justice and expediency or slavery considered with a view to its rightful and effectual remedy abolition there is a law above all the enactments of human codes the same throughout the world the same in all time such as it was before the daring genius of columbus pierced the night of ages and opened to one world the sources of wealth and power and knowledge to another all unutterable woes such as it is at this day it is the law written by the finger of god upon the heart of man and by that law unchangeable and eternal while men despise fraud and loathe rapine and abhor blood they shall reject with indignation the wild and guilty fantasy that man can hold property in man lord brougham it may be inquired of me why i seek to agitate the subject of slavery in new england where we all acknowledge it to be an evil because such an acknowledgment is not enough on our part it is doing no more than the slavemaster and the slavetrader we have found says james monroe in his speech on the subject before the virginia convention that this evil has preyed upon the very vitals of the union and has been prejudicial to all the states in which it has existed all the states in their several constitutions and declarations of rights have made a similar statement and what has been the consequence of this general belief in the evil of human servitude has it sapped the foundations of the infamous system no has it decreased the number of its victims quite the contrary unaccompanied by philanthropic action it has been in a moral point of view worthless a thing without vitality sightless soulless dead but it may be said that the miserable victims of the system have our sympathies sympathy the sympathy of the priest and the levite looking on and acknowledging but holding itself aloof from mortal suffering can such hollow sympathy reach the broken of heart and does the blessing of those who are ready to perish answer it does it hold back the lash from the slave or sweeten his bitter bread ones heart and soul are becoming weary of this sympathy this heartless mockery of feeling sick of the common cant of hypocrisy wreathing the artificial flowers of sentiment over unutterable pollution and unimaginable wrong it is whitewashing the sepulchre to make us forget its horrible deposit it is scattering flowers around the charnelhouse and over the yet festering grave to turn away our thoughts from the dead mens bones and all uncleanness the pollution and loathsomeness below no let the truth on this subject undisguised naked terrible as it is stand out before us let us no longer seek to cover it let us no longer strive to forget it let us no more dare to palliate it it is better to meet it here with repentance than at the bar of god the cry of the oppressed of the millions who have perished among us as the brute perisheth shut out from the glad tidings of salvation has gone there before us to him who as a father pitieth all his children their blood is upon us as a nation woe unto us if we repent not as a nation in dust and ashes woe unto us if we say in our hearts the lord shall not see neither shall the god of jacob regard it he that planted the ear shall he not hear he who formed the eye shall he not see but it may be urged that new england has no participation in slavery and is not responsible for its wickedness why are we thus willing to believe a lie new england not responsible bound by the united states constitution to protect the slaveholder in his sins and yet not responsible joining hands with crime covenanting with oppression leaguing with pollution and yet not responsible palliating the evil hiding the evil voting for the evil do we not participate in it messrs harvey of new hampshire mallary of vermont and ripley of maine voted in the congress of against the consideration of a resolution for inquiring into the expediency of abolishing slavery in the district of columbia members of one confederacy children of one family the curse and the shame the sin against our brother and the sin against our god all the iniquity of slavery which is revealed to man and all which crieth in the ear or is manifested to the eye of jehovah will assuredly be visited upon all our people why then should we stretch out our hands towards our southern brethren and like the pharisee thank god we are not like them for so long as we practically recognize the infernal principle that man can hold property in man god will not hold us guiltless so long as we take counsel of the worlds policy instead of the justice of heaven so long as we follow a mistaken political expediency in opposition to the express commands of god so long will the wrongs of the slaves rise like a cloud of witnesses against us at the inevitable bar slavery is protected by the constitutional compact by the standing army by the militia of the free states j q adams is the only member of congress who has ventured to speak plainly of this protection see also his very able report from the minority of the committee on manufactures in his speech during the last session upon the bill of the committee of ways and means after discussing the constitutional protection of slavery he says but that same interest is further protected by the laws of the united states it was protected by the existence of a standing army if the states of this union were all free republican states and none of them possessed any of the machinery of which he had spoken and if another portion of the union were not exposed to another danger from their vicinity to the tribes of indian savages he believed it would be difficult to prove to the house any such thing as the necessity of a standing army what in fact was the occupation of the army it had been protecting this very same interest it had been doing so ever since the army existed of what use to the district of plymouth which he there represented was the standing army of the united states of not one dollars use and never had been let us not forget that should the slaves goaded by wrongs unendurable rise in desperation and pour the torrent of their brutal revenge over the beautiful carolinas or the consecrated soil of virginia new england would be called upon to arrest the progress of rebellion to tread out with the armed heel of her soldiery that spirit of freedom which knows no distinction of cast or color which has been kindled in the heart of the black as well as in that of the white and what is this system which we are thus protecting and upholding a system which holds two millions of gods creatures in bondage which leaves one million females without any protection save their own feeble strength and which makes even the exercise of that strength in resistance to outrage punishable with death which considers rational immortal beings as articles of traffic vendible commodities merchantable property which recognizes no social obligations no natural relations which tears without scruple the infant from the mother the wife from the husband the parent from the child in the strong but just language of another it is the full measure of pure unmixed unsophisticated wickedness and scorning all competition or comparison it stands without a rival in the secure undisputed possession of its detestable preeminence so fearful an evil should have its remedies the following are among the many which have been from time to time proposed placing the slaves in the condition of the serfs of poland and russia fixed to the soil and without the right on the part of the master to sell or remove them this was intended as a preliminary to complete emancipation at some remote period but it is impossible to perceive either its justice or expediency gradual abolition an indefinite term but which is understood to imply the draining away drop by drop of the great ocean of wrong plucking off at long intervals some straggling branches of the moral upas holding out to unborn generations the shadow of a hope which the present may never feel gradually ceasing to do evil gradually refraining from robbery lust and murder in brief obeying a shortsighted and criminal policy rather than the commands of god abstinence on the part of the people of the free states from the use of the known products of slave labor in order to render that labor profitless beyond a doubt the example of conscientious individuals may have a salutary effect upon the minds of some of the slaveholders i but so long as our confederacy exists a commercial intercourse with slave states and a consumption of their products cannot be avoided the following is a recorded statement of the venerated sir william jones let sugar be as cheap as it may it is better to eat none better to eat aloes and colloquintida than violate a primary law impressed on every heart not imbruted with avarice than rob one human creature of those eternal rights of which no law on earth can justly deprive him colonization the exclusive object of the american colonization society according to the second article of its constitution is to colonize the free people of color residing among us in africa or such other place as congress may direct steadily adhering to this object it has nothing to do with slavery and i allude to it as a remedy only because some of its friends have in view an eventual abolition or an amelioration of the evil let facts speak the colonization society was organized in it has two hundred and eighteen auxiliary societies the legislatures of fourteen states have recommended it contributions have poured into its treasury from every quarter of the united states addresses in its favor have been heard from all our pulpits it has been in operation sixteen years during this period nearly one million human beings have died in slavery and the number of slaves has increased more than half a million or in round numbers the colonization society has been busily engaged all this while in conveying the slaves to africa in other words abolishing slavery in this very charitable occupation it has carried away of manumitted slaves balance against the society but enough of its abolition tendency what has it done for amelioration witness the newly enacted laws of some of the slave states laws bloody as the code of draco violating the laws of cod and the unalienable rights of his children it will be seen that the society approves of these laws but why talk of amelioration amelioration of what of sin of crime unutterable of a system of wrong and outrage horrible in the eye of god why seek to mark the line of a selfish policy a carnal expediency between the criminality of hell and that repentance and its fruits enjoined of heaven for the principles and views of the society we must look to its own statements and admissions to its annual reports to those of its auxiliaries to the speeches and writings of its advocates and to its organ the african repository it excuses slavery and apologizes for slaveholders proof slavery is an evil entailed upon the present generation of slaveholders which they must suffer whether they will or not the existence of slavery among us though not at all to be objected to our southern brethren as a fault etc it the society condemns no man because he is a slaveholder recognizing the constitutional and legitimate existence of slavery it seeks not to interfere either directly or indirectly with the rights it creates acknowledging the necessity by which its present continuance and the rigorous provisions for its maintenance are justified etc they the abolitionists confound the misfortunes of one generation with the crimes of another and would sacrifice both individual and public good to an unsubstantial theory of the rights of man it pledges itself not to oppose the system of slavery proof our society and the friends of colonization wish to be distinctly understood upon this point from the beginning they have disavowed and they do yet disavow that their object is the emancipation of slaves speech of james s green esq first annual report of the new jersey colonization society this institution proposes to do good by a single specific course of measures its direct and specific purpose is not the abolition of slavery or the relief of pauperism or the extension of commerce and civilization or the enlargement of science or the conversion of the heathen the single object which its constitution prescribes and to which all its efforts are necessarily directed is african colonization from america it proposes only to afford facilities for the voluntary emigration of free people of color from this country to the country of their fathers it is no abolition society it addresses as yet arguments to no master and disavows with horror the idea of offering temptations to any slave it denies the design of attempting emancipation either partial or general the colonization society as such have renounced wholly the name and the characteristics of abolitionists on this point they have been unjustly and injuriously slandered into their accounts the subject of emancipation does not enter at all from its origin and throughout the whole period of its existence it has constantly disclaimed all intention of interfering in the smallest degree with the rights of property or the object of emancipation gradual or immediate the society presents to the american public no project of emancipation mr clays speech idem vol vi pp the emancipation of slaves or the amelioration of their condition with the moral intellectual and political improvement of people of color within the united states are subjects foreign to the powers of this society the society as a society recognizes no principles in reference to the slave system it says nothing and proposes to do nothing respecting it so far as we can ascertain the supporters of the colonization policy generally believe that slavery is in this country a constitptional and legitimate system which they have no inclination interest nor ability to disturb it regards gods rational creatures as property proof we hold their slaves as we hold their other property sacred it is equally plain and undeniable that the society in the prosecution of this work has never interfered or evinced even a disposition to interfere in any way with the rights of proprietors of slaves to the slaveholder who has charged upon them the wicked design of interfering with the rights of property under the specious pretext of removing a vicious and dangerous free population they address themselves in a tone of conciliation and sympathy we know your rights say they and we respect them it boasts that its measures are calculated to perpetuate the detested system of slavery to remove the fears of the slaveholder and increase the value of his stock of human beings proof they the southern slaveholders will contribute more effectually to the continuance and strength of this system slavery by removing those now free than by any or all other methods which can possibly be devised so far from being connected with the abolition of slavery the measure proposed would be one of the greatest securities to enable the master to keep in possession his own property speech of john randolph at the first meeting of the colonization society the tendency of the scheme and one of its objects is to secure slaveholders and the whole southern country against certain evil consequences growing out of the present threefold mixture of our population there was but one way to avert danger but that might be made effectual fortunately it was to provide and keep open a drain for the excess beyond the occasions of profitable employment mr archer had been stating the case in the supposition that after the present class of free blacks had been exhausted by the operation of the plan he was recommending others would be supplied for its action in the proportion of the excess of colored population it would be necessary to throw off by the process of voluntary manumission or sale this effect must result inevitably from the depreciating value of the slaves ensuing their disproportionate multiplication the depreciation would be relieved and retarded at the same time by the process the two operations would aid reciprocally and sustain each other and both be in the highest degree beneficial it was on the ground of interest therefore the most indisputable pecuniary interest that he addressed himself to the people and legislatures of the slaveholding states the slaveholder who is in danger of having his slaves contaminated by their free friends of color will not only be relieved from this danger but the value of his slave will be enhanced it denies the power of christian love to overcome an unholy prejudice against a portion of our fellowcreatures proof the managers consider it clear that causes exist and are operating to prevent their the blacks improvement and elevation to any considerable extent as a class in this country which are fixed not only beyond the control of the friends of humanity but of any human power christianity will not do for them here what it will do for them in africa this is not the fault of the colored man nor christianity but an ordination of providence and no more to be changed than the laws of nature last annual report of the american colonization society the habits the feelings all the prejudices of society prejudices which neither refinement nor argument nor education nor religion itself can subdue mark the people of color whether bond or free as the subjects of a degradation inevitable and incurable the african in this country belongs by birth to the very lowest station in society and from that station he can never rise be his talents his enterprise his virtues what they may they constitute a class by themselves a class out of which no individual can be elevated and below which none can be depressed is it not wise then for the free people of color and their friends to admit what cannot reasonably be doubted that the people of color must in this country remain for ages probably forever a separate and inferior caste weighed down by causes powerful universal inevitable which neither legislation nor christianity can remove it opposes strenuously the education of the blacks in this country as useless as well as dangerous proof if the free colored people were generally taught to read it might be an inducement to them to remain in this country that is in their native country we would offer then no such inducement southern religious telegraph february the public safety of our brethren at the south requires them the slaves to be kept ignorant and uninstructed it is the business of the free their safety requires it to keep the slaves in ignorance but a few days ago a proposition was made in the legislature of georgia to allow them so much instruction as to enable them to read the bible which was promptly rejected by a large majority proceedings of new york state colonization society at its second anniversary e b caldwell the first secretary of the american colonization society in his speech at its formation recommended them to be kept in the lowest state of ignorance and degradation for says he the nearer you bring them to the condition of brutes the better chance do you give them of possessing their apathy my limits will not admit of a more extended examination to the documents from whence the above extracts have been made i would call the attention of every real friend of humanity i seek to do the colonization society no injustice but i wish the public generally to understand its character the tendency of the society to abolish the slavetrade by means of its african colony has been strenuously urged by its friends but the fallacy of this is now admitted by all witness the following from the reports of the society itself some appalling facts in regard to the slavetrade have come to the knowledge of the board of managers during the last year with undiminished atrocity and activity is this odious traffic now carried on all along the african coast slave factories are established in the immediate vicinity of the colony and at the gallinas between liberia and sierra leone not less than nine hundred slaves were shipped during the last summer in the space of three weeks april the house of commons of england ordered the printing of a document entitled slavetrade sierra leone containing official evidence of the fact that the pirates engaged in the african slavetrade are supplied from the stores of sierra leone and liberia with such articles as the infernal traffic demands an able english writer on the subject of colonization thus notices this astounding fact and here it may be well to observe that as long as negro slavery lasts all colonies on the african coast of whatever description must tend to support it because in all commerce the supply is more or less proportioned to the demand the demand exists in negro slavery the supply arises from the african slavetrade and what greater convenience could the african slavetraders desire than shops well stored along the coast with the very articles which their trade demands that the african slavetraders do get thus supplied at sierra leone and liberia is matter of official evidence and we know from the nature of human things that they will get so supplied in defiance of all law or precaution as long as the demand calls for the supply and there are free shops stored with all they want at hand the shopkeeper however honest would find it impossible always to distinguish between the african slavetrader or his agents and other dealers and how many shopkeepers are there anywhere that would be over scrupulous in questioning a customer with a full purse but we are told that the colonization society is to civilize and evangelize africa each emigrant says henry clay the ablest advocate which the society has yet found is a missionary carrying with him credentials in the holy cause of civilization religion and free institutions beautiful and heartcheering idea but stay who are these emigrants these missionaries the free people of color they and they only says the african repository the societys organ are qualified for colonizing africa what are their qualifications let the society answer in its own words free blacks are a greater nuisance than even slaves themselves african repository vol ii p a horde of miserable people the objects of universal suspicion subsisting by plunder an anomalous race of beings the most debased upon earth african repository vol vii p of all classes of our population the most vicious is that of the free colored tenth annual report of the colonization society i might go on to quote still further from the credentials which the free people of color are to carry with them to liberia but i forbear i come now to the only practicable the only just scheme of emancipation immediate abolition of slavery an immediate acknowledgment of the great truth that man cannot hold property in man an immediate surrender of baneful prejudice to christian love an immediate practical obedience to the command of jesus christ whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you do ye even so to them a correct understanding of what is meant by immediate abolition must convince every candid mind that it is neither visionary nor dangerous that it involves no disastrous consequences of bloodshed and desolation but on the contrary that it is a safe practicable efficient remedy for the evils of the slave system the term immediate is used in contrast with that of gradual earnestly as i wish it i do not expect no one expects that the tremendous system of oppression can be instantaneously overthrown the terrible and unrebukable indignation of a free people has not yet been sufficiently concentrated against it the friends of abolition have not forgotten the peculiar organization of our confederacy the delicate division of power between the states and the general government they see the many obstacles in their pathway but they know that public opinion can overcome them all they ask no aid of physical coercion they seek to obtain their object not with the weapons of violence and blood but with those of reason and truth prayer to god and entreaty to man they seek to impress indelibly upon every human heart the true doctrines of the rights of man to establish now and forever this great and fundamental truth of human liberty that man cannot hold property in his brother for they believe that the general admission of this truth will utterly destroy the system of slavery based as that system is upon a denial or disregard of it to make use of the clear exposition of an eminent advocate of immediate abolition our plan of emancipation is simply this to promulgate the true doctrine of human rights in high places and low places and all places where there are human beings to whisper it in chimney corners and to proclaim it from the housetops yea from the mountaintops to pour it out like water from the pulpit and the press to raise it up with all the food of the inner man from infancy to gray hairs to give line upon line and precept upon precept till it forms one of the foundation principles and parts indestructible of the public soul let those who contemn this plan renounce if they have not done it already the gospel plan of converting the world let them renounce every plan of moral reformation and every plan whatsoever which does not terminate in the gratification of their own animal natures the friends of emancipation would urge in the first instance an immediate abolition of slavery in the district of columbia and in the territories of florida and arkansas the number of slaves in these portions of the country coming under the direct jurisdiction of the general government is as follows district of columbia territory of arkansas territory of florida total here then are twentysix thousand human beings fashioned in the image of god the fitted temples of his holy spirit held by the government in the abhorrent chains of slavery the power to emancipate them is clear it is indisputable it does not depend upon the twentyfive slave votes in congress it lies with the free states their duty is before them in the fear of god and not of man let them perform it let them at once strike off the grievous fetters let them declare that man shall no longer hold his fellowman in bondage a beast of burden an article of traffic within the governmental domain god and truth and eternal justice demand this the very reputation of our fathers the honor of our land every principle of liberty humanity expediency demand it a sacred regard to free principles originated our independence not the paltry amount of practical evil complained of and although our fathers left their great work unfinished it is our duty to follow out their principles short of liberty and equality we cannot stop without doing injustice to their memories if our fathers intended that slavery should be perpetual that our practice should forever give the lie to our professions why is the great constitutional compact so guardedly silent on the subject of human servitude if state necessity demanded this perpetual violation of the laws of god and the rights of man this continual solecism in a government of freedom why is it not met as a necessity incurable and inevitable and formally and distinctly recognized as a settled part of our social system state necessity that imperial tyrant seeks no disguise in the language of sheridan what he does he dares avow and avowing scorns any other justification than the great motives which placed the iron sceptre in his grasp can it be possible that our fathers felt this state necessity strong upon them no for they left open the door for emancipation they left us the light of their pure principles of liberty they framed the great charter of american rights without employing a term in its structure to which in aftertimes of universal freedom the enemies of our country could point with accusation or reproach what then is our duty to give effect to the spirit of our constitution to plant ourselves upon the great declaration and declare in the face of all the world that political religious and legal hypocrisy shall no longer cover as with loathsome leprosy the features of american freedom to loose at once the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and let the oppressed go free we have indeed been authoritatively told in congress and elsewhere that our brethren of the south and west will brook no further agitation of the subject of slavery what then shall we heed the unrighteous prohibition no by our duty as christians as politicians by our duty to ourselves to our neighbor and to god we are called upon to agitate this subject to give slavery no restingplace under the hallowed aegis of a government of freedom to tear it root and branch with all its fruits of abomination at least from the soil of the national domain the slaveholder may mock us the representatives of property merchandise vendible commodities may threaten us still our duty is imperative the spirit of the constitution should be maintained within the exclusive jurisdiction of the government if we cannot provide for the general welfare if we cannot guarantee to each of the states a republican form of government let us at least no longer legislate for a free nation within view of the falling whip and within hearing of the execrations of the taskmaster and the prayer of his slave i deny the right of the slaveholder to impose silence on his brother of the north in reference to slavery what compelled to maintain the system to keep up the standing army which protects it and yet be denied the poor privilege of remonstrance ready at the summons of the master to put down the insurrections of his slaves the outbreaking of that revenge which is now and has been in all nations and all times the inevitable consequence of oppression and wrong and yet like automata to act but not speak are we to be denied even the right of a slave the right to murmur i am not unaware that my remarks may be regarded by many as dangerous and exceptionable that i may be regarded as a fanatic for quoting the language of eternal truth and denounced as an incendiary for maintaining in the spirit as well as the letter the doctrines of american independence but if such are the consequences of a simple performance of duty i shall not regard them if my feeble appeal but reaches the hearts of any who are now slumbering in iniquity if it shall have power given it to shake down one stone from that foul temple where the blood of human victims is offered to the moloch of slavery if under providence it can break one fetter from off the image of god and enable one suffering african to feel the weight of human misery less and glide ungroaning to the tomb i shall not have written in vain my conscience will be satisfied far be it from me to cast new bitterness into the gall and wormwood waters of sectional prejudice no i desire peace the peace of universal love of catholic sympathy the peace of a common interest a common feeling a common humanity but so long as slavery is tolerated no such peace can exist liberty and slavery cannot dwell in harmony together there will be a perpetual war in the members of the political mezentius between the living and the dead god and man have placed between them an everlasting barrier an eternal separation no matter under what name or law or compact their union is attempted the ordination of providence has forbidden it and it cannot stand peace there can be no peace between justice and oppression between robbery and righteousness truth and falsehood freedom and slavery the slaveholding states are not free the name of liberty is there but the spirit is wanting they do not partake of its invaluable blessings wherever slavery exists to any considerable extent with the exception of some recently settled portions of the country and which have not yet felt in a great degree the baneful and deteriorating influences of slave labor we hear at this moment the cry of suffering we are told of grassgrown streets of crumbling mansions of beggared planters and barren plantations of fear from without of terror within the once fertile fields are wasted and tenantless for the curse of slavery the improvidence of that labor whose hire has been kept back by fraud has been there poisoning the very earth beyond the reviving influence of the early and the latter rain a moral mildew mingles with and blasts the economy of nature it is as if the finger of the everlasting god had written upon the soil of the slaveholder the language of his displeasure let then the slaveholding states consult their present interest by beginning without delay the work of emancipation if they fear not and mock at the fiery indignation of him to whom vengeance belongeth let temporal interest persuade them they know they must know that the present state of things cannot long continue mind is the same everywhere no matter what may be the complexion of the frame which it animates there is a love of liberty which the scourge cannot eradicate a hatred of oppression which centuries of degradation cannot extinguish the slave will become conscious sooner or later of his brute strength his physical superiority and will exert it his torch will be at the threshold and his knife at the throat of the planter horrible and indiscriminate will be his vengeance where then will be the pride the beauty and the chivalry of the south the smoke of her torment will rise upward like a thick cloud visible over the whole earth belie the negros powers in headlong will christian thy brother thou shalt find him still belie his virtues since his wrongs began his follies and his crimes have stamped him man let the cause of insurrection be removed then as speedily as possible cease to oppress let him that stole steal no more let the laborer have his hire bind him no longer by the cords of slavery but with those of kindness and brotherly love watch over him for his good pray for him instruct him pour light into the darkness of his mind let this be done and the horrible fears which now haunt the slumbers of the slaveholder will depart conscience will take down its racks and gibbets and his soul will be at peace his lands will no longer disappoint his hopes free labor will renovate them historical facts the nature of the human mind the demonstrated truths of political economy the analysis of cause and effect all concur in establishing that immediate abolition is a safe and just and peaceful remedy for the evils of the slave system that free labor its necessary consequence is more productive and more advantageous to the planter than slave labor in proof of the first proposition it is only necessary to state the undeniable fact that immediate emancipation whether by an individual or a community has in no instance been attended with violence and disorder on the part of the emancipated but that on the contrary it has promoted cheerfulness industry and laudable ambition in the place of sullen discontent indolence and despair the case of st domingo is in point blood was indeed shed on that island like water but it was not in consequence of emancipation it was shed in the civil war which preceded it and in the iniquitous attempt to restore the slave system in it flowed on the sanguine altar of slavery not on the pure and peaceful one of emancipation no there as in all the world and in all time the violence of oppression engendered violence on the part of the oppressed and vengeance followed only upon the iron footsteps of wrong when where did justice to the injured waken their hate and vengeance when where did love and kindness and sympathy irritate and madden the persecuted the brokenhearted the foully wronged in september the commissioner of the french national convention issued his proclamation giving immediate freedom to all the slaves of st domingo did the slaves baptize their freedom in blood did they fight like unchained desperadoes because they had been made free did they murder their emancipators no they acted as human beings must act under similar circumstances by a law as irresistible as those of the universe kindness disarmed them justice conciliated them freedom ennobled them no tumult followed this wide and instantaneous emancipation it cost not one drop of blood it abated not one tittle of the wealth or the industry of the island colonel malenfant a slave proprietor residing at the time on the island states that after the public act of abolition the negroes remained perfectly quiet they had obtained all they asked for liberty and they continued to work upon all the plantations malenfant in memoirs for a history of st domingo by general lecroix there were estates he says which had neither owners nor managers resident upon them yet upon these estates though abandoned the negroes continued their labors where there were any even inferior agents to guide them and on those estates where no white men were left to direct them they betook themselves to the planting of provisions but upon all the plantations where the whites resided the blacks continued to labor as quietly as before colonel malenfant says that when many of his neighbors proprietors or managers were in prison the negroes of their plantations came to him to beg him to direct them in their work if you will take care not to talk to them of the restoration of slavery but talk to them of freedom you may with this word chain them down to their labor how did toussaint succeed how did i succeed before his time in the plain of the culdesac on the plantation of gouraud during more than eight months after liberty had been granted to the slaves let those who knew me at that time let the blacks themselves be asked they will all reply that not a single negro upon that plantation consisting of more than four hundred and fifty laborers refused to work and yet this plantation was thought to be under the worst discipline and the slaves the most idle of any in the plain i inspired the same activity into three other plantations of which i had the management if all the negroes had come from africa within six months if they had the love of independence that the indians have i should own that force must be employed but ninetynine out of a hundred of the blacks are aware that without labor they cannot procure the things that are necessary for them that there is no other method of satisfying their wants and their tastes they know that they must work they wish to do so and they will do so this is strong testimony in three years after the act of emancipation we are told that the colony was flourishing under toussaint that the whites lived happily and peaceably on their estates and the blacks continued to work for them up to the same happy state of things continued the colony went on as by enchantment cultivation made day by day a perceptible progress under the recuperative energies of free labor in general vincent a proprietor of estates in the island was sent by toussaint to paris for the purpose of laying before the directory the new constitution which had been adopted at st domingo he reached france just after the peace of amiens when napoleon was fitting out his illstarred armament for the insane purpose of restoring slavery in the island general vincent remonstrated solemnly and earnestly against an expedition so preposterous so cruel and unnecessary undertaken at a moment when all was peace and quietness in the colony when the proprietors were in peaceful possession of their estates when cultivation was making a rapid progress and the blacks were industrious and happy beyond example he begged that this beautiful state of things might not be reversed the remonstrance was not regarded and the expedition proceeded its issue is well known threatened once more with the horrors of slavery the peaceful and quiet laborer became transformed into a demon of ferocity the ploughshare and the pruninghook gave way to the pike and the dagger the white invaders were driven back by the sword and the pestilence and then and not till then was the property of the planters seized upon by the excited and infuriated blacks in dessalines was proclaimed emperor of hayti the black troops were in a great measure disbanded and they immediately returned to the cultivation of the plantations from that period up to the present there has been no want of industry among the inhabitants mr harvey who during the reign of christophe resided at cape francois in describing the character and condition of the inhabitants says it was an interesting sight to behold this class of the haytiens now in possession of their freedom coming in groups to the market nearest which they resided bringing the produce of their industry there for sale and afterwards returning carrying back the necessary articles of living which the disposal of their commodities had enabled them to purchase all evidently cheerful and happy nor could it fail to occur to the mind that their present condition furnished the most satisfactory answer to that objection to the general emancipation of slaves founded on their alleged unfitness to value and improve the benefits of liberty as they would not suffer so they do not require the attendance of one acting in the capacity of a driver with the instrument of punishment in his hand as far as i had an opportunity of ascertaining from what fell under my own observation and from what i gathered from other european residents i am persuaded of one general fact which on account of its importance i shall state in the most explicit terms namely that the haytiens employed in cultivating the plantations as well as the rest of the population perform as much work in a given time as they were accustomed to do during their subjection to the french and if we may judge of their future improvement by the change which has been already effected it may be reasonably anticipated that hayti will erelong contain a population not inferior in their industry to that of any civilized nation in the world every man had some calling to occupy his attention instances of idleness or intemperance were of rare occurrence the most perfect subordination prevailed and all appeared contented and happy a foreigner would have found it difficult to persuade himself on his first entering the place that the people he now beheld so submissive industrious and contented were the same people who a few years before had escaped from the shackles of slavery the present condition of hayti may be judged of from the following wellauthenticated facts its population is more than its resources ample its prosperity and happiness general its crimes few its labor crowned with abundance with no paupers save the decrepit and aged its people hospitable respectful orderly and contented the manumitted slaves who to the number of two thousand were settled in nova scotia by the british government at the close of the revolutionary war led a harmless life and gained the character of an honest industrious people from their white neighbors of the free laborers of trinidad we have the same report at the cape of good hope three thousand negroes received their freedom and with scarce a single exception betook themselves to laborious employments but we have yet stronger evidence the total abolishment of slavery in the southern republics has proved beyond dispute the safety and utility of immediate abolition the departed bolivar indeed deserves his glorious title of liberator for he began his career of freedom by striking off the fetters of his own slaves seven hundred in number in an official letter from the mexican envoy of the british government dated mexico march and addressed to the right hon george canning the superiority of free over slave labor is clearly demonstrated by the following facts it is now carried on exclusively by the labor of free blacks it was formerly wholly sustained by the forced labor of slaves purchased at vera cruz at to each abolition in this section was effected not by governmental interference not even from motives of humanity but from an irresistible conviction on the part of the planters that their pecuniary interest demanded it the result has proved the entire correctness of this conviction and the planters would now be as unwilling as the blacks themselves to return to the old system let our southern brethren imitate this example it is in vain in the face of facts like these to talk of the necessity of maintaining the abominable system operating as it does like a double curse upon planters and slaves heaven and earth deny its necessity it is as necessary as other robberies and no more yes putting aside altogether the righteous law of the living god the same yesterday today and forever and shutting out the clearest political truths ever taught by man still in human policy selfish expediency would demand of the planter the immediate emancipation of his slaves because slave labor is the labor of mere machines a mechanical impulse of body and limb with which the mind of the laborer has no sympathy and from which it constantly and loathingly revolts because slave labor deprives the master altogether of the incalculable benefit of the negros will that does not cooperate with the forced toil of the body this is but the necessary consequence of all labor which does not benefit the laborer it is a just remark of that profound political economist adam smith that a slave can have no other interest than to eat and waste as much and work as little as he can to my mind in the wasteful and blighting influences of slave labor there is a solemn and warning moral they seem the evidence of the displeasure of him who created man after his own image at the unnatural attempt to govern the bones and sinews the bodies and souls of one portion of his children by the caprice the avarice the lusts of another at that utter violation of the design of his merciful providence whereby the entire dependence of millions of his rational creatures is made to centre upon the will the existence the ability of their fellowmortals instead of resting under the shadow of his own infinite power and exceeding love i shall offer a few more facts and observations on this point a distinguished scientific gentleman mr coulomb the superintendent of several military works in the french west indies gives it as his opinion that the slaves do not perform more than one third of the labor which they would do provided they were urged by their own interests and inclinations instead of brute force a plantation in barbadoes in was cultivated by two hundred and eightyeight slaves ninety men eightytwo women fiftysix boys and sixty girls in three years and three months there were on this plantation fiftyseven deaths and only fifteen births a change was then made in the government of the slaves the use of the whip was denied all severe and arbitrary punishments were abolished the laborers received wages and their offences were all tried by a sort of negro court established among themselves in short they were practically free under this system in four years and three months there were fortyfour births and but fortyone deaths and the annual net produce of the plantation was more than three times what it had been before english quarterly magazine and review april the following evidence was adduced by pitt in the british parliament april the assembly of grenada had themselves stated that though the negroes were allowed only the afternoon of one day in a week they would do as much work in that afternoon when employed for their own benefit as in the whole day when employed in their masters service now after this confession said mr pitt the house might burn all its calculations relative to the negro population a negro if he worked for himself could no doubt do double work by an improvement then in the mode of labor the work in the islands could be doubled in coffee districts it is usual for the master to hire his people after they have done the regular task for the day at a rate varying from d to d for every extra bushel which they pluck from the trees and many almost all are found eager to earn their wages in a report made by the commandant of castries for the government of st lucia in it is stated in proof of the intimacy between the slaves and the free blacks that many small plantations of the latter and occupied by only one man and his wife are better cultivated and have more land in cultivation than those of the proprietors of many slaves and that the labor on them is performed by runaway slaves thus clearly proving that even runaway slaves under the alldepressing fears of discovery and oppression labor well because the fruits of their labor are immediately their own let us look at this subject from another point of view the large sum of money necessary for stocking a plantation with slaves has an inevitable tendency to place the agriculture of a slaveholding community exclusively in the hands of the wealthy a tendency at war with practical republicanism and conflicting with the best maxims of political economy two hundred slaves at per head would cost in the outset compare this enormous outlay for the labor of a single plantation with the beautiful system of free labor as exhibited in new england where every young laborer with health and ordinary prudence may acquire by his labor on the farms of others in a few years a farm of his own and the stock necessary for its proper cultivation where on a hard and unthankful soil independence and competence may be attained by all free labor is perfectly in accordance with the spirit of our institutions slave labor is a relic of a barbarous despotic age the one like the firmament of heaven is the equal diffusion of similar lights manifest harmonious regular the other is the fiery predominance of some disastrous star hiding all lesser luminaries around it in one consuming glare emancipation would reform this evil the planter would no longer be under the necessity of a heavy expenditure for slaves he would only pay a very moderate price for his labor a price indeed far less than the cost of the maintenance of a promiscuous gang of slaves which the present system requires in an old plantation of three hundred slaves not more than one hundred effective laborers will be found children the old and superannuated the sick and decrepit the idle and incorrigibly vicious will be found to constitute two thirds of the whole number the remaining third perform only about one third as much work as the same number of free laborers now disburden the master of this heavy load of maintenance let him employ free able industrious laborers only those who feel conscious of a personal interest in the fruits of their labor and who does not see that such a system would be vastly more safe and economical than the present the slave states are learning this truth by fatal experience most of them are silently writhing under the great curse virginia has uttered her complaints aloud as yet however nothing has been done even there save a small annual appropriation for the purpose of colonizing the free colored inhabitants of the state is this a remedy but it may be said that virginia will ultimately liberate her slaves on condition of their colonization in africa peacefully if possible forcibly if necessary well admitting that virginia may be able and willing at some remote period to rid herself of the evil by commuting the punishment of her unoffending colored people from slavery to exile will her fearful remedy apply to some of the other slaveholding states it is a fact strongly insisted upon by our southern brethren as a reason for the perpetuation of slavery that their climate and peculiar agriculture will not admit of hard labor on the part of the whites that amidst the fatal malaria of the rice plantations the white man is almost annually visited by the country fever that few of the white overseers of these plantations reach the middle period of ordinary life that the owners are compelled to fly from their estates as the hot season approaches without being able to return until the first frosts have fallen but we are told that the slaves remain there at their work midleg in putrid water breathing the noisome atmosphere loaded with contagion and underneath the scorching fervor of a terrible sun that they indeed suffer but that their habits constitutions and their long practice enable them to labor surrounded by such destructive influences with comparative safety the conclusive answer therefore to those who in reality cherish the visionary hope of colonizing all the colored people of the united states in africa or elsewhere is this single allimportant fact the labor of the blacks will not and cannot be dispensed with by the planter of the south to what remedy then can the friends of humanity betake themselves but to that of emancipation and nothing but a strong unequivocal expression of public sentiment is needed to carry into effect this remedy so far as the general government is concerned and when the voice of all the nonslaveholding states shall be heard on this question a voice of expostulation rebuke entreaty when the full light of truth shall break through the night of prejudice and reveal all the foul abominations of slavery will delaware still cling to the curse which is wasting her moral strength and still rivet the fetters upon her three or four thousand slaves let delaware begin the work and maryland and virginia must follow the example will be contagious and the great object of universal emancipation will be attained freemen christians lovers of truth and justice why stand ye idle ours is a government of opinion and slavery is interwoven with it change the current of opinion and slavery will be swept away let the awful sovereignty of the people a power which is limited only by the sovereignty of heaven arise and pronounce judgment against the crying iniquity let each individual remember that upon himself rests a portion of that sovereignty a part of the tremendous responsibility of its exercise the burning withering concentration of public opinion upon the slave system is alone needed for its total annihilation god has given us the power to overthrow it a power peaceful yet mighty benevolent yet effectual awful without severity a moral strength equal to the emergency how does it happen inquires an able writer that whenever duty is named we begin to hear of the weakness of human nature that same nature which outruns the whirlwind in the chase of gain which rages like a maniac at the trumpet call of glory which laughs danger and death to scorn when its least passion is awakened becomes weak as childhood when reminded of the claims of duty but let no one hope to find an excuse in hypocrisy the humblest individual of the community in one way or another possesses influence and upon him as well as upon the proudest rests the responsibility of its rightful exercise and proper direction the overthrow of a great national evil like that of slavery can only be effected by the united energies of the great body of the people shoulder must be put to shoulder and hand linked with hand the whole mass must be put in motion and its entire strength applied until the fabric of oppression is shaken to its dark foundations and not one stone is left upon another let the christian remember that the god of his worship hateth oppression that the mystery of faith can only be held by a pure conscience and that in vain is the tithe of mint and anise and cummin if the weihtier matters of the law judgment mercy and truth are forgotten let him remember that all along the clouded region of slavery the truths of the everlasting gospel are not spoken that the ear of iniquity is lulled that those who minister between the porch and the altar dare not speak out the language of eternal justice is not this the fast which i have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free isa viii he that stealeth a man and selleth him or if he be found in his hand he shall surely be put to death exod xxi yet a little while and the voice of impartial prayer for humanity will be heard no more in the abiding place of slavery the truths of the gospel its voice of warning and exhortation will be denounced as incendiary the night of that infidelity which denies god in the abuse and degradation of man will settle over the land to be broken only by the upheaving earthquake of eternal retribution to the members of the religious society of friends i would earnestly appeal they have already done much to put away the evil of slavery in this country and great britain the blessings of many who were ready to perish have rested upon them but their faithful testimony must be still steadily upborne for the great work is but begun let them not relax their exertions nor be contented with a lifeless testimony a formal protestation against the evil active prayerful unwearied exertion is needed for its overthrow but above all let them not aid in excusing and palliating it slavery has no redeeming qualities no feature of benevolence nothing pure nothing peaceful nothing just let them carefully keep themselves aloof from all societies and all schemes which have a tendency to excuse or overlook its crying iniquity true to a doctrine founded on love and mercy peace on earth and good will to men they should regard the suffering slave as their brother and endeavor to put their souls in his souls stead they may earnestly desire the civilization of africa but they cannot aid in building up the colony of liberia so long as that colony leans for support upon the arm of military power so long as it proselytes to christianity under the muzzles of its cannon and preaches the doctrines of christ while practising those of mahomet when the sierra leone company was formed in england not a member of the society of friends could be prevailed upon to engage in it because the colony was to be supplied with cannon and other military stores yet the foreign agent of the liberia colony society to which the same insurmountable objection exists is a member of the society of friends and i understand has been recently employed in providing gunpowder etc for the use of the colony there must be an awakening on this subject other woolmans and other benezets must arise and speak the truth with the meek love of james and the fervent sincerity of paul to the women of america whose sympathies know no distinction of cline or sect or color the suffering slave is making a strong appeal oh let it not be unheeded for of those to whom much is given much will be required at the last dread tribunal and never in the strongest terms of human eulogy was womans influence overrated sisters daughters wives and mothers your influence is felt everywhere at the fireside and in the halls of legislation surrounding like the allencircling atmosphere brother and father husband and son and by your love of them by every holy sympathy of your bosoms by every mournful appeal which comes up to you from hearts whose sanctuary of affections has been made waste and desolate you are called upon to exert it in the cause of redemption from wrong and outrage let the patriot the friend of liberty and the union of the states no longer shut his eyes to the great danger the masterevil before which all others dwindle into insignificance our union is tottering to its foundation and slavery is the cause remove the evil dry up at their source the bitter waters in vain you enact and abrogate your tariffs in vain is individual sacrifice or sectional concession the accursed thing is with us the stone of stumbling and the rock of offence remains drag then the achan into light and let national repentance atone for national sin the conflicting interests of free and slave labor furnish the only ground for fear in relation to the permanency of the union the line of separation between them is day by day growing broader and deeper geographically and politically united we are already in a moral point of view a divided people but a few months ago we were on the very verge of civil war a war of brothers a war between the north and the south between the slaveholder and the free laborer the danger has been delayed for a time this bolt has fallen without mortal injury to the union but the cloud from whence it came still hangs above us reddening with the elements of destruction recent events have furnished ample proof that the slaveholding interest is prepared to resist any legislation on the part of the general government which is supposed to have a tendency directly or indirectly to encourage and invigorate free labor and that it is determined to charge upon its opposite interest the infliction of all those evils which necessarily attend its own operation the primeval curse of omnipotence upon slavery we have already felt in too many instances the extreme difficulty of cherishing in one common course of national legislation the opposite interests of republican equality and feudal aristocracy and servitude the truth is we have undertaken a moral impossibility these interests are from their nature irreconcilable the one is based upon the pure principles of rational liberty the other under the name of freedom revives the ancient european system of barons and villains nobles and serfs indeed the state of society which existed among our anglosaxon ancestors was far more tolerable than that of many portions of our republican confederacy for the anglosaxon slaves had it in their power to purchase their freedom and the laws of the realm recognized their liberation and placed them under legal protection the diffusion of christianity in great britain was moreover followed by a general manumission for it would seem that the priests and missionaries of religion in that early and benighted age were more faithful in the performance of their duties than those of the present the holy fathers monks and friars says sir t smith had in their confessions and specially in their extreme and deadly sickness convinced the laity how dangerous a thing it was for one christian to hold another in bondage so that temporal men by reason of the terror in their consciences were glad to manumit all their villains hilt commonwealth blackstone p to counteract the dangers resulting from a state of society so utterly at variance with the great declaration of american freedom should be the earnest endeavor of every patriotic statesman nothing unconstitutional nothing violent should be attempted but the true doctrine of the rights of man should be steadily kept in view and the opposition to slavery should be inflexible and constantly maintained the almost daily violations of the constitution in consequence of the laws of some of the slave states subjecting free colored citizens of new england and elsewhere who may happen to be on board of our coasting vessels to imprisonment immediately on their arrival in a southern port should be provided against nor should the imprisonment of the free colored citizens of the northern and middle states on suspicion of being runaways subjecting them even after being pronounced free to the costs of their confinement and trial be longer tolerated for if we continue to yield to innovations like these upon the constitution of our fathers we shall erelong have the name only of a free government left us dissemble as we may it is impossible for us to believe after fully considering the nature of slavery that it can much longer maintain a peaceable existence among us a day of revolution must come and it is our duty to prepare for it its threatened evil may be changed into a national blessing the establishment of schools for the instruction of the slave children a general diffusion of the lights of christianity and the introduction of a sacred respect for the social obligations of marriage and for the relations between parents and children among our black population would render emancipation not only perfectly safe but also of the highest advantage to the country two millions of freemen would be added to our population upon whom in the hour of danger we could safely depend the domestic foe would be changed into a firm friend faithful generous and ready to encounter all dangers in our defence it is well known that during the last war with great britain wherever the enemy touched upon our southern coast the slaves in multitudes hastened to join them on the other hand the free blacks were highly serviceable in repelling them so warm was the zeal of the latter so manifest their courage in the defence of louisiana that the present chief magistrate of the united states publicly bestowed upon them one of the highest eulogiums ever offered by a commander to his soldiers let no one seek an apology for silence on the subject of slavery because the laws of the land tolerate and sanction it but a short time ago the slavetrade was protected by laws and treaties and sanctioned by the example of men eminent for the reputation of piety and integrity yet public opinion broke over these barriers it lifted the curtain and revealed the horrors of that most abominable traffic and unrighteous law and ancient custom and avarice and luxury gave way before its irresistible authority it should never be forgotten that human law cannot change the nature of human action in the pure eye of infinite justice and that the ordinances of man cannot annul those of god the slave system as existing in this country can be considered in no other light than as the cause of which the foul traffic in human flesh is the legitimate consequence it is the parent the fosterer the sole supporter of the slavetrade it creates the demand for slaves and the foreign supply will always be equal to the demand of consumption it keeps the market open it offers inducements to the slavetrader which no severity of law against his traffic can overcome by our laws his trade is piracy while slavery to which alone it owes its existence is protected and cherished and those engaged in it are rewarded by an increase of political power proportioned to the increase of their stock of human beings to steal the natives of africa is a crime worthy of an ignominious death but to steal and enslave annually nearly one hundred thousand of the descendants of these stolen natives born in this country is considered altogether excusable and proper for my own part i know no difference between robbery in africa and robbery at home i could with as quiet a conscience engage in the one as the other there is not one general principle justly remarks lord nugent on which the slavetrade is to be stigmatized which does not impeach slavery itself kindred in iniquity both must fall speedily fall together and be consigned to the same dishonorable grave the spirit which is thrilling through every nerve of england is awakening america from her sleep of death who among our statesmen would not shrink from the baneful reputation of having supported by his legislative influence the slavetrade the traffic in human flesh let them then beware for the time is near at hand when the present defenders of slavery will sink under the same fatal reputation and leave to posterity a memory which will blacken through all future time a legacy of infamy let us not betake us to the common arts and stratagems of nations but fear god and put away the evil which provokes him and trust not in man but in the living god and it shall go well for england this counsel given by the purehearted william penn in a former age is about to be followed in the present an intense and powerful feeling is working in the mighty heart of england it is speaking through the lips of brougham and buxton and oconnell and demanding justice in the name of humanity and according to the righteous law of god the immediate emancipation of eight hundred thousand slaves is demanded with an authority which cannot much longer be disputed or trifled with that demand will be obeyed justice will be done the heavy burdens will be unloosed the oppressed set free it shall go well for england and when the stain on our own escutcheon shall be seen no more when the declaration of our independence and the practice of our people shall agree when truth shall be exalted among us when love shall take the place of wrong when all the baneful pride and prejudice of caste and color shall fall forever when under one common sun of political liberty the slaveholding portions of our republic shall no longer sit like the egyptians of old themselves mantled in thick darkness while all around them is glowing with the blessed light of freedom and equality then and not till then shall it go well for america the abolitionists their sentiments and objects two letters to the jeffersonian and times richmond va i a friend has banded me a late number of your paper containing a brief notice of a pamphlet which i have recently published on the subject of slavery from an occasional perusal of your paper i have formed a favorable opinion of your talent and independence compelled to dissent from some of your political sentiments i still give you full credit for the lofty tone of sincerity and manliness with which these sentiments are avowed and defended i perceive that since the adjustment of the tariff question a new subject of discontent and agitation seems to engross your attention the accursed tariff has no sooner ceased to be the stone of stumbling and the rock of offence than the abolition doctrines of the northern enthusiasts as you are pleased to term the doctrines of your own jefferson furnish in your opinion a sufficient reason for poising the ancient dominion on its sovereignty and rousing every slaveowner to military preparations until the entire south from the potomac to the gulf shall bristle with bayonets like quills upon the fretful porcupine in proof of a conspiracy against your vested rights you have commenced publishing copious extracts from the pamphlets and periodicals of the abolitionists of new england and new york an extract from my own pamphlet you have headed the fanatics and in introducing it to your readers you inform them that it exhibits in strong colors the morbid spirit of that false and fanatical philanthropy which is at work in the northern states and to some extent in the south gentlemen so far as i am personally concerned in the matter i feel no disposition to take exceptions to any epithets which you may see fit to apply to me or my writings a humble son of new england a tiller of her rugged soil and a companion of her unostentatious yeomanry it matters little in any personal consideration of the subject whether the voice of praise or opprobrium reaches me from beyond the narrow limits of my immediate neighborhood but when i find my opinions quoted as the sentiment of new england and then denounced as dangerous false and fanatical and especially when i see them made the occasion of earnest appeals to the prejudices and sectional jealousies of the south it becomes me to endeavor to establish their truths and defend them from illegitimate influences and unjust suspicions in the first place then let me say that if it be criminal to publicly express a belief that it is in the power of the slave states to emancipate their slaves with profit and safety to themselves and that such is their immediate duty a majority of the people of new england are wholly guiltless of course all are nominally opposed to slavery but upon the little band of abolitionists should the anathemas of the slaveholder be directed for they are the agitators of whom you complain men who are acting under a solemn conviction of duty and who are bending every energy of their minds to the accomplishment of their object and that object is the overthrow of slavery in the united states by such means only as are sanctioned by law humanity and religion i shall endeavor gentlemen as briefly as may be to give you some of our reasons for opposing slavery and seeking its abolition and secondly to explain our mode of operation to disclose our plan of emancipation fully and entirely we wish to do nothing darkly frank republicans we acknowledge no doubledealing at this busy season of the year i cannot but regret that i have not leisure for such a deliberate examination of the subject as even my poor ability might warrant my remarks penned in the intervals of labor must necessarily be brief and wanting in coherence we seek the abolishment of slavery because it is contrary to the law of god in your paper of the d of th mo the same in which you denounce the false and fanatical philanthropy of abolitionists you avow yourselves members of the bible society and bestow warm and deserved encomiums on the truly pious undertaking of sending the truth among all nations you therefore gentlemen whatever others may do will not accuse me of fanaticism if i endeavor to sustain my first great reason for opposing slavery by a reference to the volume of inspiration therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you take heed and do it for there is no iniquity with the lord nor respect of persons is not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke if a man be found stealing any of his brethren and maketh merchandise of him or selling him that thief shall die of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons and he that stealeth a man and selleth him or if he be found in his hands he shall surely be put to death because it is an open violation of all human equality of the laws of nature and of nations the fundamental principle of all equal and just law is contained in the following extract from blackstones commentaries introduction sec the rights which god and nature have established and which are therefore called natural rights such as life and liberty need not the aid of human laws to be more effectually vested in every man than they are neither do they receive any additional strength when declared by municipal laws to be inviolable on the contrary no human legislation has power to abridge or destroy there unless the owner shall himself commit some act that amounts to a forfeiture has the negro committed such offence above all has his infant child forfeited its unalienable right surely it can be no act of the innocent child yet you must prove the forfeiture or no human legislation can deprive that child of its freedom its black skin constitutes the forfeiture what throw the responsibility upon god charge the common father of the white and the black he who is no respecter of persons with plundering his unoffending children of all which makes the boon of existence desirable their personal liberty we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness declaration of independence from the pen of thomas jefferson in this general and unqualified declaration on the th of july all the people of the united states without distinction of color were proclaimed free by the delegates of the people of those states assembled in their highest sovereign capacity for more than half a century we have openly violated that solemn declaration because it renders nugatory the otherwise beneficial example of our free institutions and exposes us to the scorn and reproach of the liberal and enlightened of other nations chains clank and groans echo around the walls of their spotless congress francis jeffrey man to be possessed by man man to be made property of the image of the deity to be put under the yoke let these usurpers show us their titledeeds simon boliver when i am indulging in my views of american prospects and american liberty it is mortifying to be told that in that very country a large portion of the people are slaves it is a dark spot on the face of the nation such a state of things cannot always exist lafayette i deem it right to raise my humble voice to convince the citizens of america that the slaveholding states are held in abomination by all those whose opinion ought to be valuable man is the property of man in about one half of the american states let them not therefore dare to prate of their institutions or of their national freedom while they hold their fellowmen in bondage of all men living the american citizen who is the owner of slaves is the most despicable he is a political hypocrite of the very worst description the friends of humanity and liberty in europe should join in one universal cry of shame on the american slaveholders base wretches should we shout in chorus base wretches how dare you profane the temple of national freedom the sacred fane of republican rites with the presence and the sufferings of human beings in chains and slavery daniel oconnell because it subjects one portion of our american brethren to the unrestrained violence and unholy passions of another here gentlemen i might summon to my support a cloud of witnesses a host of incontrovertible damning facts the legitimate results of a system whose tendency is to harden and deprave the heart but i will not descend to particulars i am willing to believe that the majority of the masters of your section of the country are disposed to treat their unfortunate slaves with kindness but where the dreadful privilege of slaveholding is extended to all in every neighborhood there must be individuals whose cupidity is unrestrained by any principle of humanity whose lusts are fiercely indulged whose fearful power over the bodies nay may i not say the souls of their victims is daily and hourly abused will the evidence of your own jefferson on this point be admissible the whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions the most unremitting despotism on the one part and degrading submission on the other our children see this and learn to imitate it the parent storms the child looks on catches the lineaments of wrath puts on the same airs in the circle of smaller slaves gives loose to the worst of passions and thus nursed educated and daily exercised in tyranny cannot fail to be stamped by it with odious peculiarities the man must be a prodigy who can retain his morals and manners undepraved by such circumstances notes on virginia p il nexiste a la verite aucune loi qui protege lesclave le mauvais traitement du maitre says achille murat himself a floridian slaveholder in his late work on the united states gentlemen is not this true does there exist even in virginia any law limiting the punishment of a slave are there any bounds prescribed beyond which the brutal the revengeful the intoxicated slavemaster acting in the double capacity of judge and executioner cannot pass you will perhaps tell me that the general law against murder applies alike to master and slave true but will you point out instances of masters suffering the penalty of that law for the murder of their slaves if you examine your judicial reports you will find the wilful murder of a slave decided to be only a trespass virginia reports vol v p harris versus nichols it indeed argues well for virginian pride of character that latterly the law which expressly sanctioned the murder of a slave who in the language of georgia and north carolina died of moderate correction has been repealed but although the letter of the law is changed its practice remains the same in proof of this i would refer to brockenborough and holmes virginia cases p in georgia and north carolina the murder of a slave is tolerated and justified by law provided that in the opinion of the court he died of moderate correction in south carolina the following clause of a law enacted in is still in force if any slave shall suffer in his life limbs or members when no white person shall be present or being present shall neglect or refuse to give evidence concerning the same in every such case the owner or other person who shall have the care and government of the slave shall be deemed and taken to be guilty of such offence unless such owner or other person can make the contrary appear by good and sufficient evidence or shall by his own oath clear and exculpate himself which oath every court where such offence shall be tried is hereby empowered to administer and to acquit the offender accordingly if clear proof of the offence be not made by two witnesses at least any law usage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding is not this offering a reward for perjury and what shall we think of that misnamed court of justice where it is optional with the witnesses in a case of life and death to give or withhold their testimony because it induces dangerous sectional jealousies creates of necessity a struggle between the opposing interests of free and slave labor and threatens the integrity of the union that sectional jealousies do exist the tone of your paper gentlemen is of itself an evidence if indeed any were needed the moral sentiment of the free states is against slavery the freeman has declared his unwillingness that his labor should be reduced to a level with that of slaves harsh epithets and harsh threats have been freely exchanged until the beautiful potomac wherever it winds its way to the ocean has become the dividing line not of territory only but of feeling interest national pride a moral division what shook the pillars of the union when the missouri question was agitated what but a few months ago arrayed in arms a state against the union and the union against a state from maine to florida gentlemen the answer must be the same slavery because of its pernicious influence upon national wealth and prosperity political economy has been the peculiar study of virginia but there are some important truths connected with this science which she has hitherto overlooked or wantonly disregarded population increasing with the means of subsistence is a fair test of national wealth by reference to the several censuses of the united states it will be seen that the white population increases nearly twice as fast in states where there are few or no slaves as in the slave states again in the latter states the slave population has increased twice as fast as the white let us take for example the period of twenty years from to and compare the increase of the two classes in three of the southern states per cent of whites per cent of blacks maryland virginia north carolina the causes of this disproportionate increase so inimical to the true interests of the country are very manifest a large proportion of the free inhabitants of the united states are dependent upon their labor for subsistence the forced unnatural system of slavery in some of the states renders the demand for free laborers less urgent they are not so readily and abundantly supplied with the means of subsistence as those of their own class in the free states and as the necessaries of life diminish population also diminishes there is yet another cause for the decline of the white population in the free states labor is reputable the statesman whose eloquence has electrified a nation does not disdain in the intervals of the public service to handle the axe and the hoe and the woman whose beauty talents and accomplishments have won the admiration of all deems it no degradation to look well to her household but the slave stamps with indelible ignominy the character of occupation it is a disgrace for a highborn virginian or chivalrous carolinian to labor side by side with the low despised miserable black man wretched must be the condition of the poorer classes of whites in a slaveholding community compelled to perform the despised offices of the slave they can hardly rise above his level they become the pariahs of society no wonder then that the tide of emigration flows from the slavecursed shores of the atlantic to the free valleys of the west in new england the labor of a farmer or mechanic is worth from to per annum that of a female from to our entire population with the exception of those engaged in mercantile affairs the professional classes and a very few moneyed idlers are working men and women if that of the south were equally employed and slavery apart there is no reason why they should not be how large an addition would be annually made to the wealth of the country the truth is a very considerable portion of the national wealth produced by northern labor is taxed to defray the expenses of twentyfive representatives of southern property in congress and to maintain an army mainly for the protection of the slavemaster against the dangerous tendencies of that property in the early and better days of the roman republic the ancient warriors and statesmen cultivated their fields with their own hands but so soon as their agriculture was left to the slaves it visibly declined the once fertile fields became pastures and the inhabitants of that garden of the world were dependent upon foreign nations for the necessaries of life the beautiful villages once peopled by free contented laborers became tenantless and over the waste of solitude we see here and there at weary distances the palaces of the master contrasting painfully with the wretched cottages and subterranean cells of the slave in speaking of the extraordinary fertility of the soil in the early times of the republic pliny inquires what was the cause of these abundant harvests it was this that men of rank employed themselves in the culture of the fields whereas now it is left to wretches loaded with fetters who carry in their countenances the shameful evidence of their slavery and what was true in the days of the roman is now written legibly upon the soil of your own virginia a traveller in your state in contemplating the decline of its agriculture has justly remarked that if the miserable condition of the negro had left his mind for reflection he would laugh in his chains to see how slavery has stricken the land with ugliness is the rapid increase of a population of slaves in itself no evil in all the slave states the increase of the slaves is vastly more rapid than that of the whites or free blacks when we recollect that they are under no natural or moral restraint careless of providing food or clothing for themselves or their children when too we consider that they are raised as an article of profitable traffic like the cattle of new england and the hogs of kentucky that it is a matter of interest of dollars and cents to the master that they should multiply as fast as possible there is surely nothing at all surprising in the increase of their numbers would to heaven there were also nothing alarming because by the terms of the national compact the free and the slave states are alike involved in the guilt of maintaining slavery and the citizens of the former are liable at any moment to be called upon to aid the latter in suppressing at the point of the bayonet the insurrection of the slaves slavery is at the best an unnatural state and nature when her eternal principles are violated is perpetually struggling to restore them to their first estate all history ancient and modern is full of warning on this point need i refer to the many revolts of the roman and grecian slaves the bloody insurrection of etruria the horrible servile wars of sicily and capua or to come down to later times to france in the fourteenth century germany in the sixteenth to malta in the last need i call to mind the untold horrors of st domingo when that island under the curse of its servile war glowed redly in the view of earth and heaven an open hell have our own peculiar warnings gone by unheeded the frequent slave insurrections of the south one horrible tragedy gentlemen must still be fresh in your recollection southampton with its fired dwellings and ghastly dead southampton with its dreadful associations of the death struggle with the insurgents the groans of the tortured negroes the lamentations of the surviving whites over woman in her innocence and beauty and childhood and hoary age the hour of emancipation said thomas jefferson is advancing in the march of time it will come if not brought on by the generous energy of our own minds it will come by the bloody process of st domingo to the just and prophetic language of your own great statesman i have but a few words to add they shall be those of truth and soberness we regard the slave system in your section of the country as a great evil moral and political an evil which if left to itself for even a few years longer will give the entire south into the hands of the blacks the terms of the national compact compel us to consider more than two millions of our fellowbeings as your property not indeed morally really de facto but still legally your property we acknowledge that you have a power derived from the united states constitution to hold this property but we deny that you have any moral right to take advantage of that power for truth will not allow us to admit that any human law or compact can make void or put aside the ordinance of the living god and the eternal laws of nature we therefore hold it to be the duty of the people of the slaveholding states to begin the work of emancipation now that any delay must be dangerous to themselves in time and eternity and full of injustice to their slaves and to their brethren of the free states because the slave has never forfeited his right to freedom and the continuance of his servitude is a continuance of robbery and because in the event of a servile war the people of the free states would be called upon to take a part in its unutterable horrors new england would obey that call for she will abide unto death by the constitution of the land yet what must be the feelings of her citizens while engaged in hunting down like wild beasts their fellowmen brutal and black it may be but still oppressed suffering human beings struggling madly and desperately for their liberty if they feel and know that the necessity of so doing has resulted from a blind fatality on the part of the oppressor a reckless disregard of the warnings of earth and heaven an obstinate perseverance in a system founded and sustained by robbery and wrong all wars are horrible wicked inexcusable and truly and solemnly has jefferson himself said that in a contest of this kind between the slave and the master the almighty has no attribute which could take side with us understand us gentlemen we only ask to have the fearful necessity taken away from us of sustaining the wretched policy of slavery by moral influence or physical force we ask alone to be allowed to wash our hands of the blood of millions of your fellowbeings the cry of whom is rising up as a swift witness unto god against us because all the facts connected with the subject warrant us in a most confident belief that a speedy and general emancipation might be made with entire safety and that the consequences of such an emancipation would be highly beneficial to the planters of the south awful as may be their estimate in time and eternity i will not gentlemen dwell upon the priceless benefits of a conscience at rest a soul redeemed from the allpolluting influences of slavery and against which the cry of the laborer whose hire has been kept back by fraud does not ascend nor will i rest the defence of my position upon the fact that it can never be unsafe to obey the commands of god these are the old and common arguments of fanatics and enthusiasts melting away like frostwork in the glorious sunshine of expediency and utility in the light of these modern luminaries then let us reason together a long and careful examination of the subject will i think fully justify me in advancing this general proposition wherever whether in europe the east and west indies south america or in our own country a fair experiment has been made of the comparative expense of free and slave labor the result has uniformly been favorable to the former see broughams colonial policy hodgdons letter to jean baptiste say walehs brazil official letter of hon mr ward

observations on slavery storchs political economy adam smith j jeremies essays humboldts travels etc etc here gentlemen the issue is tendered standing on your own ground of expediency i am ready to defend my position i pass from the utility to the safety of emancipation and here gentlemen i shall probably be met at the outset with your supposed consequences bloodshed rapine promiscuous massacre the facts gentlemen in gods name bring out your facts if slavery is to cast over the prosperity of our country the thick shadow of an everlasting curse because emancipation is dreaded as a remedy worse than the disease itself let us know the real grounds of your fear do you find them in the emancipation of the south american republics in hayti in the partial experiments of some of the west india islands does history ancient or modern justify your fears can you find any excuse for them in the nature of the human mind everywhere maddened by injury and conciliated by kindness no gentlemen the dangers of slavery are manifest and real all history lies open for your warning but the dangers of emancipation of doing justly and loving mercy exist only in your imaginations you cannot produce one fact in corroboration of your fears you cannot point to the stain of a single drop of any masters blood shed by the slave he has emancipated i have now given some of our reasons for opposing slavery in my next letter i shall explain our method of opposition and i trust i shall be able to show that there is nothing fanatical nothing unconstitutional and nothing unchristian in that method in the mean time gentlemen i am your friend and wellwisher haverhill mass d th mo ii the abolitionists of the north have been grossly misrepresented in attacking the system of slavery they have never recommended any measure or measures conflicting with the constitution of the united states they have never sought to excite or encourage a spirit of rebellion among the slaves on the contrary they would hold any such attempt by whomsoever made in utter and stern abhorrence all the leading abolitionists of my acquaintance are from principle opposed to war of all kinds believing that the benefits of no war whatever can compensate for the sacrifice of one human life by violence consequently they would be the first to deprecate any physical interference with your slave system on the part of the general government they are without exception opposed to any political interposition of the government in regard to slavery as it exists in the states for although they feel and see that the canker of the moral disease is affecting all parts of the confederacy they believe that the remedy lies with yourselves alone any such interference they would consider unlawful and unconstitutional and the exercise of unconstitutional power although sanctioned by the majority of a republican government they believe to be a tyranny as monstrous and as odious as the despotism of a turkish sultan having made this disclaimer on the part of myself and my friends let me inquire from whence this charge of advocating the interference of the general government with the sovereign jurisdiction of the states has arisen will you gentlemen will the able editors of the united states telegraph and the columbian telescope explain for myself i have sought in vain among the writings of our northern enthusiasts and among the speeches of the northern statesmen and politicians for some grounds for the accusation the doctrine such as it is does not belong to us i think it may be traced home to the south to virginia to her convention of to the speech of expresident monroe on the white basis question as to emancipation said that distinguished son of your state if ever that should take place it cannot be done by the state it must be done by the union again if emancipation can ever be effected it can only be done with the aid of the general government gentlemen you are welcome to your doctrine it has no advocates among the abolitionists of new england we aim to overthrow slavery by the moral influence of an enlightened public sentiment by a clear and fearless exposition of the guilt of holding property in man by analyzing the true nature of slavery and boldly rebuking sin by a general dissemination of the truths of political economy in regard to free and slave labor by appeals from the pulpit to the consciences of men by the powerful influence of the public press by the formation of societies whose object shall be to oppose the principle of slavery by such means as are consistent with our obligations to law religion and humanity by elevating by means of education and sympathy the character of the free people of color among us our testimony against slavery is the same which has uniformly and with so much success been applied to prevailing iniquity in all ages of the world the truths of divine revelation believing that there can be nothing in the providence of god to which his holy and eternal law is not strictly applicable we maintain that no circumstances can justify the slaveholder in a continuance of his system that the fact that this system did not originate with the present generation is no apology for retaining it inasmuch as crime cannot be entailed and no one is under a necessity of sinning because others have done so before him that the domestic slavetrade is as repugnant to the laws of god and should be as odious in the eyes of a christian community as the foreign that the black child born in a slave plantation is not an entailed article of property and that the white man who makes of that child a slave is a thief and a robber stealing the child as the sea pirate stole his father we do not talk of gradual abolition because as christians we find no authority for advocating a gradual relinquishment of sin we say to slaveholders repent now today immediately just as we say to the intemperate break off from your vice at once touch not taste not handle not from henceforth forever besides the plan of gradual abolition has been tried in this country and the west indies and found wanting it has been in operation in our slave states ever since the declaration of independence and its results are before the nation let us see the abolitionists in there were in the slave states south of the potomac and the ohio free blacks their increase for the ten years following was at the rate of sixty per cent their number in being in there were an increase of seventyfive per cent this comparatively large increase was in a great measure owing to the free discussions going on in england and in this country on the subject of the slavetrade and the rights of man the benevolent impulse extended to the slavemasters and manumissions were frequent but the salutary impression died away the hand of oppression closed again upon its victims and the increase for the period of twenty years to was only seventyseven per cent about one half of what it was in the ten years from to and this is the practical result of the muchlauded plan of gradual abolition in in the states above mentioned there were only slaves but in there were and this too is gradual abolition what then perhaps you will ask do you expect to overthrow our whole slave system at once to turn loose today two millions of negroes no gentlemen we expect no such thing enough for us if in the spirit of fraternal duty we point to your notice the commands of god if we urge you by every cherished remembrance of common sacrifices upon a common altar by every consideration of humanity justice and expediency to begin now without a moments delay to break away from your miserable system to begin the work of moral reformation as god commands you to begin not as selfishness or worldly policy or shortsighted political expediency may chance to dictate such is our doctrine of immediate emancipation a doctrine founded on gods eternal truth plain simple and perfect the doctrine of immediate unprocrastinated repentance applied to the sin of slavery of this doctrine and of our plan for crrrying it into effect i have given an exposition with the most earnest regard to the truth does either embrace anything false fanatical or unconstitutional do they afford a reasonable protext for your fierce denunciations of your northern brethren do they furnish occasion for your newspaper chivalry your stereotyped demonstrations of southern magnanimity and yankee meanness things let me say unworthy of virginians degrading to yourselves insulting to us gentlemen it is too late for virginia with all her lofty intellect and nobility of feeling to defend and advocate the principle of slavery the deathlike silence which for nearly two centuries brooded over her execrable system has been broken light is pouring in upon the minds of her citizens truth is abroad searching out and overturning the lies of the age a moral reformation has been already awakened and it cannot now be drugged to sleep by the sophistries of detected sin a thousand intelligences are at work in her land a thousand of her noblest hearts are glowing with the redeeming spirit of that true philanthropy which is moving all the world no gentlemen light is spreading from the hills of western virginia to the extremest east you cannot arrest its progress it is searching the consciences it is exercising the reason it is appealing to the noblest characteristics of intelligent virginians it is no foreign influence from every abandoned plantation where the profitless fern and thistle have sprung up under the heel of slavery from every falling mansion of the master through whose windows the fox may look out securely and over whose hearthstone the thin grass is creeping a warning voice is sinking deeply into all hearts not imbruted by avarice indolence and the lust of power abolitionist as i am the intellectual character of virginia has no warmer admirer than myself her great names her moral trophies the glories of her early day the still proud and living testimonials of her mental power i freely acknowledge and strongly appreciate and believe me it is with no other feelings than those of regret and heartfelt sorrow that i speak plainly of her great error her giant crime a crime which is visibly calling down upon her the curse of an offended deity but i cannot forget that upon some of the most influential and highly favored of her sons rests the responsibility at the present time of sustaining this fearful iniquity blind to the signs of the times careless of the wishes of thousands of their white fellowcitizens and of the manifold wrongs of the black man they have dared to excuse defend nay eulogize the black abominations of slavery against the tottering ark of the idol these strong men have placed their shoulders that ark must fall that idol must be cast down what then will be the fate of their supporters when the convention of had gathered in its splendid galaxy of talents the great names of virginia the friends of civil liberty turned their eyes towards it in the earnest hope and confidence that it would adopt some measures in regard to slavery worthy of the high character of its members and of the age in which they lived i need not say how deep and bitter was our disappointment western virginia indeed spoke on that occasion through some of her delegates the words of truth and humanity but their counsels and warnings were unavailing the majority turned away to listen to the bewildering eloquence of leigh and upshur and randolph as they desecrated their great intellects to the defence of that system of oppression under which the whole land is groaning the memorial of the citizens of augusta county bearing the signatures of many slaveholders placed the evils of slavery in a strong light before the convention its facts and arguments could only be arbitrarily thrust aside and wantonly disregarded they could not be disproved in a political point of view says the memorial we esteem slavery an evil greater than the aggregate of all the other evils which beset us and we are perfectly willing to bear our proportion of the burden of removing it we ask further what is the evil of any such alarm as our proposition may excite in minds unnecessarily jealous compared with that of the fatal catastrophe which ultimately awaits our country and the general depravation of manners which slavery has already produced and is producing i cannot forbear giving one more extract from this paper the memorialists state their belief that the labor of slaves is vastly less productive than that of freemen that it therefore requires a larger space to furnish subsistence for a given number of the former than of the latter that the employment of the former necessarily excludes that of the latter that hence our population white and black averages seventeen when it ought and would under other circumstances average as in new england at least sixty to a square mile that the possession and management of slaves form a source of endless vexation and misery in the house and of waste and ruin on the farm that the youth of the country are growing up with a contempt of steady industry as a low and servile thing which contempt induces idleness and all its attendant effeminacy vice and worthlessness that the waste of the products of the land nay of the land itself is bringing poverty on all its inhabitants that this poverty and the sparseness of population either prevent the institution of schools throughout the country or keep them in a most languid and inefficient condition and that the same causes most obviously paralyze all our schemes and efforts for the useful improvement of the country gentlemen you have only to look around you to know that this picture has been drawn with the pencil of truth what has made desolate and sterile one of the loveliest regions of the whole earth what mean the signs of wasteful neglect of long improvidence around you the halffinished mansion already falling into decay the brokendown enclosures the weedgrown garden the slave hut open to the elements the hillsides galled and naked the fields below them run over with brier and fern is all this in the ordinary course of nature has man husbanded well the good gifts of god and are they nevertheless passing from him by a process of deterioration over which he has no control no gentlemen for more than two centuries the cold and rocky soil of new england has yielded its annual tribute and it still lies green and luxuriant beneath the sun of our brief summer the nerved and everexercised arm of free labor has changed a landscape wild and savage as the night scenery of salvator rosa into one of pastoral beauty the abode of independence and happiness under a similar system of economy and industry how would virginia rich with natures prodigal blessings have worn at this time over all her territory the smiles of plenty the charms of rewarded industry what a change would have been manifest in your whole character freemen in the place of slaves industry reputable economy a virtue dissipation despised emigration unnecessary a late virginia member of congress described the virginia slaveholder as follows he is an eastern virginian whose good fortune it has been to have been born wealthy and to have become a profound politician at twentyone without study or labor this individual from birth and habit is above all labor and exertion he never moves a finger for any useful purpose he lives on the labor of his slaves and even this labor he is too proud and indolent to direct in person while he is at his ease a mercenary with a whip in his hand drives his slaves in the field their dinner consisting of a few scraps and lean bones is eaten in the burning sun they have no time to go to a shade and be refreshed such easement is reserved for the horses speech of hon p p doddridge in house of delegates all this you will say comes too late the curse is upon you the evil in the vitals of your state the desolation widening day by day no it is not too late there are elements in the virginian character capable of meeting the danger extreme as it is and turning it aside could you but forget for a time partisan contest and unprofitable political speculations you might successfully meet the dangerous exigencies of your state with those efficient remedies which the spirit of the age suggests you might and that too without pecuniary loss relinquish your claims to human beings as slaves and employ them as free laborers under such restraint and supervision as their present degraded condition may render necessary in the language of one of your own citizens it is useless for you to attempt to linger on the skirts of the age which is departed the action of existing causes and principles is steady and progressive it cannot be retarded unless you would blow out all the moral lights around you and if you refuse to keep up with it you will be towed in the wake whether you will or not speech in virginia legislature the late noble example of the eloquent statesman of roanoke the manumission of his slaves speaks volumes to his political friends in the last hour of existence when his soul was struggling from his broken tenement his latest effort was the confirmation of this generous act of a former period light rest the turf upon him beneath his own patrimonial oaks the prayers of many hearts made happy by his benevolence shall linger over his grave and bless it gentlemen in concluding these letters let me once more assure you that i entertain towards you and your political friends none other than kindly feelings if i have spoken at all with apparent harshness it has been of principles rather than of men but i deprecate no censure conscious of the honest and patriotic motives which have prompted their avowal i cheerfully leave my sentiments to their fate despised and contemned as they may be i believe they cannot be gainsaid sustained by the truth as it exists in nature and revelation sanctioned by the prevailing spirit of the age they are yet destined to work out the political and moral regeneration of our country the opposition which they meet with does not dishearten me in the lofty confidence of john milton i believe that though all the winds of doctrine be let loose upon the earth so truth be among them we need not fear let her and falsehood grapple whoever knew her to be put to the worst in a free and open encounter haverhill mass th of th mo letter to samuel e sewall haverhill th of st mo samuel e sewall esq secretary new england a s society dear friend i regret that circumstances beyond my control will not allow of my attendance at the annual meeting of the new england antislavery society i need not say to the members of that society that i am with them heart and soul in the cause of abolition the abolition not of physical slavery alone abhorrent and monstrous as it is but of that intellectual slavery the bondage of corrupt and mistaken opinion which has fettered as with iron the moral energies and intellectual strength of new england for what is slavery after all but fear fear forcing mind and body into unnatural action and it matters little whether it be the terror of the slavewhip on the body or of the scourge of popular opinion upon the inner man we all know how often the representatives of the southern division of the country have amused themselves in congress by applying the opprobrious name of slave to the free northern laborer and how familiar have the significant epithets of white slave and doughface become i fear these epithets have not been wholly misapplied have we not been told here gravely and authoritatively by some of our learned judges divines and politicians that we the free people of new england have no right to discuss the subject of slavery freemen and no right to suggest the duty or the policy of a practical adherence to the doctrines of that immortal declaration upon which our liberties are founded christians enjoying perfect liberty of conscience yet possessing no right to breathe one whisper against a system of adultery and blood which is filling the whole land with abomination and blasphemy and this craven sentiment is echoed by the very men whose industry is taxed to defray the expenses of twentyfive representatives of property vested in beings fashioned in the awful image of their maker by men whose hard earnings aid in supporting a standing army mainly for the protection of slaveholding indolence by men who are liable at any moment to be called from the field and workshop to put down by force the ever upward tendencies of oppressed humanity to aid the negrobreeder and the negrotrader in the prosecution of a traffic most horrible in the eye of god to wall round with their bayonets two millions of colored americans children of a common father and heirs of a common eternity while the broken chain is riveted anew and the thrownoff fetter replaced i am for the abolition of this kind of slavery it must be accomplished before we can hope to abolish the negro slavery of the country the people of the free states with a perfect understanding of their own rights and a sacred respect for the rights of others must put their strong shoulders to the work of moral reform and our statesmen orators and politicians will follow floating as they must with the tendency of the current the mere indices of popular sentiment they cannot be expected to lead in this matter they are but instruments in the hands of the people for good or evil a breath can make them as a breath has made be it our task to give tone and direction to these instruments to turn the tide of popular feeling into the pure channels of justice to break up the sinful silence of the nation to bring the vaunted christianity of our age and country to the test of truth to try the strength and purity of our republicanism if the christianity we profess has not power to pull down the strongholds of prejudice and overcome hate and melt the heart of oppression it is not of god if our republicanism is based on other foundation than justice and humanity let it fall forever no better evidence is needed of the suicidal policy of this nation than the deathlike silence on the subject of slavery which pervades its public documents who that peruses the annual messages of the national executive would from their perusal alone conjecture that such an evil as slavery had existence among us have the people reflected upon the cause of this silence the evil has grown to be too monstrous to be questioned its very magnitude has sealed the lips of the rulers uneasily and troubled with its dream of guilt the nation sleeps on the volcano is beneath god is above us at every step of our peaceful and legal agitation of this subject we are met with one grave objection we are told that the system which we are conscientiously opposing is recognized and protected by the constitution for all the benefits of our fathers patriotism and they are neither few nor trifling let us be grateful to god and to their memories but it should not be forgotten that the same constitutional compact which now sanctions slavery guaranteed protection for twenty years to the foreign slavetrade it threw the shield of its sanctity around the now universally branded pirate it legalized the most abhorrent system of robbery which ever cursed the family of man during those years of sinful compromise the crime of manrobbery less atrocious than at present because the constitution permitted in that single crime the violation of all the commandments of god was that violation less terrible to earth or offensive to heaven no one now defends that constitutional slavetrade loaded with the curse of god and man it stands amidst minor iniquities like satan in pandemonium preeminent and monstrous in crime and if the slavetrade has become thus odious what must be the fate erelong of its parent slavery if the mere consequence be thus blackening under the execration of all the world who shall measure the dreadful amount of infamy which must finally settle on the cause itself the titled ecclesiastic and the ambitious statesman should have their warning on this point they should know that public opinion is steadily turning to the light of truth the fountains are breaking up around us and the great deep will soon be in motion a stern uncompromising and solemn spirit of inquiry is abroad it cannot be arrested and its result may be easily foreseen it will not long be popular to talk of the legality of soulmurder the constitutionality of manrobbery one word in relation to our duty to our southern brethren if we detest their system of slavery in our hearts let us not play the hypocrite with our lips let us not pay so poor a compliment to their understandings as to suppose that we can deceive them into a compliance with our views of justice by ambiguous sophistry and overcome their sinful practices and established prejudices by miserable stratagem let us not first do violence to our consciences by admitting their moral right to property in man and then go to work like so many vagabond pedlers to cheat them out of it they have a right to complain of such treatment it is mean and wicked and dishonorable let us rather treat our southern friends as intelligent and highminded men who whatever may be their faults despise unmanly artifice and loathe cant and abhor hypocrisy connected with them not by political ties alone but by common sacrifices and mutual benefits let us seek to expostulate with them earnestly and openly to gain at least their confidence in our sincerity to appeal to their consciences reason and interests and using no other weapons than those of moral truth contend fearlessly with the evil system they are cherishing and if in an immediate compliance with the strict demands of justice they should need our aid and sympathy let us open to them our hearts and our purses but in the name of sincerity and for the love of peace and the harmony of the union let there be no more mining and countermining no more blending of apology with denunciation no more januslike systems of reform with one face for the south and another for the north if we steadily adhere to the principles upon which we have heretofore acted if we present our naked hearts to the view of all if we meet the threats and violence of our misguided enemies with the bare bosom and weaponless hand of innocence may we not trust that the arm of our heavenly father will be under us to strengthen and support us and although we may not be able to save our country from the awful judgment she is provoking though the pillars of the union fall and all the elements of her greatness perish still let it be our part to rally around the standard of truth and justice to wash our hands of evil to keep our own souls unspotted and bearing our testimony and lifting our warning voices to the last leave the event in the hands of a righteous god john quincy adams in isaac knapp printed letters from john quincy adams to his constituents of the twelfth congressional district in massachusetts to which is added his speech in congress delivered february and the following stood as an introduction to the pamphlet the following letters have been published within a few weeks in the quincy mass patriot notwithstanding the great importance of the subjects which they discuss the intense interest which they are calculated to awaken throughout this commonwealth and the whole country and the exalted reputation of their author as a profound statesman and powerful writer they are as yet hardly known beyond the limits of the constituency to whom they are particularly addressed the reason of this is sufficiently obvious john quincy adams belongs to neither of the prominent political parties fights no partisan battles and cannot be prevailed upon to sacrifice truth and principle upon the altar of party expediency and interest hence neither party is interested in defending his course or in giving him an opportunity to defend himself but however systematic may be the efforts of mere partisan presses to suppress and hold back from the public eye the powerful and triumphant vindication of the right of petition the graphic delineation of the slavery spirit in congress and the humbling disclosure of northern cowardice and treachery contained in these letters they are destined to exert a powerful influence upon the public mind they will constitute one of the most striking pages in the history of our times they will be read with avidity in the north and in the south and throughout europe apart from the interest excited by the subjects under discussion and viewed only as literary productions they may be ranked among the highest intellectual efforts of their author their sarcasm is juniuslike cold keen unsparing in boldness directness and eloquent appeal they will bear comparison with oconnells celebrated letters to the reformers of great britain they are the offspring of an intellect unshorn of its primal strength and combining the ardor of youth with the experience of age the disclosure made in these letters of the slavery influence exerted in congress over the representatives of the free states of the manner in which the rights of freemen have been bartered for southern votes or basely yielded to the threats of men educated in despotism and stamped by the free indulgence of unrestrained tyranny with the odious peculiarities of slavery is painful and humiliating in the extreme it will be seen that in the great struggle for and against the right of petition an account of which is given in the following pages their author stood in a great measure alone and unsupported by his northern colleagues on his gray discrowned head the entire fury of slaveholding arrogance and wrath was expended he stood alone beating back with his aged and single arm the tide which would have borne down and overwhelmed a less sturdy and determined spirit we need not solicit for these letters and the speech which accompanies them a thorough perusal they deserve and we trust will receive a circulation throughout the entire country they will meet a cordial welcome from every lover of human liberty from every friend of justice and the rights of man irrespective of color or condition the principles which they defend the sentiments which they express are those of massachusetts as recently asserted almost unanimously by her legislature in both branches of that body during the discussion of the subject of slavery and the right of petition the course of the expresident was warmly and eloquently commended massachusetts will sustain her tried and faithful representative and the time is not far distant when the best and worthiest citizens of the entire north will proffer him their thanks for his noble defence of their rights as freemen and of the rights of the slave as a man the bible and slavery from a review of a proslavery pamphlet by evangelicus in the boston emancipator in the second part of the essay is occupied in proving that the slavery in the roman world at the time of our saviour was similar in all essential features to american slavery at the present day and the third and concluding part is devoted to an examination of the apostolical directions to slaves and masters as applicable to the same classes in the united states he thinks the command to give to servants that which is just and equal means simply that the masters should treat their slaves with equity and that while the servant is to be profitable to the master the latter is bound in a fair and equitable manner to provide for the slaves subsistence and happiness although he professes to believe that a faithful adherence to scriptural injunctions on this point would eventually terminate in the emancipation of the slaves he thinks it not necessary to inquire whether the new testament does or does not tolerate slavery as a permanent institution from the foregoing synopsis it will be seen at once that whatever may have been the motives of the writer the effect of his publication so far as it is at all felt will be to strengthen the oppressor in his guilt and hold him back from the performance of his immediate duty in respect to his slaves and to shield his conscience from the reproofs of that class who according to evangelicus have no personal acquaintance with the actual domestic state or the social and political connections of their southern fellowcitizens we look upon it only as another vain attempt to strike a balance between christian duty and criminal policy to reconcile christ and belial the holy philanthropy of him who went about doing good with the most abhorrent manifestation of human selfishness lust and hatred which ever provoked the divine displeasure there is a gravestone coldness about it the author manifests as little feeling as if he were solving a question in algebra no sigh of sympathy breathes through its frozen pages for the dumb chained millions no evidence of a feeling akin to that of him who at the grave of lazarus wept and forgot his power to save no outburst of that indignant reproof with which the divine master rebuked the devourers of widows houses and the oppressors of the poor is called forth by the writers stoical contemplation of the tyranny of his christian brethren at the south it is not necessary says evangelicus to inquire whether the new testament does not tolerate slavery as a permanent institution and this is said when the entire slaveholding church has sheltered its abominations under the pretended sanction of the gospel when slavery including within itself a violation of every command uttered amidst the thunders of sinai a system which has filled the whole south with the oppression of egypt and the pollutions of sodom is declared to be an institution of the most high with all due deference to the author we tell him and we tell the church north and south that this question must be met once more we repeat the solemn inquiry which has been already made in our columns is the bible to enslave the world has it been but a vain dream of ours that the mission of the author of the gospel was to undo the heavy burdens to open the prison doors and to break the yoke of the captive let andover and princeton answer if the gospel does sanction the vilest wrong which man can inflict upon his fellowman if it does rivet the chains which humanity left to itself would otherwise cast off then in humanitys name let it perish forever from the face of the earth let the bible societies dissolve let not another sheet issue from their presses scatter not its leaves abroad over the dark places of the earth they are not for the healing of the nations leave rather to the persian his zendavesta to the mussulman his koran we repeat it this question must be met already we have heard infidelity exulting over the astute discoveries of bespectacled theological professors that the great head of the christian church tolerated the horrible atrocities of roman slavery and that his most favored apostle combined slavecatching with his missionary labors and why should it not exult fouler blasphemy than this was never uttered a more monstrous libel upon the divine author of christianity was never propagated by paine or voltaire kneeland or owen and we are constrained to regard the professor of theology or the doctor of divinity who tasks his sophistry and learning in an attempt to show that the divine mind looks with complacency upon chattel slavery as the most dangerous enemy with which christianity has to contend the friends of pure and undefiled religion must awake to this danger the northern church must shake itself clean from its present connection with blasphemers and slaveholders or perish with them what is slavery addressed to the liberty party convention at new bedford in september i have just received your kind invitation to attend the meeting of the liberty party in new bedford on the d of next month believe me it is with no ordinary feelings of regret that i find myself under the necessity of foregoing the pleasure of meeting with you on that occasion but i need not say to you and through you to the convention that you have my hearty sympathy i am with the liberty party because it is the only party in the country which is striving openly and honestly to reduce to practice the great truths which lie at the foundation of our republic all men created equal endowed with rights inalienable the security of these rights the only just object of government the right of the people to alter or modify government until this great object is attained precious and glorious truths sacred in the sight of their divine author grateful and beneficent to suffering humanity essential elements of that ultimate and universal government of which god is laying the strong and wide foundations turning and overturning until he whose right it is shall rule the voice which calls upon us to sustain them is the voice of god in the eloquent language of the lamented myron holley the man who first lifted up the standard of the liberty party he calls upon us to sustain these truths in the recorded voice of the holy of ancient times he calls us to sustain them in the sound as of many waters and mighty thunderings rising from the fields of europe converted into one vast aceldama by the exertions of despots to suppress them in the persuasive history of the best thoughts and boldest deeds of all our brave selfsacrificing ancestors in the tender heartreaching whispers of our children preparing to suffer or enjoy the future as we leave it for them in the broken and disordered but moving accents of half our race yet groping in darkness and galled by the chains of bondage he calls upon us to sustain them by the solemn and considerate use of all the powers with which he has invested us in a time of almost universal political scepticism in the midst of a pervading and growing unbelief in the great principles enunciated in the revolutionary declaration the liberty party has dared to avow its belief in these truths and to carry them into action as far as it has the power it is a protest against the political infidelity of the day a recurrence to first principles a summons once more to that deserted altar upon which our fathers laid their offerings it may be asked why it is that a party resting upon such broad principles is directing its exclusive exertions against slavery are there not other great interests ask all manner of whig and democrat editors and politicians consider for instance say the democrats the mighty question which is agitating us whether a northern man with southern principles or a southern man with the principles of a nero or caligula shall be president or look at us say the whigs deprived of our inalienable right to office by this tylercalhoun administration and bethink you gentlemen how could your liberty party do better than to vote with us for a man who if he does hold some threescore of slaves and maintain that two hundred years of legislation has sanctioned and sanctified negro slavery is at the same time the champion of greek liberty and polish liberty and south american liberty and in short of all sorts of liberties save liberty at home yes friends we have considered all this and more namely that one sixth part of our entire population are slaves and that you with your subtreasuries and national banks propose no relief for them nay farther it is because both of you when in power have used your authority to rivet closer the chains of unhappy millions that we have been compelled to abandon you and form a liberty party having for its first object the breaking of these chains what is slavery for upon the answer to this question must the liberty party depend for its justification the slave laws of the south tell us that it is the conversion of men into articles of property the transformation of sentient immortal beings into chattels personal the principle of a reciprocity of benefits which to some extent characterizes all other relations does not exist in that of master and slave the master holds the plough which turns the soil of his plantation the horse which draws it and the slave who guides it by one and the same tenure the profit of the master is the great end of the slaves existence for this end he is fed clothed and prescribed for in sickness he learns nothing acquires nothing for himself he cannot use his own body for his own benefit his very personality is destroyed he is a mere instrument a means in the hands of another for the accomplishment of an end in which his own interests are not regarded a machine moved not by his own will but by anothers in him the awful distinction between a person and a thing is annihilated he is thrust down from the place which god and nature assigned him from the equal companionship of rational intelligences a man herded with beasts an immortal nature classed with the wares of the merchant the relations of parent and child master and apprentice government and subject are based upon the principle of benevolence reciprocal benefits and the wants of human society relations which sacredly respect the rights and legacies which god has given to all his rational creatures but slavery exists only by annihilating or monopolizing these rights and legacies in every other modification of society mans personal ownership remains secure he may be oppressed deprived of privileges loaded with burdens hemmed about with legal disabilities his liberties restrained but through all the right to his own body and soul remains inviolate he retains his inherent original possession of himself even crime cannot forfeit it for that law which destroys his personality makes void its own claims upon him as a moral agent and the power to punish ceases with the accountability of the criminal he may suffer and die under the penalties of the law but he suffers as a man he perishes as a man and not as a thing to the last moments of his existence the rights of a moral agent are his they go with him to the grave they constitute the ground of his accountability at the bar of infinite justice rights fixed eternal inseparable attributes of all rational intelligence in time and eternity the same in essence and differing in degree only with those of the highest moral being of god himself slavery alone lays its grasp upon the right of personal ownership that foundation right the removal of which uncreates the man a right which god himself could not take away without absolving the being thus deprived of all moral accountability and so far as that being is concerned making sin and holiness crime and virtue words without significance and the promises and sanctions of revelation dreams hence the crowning horror of slavery that which lifts it above all other iniquities is not that it usurps the prerogatives of deity but that it attempts that which even he who has said all souls are mine cannot do without breaking up the foundations of his moral government slavery is in fact a struggle with the almighty for dominion over his rational creatures it is leagued with the powers of darkness in wresting man from his maker it is blasphemy lifting brazen brow and violent hand to heaven attempting a reversal of gods laws man claiming the right to uncreate his brother to undo that last and most glorious work which god himself pronounced good amidst the rejoicing hosts of heaven man arrogating to himself the right to change for his own selfish purposes the beautiful order of created existences to pluck the crown of an immortal nature scarce lower than that of angels from the brow of his brother to erase the godlike image and superscription stamped upon him by the hand of his creator and to write on the despoiled and desecrated tablet a chattel personal this then is slavery nature with her thousand voices cries out against it against it divine revelation launches its thunders the voice of god condemns it in the deep places of the human heart the woes and wrongs unutterable which attend this dreadful violation of natural justice the stripes the tortures the sunderings of kindred the desolation of human affections the unchastity and lust the toil uncompensated the abrogated marriage the legalized heathenism the burial of the mind are but the mere incidentals of the first grand outrage that seizure of the entire man nerve sinew and spirit which robs him of his body and god of his soul these are but the natural results and outward demonstrations of slavery the crystallizations from the chattel principle it is against this system in its active operation upon three millions of our countrymen that the liberty party is for the present directing all its efforts with such an object well may we be men of one idea nor do we neglect other great interests for all are colored and controlled by slavery and the removal of this disastrous influence would most effectually benefit them political action is the result and immediate object of moral suasion on this subject action action is the spirits means of progress its sole test of rectitude its only source of happiness and should not decided action follow our deep convictions of the wrong of slavery shall we denounce the slaveholders of the states while we retain our slavery in the district of columbia shall we pray that the god of the oppressed will turn the hearts of the rulers in south carolina while we the rulers of the district refuse to open the prisons and break up the slavemarkets on its ten miles square god keep us from such hypocrisy everybody now professes to be opposed to slavery the leaders of the two great political parties are grievously concerned lest the purity of the antislavery enterprise will suffer in its connection with politics in the midst of grossest proslavery action they are full of antislavery sentiment they love the cause but on the whole think it too good for this world they would keep it sublimated aloft out of vulgar reach or use altogether intangible as magellans clouds everybody will join us in denouncing slavery in the abstract not a faithless priest nor politician will oppose us abandon action and forsooth we can have an abolition millennium the wolf shall lie down with the lamb while slavery in practice clanks in derision its three millions of unbroken chains our opponents have no fear of the harmless spectre of an abstract idea they dread it only when it puts on the flesh and sinews of a practical reality and lifts its right arm in the strength which god giveth to do as well as theorize as honest men then we must needs act let us do so as becomes men engaged in a great and solemn cause not by processions and idle parades and spasmodic enthusiasms by shallow tricks and shows and artifices can a cause like ours be carried onward leave these to parties contending for office as the spoils of victory we need no disguises nor false pretences nor subterfuges enough for us to present before our fellowcountrymen the holy truths of freedom in their unadorned and native beauty dark as the present may seem let us remember with hearty confidence that truth and right are destined to triumph let us blot out the word discouragement from the antislavery vocabulary let the enemies of freedom be discouraged let the advocates of oppression despair but let those who grapple with wrong and falsehood in the name of god and in the power of his truth take courage slavery must die the lord hath spoken it the vials of his hot displeasure like those which chastised the nations in the apocalyptic vision are smoking even now above its habitations of cruelty it can no longer be borne with by heaven universal humanity cries out against it let us work then to hasten its downfall doing whatsoever our hands find to do with all our might october democracy and slavery the great leader of american democracy thomas jefferson was an ultraabolitionist in theory while from youth to age a slaveholder in practice with a zeal which never abated with a warmth which the frost of years could not chill he urged the great truths that each man should be the guardian of his own weal that one man should never have absolute control over another he maintained the entire equality of the race the inherent right of selfownership the equal claim of all to a fair participation in the enactment of the laws by which they are governed he saw clearly that slavery as it existed in the south and on his own plantation was inconsistent with this doctrine his early efforts for emancipation in virginia failed of success but he next turned his attention to the vast northwestern territory and laid the foundation of that ordinance of which like the flaming sword of the angel at the gates of paradise has effectually guarded that territory against the entrance of slavery nor did he stop here he was the friend and admirer of the ultraabolitionists of revolutionary france he warmly urged his british friend dr price to send his antislavery pamphlets into virginia he omitted no opportunity to protest against slavery as antidemocratic unjust and dangerous to the common welfare and in his letter to the territorial governor of illinois written in old age he bequeathed in earnest and affecting language the cause of negro emancipation to the rising generation this enterprise said he is for the young for those who can carry it forward to its consummation it shall have all my prayers and these are the only weapons of an old man such was thomas jefferson the great founder of american democracy the advocate of the equality of human rights irrespective of any conditions of birth or climate or color his political doctrines it is strange to say found their earliest recipients and most zealous admirers in the slave states of the union the privileged class of slaveholders whose rank and station supersede the necessity of an order of nobility became earnest advocates of equality among themselves the democracy of aristocracy with the misery and degradation of servitude always before them in the condition of their own slaves an intense love of personal independence and a haughty impatience of any control over their actions prepared them to adopt the democratic idea so far as it might be applied to their own order of that enlarged and generous democracy the love not of individual freedom alone but of the rights and liberties of all men the unselfish desire to give to others the privileges which all men value for themselves we are constrained to believe the great body of thomas jeffersons slaveholding admirers had no adequate conception they were just such democrats as the patricians of rome and the aristocracy of venice lords over their own plantations a sort of holy alliance of planters admitting and defending each others divine right of mastership still in virginia maryland and in other sections of the slave states truer exponents and exemplifiers of the idea of democracy as it existed in the mind of jefferson were not wanting in the debate on the memorials presented to the first congress of the united states praying for the abolition of slavery the voice of the virginia delegation in that body was unanimous in deprecation of slavery as an evil social moral and political in the virginia constitutional convention of there were men who had the wisdom to perceive and the firmness to declare that slavery was not only incompatible with the honor and prosperity of the state but wholly indefensible on any grounds which could be consistently taken by a republican people in the debate on the same subject in the legislature in universal and impartial democracy found utterance from eloquent lips we might say as much of kentucky the child of virginia but it remains true that these were exceptions to the general rule with the language of universal liberty on their lips and moved by the most zealous spirit of democratic propagandism the greater number of the slaveholders of the union seem never to have understood the true meaning or to have measured the length and breadth of that doctrine which they were the first to adopt and of which they have claimed all along to be the peculiar and chosen advocates the northern states were slow to adopt the democratic creed the oligarchy of new england and the rich proprietors and landholders of the middle states turned with alarm and horror from the levelling doctrines urged upon them by the liberty and equality propagandists of the south the doctrines of virginia were quite as unpalatable to massachusetts at the beginning of the present century as those of massachusetts now are to the old dominion democracy interfered with old usages and timehonored institutions and threatened to plough up the very foundations of the social fabric it was zealously opposed by the representatives of new england in congress and in the home legislatures and in many pulpits hands were lifted to god in humble entreaty that the curse and bane of democracy an offshoot of the rabid jacobinism of revolutionary france might not be permitted to take root and overshadow the goodly heritage of puritanism the alarmists of the south in their most fervid pictures of the evils to be apprehended from the prevalence of antislavery doctrines in their midst have drawn nothing more fearful than the visions of such prophets of war and harbingers of ill as fisher ames in the forum and parish in the desk when contemplating the inroads of jeffersonian democracy upon the politics religion and property of the north but great numbers of the free laborers of the northern states the mechanics and small farmers took a very different view of the matter the doctrines of jefferson were received as their political gospel it was in vain that federalism denounced with indignation the impertinent inconsistency of slaveholding interference in behalf of liberty in the free states come the doctrine from whom it might the people felt it to be true state after state revolted from the ranks of federalism and enrolled itself on the side of democracy the old order of things was broken up equality before the law was established religious tests and restrictions of the right of suffrage were abrogated take massachusetts for example there the resistance to democratic principles was the most strenuous and longest continued yet at this time there is no state in the union more thorough in its practical adoption of them no property qualifications or religious tests prevail all distinctions of sect birth or color are repudiated and suffrage is universal the democracy which in the south has only been held in a state of gaseous abstraction hardened into concrete reality in the cold air of the north the ideal became practical for it had found lodgment among men who were accustomed to act out their convictions and test all their theories by actual experience while thus making a practical application of the new doctrine the people of the free states could not but perceive the incongruity of democracy and slavery selleck osborn who narrowly escaped the honor of a democratic martyr in connecticut denounced slaveholding in common with other forms of oppression barlow fresh from communion with gregoire brissot and robespierre devoted to negro slavery some of the most vigorous and truthful lines of his great poem eaton returning from his romantic achievements in tunis for the deliverance of white slaves improved the occasion to read a lecture to his countrymen on the inconsistency and guilt of holding blacks in servitude in the missouri struggle of the people of the free states with a few ignoble exceptions took issue with the south against the extension of slavery some ten years later the present antislavery agitation commenced it originated beyond a question in the democratic element with the words of jefferson on their lips young earnest and enthusiastic men called the attention of the community to the moral wrong and political reproach of slavery in the name and spirit of democracy the moral and political powers of the people were invoked to limit discountenance and put an end to a system so manifestly subversive of its foundation principles it was a revival of the language of jefferson and page and randolph an echo of the voice of him who penned the declaration of independence and originated the ordinance of meanwhile the south had wellnigh forgotten the actual significance of the teachings of its early political prophets and their renewal in the shape of abolitionism was as might have been expected strange and unwelcome pleasant enough it had been to hold up occasionally these democratic abstractions for the purpose of challenging the worlds admiration and cheaply acquiring the character of lovers of liberty and equality frederick of prussia apostrophizing the shades of cato and brutus vous de la liberte heros que je revere while in the full exercise of his despotic power was quite as consistent as these democratic slaveowners whose admiration of liberty increased in exact ratio with its distance from their own plantations they had not calculated upon seeing their doctrine clothed with life and power a practical reality pressing for application to their slaves as well as to themselves they had not taken into account the beautiful ordination of providence that no man can vindicate his own rights without directly or impliedly including in that vindication the rights of all other men the haughty and oppressive barons who wrung from their reluctant monarch the great charter at runnymede acting only for themselves and their class little dreamed of the universal application which has since been made of their guaranty of rights and liberties as little did the nobles of the parliament of paris when strengthening themselves by limiting the kingly prerogative dream of the emancipation of their own serfs by a revolution to which they were blindly giving the first impulse gods truth is universal it cannot be monopolized by selfishness the two processions look upon this picture and on this hamlet considering that we have a slave population of nearly three millions and that in one half of the states of the republic it is more hazardous to act upon the presumption that all men are created free and equal than it would be in austria or russia the lavish expression of sympathy and extravagant jubilation with which as a people we are accustomed to greet movements in favor of freedom abroad are not a little remarkable we almost went into ecstasies over the first french revolution we filled our papers with the speeches of orator hunt and the english radicals we fraternized with the united irishmen we hailed as brothers in the cause of freedom the very mexicans whom we have since wasted with fire and sword our orators north and south grew eloquent and classic over the greek and polish revolutions in short long ere this if the walls of kingcraft and despotism had been like those of jericho destined to be overthrown by sound our fourth of july cannonshootings and bellringings together with our fierce grandiloquent speechmakings in and out of congress on the occasions referred to would have left no stone upon another it is true that an exception must be made in the case of hayti we fired no guns drank no toasts made no speeches in favor of the establishment of that new republic in our neighborhood the very mention of the possibility that haytien delegates might ask admittance to the congress of the free republics of the new world at panama frightened from their propriety the eager propagandists of republicanism in the senate and gave a deathblow to their philanthropic projects but as hayti is a republic of blacks who having revolted from their masters as well as from the mother country have placed themselves entirely without the pale of anglosaxon sympathy by their impertinent interference with the monopoly of white liberty this exception by no means disproves the general fact that in the matter of powderburning belljangling speechmaking toastdrinking admiration of freedom afar off and in the abstract we have no rivals the caricature of our general sympathizers in martin chuzzlewit is by no means a fancy sketch the news of the revolution of the three days in paris and the triumph of the french people over charles x and his ministers as a matter of course acted with great effect upon our national susceptibility we all threw up our hats in excessive joy at the spectacle of a king dashed down headlong from his throne and chased out of his kingdom by his longsuffering and oppressed subjects we took half the credit of the performance to ourselves inasmuch as lafayette was a principal actor in it our editors from passamaquoddy to the sabine indited paragraphs for a thousand and one newspapers congratulating the parisian patriots and prophesying all manner of evil to holy alliances kings and aristocracies the national intelligencer for september contains a full account of the public rejoicings of the good people of washington on the occasion bells were rung in all the steeples guns were fired and a grand procession was formed including the president of the united states the heads of departments and other public functionaries decorated with tricolored ribbons and with tricolored flags mingling with the stripes and stars over their heads and gazed down upon by bright eyes from window and balcony the general sympathizers moved slowly and majestically through the broad avenue towards the capitol to celebrate the revival of french liberty in a manner becoming the chosen rulers of a free people what a spectacle was this for the representatives of european kingcraft at our seat of government how the titled agents of metternich and nicholas must have trembled in view of this imposing demonstration for the safety of their peculiar institutions unluckily however the moral effect of this grand spectacle was marred somewhat by the appearance of another procession moving in a contrary direction it was a gang of slaves handcuffed in pairs with the sullen sadness of despair in their faces they marched wearily onward to the music of the drivers whip and the clanking iron on their limbs think of it shouts of triumph rejoicing bells gay banners and glittering cavalcades in honor of liberty in immediate contrast with men and women chained and driven like cattle to market the editor of the american spectator a paper published at washington at that time speaking of this black procession of slavery describes it as driven along by what had the appearance of a man on horseback the miserable wretches who composed it were doubtless consigned to a slavejail to await their purchase and transportation to the south or southwest and perhaps formed a part of that drove of human beings which the same editor states that he saw on the saturday following males and females chained in couples starting from robeys tavern on foot for alexandria to embark on board a slaveship at a virginia campmeeting many years ago one of the brethren attempting an exhortation stammered faltered and finally came to a dead stand sit down brother said old father kyle the oneeyed abolition preacher its no use to try you cant preach with twenty negroes sticking in your throat it strikes us that our country is very much in the condition of the poor confused preacher at the campmeeting slavery sticks in its throat and spoils its finest performances political and ecclesiastical confuses the tongues of its evangelical alliances makes a farce of its fourth of july celebrations and as in the case of the grand washington procession of sadly mars the effect of its rejoicings in view of the progress of liberty abroad there is a stammer in all our exhortations our moral and political homilies are sure to run into confusions and contradictions and the response which comes to us from the nations is not unlike that of father kyle to the planters attempt at sermonizing its no use brother jonathan you cant preach liberty with three millions of slaves in your throat a chapter of history the theory which a grave and learned northern senator has recently announced in congress that slavery like the cottonplant is confined by natural laws to certain parallels of latitude beyond which it can by no possibility exist however it may have satisfied its author and its auditors has unfortunately no verification in the facts of the case slavery is singularly cosmopolitan in its habits the offspring of pride and lust and avarice it is indigenous to the world rooted in the human heart it defies the rigors of winter in the steppes of tartary and the fierce sun of the tropics it has the universal acclimation of sin the first account we have of negro slaves in new england is from the pen of john josselyn nineteen years after the landing at plymouth this interesting traveller was for some time the guest of samuel maverick who then dwelt like a feudal baron in his fortalice on noddles island surrounded by retainers and servants bidding defiance to his indian neighbors behind his strong walls with four great guns mounted thereon and giving entertainment to all newcomers gratis on the d of october about nine oclock in the morning mr mavericks negro woman says josselyn came to my chamber and in her own country language and tune sang very loud and shrill going out to her she used a great deal of respect towards me and would willingly have expressed her grief in english had she been able to speak the language but i apprehended it by her countenance and deportment whereupon i repaired to my host to learn of him the cause and resolved to entreat him in her behalf for i had understood that she was a queen in her own country and observed a very dutiful and humble garb used towards her by another negro who was her maid mr maverick was desirous to have a breed of negroes and therefore seeing she would not yield by persuasions to company with a negro young man he had in his house he commanded him willed she nilled she to go to her bed which was no sooner done than she thrust him out again this she took in high disdain beyond her slavery and this was the cause of her grief that the peculiar domestic arrangements and unfastidious economy of this slavebreeding settler were not countenanced by the puritans of that early time we have sufficient evidence it is but fair to suppose from the silence of all other writers of the time with respect to negroes and slaves that this case was a marked exception to the general habits and usage of the colonists at an early period a traffic was commenced between the new england colonies and that of barbadoes and it is not improbable that slaves were brought to boston from that island the laws however discouraged their introduction and purchase giving freedom to all held to service at the close of seven years in two years after josselyns adventure on noddles island the code of laws known by the name of the body of liberties was adopted by the colony it was drawn up by nathaniel ward the learned and ingenious author of the simple cobbler of agawarn the earliest poetical satire of new england one of its provisions was as follows there shall be never any bond slaverie villainage or captivitie amongst us unless it be lawfull captives taken in just warres and such strangers as willingly sell themselves or are sold to us and these shall have all the liberties and christian usages which the law of god established in israel doth morally require in captain smith a boston churchmember in connection with one keeser brought home two negroes whom he obtained by the surprise and burning of a negro village in africa and the massacre of many of its inhabitants sir richard saltonstall one of the assistants presented a petition to the general court stating the outrage thereby committed as threefold in its nature namely murder manstealing and sabbathbreaking inasmuch as the offence of chasing the negers as aforesayde upon the sabbath day being a servile work and such as cannot be considered under any other head is expressly capital by the law of god for which reason he prays that the offenders may be brought to justice soe that the sin they have committed may be upon their own heads and not upon ourselves upon this petition the general court passed the following order eminently worthy of men professing to rule in the fear and according to the law of god a terror to evildoers and a praise to them that do well the general court conceiving themselves bound by the first opportunity to bear witness against the heinous and crying sin of manstealing as also to prescribe such timely redress for what has passed and such a law for the future as may sufficiently deter all others belonging to us to have to do in such vile and odious courses justly abhorred of all good and just men do order that the negro interpreter and others unlawfully taken be by the first opportunity at the charge of the country for the present sent to his native country guinea and a letter with him of the indignation of the court thereabout and justice thereof desiring our honored governor would please put this order in execution there is so far as we know no historical record of the actual return of these stolen men to their home a letter is extant however addressed in behalf of the general court to a mr williams on the piscataqua by whom one of the negroes had been purchased requesting him to send the man forthwith to boston that he may be sent home which this court do resolve to send back without delay three years after in the following law was placed upon the statutebook of the massachusetts colony if any man stealeth a man or mankind he shall surely be put to death it will thus be seen that these early attempts to introduce slavery into new england were opposed by severe laws and by that strong popular sentiment in favor of human liberty which characterized the christian radicals who laid the foundations of the colonies it was not the rigor of her northern winter nor the unkindly soil of massachusetts which discouraged the introduction of slavery in the first halfcentury of her existence as a colony it was the puritans recognition of the brotherhood of man in sin suffering and redemption his estimate of the awful responsibilities and eternal destinies of humanity his hatred of wrong and tyranny and his stern sense of justice which led him to impose upon the african slavetrader the terrible penalty of the mosaic code but that brave old generation passed away the civil contentions in the mother country drove across the seas multitudes of restless adventurers and speculators the indian wars unsettled and demoralized the people habits of luxury and the greed of gain took the place of the severe selfdenial and rigid virtues of the fathers hence we are not surprised to find that josselyn in his second visit to new england some twentyfive years after his first speaks of the great increase of servants and negroes in governor bradstreet in answer to the inquiries of his majestys privy council states that two years before a vessel from madagasca brought into the colony betwixt forty and fifty negroes mostly women and children who were sold at a loss to the owner of the vessel now and then he continues two or three negroes are brought from barbadoes and other of his majestys plantations and sold for twenty pounds apiece so that there may be within the government about one hundred or one hundred and twenty and it may be as many scots brought hither and sold for servants in the time of the war with scotland and about half as many irish the owning of a black or white slave or servant at this period was regarded as an evidence of dignity and respectability and hence magistrates and clergymen winked at the violation of the law by the mercenary traders and supplied themselves without scruple indian slaves were common and are named in old wills deeds and inventories with horses cows and household furniture as early as the year we find william hilton of newbury sells to george carr for one quarter part of a vessel james my indian with all the interest i have in him to be his servant forever some were taken in the narragansett war and other indian wars others were brought from south carolina and the spanish main it is an instructive fact as illustrating the retributive dealings of providence that the direst affliction of the massachusetts colony the witchcraft terror of originated with the indian tituba a slave in the family of the minister of danvers in the year the inhabitants of newbury were greatly excited by the arrest of a jerseyman who had been engaged in enticing indians and negroes to leave their masters he was charged before the court with saying that the english should be cut off and the negroes set free james a negro slave and joseph an indian were arrested with him their design was reported to be to seize a vessel in the port and escape to canada and join the french and return and lay waste and plunder their masters they were to come back with five hundred indians and three hundred canadians and the place of crossing the merrimac river and of the first encampment on the other side were even said to be fixed upon when we consider that there could not have been more than a score of slaves in the settlement the excitement into which the inhabitants were thrown by this absurd rumor of conspiracy seems not very unlike that of a convocation of small planters in a backwoods settlement in south carolina on finding an antislavery newspaper in their weekly mail bag in colonel saltonstall of haverhill had several negroes and among them a highspirited girl who for some alleged misdemeanor was severely chastised the slave resolved upon revenge for her injury and soon found the means of obtaining it the colonel had on hand for service in the indian war then raging a considerable store of gunpowder this she placed under the room in which her master and mistress slept laid a long train and dropped a coal on it she had barely time to escape to the farmhouse before the explosion took place shattering the stately mansion into fragments saltonstall and his wife were carried on their bed a considerable distance happily escaping serious injury some soldiers stationed in the house were scattered in all directions but no lives were lost the colonel on recovering from the effects of his sudden overturn hastened to the farmhouse and found his servants all up save the author of the mischief who was snug in bed and apparently in a quiet sleep in an attempt was made in the general court of massachusetts to prevent the increase of slaves judge sewall soon after published a pamphlet against slavery but it seems with little effect boston merchants and shipowners became to a considerable extent involved in the slavetrade distilleries established in that place and in rhode island furnished rum for the african market the slaves were usually taken to the west indies although occasionally part of a cargo found its way to new england where the wholesome old laws against manstealing had become a dead letter on the statutebook in a bill was brought before the legislature of massachusetts to prevent the unwarrantable and unnatural custom of enslaving mankind the council of governor bernard sent it back to the house greatly changed and curtailed and it was lost by the disagreement of the two branches governor bernard threw his influence on the side of slavery in a bill prohibiting the traffic in slaves passed both houses but governor hutchinson withheld his assent and dismissed the legislature the colored men sent a deputation of their own to the governor to solicit his consent to the bill but he told them his instructions forbade him a similar committee waiting upon general gage received the same answer in the year a servant of richard lechmere of cambridge stimulated by the general discussion of the slavery question and by the advice of some of the zealous advocates of emancipation brought an action against his master for detaining him in bondage the suit was decided in his favor two years before the similar decision in the case of somerset in england the funds necessary for carrying on this suit were raised among the blacks themselves other suits followed in various parts of the province and the result was in every instance the freedom of the plaintiff in caesar hendrick sued his master one greenleaf of newburyport for damages laid at fifty pounds for holding him as a slave the jury awarded him his freedom and eighteen pounds according to dr belknap whose answers to the queries on the subject propounded by judge tucker of virginia have furnished us with many of the facts above stated the principal grounds upon which the counsel of the masters depended were that the negroes were purchased in open market and included in the bills of sale like other property that slavery was sanctioned by usage and finally that the laws of the province recognized its existence by making masters liable for the maintenance of their slaves or servants on the part of the blacks the law and usage of the mother country confirmed by the great charter that no man can be deprived of his liberty but by the judgment of his peers were effectually pleaded the early laws of the province prohibited slavery and no subsequent legislation had sanctioned it for although the laws did recognize its existence they did so only to mitigate and modify an admitted evil the present state constitution was established in the first article of the bill of rights prohibited slavery by affirming the foundation truth of our republic that all men are born free and equal the supreme court decided in that no man could hold another as property without a direct violation of that article in three free black citizens of boston were kidnapped and sold into slavery in one of the french islands an intense excitement followed governor hancock took efficient measures for reclaiming the unfortunate men the clergy of boston petitioned the legislature for a total prohibition of the foreign slavetrade the society of friends and the blacks generally presented similar petitions and the same year an act was passed prohibiting the slavetrade and granting relief to persons kidnapped or decoyed out of the commonwealth the fear of a burden to the state from the influx of negroes from abroad led the legislature in connection with this law to prevent those who were not citizens of the state or of other states from gaining a residence the first case of the arrest of a fugitive slave in massachusetts under the law of took place in boston soon after the passage of the law it is the case to which president quincy alludes in his late letter against the fugitive slave law the populace at the trial aided the slave to escape and nothing further was done about it the arrest of george latimer as a slave in boston and his illegal confinement in jail in led to the passage of the law of for the protection of personal liberty prohibiting state officers from arresting or detaining persons claimed as slaves and the use of the jails of the commonwealth for their confinement this law was strictly in accordance with the decision of the supreme judiciary in the case of prigg vs the state of pennsylvania that the reclaiming of fugitives was a matter exclusively belonging to the general government yet that the state officials might if they saw fit carry into effect the law of congress on the subject unless prohibited by state legislation it will be seen by the facts we have adduced that slavery in massachusetts never had a legal existence the ermine of the judiciary of the puritan state has never been sullied by the admission of its detestable claims it crept into the commonwealth like other evils and vices but never succeeded in clothing itself with the sanction and authority of law it stood only upon its own execrable foundation of robbery and wrong with a history like this to look back upon is it strange that the people of massachusetts at the present day are unwilling to see their timehonored defences of personal freedom the good old safeguards of saxon liberty overridden and swept away after the summary fashion of the fugitive slave bill that they should loathe and scorn the task which that bill imposes upon them of aiding professional slavehunters in seizing fettering and consigning to bondage men and women accused only of that which commends them to esteem and sympathy love of liberty and hatred of slavery that they cannot at once adjust themselves to constitutional duties which in south carolina and georgia are reserved for trained bloodhounds surely in view of what massachusetts has been and her strong bias in favor of human freedom derived from her greathearted founders it is to be hoped that the executive and cabinet at washington will grant her some little respite some space for turning some opportunity for conquering her prejudices before letting loose the dogs of war upon her let them give her time and treat with forbearance her hesitation qualms of conscience and wounded pride her people indeed are awkward in the work of slavecatching and it would seem rendered but indifferent service in a late hunt in boston whether they would do better under the surveillance of the army and navy of the united states is a question which we leave with the president and his secretary of state general putnam once undertook to drill a company of quakers and instruct them by force of arms in the art and mystery of fighting but not a single pair of drabcolored breeches moved at his forward march not a broad beaver wheeled at his word of command no hand unclosed to receive a proffered musket patriotic appeal hard swearing and prick of bayonet had no effect upon these impracticable raw recruits and the stout general gave them up in despair we are inclined to believe that any attempt on the part of the commanderinchief of our army and navy to convert the good people of massachusetts into expert slavecatchers under the discipline of west point and norfolk would prove as idle an experiment as that of general putnam upon the quakers thomas carlyle on the slavequestion a late number of frasers magazine contains an article bearing the unmistakable impress of the anglogerman peculiarities of thomas carlyle entitled an occasional discourse on the negro question which would be interesting as a literary curiosity were it not in spirit and tendency so unspeakably wicked as to excite in every rightminded reader a feeling of amazement and disgust with a hard brutal audacity a blasphemous irreverence and a sneering mockery which would do honor to the devil of faust it takes issue with the moral sense of mankind and the precepts of christianity having ascertained that the exports of sugar and spices from the west indies have diminished since emancipation and that the negroes having worked as they believed quite long enough without wages now refuse to work for the planters without higher pay than the latter with the thriftless and evil habits of slavery still clinging to them can afford to give the author considers himself justified in denouncing negro emancipation as one of the shams which he was specially sent into this world to belabor had he confned himself to simple abuse and caricature of the selfdenying and christian abolitionists of england the broadbrimmed philanthropists of exeter hall there would have been small occasion for noticing his splenetic and discreditable production doubtless there is a cant of philanthropy the alloy of human frailty and folly in the most righteous reforms which is a fair subject for the indignant sarcasm of a professed hater of shows and falsities whatever is hollow and hypocritical in politics morals or religion comes very properly within the scope of his mockery and we bid him godspeed in plying his satirical lash upon it impostures and frauds of all kinds deserve nothing better than detection and exposure let him blow them up to his hearts content as daniel did the image of bell and the dragon but our author in this matter of negro slavery has undertaken to apply his explosive pitch and rosin not to the affectation of humanity but to humanity itself he mocks at pity scoffs at all who seek to lessen the amount of pain and suffering sneers at and denies the most sacred rights and mercilessly consigns an entire class of the children of his heavenly father to the doom of compulsory servitude he vituperates the poor black man with a coarse brutality which would do credit to a mississippi slavedriver or a renegade yankee dealer in human cattle on the banks of the potomac his rhetoric has a flavor of the slavepen and auctionblock vulgar unmanly indecent a scandalous outrage upon good taste and refined feeling which at once degrades the author and insults his readers he assumes for he is one of those sublimated philosophers who reject the baconian system of induction and depend upon intuition without recourse to facts and figures that the emancipated class in the west india islands are universally idle improvident and unfit for freedom that god created them to be the servants and slaves of their born lords the white men and designed them to grow sugar coffee and spices for their masters instead of raising pumpkins and yams for themselves and that if they will not do this the beneficent whip should be again employed to compel them he adopts in speaking of the black class the lowest slang of vulgar prejudice black quashee sneers the gentlemanly philosopher black quashee if he will not help in bringing out the spices will get himself made a slave again which state will be a little less ugly than his present one and with beneficent whip since other methods avail not will be compelled to work it is difficult to treat sentiments so atrocious and couched in such offensive language with anything like respect common sense and unperverted conscience revolt instinctively against them the doctrine they inculcate is that which underlies all tyranny and wrong of man towards man it is that under which the creation groaneth and travaileth unto this day it is as old as sin the perpetual argument of strength against weakness of power against right that of the greek philosopher that the barbarians being of an inferior race were born to be slaves to the greeks and of the infidel hobbes that every man being by nature at war with every other man has a perpetual right to reduce him to servitude if he has the power it is the cardinal doctrine of what john quincy adams has very properly styled the satanic school of philosophy the ethics of an old norse sea robber or an arab plunderer of caravans it is as widely removed from the sweet humanities and unselfish benevolence of christianity as the faith and practice of the east india thug or the new zealand cannibal our author does not however take us altogether by surprise he has before given no uncertain intimations of the point towards which his philosophy was tending in his brilliant essay upon francia of paraguay for instance we find him entering with manifest satisfaction and admiration into the details of his heros tyranny in his letters and speeches of oliver cromwell in half a dozen pages of savage and almost diabolical sarcasm directed against the growing humanity of the age the rosepink sentimentalisms and squeamishness which shudders at the sight of blood and infliction of pain he prepares the way for a justification of the massacre of drogheda more recently he has intimated that the extermination of the celtic race is the best way of settling the irish question and that the enslavement and forcible transportation of her poor to labor under armed taskmasters in the colonies is the only rightful and proper remedy for the political and social evils of england in the discourse on negro slavery we see this devilish philosophy in full bloom the gods he tells us are with the strong might has a divine right to rule blessed are the crafty of brain and strong of hand weakness is crime vae victis as brennus said when he threw his sword into the scale woe to the conquered the negro is weaker in intellect than his born lord the white man and has no right to choose his own vocation let the latter do it for him and if need be return to the beneficent whip on the side of the oppressor there is power let him use it without mercy and hold flesh and blood to the grindstone with unrelenting rigor humanity is squeamishness pity for the suffering mere rosepink sentimentalism maudlin and unmanly the gods the old norse gods doubtless laugh to scorn alike the complaints of the miserable and the weak compassions and philanthropisms of those who would relieve them this is the substance of thomas carlyles advice this is the matured fruit of his philosophic husbandry the grand result for which he has been all his life sounding unfathomable abysses or beating about in the thin air of transcendentalism such is the substitute which he offers us for the sermon on the mount he tells us that the blacks have no right to use the islands of the west indies for growing pumpkins and garden stuffs for their own use and behoof because but for the wisdom and skill of the whites these islands would have been productive only of jungle savagery and swamp malaria the negro alone could never have improved the islands or civilized himself and therefore their and his born lord the white man has a right to the benefits of his own betterments of land and twolegged cattle black quashee has no right to dispose of himself and his labor because he owes his partial civilization to others and pray how has it been with the white race for whom our philosopher claims the divine prerogative of enslaving some twenty and odd centuries ago a pair of halfnaked savages daubed with paint might have been seen roaming among the hills and woods of the northern part of the british island subsisting on acorns and the flesh of wild animals with an occasional relish of the smoked hams and pickled fingers of some unfortunate stranger caught on the wrong side of the tweed this interesting couple reared as they best could a family of children who in turn became the heads of families and some time about the beginning of the present century one of their descendants in the borough of ecclefechan rejoiced over the birth of a man child now somewhat famous as thomas carlyle a maker of books does it become such a one to rave against the west india negros incapacity for selfcivilization unaided by the arts sciences and refinements of the romans he might have been at this very day squatted on his naked haunches in the woods of ecclefechan painting his weatherhardened epidermis in the sun like his piet ancestors where in fact can we look for unaided selfimprovement and spontaneous internal development to any considerable extent on the part of any nation or people from people to people the original godgiven impulse towards civilization and perfection has been transmitted as from egypt to greece and thence to the roman world but the blacks we are told are indolent and insensible to the duty of raising sugar and coffee and spice for the whites being mainly careful to provide for their own household and till their own gardens for domestic comforts and necessaries the exports have fallen off somewhat and what does this prove only that the negro is now a consumer of products of which under the rule of the whip he was a producer merely as to indolence under the proper stimulus of fair wages we have reason to believe that the charge is not sustained if unthrifty habits and lack of prudence on the part of the owners of estates combined with the repeal of duties on foreign sugars by the british government have placed it out of their power to pay just and reasonable wages for labor who can blame the blacks if they prefer to cultivate their own garden plots rather than raise sugar and spice for their late masters upon terms little better than those of their old condition the beneficent whip always excepted the despatches of the colonial governors agree in admitting that the blacks have had great cause for complaint and dissatisfaction owing to the delay or nonpayment of their wages sir c e gray writing from jamaica says that in a good many instances the payment of the wages they have earned has been either very irregularly made or not at all probably on account of the inability of the employers he says moreover the negroes appear to me to be generally as free from rebellious tendencies or turbulent feelings and malicious thoughts as any race of laborers i ever saw or heard of my impression is indeed that under a system of perfectly fair dealing and of real justice they will come to be an admirable peasantry and yeomanry ablebodied industrious and hardworking frank and welldisposed it must indeed be admitted that judging by their diminished exports and the growing complaints of the owners of estates the condition of the islands in a financial point of view is by no means favorable an immediate cause of this however must be found in the unfortunate sugar act of the more remote but for the most part powerful cause of the present depression is to be traced to the vicious and unnatural system of slavery which has been gradually but surely preparing the way for ruin bankruptcy and demoralization never yet by a community or an individual have the righteous laws of god been violated with impunity sooner or later comes the penalty which the infinite justice has affixed to sin partial and temporary evils and inconveniences have undoubtedly resulted from the emancipation of the laborers and many years must elapse before the relations of the two heretofore antagonistic classes can be perfectly adjusted and their interests brought into entire harmony but that freedom is not to be held mainly accountable for the depression of the british colonies is obvious from the fact that dutch surinam where the old system of slavery remains in its original rigor is in an equally depressed condition the paramaribo neuws en advertentie blad quoted in the jamaica gazette says under date of january around us we hear nothing but complaints people seek and find matter in everything to picture to themselves the lot of the place in which they live as bitterer than that of any other country of a large number of flourishing plantations few remain that can now be called such so deteriorated has property become within the last few years that many of these estates have not been able to defray their weekly expenses the colony stands on the brink of a yawning abyss into which it must inevitably plunge unless some new and better system is speedily adopted it is impossible that our agriculture can any longer proceed on its old footing our laboring force is dying away and the social position they held must undergo a revolution the paper from which we have quoted the official journal of the colony thinks the condition of the emancipated british colonies decidedly preferable to that of surinam where the old slave system has continued in force and insists that the dutch government must follow the example of great britain the actual condition of the british colonies since emancipation is perfectly well known in surinam three of them essequibo demerara and berbice being its immediate neighbors whatever evils and inconveniences have resuited from emancipation must be well understood by the dutch slaveholders yet we find them looking towards emancipation as the only prospect of remedy for the greater evils of their own system this fact is of itself a sufficient answer to the assumption of carlyle and others that what they call the ruin of the colonies has been produced by the emancipation acts of and we have no fears whatever of the effect of this literary monstrosity which we have been considering upon the british colonies quashee black and ignorant as he may be will not get himself made a slave again the mission of the beneficent whip is there pretty well over and it may now find its place in museums and cabinets of ghastly curiosities with the racks pillories thumbscrews and brandingirons of old days what we have feared however is that the advocates and defenders of slaveholding in this country might find in this discourse matter of encouragement and that our antichristian prejudices against the colored man might be strengthened and confirmed by its malignant vituperation and sarcasm on this point we have sympathized with the forebodings of an eloquent writer in the london enquirer we cannot imagine a more deadly moral poison for the american people than his carlyles last composition every cruel practice of social exclusion will derive from it new sharpness and venom the slaveholder of course will exult to find himself not apologized for but enthusiastically cheered upheld and glorified by a writer of european celebrity but it is not merely the slave who will feel mr carlyles hand in the torture of his flesh the riveting of his fetters and the denial of light to his mind the free black will feel him too in the more contemptuous and abhorrent scowl of his brother man who will easily derive from this unfortunate essay the belief that his inhuman feelings are of divine ordination it is a true work of the devil the fostering of a tyrannical prejudice far and wide over space and long into the future the winged words of evil counsel will go in the marketplace in the house in the theatre and in the church by land and by sea in all the haunts of men their influence will be felt in a perennial growth of hate and scorn and suffering and resentment amongst the sufferers will be many to whom education has given every refined susceptibility that makes contempt and exclusion bitter men and women faithful and diligent loving and worthy to be loved and bearing it may be no more than an almost imperceptible trace of african descent will continue yet longer to be banished from the social meal of the white man and to be spurned from his presence in the house of god because a writer of genius has lent the weight of his authority and his fame if not of his power to the perpetuation of a prejudice which christianity was undermining a more recent production latter day pamphlets in which mans capability of selfgovernment is more than doubted democracy somewhat contemptuously sneered at and the model republic itself stigmatized as a nation of bores may have a salutary effect in restraining our admiration and in lessening our respect for the defender and eulogist of slavery the sweeping impartiality with which in this latter production he applies the principle of our peculiar institution to the laboring poor man irrespective of color recognizing as his only inalienable right the right of being set to labor for his born lords will we imagine go far to neutralize the mischief of his discourse upon negro slavery it is a sad thing to find so much intellectual power as carlyle really possesses so little under the control of the moral sentiments in some of his earlier writings as for instance his beautiful tribute to the corn law rhymer we thought we saw evidence of a warm and generous sympathy with the poor and the wronged a desire to ameliorate human suffering which would have done credit to the philanthropisms of exeter hall and the abolition of pain society latterly however like molieres quack he has changed all that his heart has got upon the wrong side or rather he seems to us very much in the condition of the coalburner in the german tale who had swapped his heart of flesh for a cobblestone formation of the american antislavery society a letter to william lloyd garrison president of the society amesbury th th mo my dear friend i have received thy kind letter with the accompanying circular inviting me to attend the commemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the formation of the american antislavery society at philadelphia it is with the deepest regret that i am compelled by the feeble state of my health to give up all hope of meeting thee and my other old and dear friends on an occasion of so much interest how much it costs me to acquiesce in the hard necessity thy own feelings will tell thee better than any words of mine i look back over thirty years and call to mind all the circumstances of my journey to philadelphia in company with thyself and the excellent dr thurston of maine even then as we thought an old man but still living and true as ever to the good cause i recall the early gray morning when with samuel j may our colleague on the committee to prepare a declaration of sentiments for the convention i climbed to the small upper chamber of a colored friend to hear thee read the first draft of a paper which will live as long as our national history i see the members of the convention solemnized by the responsibility rise one by one and solemnly affix their names to that stern pledge of fidelity to freedom of the signers many have passed away from earth a few have faltered and turned back but i believe the majority still live to rejoice over the great triumph of truth and justice and to devote what remains of time and strength to the cause to which they consecrated their youth and manhood thirty years ago for while we may well thank god and congratulate one another on the prospect of the speedy emancipation of the slaves of the united states we must not for a moment forget that from this hour new and mighty responsibilities devolve upon us to aid direct and educate these millions left free indeed but bewildered ignorant naked and foodless in the wild chaos of civil war we have to undo the accumulated wrongs of two centuries to remake the manhood which slavery has wellnigh unmade to see to it that the longoppressed colored man has a fair field for development and improvement and to tread under our feet the last vestige of that hateful prejudice which has been the strongest external support of southern slavery we must lift ourselves at once to the true christian altitude where all distinctions of black and white are overlooked in the heartfelt recognition of the brotherhood of man i must not close this letter without confessing that i cannot be sufficiently thankful to the divine providence which in a great measure through thy instrumentality turned me away so early from what roger williams calls the worlds great trinity pleasure profit and honor to take side with the poor and oppressed i am not insensible to literary reputation i love perhaps too well the praise and goodwill of my fellowmen but i set a higher value on my name as appended to the antislavery declaration of than on the titlepage of any book looking over a life marked by many errors and shortcomings i rejoice that i have been able to maintain the pledge of that signature and that in the long intervening years my voice though not the loudest has been heard wherever freedom raised her cry of pain let me through thee extend a warm greeting to the friends whether of our own or the new generation who may assemble on the occasion of commemoration there is work yet to be done which will task the best efforts of us all for thyself i need not say that the love and esteem of early boyhood have lost nothing by the test of time and i am very cordially thy friend john g whittier the lesson and our duty from the amesbury villager in the assassination of abraham lincoln and the unspeakably brutal assault upon secretary seward slavery has made another revelation of itself perhaps it was needed in the magnanimity of assured victory we were perhaps disposed to overlook not so much the guilty leaders and misguided masses of the great rebellion as the unutterable horror and sin of slavery which prompted it how slowly we of the north have learned the true character of this mighty mischief how our politicians bowed their strong shoulders under its burthens how our churches reverenced it how our clergy contrasted the heresytolerating north with the purely orthodox and scriptural type of slaveholding christianity how all classes hunted down not merely the fugitive slave but the few who ventured to give him food and shelter and a godspeed in his flight from bondage how utterly ignored was the negros claim of common humanity how readily was the decision of the slaveholding chief justice acquiesced in that the black man had no rights which the white man is bound to respect we saw a senator of the united states worldknown and honored for his learning talents and stainless integrity beaten down and all but murdered at his official desk by a south carolina slaveholder for the crime of speaking against the extension of slavery and we heard the dastardly deed applauded throughout the south while its brutal perpetrator was rewarded with orations and gifts and smiles of beauty as a chivalrous gentleman we saw slavery enter kansas with bowieknife in hand and curses on its lips we saw the life of the union struck at by secession and rebellion we heard of the bones of sons and brothers fallen in defence of freedom and law dug up and wrought into ornaments for the wrists and bosoms of slaveholding women we looked into the open hell of andersonville upon the deliberate systematic starvation of helpless prisoners we heard of libby prison underlaid with gunpowder for the purpose of destroying thousands of union prisoners in case of the occupation of richmond by our army we saw hundreds of prisoners massacred in cold blood at fort pillow and the midnight sack of lawrence and the murder of its principal citizens the flames of our merchant vessels seized by pirates lighted every sea we heard of officers of the rebel army and navy stealing into our cities firing hotels filled with sleeping occupants and laying obstructions on the track of rail cars for the purpose of killing and mangling their passengers yet in spite of these revelations of the utterly barbarous character of slavery and its direful effect upon all connected with it we were on the very point of trusting to its most criminal defenders the task of reestablishing the state governments of the south leaving the real union men white as well as black at the mercy of those who have made hatred a religion and murder a sacrament the nation needed one more terrible lesson it has it in the murder of its beloved chief magistrate and the attempted assassination of its honored prime minister the two men of all others prepared to go farthest to smooth the way of defeated rebellion back to allegiance even now the lesson of these terrible events seems but half learned in the public utterances i hear much of punishing and hanging leading traitors fierce demands for vengeance and threats of the summary chastisement of domestic sympathizers with treason but comparatively little is said of the accursed cause the prolific mother of abominations slavery the government is exhorted to remember that it does not bear the sword in vain the old testament is ransacked for texts of oriental hatred and examples of the revenges of a semibarbarous nation but as respects the four millions of unmistakably loyal people of the south the patient the longsuffering kindhearted victims of oppressions only here and there a voice pleads for their endowment with the same rights of citizenship which are to be accorded to the rank and file of disbanded rebels the golden rule of the sermon on the mount is not applied to them much is said of executing justice upon rebels little of justice to loyal black men hanging a few ringleaders of treason it seems to be supposed is all that is needed to restore and reestablish the revolted states the negro is to be left powerless in the hands of the white trash who hate him with a bitter hatred exceeding that of the large slaveholders in short four years of terrible chastisement of gods unmistakable judgments have not taught us as a people their lesson which could scarcely be plainer if it had been written in letters of fire on the sky why is it that we are so slow to learn so unwilling to confess that slavery is the accursed thing which whets the knife of murder and transforms men with the exterior of gentlemen and christians into fiends how pitiful is our exultation over the capture of the wretched booth and his associates the great criminal of whom he and they were but paltry instruments still stalks abroad in the pine woods of jersey where the state has thrown around him her legislative sanction and protection he is in pennsylvania thrusting the black man from public conveyances wherever gods children are despised insulted and abused on account of their color there is the real assassin of the president still at large i do not wonder at the indignation which has been awakened by the late outrage for i have painfully shared it but let us see to it that it is rightly directed the hanging of a score of southern traitors will not restore abraham lincoln nor atone for the mighty loss in wreaking revenge upon these miserable men we must see to it that we do not degrade ourselves and do dishonor to the sacred memory of the dead we do well to be angry and if need be let our wrath wax seven times hotter until that which was a murderer from the beginning is consumed from the face of the earth as the people stand by the grave of lincoln let them lift their right hands to heaven and take a solemn vow upon their souls to give no sleep to their eyes nor slumber to their eyelids until slavery is hunted from its last shelter and every man black and white stands equal before the law in dealing with the guilty leaders and instigators of the rebellion we should beware how we take counsel of passion hatred has no place beside the calm and awful dignity of justice human life is still a very sacred thing christian forbearance and patience are still virtues for my own part i should be satisfied to see the chiefs of the great treason go out from among us homeless exiled with the mark of cain on their foreheads carrying with them wherever they go the avenging nemesis of conscience we cannot take lessons at this late day in their school of barbarism we cannot starve and torture them as they have starved and tortured our soldiers let them live perhaps that is after all the most terrible penalty for wherever they hide themselves the story of their acts will pursue them they can have no rest nor peace save in that deep repentance which through the mercy of god is possible for all i have no disposition to stand between these men and justice if arrested they can have no claim to exemption from the liabilities of criminals but it is not simply a question of deserts that is to be considered we are to take into account our own reputation as a christian people the wishes of our best friends abroad and the humane instincts of the age which forbid all unnecessary severity happily we are not called upon to take counsel of our fears rabbinical writers tell us that evil spirits who are once baffled in a contest with human beings lose from thenceforth all power of further mischief the defeated rebels are in the precise condition of these jewish demons deprived of slavery they are like wasps that have lost their stings as respects the misguided masses of the south the shattered and crippled remnants of the armies of treason the desolate wives mothers and children mourning for dear ones who have fallen in a vain and hopeless struggle it seems to me our duty is very plain we must forgive their past treason and welcome and encourage their returning loyalty none but cowards will insult and taunt the defeated and defenceless we must feed and clothe the destitute instruct the ignorant and bearing patiently with the bitterness and prejudice which will doubtless for a time thwart our efforts and misinterpret our motives aid them in rebuilding their states on the foundation of freedom our sole enemy was slavery and slavery is dead we have now no quarrel with the people of the south who have really more reason than we have to rejoice over the downfall of a system which impeded their material progress perverted their religion shut them out from the sympathies of the world and ridged their land with the graves of its victims we are victors the cause of all this evil and suffering is removed forever and we can well afford to be magnanimous how better can we evince our gratitude to god for his great mercy than in doing good to those who hated us and in having compassion on those who have despitefully used us the hour is hastening for us all when our sole ground of dependence will be the mercy and forgiveness of god let us endeavor so to feel and act in our relations to the people of the south that we can repeat in sincerity the prayer of our lord forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us reverently acknowledging that he has indeed led captivity captive and received gifts for men yea for the rebellious also that the lord god might dwell among them charles sumner and the statedepartment the wise reticence of the president elect in the matter of his cabinet has left free course to speculation and conjecture as to its composition that he fully comprehends the importance of the subject and that he will carefully weigh the claims of the possible candidates on the score of patriotic services ability and fitness for specific duties no one who has studied his character and witnessed his discretion clear insight and wise adaptation of means to ends under the mighty responsibilities of his past career can reasonably doubt it is not probable that the distinguished statesman now at the head of the state department will under the circumstances look for a continuance in office history will do justice to his eminent services in the senate and in the cabinet during the first years of the rebellion but the fact that he has to some extent shared the unpopularity of the present chief magistrate seems to preclude the idea of his retention in the new cabinet in looking over the list of our public men in search of a successor general grant is not likely to be embarrassed by the number of individuals fitted by nature culture and experience for such an important post the newspaper press in its wide license of conjecture and suggestion has as far as i have seen mentioned but three or four names in this connection allusions have been made to senator fessenden of maine exminister motley general dix exsecretary stanton and charles sumner of massachusetts without disparaging in any degree his assumed competitors the lastnamed gentleman is unquestionably preeminently fitted for the place he has had a lifelong education for it the entire cast of his mind the bent of his studies the habit and experience of his public life his profound knowledge of international law and the diplomatic history of his own and other countries his wellearned reputation as a statesman and constitutional lawyer not only at home but wherever our country has relations of amity and commerce the honorable distinction which he enjoys of having held a foremost place in the great conflict between freedom and slavery union and rebellion all mark him as the man for the occasion there seems indeed a certain propriety in assigning to the man who struck the heaviest blows at secession and slavery in the national senate the first place under him who in the field made them henceforth impossible the great captain and the great senator united in war should not be dissevered in peace i am not unaware that there are some even in the republican party who have failed to recognize in senator sumner the really wise and practical statesmanship which a careful review of his public labors cannot but make manifest it is only necessary to point such to the open record of his senatorial career few men have had the honor of introducing and defending with exhaustive ability and thoroughness so many measures of acknowledged practical importance to his immediate constituents the country at large and the wider interests of humanity and civilization in what exigency has he been found wanting what legislative act of public utility for the last eighteen years has lacked his encouragement at the head of the committee on foreign affairs his clearness of vision firmness moderation and ready comprehension of the duties of his time and place must be admitted by all parties it was shrewdly said by burke that men are wise with little reflection and good with little selfdenial in business of all times except their own but charles sumner the scholar loving the still air of delightful studies has shown himself as capable of thoroughly comprehending and digesting the events transpiring before his eyes as of pronouncing judgment upon those recorded in history far in advance of most of his contemporaries he saw and enunciated the true doctrine of reconstruction the early adoption of which would have been of incalculable service to the country one of the ablest statesmen and jurists of the democratic party has had the rare magnanimity to acknowledge that in this matter the republican senator was right and himself and his party wrong the republicans of massachusetts will make no fractious or importunate demand upon the new president they are content to leave to his unbiased and impartial judgment the selection of his cabinet but if looking to the best interests of the country he shall see fit to give their distinguished fellowcitizen the first place in it they will feel no solicitude as to the manner in which the duties of the office will be discharged they will feel that the tools are with him who can use them nothing more directly affects the reputation of a country than the character of its diplomatic correspondence and its foreign representatives we have suffered in times past from sad mismanagement abroad and intelligent americans have too often been compelled to hang their heads with shame to see the flag of their country floating over the consular offices of worthless incompetent agents there can be no question that so far as they are entrusted to senator sumners hands the interest honor and dignity of the nation will be safe in a few weeks charles summer will be returned for his fourth term in the united states senate by the wellnigh unanimous vote of both branches of the legislature of massachusetts not a syllable of opposition to his reelection is heard from any quarter there is not a republican in the legislature who could have been elected unless he had been virtually pledged to his support no stronger evidence of the popular estimate of his ability and integrity than this could be offered as a matter of course the marked individuality of his intense convictions earnestness persistence and confident reliance upon the justice of his conclusions naturally growing out of the consciousness of having brought to his honest search after truth all the lights of his learning and experience may at times have brought him into unpleasant relations with some of his colleagues but no one friend or foe has questioned his ability and patriotism or doubted his fidelity to principle he has lent himself to no schemes of greed while so many others have taken advantage of the facilities of their official stations to fill directly or indirectly their own pockets or those of their relatives and retainers it is to the honor of massachusetts that her representatives in the senate have not only shaken their hands from the holding of bribes but have so borne themselves that no shadow of suspicion has ever rested on them in this connection it may be proper to state that in the event of a change in the war department the claims of general wilson to whose services in the committee on military affairs the country is deeply indebted may be brought under consideration in that case massachusetts would not if it were in her power discriminate between her senators both have deserved well of her and of the country in expressing thus briefly my opinion i do not forget that after all the choice and responsibility rest with general grant alone there i am content to leave them i am very far from urging any sectional claim let the country but have peace after its long discord let its good faith and financial credit be sustained and all classes of its citizens everywhere protected in person and estate and it matters very little to me whether massachusetts is represented at the executive council board or not personally charles sumner would gain nothing by a transfer from the senate chamber to the state department he does not need a place in the american cabinet any more than john bright does in the british the highest ambition might well be satisfied with his present position from which looking back upon an honorable record he might be justified in using miltons language of lofty confidence in the reply to salmasius i am not one who has disgraced beauty of sentiment by deformity of conduct or the maxims of a freeman by the actions of a slave but by the grace of god i have kept my life unsullied the presidential election of the following letter was written on receiving a request from a committee of colored voters for advice as to their action at the presidential election of amesbury th mo d dear friends i have just received your letter of the th ult asking my opinion of your present duty as colored voters in the choice between general grant and horace greeley for the presidency you state that you have been confused by the contradictory advice given you by such friends of your people as charles sumner on one hand and william l garrison and wendell phillips on the other and you ask me as one whom you are pleased to think free from all bias to add my counsel to theirs i thank you for the very kind expression of your confidence and your generous reference to my endeavors to serve the cause of freedom but i must own that i would fain have been spared the necessity of adding to the already too long list of political epistles i have felt it my duty in times past to take an active part often very distasteful to me in political matters having for my first object the deliverance of my country from the crime and curse of slavery that great question being now settled forever i have been more than willing to leave to younger and stronger hands the toils and the honors of partisan service pained and saddened by the bitter and unchristian personalities of the canvass now in progress i have hitherto held myself aloof from it as far as possible unwilling to sanction in the slightest degree the criminations and recriminations of personal friends whom i have every reason to love and respect and in whose integrity i have unshaken confidence in the present condition of affairs i have not been able to see that any special action as an abolitionist was required at my hands both of the great parties heretofore widely separated have put themselves on substantially the same platform the republican party originally pledged only to the nonextension of slavery and whose most illustrious representative president lincoln avowed his willingness to save the union without abolishing slavery has been under providence mainly instrumental in the total overthrow of the detestable system while the democratic party composed largely of slaveholders and even at the north scarcely willing to save the union at the expense of the slave interest upon which its success depended shattered and crippled by the civil war and its results has at last yielded to the inexorable logic of events abandoned a position no longer tenable and taken its new departure with an abolitionist as its candidate as a friend of the longoppressed colored man and for the sake of the peace and prosperity of the country i rejoice at this action of the democratic party the underlying motives of this radical change are doubtless somewhat mixed and contradictory honest conviction on the part of some and party expediency and desire of office on the part of others but the change itself is real and irrevocable the penalty of receding would be swift and irretrievable ruin in any point of view the new order of things is desirable and nothing more fully illustrates the ways that are dark and the tricks that are vain of party politics than the attempt of professed friends of the union and equal rights for all to counteract it by giving aid and comfort to a revival of the worst characteristics of the old party in the shape of a straightout democratic convention as respects the candidates now before us i can see no good reason why colored voters as such should oppose general grant who though not an abolitionist and not even a member of the republican party previous to his nomination has faithfully carried out the laws of congress in their behalf nor on the other hand can i see any just grounds for distrust of such a man as horace greeley who has so nobly distinguished himself as the advocate of human rights irrespective of race or color and who by the instrumentality of his press has been for thirty years the educator of the people in the principles of justice temperance and freedom both of these men have in different ways deserved too well of the country to be unnecessarily subjected to the brutalities of a presidential canvass and so far as they are personally concerned it would doubtless have been better if the one had declined a second term of uncongenial duties and the other continued to indite words of wisdom in the shades of chappaqua but they have chosen otherwise and i am willing for one to leave my colored fellowcitizens to the unbiased exercise of their own judgment and instincts in deciding between them the democratic party labors under the disadvantage of antecedents not calculated to promote a rapid growth of confidence and it is no matter of surprise that the vote of the emancipated class is likely to be largely against it but if as will doubtless be the case that vote shall be to some extent divided between the two candidates it will have the effect of inducing politicians of the rival parties to treat with respect and consideration this new element of political power from selfinterest if from no higher motive the fact that at this time both parties are welcoming colored orators to their platforms and that in the south old slavemasters and their former slaves fraternize at caucus and barbecue and vote for each other at the polls is full of significance if in new england the very men who thrust frederick douglass from car and stagecoach and mobbed and hunted him like a wild beast now crowd to shake his hand and cheer him let us not despair of seeing even the kuklux tarried into decency and sitting clothed in their right minds as listeners to their former victims the colored man is today the master of his own destiny no power on earth can deprive him of his rights as an american citizen and it is in the light of american citizenship that i choose to regard my colored friends as men having a common stake in the welfare of the country mingled with and not separate from their white fellowcitizens not herded together as a distinct class to be wielded by others without selfdependence and incapable of selfdetermination thanks to such men as sumner and wilson and their compeers nearly all that legislation can do for them has already been done we can now only help them to help themselves industry economy temperance selfculture education for their children these things indispensable to their elevation and progress are in a great measure in their own hands you will therefore my friends and fellowcitizens pardon me if i decline to undertake to decide for you the question of your political duty as respects the candidates for the presidency a question which you have probably already settled in your own minds if it had been apparent to me that your rights and liberties were really in danger from the success of either candidate your letter would not have been needed to call forth my opinion in the long struggle of wellnigh forty years i can honestly say that no consideration of private interest nor my natural love of peace and retirement and the goodwill of others have kept me silent when a word could be fitly spoken for human rights i have not so long acted with the class to which you belong without acquiring respect for your intelligence and capacity for judging wisely for yourselves i shall abide your decision with confidence and cheerfully acquiesce in it if on the whole you prefer to vote for the reelection of general grant let me hope you will do so without joining with eleventhhour friends in denouncing and reviling such an old and tried friend as charles sumner who has done and suffered so much in your behalf if on the other hand some of you decide to vote for horace greeley you need not in so doing forget your great obligations to such friends as william lloyd garrison wendell phillips and lydia maria child agree or disagree with them take their advice or reject it but stand by them still and teach the parties with which you are connected to respect your feelings towards your benefactors the censure of sumner a letter to the boston daily advertiser in reference to the petition for the rescinding of the resolutions censuring senator sumner for his motion to erase from the united states flags the record of the battles of the civil war i beg leave to occupy a small space in the columns of the advertiser for the purpose of noticing a charge which has been brought against the petitioners for rescinding the resolutions of the late extra session virtually censuring the hon charles sumner it is intimated that the action of these petitioners evinces a lack of appreciation of the services of the soldiers of the union and that not to censure charles sumner is to censure the volunteers of massachusetts as a matter of fact the petitioners express no opinion as to the policy or expediency of the senators proposition some may believe it not only right in itself but expedient and welltimed others that it was inexpedient or premature none doubt that sooner or later the thing which it contemplates must be done if we are to continue a united people what they feel and insist upon is that the proposition is one which implies no disparagement of the soldiers of massachusetts and the union that it neither receives nor merits the unqualified condemnation of the people of the state and that it furnishes no ground whatever for legislative interference or censure a single glance at the names of the petitioners is a sufficient answer to the insinuation that they are unmindful of that selfsacrifice and devotion the marble and granite memorials of which dotting the state from the merrimac to the connecticut testify the gratitude of the loyal heart of massachusetts i have seen no soldier yet who considered himself wronged or insulted by the proposition in point of fact the soldiers have never asked for such censure of the brave and loyal statesman who was the bosom friend and confidant of secretary stanton the great warminister second if at all only to carnot and of john a andrew dear to the heart of every massachusetts soldier and whose tender care and sympathy reached them wherever they struggled or died for country and freedom the proposal of senator sumner instead of being an insult was in fact the highest compliment which could be paid to brave men for it implied that they cherished no vindictive hatred of fallen foes that they were too proudly secure of the love and gratitude of their countrymen to need above their heads the flaunting blazon of their achievements that they were as magnanimous in peace and victory as they were heroic and patient through the dark and doubtful arbitrament of war as such they understand it i should be sorry to think there existed a single son of massachusetts weak enough to believe that his reputation and honor as a soldier needed this censure of charles sumner i have before me letters from men ranking from orderly sergeant to general who have looked at death full in the face on every battlefield where the flag of massachusetts floated and they all thank me for my efforts to rescind this uncalledfor censure and pledge me their hearty support they cordially indorse the noble letter of vicepresident wilson offering his signature to the petition for rescinding the obnoxious resolutions and if these resolutions are not annulled it will not be the fault of massachusetts volunteers but rather of the mistaken zeal of men more familiar with the drill of the caucus than with that of the camp i am no blind partisan of charles sumner i have often differed from him in opinion i regretted deeply the position which he thought it his duty to take during the late presidential campaign he felt the atmosphere about him thick and foul with corruption and bribery and greed he saw the treasury ringed about like saturn with unscrupulous combinations and corporations and it is to be regretted more than wondered at if he struck out wildly in his indignation and that his blows fell sometimes upon the wrong object but i did not intend to act the part of his apologist the twenty years of his senatorial life are crowded with memorials of his loyalty to truth and free dom and humanity which will be enduring as our history he is no party to this movement in which my name has been more prominent than i could have wished and no word of his prompted or suggested it from its inception to the present time he has remained silent in his chamber of pain waiting to bequeath like the testator of the dramatist a fame by scandal untouched to memory and times old daughter truth he can well afford to wait and the issue of the present question before our legislature is of far less consequence to him than to us to use the words of one who stood by him in the dark days of the fugitive slave law the chief justice of the united states time and the wiser thought will vindicate the illustrious statesman to whom massachusetts the country and humanity owe so much but the state can ill afford the damage to its own reputation which such a censure of such a man will inflict amesbury d month the antislavery convention of in the gray twilight of a chill day of late november forty years ago a dear friend of mine residing in boston made his appearance at the old farmhouse in east haverhill he had been deputed by the abolitionists of the city william l garrison samuel e sewall and others to inform me of my appointment as a delegate to the convention about to be held in philadelphia for the formation of an american antislavery society and to urge upon me the necessity of my attendance few words of persuasion however were needed i was unused to travelling my life had been spent on a secluded farm and the journey mostly by stagecoach at that time was really a formidable one moreover the few abolitionists were everywhere spoken against their persons threatened and in some instances a price set on their heads by southern legislators pennsylvania was on the borders of slavery and it needed small effort of imagination to picture to ones self the breaking up of the convention and maltreatment of its members this latter consideration i do not think weighed much with me although i was better prepared for serious danger than for anything like personal indignity i had read governor trumbulls description of the tarring and feathering of his hero macfingal when after the application of the melted tar the featherbed was ripped open and shaken over him until not maias son with wings for ears such plumes about his visage wears nor miltons sixwinged angel gathers such superfluity of feathers and i confess i was quite unwilling to undergo a martyrdom which my best friends could scarcely refrain from laughing at but a summons like that of garrisons bugleblast could scarcely be unheeded by one who from birth and education held fast the traditions of that earlier abolitionism which under the lead of benezet and woolman had effaced from the society of friends every vestige of slaveholding i had thrown myself with a young mans fervid enthusiasm into a movement which commended itself to my reason and conscience to my love of country and my sense of duty to god and my fellowmen my first venture in authorship was the publication at my own expense in the spring of of a pamphlet entitled justice and expediency on the moral and political evils of slavery and the duty of emancipation under such circumstances i could not hesitate but prepared at once for my journey it was necessary that i should start on the morrow and the intervening time with a small allowance for sleep was spent in providing for the care of the farm and homestead during my absence so the next morning i took the stage for boston stopping at the ancient hostelry known as the eastern stage tavern and on the day following in company with william lloyd garrison i left for new york at that city we were joined by other delegates among them david thurston a congregational minister from maine on our way to philadelphia we took as a matter of necessary economy a secondclass conveyance and found ourselves in consequence among rough and hilarious companions whose language was more noteworthy for strength than refinement our worthy friend the clergyman bore it awhile in painful silence but at last felt it his duty to utter words of remonstrance and admonition the leader of the young roisterers listened with a ludicrous mock gravity thanked him for his exhortation and expressing fears that the extraordinary effort had exhausted his strength invited him to take a drink with him father thurston buried his grieved face in his cloakcollar and wisely left the young reprobates to their own devices on reaching philadelphia we at once betook ourselves to the humble dwelling on fifth street occupied by evan lewis a plain earnest man and lifelong abolitionist who had been largely interested in preparing the way for the convention in one respect the time of our assembling seemed unfavorable the society of friends upon whose cooperation we had counted had but recently been rent asunder by one of those unhappy controversies which so often mark the decline of practical righteousness the martyrage of the society had passed wealth and luxury had taken the place of the old simplicity there was a growing conformity to the maxims of the world in trade and fashion and with it a corresponding unwillingness to hazard respectability by the advocacy of unpopular reforms unprofitable speculation and disputation on one hand and a vain attempt on the other to enforce uniformity of opinion had measurably lost sight of the fact that the end of the gospel is love and that charity is its crowning virtue after a long and painful struggle the disruption had taken place the shattered fragments under the name of orthodox and hicksite so like and yet so separate in feeling confronted each other as hostile sects and never either found another to free the hollow heart from paining they stood aloof the scars remaining like cliffs that have been torn asunder a dreary sea now flows between but neither rain nor frost nor thunder can wholly do away i ween the marks of that which once has been we found about forty members assembled in the parlors of our friend lewis and after some general conversation lewis tappan was asked to preside over an informal meeting preparatory to the opening of the convention a handsome intellectuallooking man in the prime of life responded to the invitation and in a clear wellmodulated voice the firm tones of which inspired hope and confidence stated the objects of our preliminary council and the purpose which had called us together in earnest and wellchosen words in making arrangements for the convention it was thought expedient to secure if possible the services of some citizen of philadelphia of distinction and high social standing to preside over its deliberations looking round among ourselves in vain for some titled civilian or doctor of divinity we were fain to confess that to outward seeming we were but a feeble folk sorely needing the shield of a popular name a committee of which i was a member was appointed to go in search of a president of this description we visited two prominent gentlemen known as friendly to emancipation and of high social standing they received us with the dignified courtesy of the old school declined our proposition in civil terms and bowed us out with a cool politeness equalled only by that of the senior winkle towards the unlucky deputation of pickwick and his unprepossessing companions as we left their doors we could not refrain from smiling in each others faces at the thought of the small inducement our proffer of the presidency held out to men of their class evidently our company was not one for respectability to march through coventry with on the following morning we repaired to the adelphi building on fifth street below walnut which had been secured for our use sixtytwo delegates were found to be in attendance beriah green of the oneida new york institute was chosen president a freshfaced sandyhaired rather commonlooking man but who had the reputation of an able and eloquent speaker he had already made himself known to us as a resolute and selfsacrificing abolitionist lewis tappan and myself took our places at his side as secretaries on the elevation at the west end of the hall looking over the assembly i noticed that it was mainly composed of comparatively young men some in middle age and a few beyond that period they were nearly all plainly dressed with a view to comfort rather than elegance many of the faces turned towards me wore a look of expectancy and suppressed enthusiasm all had the earnestness which might be expected of men engaged in an enterprise beset with difficulty and perhaps with peril the fine intellectual head of garrison prematurely bald was conspicuous the sunnyfaced young man at his side in whom all the beatitudes seemed to find expression was samuel j may mingling in his veins the best blood of the sewalls and quincys a man so exceptionally pure and largehearted so genial tender and loving that he could be faithful to truth and duty without making an enemy the deil wad look into his face and swear he couldna wrang him that tall gaunt swarthy man erect eaglefaced upon whose somewhat martial figure the quaker coat seemed a little out of place was lindley coates known in all eastern pennsylvania as a stern enemy of slavery that slight eager man intensely alive in every feature and gesture was thomas shipley who for thirty years had been the protector of the free colored people of philadelphia and whose name was whispered reverently in the slave cabins of maryland as the friend of the black man one of a class peculiar to old quakerism who in doing what they felt to be duty and walking as the light within guided them knew no fear and shrank from no sacrifice braver men the world has not known beside him differing in creed but united with him in works of love and charity sat thomas whitson of the hicksite school of friends fresh from his farm in lancaster county dressed in plainest homespun his tall form surmounted by a shock of unkempt hair the odd obliquity of his vision contrasting strongly with he clearness and directness of his spiritual insight elizur wright the young professor of a western college who had lost his place by his bold advocacy of freedom with a look of sharp concentration in keeping with an intellect keen as a damascus blade closely watched the proceedings through his spectacles opening his mouth only to speak directly to the purpose the portly form of dr bartholomew russell the beloved physician from that beautiful land of plenty and peace which bayard taylor has described in his story of kennett was not to be overlooked abolitionist in heart and soul his house was known as the shelter of runaway slaves and no sportsman ever entered into the chase with such zest as he did into the arduous and sometimes dangerous work of aiding their escape and baffling their pursuers the youngest man present was i believe james miller mckim a presbyterian minister from columbia afterwards one of our most efficient workers james mott e l capron arnold buffum and nathan winslow men well known in the antislavery agitation were conspicuous members vermont sent down from her mountains orson s murray a man terribly in earnest with a zeal that bordered on fanaticism and who was none the more genial for the mobviolence to which he had been subjected in front of me awakening pleasant associations of the old homestead in merrimac valley sat my first schoolteacher joshua coffin the learned and worthy antiquarian and historian of newbury a few spectators mostly of the hicksite division of friends were present in broad brims and plain bonnets among them esther moore and lucretia mott committees were chosen to draft a constitution for a national antislavery society nominate a list of officers and prepare a declaration of principles to be signed by the members dr a l cox of new york while these committees were absent read something from my pen eulogistic of william lloyd garrison and lewis tappan and amos a phelps a congregational clergyman of boston afterwards one of the most devoted laborers in the cause followed in generous commendation of the zeal courage and devotion of the young pioneer the president after calling james mccrummell one of the two or three colored members of the convention to the chair made some eloquent remarks upon those editors who had ventured to advocate emancipation at the close of his speech a young man rose to speak whose appearance at once arrested my attention i think i have never seen a finer face and figure and his manner words and bearing were in keeping who is he i asked of one of the pennsylvania delegates robert purvis of this city a colored man was the answer he began by uttering his heartfelt thanks to the delegates who had convened for the deliverance of his people he spoke of garrison in terms of warmest eulogy as one who had stirred the heart of the nation broken the tomblike slumber of the church and compelled it to listen to the story of the slaves wrongs he closed by declaring that the friends of colored americans would not be forgotten their memories he said will be cherished when pyramids and monuments shall have crumbled in dust the flood of time which is sweeping away the refuge of lies is bearing on the advocates of our cause to a glorious immortality the committee on the constitution made their report which after discussion was adopted it disclaimed any right or intention of interfering otherwise than by persuasion and christian expostulation with slavery as it existed in the states but affirming the duty of congress to abolish it in the district of columbia and territories and to put an end to the domestic slavetrade a list of officers of the new society was then chosen arthur tappan of new york president and elizur wright jr william lloyd garrison and a l cox secretaries among the vicepresidents was dr lord of dartmouth college then professedly in favor of emancipation but who afterwards turned a moral somersault a selfinversion which left him ever after on his head instead of his feet he became a querulous advocate of slavery as a divine institution and denounced woe upon the abolitionists for interfering with the will and purpose of the creator as the cause of freedom gained ground the poor mans heart failed him and his hope for church and state grew fainter and fainter a sad prophet of the evangel of slavery he testified in the unwilling ears of an unbelieving generation and died at last despairing of a world which seemed determined that canaan should no longer be cursed nor onesimus sent back to philemon the committee on the declaration of principles of which i was a member held a long session discussing the proper scope and tenor of the document but little progress being made it was finally decided to entrust the matter to a subcommittee consisting of william l garrison s j may and myself and after a brief consultation and comparison of each others views the drafting of the important paper was assigned to the former gentleman we agreed to meet him at his lodgings in the house of a colored friend early the next morning it was still dark when we climbed up to his room and the lamp was still burning by the light of which he was writing the last sentence of the declaration we read it carefully made a few verbal changes and submitted it to the large committee who unanimously agreed to report it to the convention the paper was read to the convention by dr atlee chairman of the committee and listened to with the profoundest interest commencing with a reference to the time fiftyseven years before when in the same city of philadelphia our fathers announced to the world their declaration of independence based on the selfevident truths of human equality and rights and appealed to arms for its defence it spoke of the new enterprise as one without which that of our fathers is incomplete and as transcending theirs in magnitude solemnity and probable results as much as moral truth does physical force it spoke of the difference of the two in the means and ends proposed and of the trifling grievances of our fathers compared with the wrongs and sufferings of the slaves which it forcibly characterized as unequalled by any others on the face of the earth it claimed that the nation was bound to repent at once to let the oppressed go free and to admit them to all the rights and privileges of others because it asserted no man has a right to enslave or imbrute his brother because liberty is inalienable because there is no difference in principle between slaveholding and manstealing which the law brands as piracy and because no length of bondage can invalidate mans claim to himself or render slave laws anything but an audacious usurpation it maintained that no compensation should be given to planters emancipating slaves because that would be a surrender of fundamental principles slavery is a crime and is therefore not an article to be sold because slaveholders are not just proprietors of what they claim because emancipation would destroy only nominal not real property and because compensation if given at all should be given to the slaves it declared any scheme of expatriation to be delusive cruel and dangerous it fully recognized the right of each state to legislate exclusively on the subject of slavery within its limits and conceded that congress under the present national compact had no right to interfere though still contending that it had the power and should exercise it to suppress the domestic slavetrade between the several states and to abolish slavery in the district of columbia and in those portions of our territory which the constitution has placed under its exclusive jurisdiction after clearly and emphatically avowing the principles underlying the enterprise and guarding with scrupulous care the rights of persons and states under the constitution in prosecuting it the declaration closed with these eloquent words we also maintain that there are at the present time the highest obligations resting upon the people of the free states to remove slavery by moral and political action as prescribed in the constitution of the united states they are now living under a pledge of their tremendous physical force to fasten the galling fetters of tyranny upon the limbs of millions in the southern states they are liable to be called at any moment to suppress a general insurrection of the slaves they authorize the slaveowner to vote on three fifths of his slaves as property and thus enable him to perpetuate his oppression they support a standing army at the south for its protection and they seize the slave who has escaped into their territories and send him back to be tortured by an enraged master or a brutal driver this relation to slavery is criminal and full of danger it must be broken up these are our views and principles these our designs and measures with entire confidence in the overruling justice of god we plant ourselves upon the declaration of independence and the truths of divine revelation as upon the everlasting rock we shall organize antislavery societies if possible in every city town and village in our land we shall send forth agents to lift up the voice of remonstrance of warning of entreaty and rebuke we shall circulate unsparingly and extensively antislavery tracts and periodicals we shall enlist the pulpit and the press in the cause of the suffering and the dumb we shall aim at a purification of the churches from all participation in the guilt of slavery we shall encourage the labor of freemen over that of the slaves by giving a preference to their productions and we shall spare no exertions nor means to bring the whole nation to speedy repentance our trust for victory is solely in god we may be personally defeated but our principles never truth justice reason humanity must and will gloriously triumph already a host is coming up to the help of the lord against the mighty and the prospect before us is full of encouragement submitting this declaration to the candid examination of the people of this country and of the friends of liberty all over the world we hereby affix our signatures to it pledging ourselves that under the guidance and by the help of almighty god we will do all that in us lies consistently with this declaration of our principles to overthrow the most execrable system of slavery that has ever been witnessed upon earth to deliver our land from its deadliest curse to wipe out the foulest stain which rests upon our national escutcheon and to secure to the colored population of the united states all the rights and privileges which belong to them as men and as americans come what may to our persons our interests or our reputations whether we live to witness the triumph of justice liberty and humanity or perish untimely as martyrs in this great benevolent and holy cause the reading of the paper was followed by a discussion which lasted several hours a member of the society of friends moved its immediate adoption we have he said all given it our assent every heart here responds to it it is a doctrine of friends that these strong and deep impressions should be heeded the convention nevertheless deemed it important to go over the declaration carefully paragraph by paragraph during the discussion one of the spectators asked leave to say a few words a beautiful and graceful woman in the prime of life with a face beneath her plain cap as finely intellectual as that of madame roland offered some wise and valuable suggestions in a clear sweet voice the charm of which i have never forgotten it was lucretia mott of philadelphia the president courteously thanked her and encouraged her to take a part in the discussion on the morning of the last day of our session the declaration with its few verbal amendments carefully engrossed on parchment was brought before the convention samuel j may rose to read it for the last time his sweet persuasive voice faltered with the intensity of his emotions as he repeated the solemn pledges of the concluding paragraphs after a season of silence david thurston of maine rose as his name was called by one of the secretaries and affixed his name to the document one after another passed up to the platform signed and retired in silence all felt the deep responsibility of the occasion the shadow and forecast of a lifelong struggle rested upon every countenance our work as a convention was now done president green arose to make the concluding address the circumstances under which it was uttered may have lent it an impressiveness not its own but as i now recall it it seems to me the most powerful and eloquent speech to which i have ever listened he passed in review the work that had been done the constitution of the new society the declaration of sentiments and the union and earnestness which had marked the proceedings his closing words will never be forgotten by those who heard them brethren it has been good to be here in this hallowed atmosphere i have been revived and refreshed this brief interview has more than repaid me for all that i have ever suffered i have here met congenial minds i have rejoiced in sympathies delightful to the soul heart has beat responsive to heart and the holy work of seeking to benefit the outraged and despised has proved the most blessed employment but now we must retire from these balmy influences and breathe another atmosphere the chill hoarfrost will be upon us the storm and tempest will rise and the waves of persecution will dash against our souls let us be prepared for the worst let us fasten ourselves to the throne of god as with hooks of steel if we cling not to him our names to that document will be but as dust let us court no applause indulge in no spirit of vain boasting let us be assured that our only hope in grappling with the bony monster is in an arm that is stronger than ours let us fix our gaze on god and walk in the light of his countenance if our cause be just and we know it is his omnipotence is pledged to its triumph let this cause be entwined around the very fibres of our hearts let our hearts grow to it so that nothing but death can sunder the bond he ceased and then amidst a silence broken only by the deepdrawn breath of emotion in the assembly lifted up his voice in a prayer to almighty god full of fervor and feeling imploring his blessing and sanctification upon the convention and its labors and with the solemnity of this supplication in our hearts we clasped hands in farewell and went forth each man to his place of duty not knowing the things that should befall us as individuals but with a confidence never shaken by abuse and persecution in the certain triumph of our cause kansas read at the twentyfifth anniversary of the founding of the state of kansas bear camp house west ossipee n h eighth month th to j s emery r morrow and c w smith committee i have received your invitation to the twentyfifth anniversary celebration of the first settlement of kansas it would give me great pleasure to visit your state on an occasion of such peculiar interest and to make the acquaintance of its brave and selfdenying pioneers but i have not health and strength for the journey it is very fitting that this anniversary should be duly recognized no one of your sister states has such a record as yours so full of peril and adventure fortitude selfsacrifice and heroic devotion to freedom its baptism of martyr blood not only saved the state to liberty but made the abolition of slavery everywhere possible barber and stillwell and colpetzer and their associates did not die in vain all through your long hard struggle i watched the course of events in kansas with absorbing interest i rejoiced while i marvelled at the steady courage which no danger could shake at the firm endurance which outwearied the brutalities of your slaveholding invaders and at that fidelity to right and duty which the seduction of immediate selfinterest could not swerve nor the military force of a proslavery government overawe all my sympathies were with you in that stern trial of your loyalty to god and humanity and when in the end you had conquered peace and the last of the baffled border ruffians had left your territory i felt that the doom of the accursed institution was sealed and that its abolition was but a question of time a state with such a record will i am sure be true to its noble traditions and will do all in its power to aid the victims of prejudice and oppression who may be compelled to seek shelter within its borders i will not for a moment distrust the fidelity of kansas to her foundation principle god bless and prosper her thanking you for the kind terms of your invitation i am gentlemen very truly your friend william lloyd garrison an introduction to oliver johnsons william lloyd garrison and his times i no not know that any word of mine can give additional interest to this memorial of william lloyd garrison from the pen of one of his earliest and most devoted friends whose privilege it has been to share his confidence and his labors for nearly half a century but i cannot well forego the opportunity afforded me to add briefly my testimony to the tribute to the memory of the great reformer whose friendship i have shared and with whom i have been associated in a common cause from youth to age my acquaintance with him commenced in boyhood my father was a subscriber to his first paper the free press and the humanitarian tone of his editorials awakened a deep interest in our little household which was increased by a visit which he made us when he afterwards edited the journal of the times at bennington vt i ventured to write him a letter of encouragement and sympathy urging him to continue his labors against slavery and assuring him that he could do great things an unconscious prophecy which has been fulfilled beyond the dream of my boyish enthusiasm the friendship thus commenced has remained unbroken through half a century confirming my early confidence in his zeal and devotion and in the great intellectual and moral strength which he brought to the cause with which his name is identified during the long and hard struggle in which the abolitionists were engaged and amidst the new and difficult questions and sideissues which presented themselves it could scarcely be otherwise than that differences of opinion and action should arise among them the leader and his disciples could not always see alike my friend the author of this book i think generally found himself in full accord with him while i often decidedly dissented i felt it my duty to use my right of citizenship at the ballotbox in the cause of liberty while garrison with equal sincerity judged and counselled otherwise each acted under a sense of individual duty and responsibility and our personal relations were undisturbed if at times the great antislavery leader failed to do justice to the motives of those who while in hearty sympathy with his hatred of slavery did not agree with some of his opinions and methods it was but the pardonable and not unnatural result of his intensity of purpose and his selfidentification with the cause he advocated and while compelled to dissent in some particulars from his judgment of men and measures the great mass of the antislavcry people recognized his moral leadership the controversies of old and new organization nonresistance and political action may now be looked upon by the parties to them who still survive with the philosophic calmness which follows the subsidence of prejudice and passion we were but fallible men and doubtless often erred in feeling speech and action ours was but the common experience of reformers in all ages never in customs oiled grooves the world to a higher level moves but grates and grinds with friction hard on granite bowlder and flinty shard ever the virtues blush to find the vices wearing their badge behind and graces and charities feel the fire wherein the sins of the age expire it is too late now to dwell on these differences i choose rather with a feeling of gratitude to god to recall the great happiness of laboring with the noble company of whom garrison was the central figure i love to think of him as he seemed to me when in the fresh dawn of manhood he sat with me in the old haverhill farmhouse revolving even then schemes of benevolence or with cheery smile welcoming me to his frugal meal of bread and milk in the dingy boston printingroom or as i found him in the gray december morning in the small attic of a colored man in philadelphia finishing his nightlong task of drafting his immortal declaration of sentiments of the american antislavery society or as i saw him in the jail of leverett street after his almost miraculous escape from the mob playfully inviting me to share the safe lodgings which the state had provided for him and in all the varied scenes and situations where we acted together our parts in the great endeavor and success of freedom the verdict of posterity in his case may be safely anticipated with the true reformers and benefactors of his race he occupies a place inferior to none other the private lives of many who fought well the battles of humanity have not been without spot or blemish but his private character like his public knew no dishonor no shadow of suspicion rests upon the white statue of a life the fitting garland of which should be the alpine flower that symbolizes noble purity antislavery anniversary read at the semicentennial celebration of the american antislavery society at philadelphia on the d december oak knoll danvers mass th mo i need not say how gladly i would be with you at the semicentennial of the american antislavery society i am i regret to say quite unable to gratify this wish and can only represent myself by a letter looking back over the long years of half a century i can scarcely realize the conditions under which the convention of assembled slavery was predominant like apollyon in pilgrims progress it straddled over the whole breadth of the way church and state press and pulpit business interests literature and fashion were prostrate at its feet our convention with few exceptions was composed of men without influence or position poor and little known strong only in their convictions and faith in the justice of their cause to onlookers our endeavor to undo the evil work of two centuries and convert a nation to the great renunciation involved in emancipation must have seemed absurd in the last degree our voices in such an atmosphere found no echo we could look for no response but laughs of derision or the missiles of a mob but we felt that we had the strength of truth on our side we were right and all the world about us was wrong we had faith hope and enthusiasm and did our work nothing doubting amidst a generation who first despised and then feared and hated us for myself i have never ceased to be grateful to the divine providence for the privilege of taking a part in that work and now for more than twenty years we have had a free country no slave treads its soil the anticipated dangerous consequences of complete emancipation have not been felt the emancipated class as a whole have done wisely and well under circumstances of peculiar difficulty the masters have learned that cotton can be raised better by free than by slave labor and nobody now wishes a return to slaveholding sectional prejudices are subsiding the bitterness of the civil war is slowly passing away we are beginning to feel that we are one people with no really clashing interests and none more truly rejoice in the growing prosperity of the south than the old abolitionists who hated slavery as a curse to the master as well as to the slave in view of this commemorative semicentennial occasion many thoughts crowd upon me memory recalls vanished faces and voices long hushed of those who acted with me in the convention fifty years ago nearly all have passed into another state of being we who remain must soon follow we have seen the fulfilment of our desire we have outlived scorn and persecution the lengthening shadows invite us to rest if in looking back we feel that we sometimes erred through impatient zeal in our contest with a great wrong we have the satisfaction of knowing that we were influenced by no merely selfish considerations the low light of our setting sun shines over a free united people and our last prayer shall be for their peace prosperity and happiness response to the celebration of my eightieth birthday by the colored citizens of washington d c to r h terrell and george w williams esquires gentlemen among the great number of tokens of interest and goodwill which reached me on my birthday none have touched me more deeply than the proceedings of the great meeting of the colored citizens of the nations capital of which you are the representatives the resolutions of that meeting came to me as the voice of millions of my fellowcountrymen that voice was dumb in slavery when more than half a century ago i put forth my plea for the freedom of the slave it could not answer me from the rice swamp and cotton field but now god be praised it speaks from your great meeting in washington and from all the colleges and schools where the youth of your race are taught i scarcely expected then that the people for whom i pleaded would ever know of my efforts in their behalf i cannot be too thankful to the divine providence that i have lived to hear their grateful response i stand amazed at the rapid strides which your people have made since emancipation at your industry your acquisition of property and land your zeal for education your selfrespecting but unresentful attitude toward those who formerly claimed to be your masters your pathetic but manly appeal for just treatment and recognition i see in all this the promise that the time is not far distant when in common with the white race you will have the free undisputed rights of american citizenship in all parts of the union and your rightful share in the honors as well as the protection of the government your letter would have been answered sooner if it had been possible i have been literally overwhelmed with letters and telegrams which owing to illness i have been in a great measure unable to answer or even read i tender to you gentlemen and to the people you represent my heartfelt thanks and the assurance that while life lasts you will find me as i have been heretofore under more difficult circumstances your faithful friend oak knoll danvers mass first mo reform and politics utopian schemes and political theorists there is a large class of men not in europe alone but in this country also whose constitutional conservatism inclines them to regard any organic change in the government of a state or the social condition of its people with suspicion and distrust they admit perhaps the evils of the old state of things but they hold them to be inevitable the alloy necessarily mingled with all which pertains to fallible humanity themselves generally enjoying whatever of good belongs to the political or social system in which their lot is cast they are disposed to look with philosophic indifference upon the evil which only afflicts their neighbors they wonder why people are not contented with their allotments they see no reason for change they ask for quiet and peace in their day being quite well satisfied with that social condition which an old poet has quaintly described the citizens like pounded pikes the lesser feed the great the rich for food seek stomachs and the poor for stomachs meat this class of our fellowcitizens have an especial dislike of theorists reformers uneasy spirits speculators upon the possibilities of the worlds future constitution builders and believers in progress they are satisfied the world at least goes well enough with them they sit as comfortable in it as lafontaines rat in the cheese and why should those who would turn it upside down come hither also why not let well enough alone why tinker creeds constitutions and laws and disturb the good oldfashioned order of things in church and state the idea of making the world better and happier is to them an absurdity he who entertains it is a dreamer and a visionary destitute of common sense and practical wisdom his project whatever it may be is at once pronounced to be impracticable folly or as they are pleased to term it utopian the romance of sir thomas more which has long afforded to the conservatives of church and state a term of contempt applicable to all reformatory schemes and innovations is one of a series of fabulous writings in which the authors living in evil times and unable to actualize their plans for the wellbeing of society have resorted to fiction as a safe means of conveying forbidden truths to the popular mind platos timaeus the first of the series was written after the death of socrates and the enslavement of the authors country in this are described the institutions of the island of atlantis the writers ideal of a perfect commonwealth xenophon in his cyropaedia has also depicted an imaginary political society by overlaying with fiction historical traditions at a later period we have the new atlantis of lord bacon and that dream of the city of the sun with which campanella solaced himself in his long imprisonment the utopia of more is perhaps the best of its class it is the work of a profound thinker the suggestive speculations and theories of one who could forerun his age and race and let his feet millenniums hence be set in midst of knowledge dreamed not yet much of what he wrote as fiction is now fact a part of the framework of european governments and the political truths of his imaginary state are now practically recognized in our own democratic system as might be expected in view of the times in which the author wrote and the exceedingly limited amount of materials which he found ready to his hands for the construction of his social and political edifice there is a want of proportion and symmetry in the structure many of his theories are no doubt impracticable and unsound but as a whole the work is an admirable one striding in advance of the authors age and prefiguring a government of religious toleration and political freedom the following extract from it was doubtless regarded in his day as something worse than folly or the dream of a visionary enthusiast he judged it wrong to lay down anything rashly and seemed to doubt whether these different forms of religion might not all come from god who might inspire men in a different manner and be pleased with the variety he therefore thought it to be indecent and foolish for any man to threaten and terrify another to make him believe what did not strike him as true passing by the telemachus of fenelon we come to the political romance of harrington written in the time of cromwell oceana is the name by which the author represents england and the republican plan of government which he describes with much minuteness is such as he would have recommended for adoption in case a free commonwealth had been established it deals somewhat severely with cromwells usurpation yet the author did not hesitate to dedicate it to that remarkable man who after carefully reading it gave it back to his daughter lady claypole with the remark full of characteristic bluntness that the gentleman need not think to cheat him of his power and authority for what he had won with the sword he would never suffer himself to be scribbled out of notwithstanding the liberality and freedom of his speculations upon government and religion in his utopia it must be confessed that sir thomas more in after life fell into the very practices of intolerance and bigotry which he condemned when in the possession of the great seal under that scandal of kingship henry viii he gave his countenance to the persecution of heretics bishop burnet says of him that he caused a gentleman of the temple to be whipped and put to the rack in his presence in order to compel him to discover those who favored heretical opinions in his utopia he assailed the profession of the law with merciless satire yet the satirist himself finally sat upon the chancellors woolsack and as has been well remarked by horace smith if from this elevated seat he ever cast his eyes back upon his past life he must have smiled at the fond conceit which could imagine a permanent utopia when he himself certainly more learned honest and conscientious than the mass of men has ever been could in the course of one short life fall into such glaring and frightful rebellion against his own doctrines harrington on the other hand as became the friend of milton and marvel held fast through good and evil report his republican faith he published his work after the restoration and defended it boldly and ably from the numerous attacks made upon it regarded as too dangerous an enthusiast to be left at liberty he was imprisoned at the instance of lord chancellor hyde first in the tower and afterwards on the island of st nicholas where disease and imprudent remedies brought on a partial derangement from which he never recovered bernardin st pierre whose pathetic tale of paul and virginia has found admirers in every language of the civilized world in a fragment entitled arcadia attempted to depict an ideal republic without priest noble or slave where all are so religious that each man is the pontiff of his family where each man is prepared to defend his country and where all are in such a state of equality that there are no such persons as servants the plan of it was suggested by his friend rousseau during their pleasant walking excursions about the environs of paris in which the two enthusiastic philosophers baffled by the evil passions and intractable materials of human nature as manifested in existing society comforted themselves by appealing from the actual to the possible from the real to the imaginary under the chestnuttrees of the bois de boulogne through long summer days the two friends sick of the noisy world about them yet yearning to become its benefactors gladly escaping from it yet busy with schemes for its regeneration and happiness at once misanthropes and philanthropists amused and solaced themselves by imagining a perfect and simple state of society in which the lessons of emulation and selfish ambition were never to be taught where on the contrary the young were to obey their parents and to prefer father mother brother sister wife and friend to themselves they drew beautiful pictures of a country blessed with peace indus try and love covered with no disgusting monuments of violence and pride and luxury without columns triumphal arches hospitals prisons or gibbets but presenting to view bridges over torrents wells on the arid plain groves of fruittrees and houses of shelter for the traveller in desert places attesting everywhere the sentiment of humanity religion was to speak to all hearts in the eternal language of nature death was no longer to be feared perspectives of holy consolation were to open through the cypress shadows of the tomb to live or to die was to be equally an object of desire the plan of the arcadia of st pierre is simply this a learned young egyptian educated at thebes by the priests of osiris desirous of benefiting humanity undertakes a voyage to gaul for the purpose of carrying thither the arts and religion of egypt he is shipwrecked on his return in the gulf of messina and lands upon the coast where he is entertained by an arcadian to whom he relates his adventures and from whom he receives in turn an account of the simple happiness and peace of arcadia the virtues and felicity of whose inhabitants are beautifully exemplified in the lives and conversation of the shepherd and his daughter this pleasant little prose poem closes somewhat abruptly although inferior in artistic skill to paul and virginia or the indian cottage there is not a little to admire in the simple beauty of its pastoral descriptions the closing paragraph reminds one of bunyans upper chamber where the weary pilgrims windows opened to the sunrising and the singing of birds tyrteus conducted his guests to an adjoining chamber it had a window shut by a curtain of rushes through the crevices of which the islands of the alpheus might be seen in the light of the moon there were in this chamber two excellent beds with coverlets of warm and light wool now as soon as amasis was left alone with cephas he spoke with joy of the delight and tranquillity of the valley of the goodness of the shepherd and the grace of his young daughter to whom he had seen none worthy to be compared and of the pleasure which he promised himself the next day at the festival on mount lyceum of beholding a whole people as happy as this sequestered family converse so delightful might have charmed away the night without the aid of sleep had they not been invited to repose by the mild light of the moon shining through the window the murmuring wind in the leaves of the poplars and the distant noise of the achelous which falls roaring from the summit of mount lyceum the young patrician wits of athens doubtless laughed over platos ideal republic campanellas city of the sun was looked upon no doubt as the distempered vision of a crazy state prisoner bacons college in his new atlantis moved the risibles of fatwitted oxford mores utopia as we know gave to our language a new word expressive of the vagaries and dreams of fanatics and lunatics the merciless wits clerical and profane of the court of charles ii regarded harringtons romance as a perfect godsend to their vocation of ridicule the gay dames and carpet knights of versailles made themselves merry with the prose pastoral of st pierre and the poor old enthusiast went down to his grave without finding an auditory for his lectures upon natural society the world had its laugh over these romances when unable to refute their theories it could sneer at the authors and answer them to the satisfaction of the generation in which they lived at least by a general charge of lunacy some of their notions were no doubt as absurd as those of the astronomer in rasselas who tells imlac that he has for five years possessed the regulation of the weather and has got the secret of making to the different nations an equal and impartial dividend of rain and sunshine but truth even when ushered into the world through the medium of a dull romance and in connection with a vast progeny of errors however ridiculed and despised at first never fails in the end of finding a lodgingplace in the popular mind the speculations of the political theorists whom we have noticed have not all proved to be of such stuff as dreams are made of and their little life rounded with sleep they have entered into and become parts of the social and political fabrics of europe and america the prophecies of imagination have been fulfilled the dreams of romance have become familiar realities what is the moral suggested by this record is it not that we should look with charity and tolerance upon the schemes and speculations of the political and social theorists of our day that if unprepared to venture upon new experiments and radical changes we should at least consider that what was folly to our ancestors is our wisdom and that another generation may successfully put in practice the very theories which now seem to us absurd and impossible many of the evils of society have been measurably removed or ameliorated yet now as in the days of the apostle the creation groaneth and travaileth in pain and although quackery and empiricism abound is it not possible that a proper application of some of the remedies proposed might ameliorate the general suffering rejecting as we must whatever is inconsistent with or hostile to the doctrines of christianity on which alone rests our hope for humanity it becomes us to look kindly upon all attempts to apply those doctrines to the details of human life to the social political and industrial relations of the race if it is not permitted us to believe all things we can at least hope them despair is infidelity and death temporally and spiritually the declaration of inspiration holds good we are saved by hope peculiar institutions of massachusetts bernardin st pierre in his wishes of a solitary asks for his country neither wealth nor military glory nor magnificent palaces and monuments nor splendor of court nobility nor clerical pomp rather he says o france may no beggar tread thy plains no sick or suffering man ask in vain for relief in all thy hamlets may every young woman find a lover and every lover a true wife may the young be trained arightly and guarded from evil may the old close their days in the tranquil hope of those who love god and their fellowmen we are reminded of the amiable wish of the french essayist a wish even yet very far from realization we fear in the empire of napoleon iii by the perusal of two documents recently submitted to the legislature of the state of massachusetts they indicate in our view the real glory of a state and foreshadow the coming of that time when miltons definition of a true commonwealth shall be no longer a prophecy but the description of an existing fact a huge christian personage a mighty growth and stature of an honest man moved by the purpose of a love of god and of mankind some years ago the legislature of massachusetts at the suggestion of several benevolent gentlemen whose attention had been turned to the subject appointed a commission to inquire into the condition of the idiots of the commonwealth to ascertain their numbers and whether anything could be done in their behalf the commissioners were dr samuel g howe so well and honorably known for his long and arduous labors in behalf of the blind judge byington and dr gilman kimball the burden of the labor fell upon the chairman who entered upon it with the enthusiasm perseverance and practical adaptation of means to ends which have made him so efficient in his varied schemes of benevolence on the th of the second month a full report of the results of this labor was made to the governor accompanied by statistical tables and minute details one hundred towns had been visited by the chairman or his reliable agent in which five hundred and seventyfive persons in a state of idiocy were discovered these were examined carefully in respect to their physical as well as mental condition no inquiry being omitted which was calculated to throw light upon the remote or immediate causes of this mournful imperfection in the creation of god the proximate causes dr howe mentions are to be found in the state of the bodily organization deranged and disproportioned by some violation of natural law on the part of the parents or remoter ancestors of the sufferers out of cases of idiocy he had obtained information respecting the condition of the progenitors of and in all but four of these eases he found that one or the other or both of their immediate progenitors had in some way departed widely from the condition of health they were scrofulous or predisposed to affections of the brain and insanity or had intermarried with bloodrelations or had been intemperate or guilty of sensual excesses of the cases were those of idiocy from birth and of idiocy afterwards of the born idiots were under twentyfive years of age and all but seemed capable of improvement of those above twentyfive years of age appeared incapable of improvement in their mental condition being helpless as children at seven years of age out of the seemed as helpless as children at two years of age were in the condition of mere infants and were supported at the public charge in almshouses a large proportion of them were found to be given over to filthy and loathsome habits gluttony and lust and constantly sinking lower towards the condition of absolute brutishness those in private houses were found if possible in a still more deplorable state their parents were generally poor feeble in mind and body and often of very intemperate habits many of them seemed scarcely able to take care of themselves and totally unfit for the training of ordinary children it was the blind leading the blind imbecility teaching imbecility some instances of the experiments of parental ignorance upon idiotic offspring which fell under the observation of dr howe are related in his report idiotic children were found with their heads covered over with cold poultices of oakbark which the foolish parents supposed would tan the brain and harden it as the tanner does his oxhides and so make it capable of retaining impressions and remembering lessons in other cases finding that the child could not be made to comprehend anything the sagacious heads of the household on the supposition that its brain was too hard tortured it with hot poultices of bread and milk to soften it others plastered over their childrens heads with tar some administered strong doses of mercury to solder up the openings in the head and make it tight and strong others encouraged the savage gluttony of their children stimulating their unnatural and bestial appetites on the ground that the poor creatures had nothing else to enjoy but their food and they should have enough of that in consequence of this report the legislature in the spring of made an annual appropriation of twentyfive hundred dollars for three years for the purpose of training and teaching ten idiot children to be selected by the governor and council the trustees of the asylum for the blind under the charge of dr howe made arrangements for receiving these pupils the school was opened in the autumn of and its first annual report addressed to the governor and printed by order of the senate is now before us of the ten pupils it appears that not one had the usual command of muscular motion the languid body obeyed not the service of the imbecile will some could walk and use their limbs and hands in simple motions others could make only make slight use of their muscles and two were without any power of locomotion one of these last a boy six years of age who had been stupefied on the day of his birth by the application of hot rum to his head could scarcely see or notice objects and was almost destitute of the sense of touch he could neither stand nor sit upright nor even creep but would lie on the floor in whatever position he was placed he could not feed himself nor chew solid food and had no more sense of decency than an infant his intellect was a blank he had no knowledge no desires no affections a more hopeless object for experiment could scarcely have been selected a year of patient endeavor has nevertheless wrought a wonderful change in the condition of this miserable being cold bathing rubbing of the limbs exercise of the muscles exposure to the air and other appliances have enabled him to stand upright to sit at table and feed himself and chew his food and to walk about with slight assistance his habits are no longer those of a brute he observes decency his eye is brighter his cheeks glow with health his countenance is more expressive of thought he has learned many words and constructs simple sentences his affections begin to develop and there is every prospect that he will be so far renovated as to be able to provide for himself in manhood in the case of another boy aged twelve years the improvement has been equally remarkable the gentleman who first called attention to him in a recent note to dr howe published in the report thus speaks of his present condition when i remember his former wild and almost frantic demeanor when approached by any one and the apparent impossibility of communicating with him and now see him standing in his class playing with his fellows and willingly and familiarly approaching me examining what i gave him and when i see him already selecting articles named by his teacher and even correctly pronouncing words printed on cards improvement does not convey the idea presented to my mind it is creation it is making him anew all the pupils have more or less advanced their health and habits have improved and there is no reason to doubt that the experiment at the close of its three years will be found to have been quite as successful as its most sanguine projectors could have anticipated dr howe has been ably seconded by an accomplished teacher james b richards who has devoted his whole time to the pupils of the nature and magnitude of their task an idea may be formed only by considering the utter listlessness of idiocy the incapability of the poor pupil to fix his attention upon anything and his general want of susceptibility to impressions all his senses are dulled and perverted touch hearing sight smell are all more or less defective his gluttony is unaccompanied with the gratification of taste the most savory viands and the offal which he shares with the pigs equally satisfy him his mental state is still worse than his physical thought is painful and irksome to him his teacher can only engage his attention by strenuous efforts loud earnest tones gesticulations and signs and a constant presentation of some visible object of bright color and striking form the eye wanders and the spark of consciousness and intelligence which has been fanned into momentary brightness darkens at the slightest relaxation of the teachers exertions the names of objects presented to him must sometimes be repeated hundreds of times before he can learn them yet the patience and enthusiasm of the teacher are rewarded by a progress slow and unequal but still marked and manifest step by step often compelled to turn back and go over the inch of ground he had gained the idiot is still creeping forward and by almost imperceptible degrees his sick cramped and prisoned spirit casts off the burden of its body of death breath as from the almighty is breathed into him and he becomes a living soul after the senses of the idiot are trained to take note of their appropriate objects the various perceptive faculties are next to be exercised the greatest possible number of facts are to be gathered up through the medium of these faculties into the storehouse of memory from whence eventually the higher faculties of mind may draw the material of general ideas it has been found difficult if not impossible to teach the idiot to read by the letters first as in the ordinary method but while the varied powers of the three letters h a t could not be understood by him he could be made to comprehend the complex sign of the word hat made by uniting the three the moral nature of the idiot needs training and development as well as his physical and mental all that can be said of him is that he has the latent capacity for moral development and culture uninstructed and left to himself he has no ideas of regulated appetites and propensities of decency and delicacy of affection and social relations the germs of these ideas which constitute the glory and beauty of humanity undoubtedly exist in him but there can be no growth without patient and persevering culture where this is afforded to use the language of the report the idiot may learn what love is though he may not know the word which expresses it he may feel kindly affections while unable to understand the simplest virtuous principle and he may begin to live acceptably to god before he has learned the name by which men call him in the facts and statistics presented in the report light is shed upon some of the dark pages of gods providence and it is seen that the suffering and shame of idiocy are the result of sin of a violation of the merciful laws of god and of the harmonies of his benign order the penalties which are ordained for the violators of natural laws are inexorable and certain for the transgressor of the laws of life there is as in the case of esau no place for repentance though he seek it earnestly and with tears the curse cleaves to him and his children in this view how important becomes the subject of the hereditary transmission of moral and physical disease and debility and how necessary it is that there should be a clearer understanding of and a willing obedience at any cost to the eternal law which makes the parent the blessing or the curse of the child giving strength and beauty and the capacity to know and do the will of god or bequeathing loathsomeness deformity and animal appetite incapable of the restraints of the moral faculties even if the labors of dr howe and his benevolent associates do not materially lessen the amount of present actual evil and suffering in this respect they will not be put forth in vain if they have the effect of calling public attention to the great laws of our being the violation of which has made this goodly earth a vast lazarhouse of pain and sorrow the late annual message of the governor of massachusetts invites our attention to a kindred institution of charity the chief magistrate congratulates the legislature in language creditable to his mind and heart on the opening of the reform school for juvenile criminals established by an act of a previous legislature the act provides that when any boy under sixteen years of age shall be convicted of crime punishable by imprisonment other than such an offence as is punished by imprisonment for life he may be at the discretion of the court or justice sent to the state reform school or sentenced to such imprisonment as the law now provides for his offence the school is placed under the care of trustees who may either refuse to receive a boy thus sent there or after he has been received for reasons set forth in the act may order him to be committed to prison under the previous penal law of the state they are also authorized to apprentice the boys at their discretion to inhabitants of the commonwealth and whenever any boy shall be discharged either as reformed or as having reached the age of twentyone years his discharge is a full release from his sentence it is made the duty of the trustees to cause the boys to be instructed in piety and morality and in branches of useful knowledge in some regular course of labor mechanical agricultural or horticultural and such other trades and arts as may be best adapted to secure the amendment reformation and future benefit of the boys the class of offenders for whom this act provides are generally the offspring of parents depraved by crime or suffering from poverty and want the victims often of circumstances of evil which almost constitute a necessity issuing from homes polluted and miserable from the sight and hearing of loathsome impurities and hideous discords to avenge upon society the ignorance and destitution and neglect with which it is too often justly chargeable in three hundred of these youthful violators of law were sentenced to jails and other places of punishment in massachusetts where they incurred the fearful liability of being still more thoroughly corrupted by contact with older criminals familiar with atrocity and rolling their loathsome vices as a sweet morsel under the tongue in view of this state of things the reform school has been established twentytwo thousand dollars having been contributed to the state for that purpose by an unknown benefactor of his race the school is located in westboro on a fine farm of two hundred acres the buildings are in the form of a square with a court in the centre three stories in front with wings they are constructed with a degree of architectural taste and their site is happily chosen a gentle eminence overlooking one of the loveliest of the small lakes which form a pleasing feature in new england scenery from this place the atmosphere and associations of the prison are excluded the discipline is strict as a matter of course but it is that of a wellregulated home or schoolroom order neatness and harmony within doors and without the beautiful sights and sounds and healthful influences of nature one would almost suppose that the poetical dream of coleridge in his tragedy of remorse had found its realization in the westboro school and that weary of the hopelessness and cruelty of the old penal system our legislators had embodied in their statutes the idea of the poet with other ministrations thou o nature healest thy wandering and distempered child thou pourest on him thy soft influences thy sunny hues fair forms and breathing sweets thy melodies of woods and winds and waters till he relent and can no more endure to be a jarring and a dissonant thing amidst this general dance and minstrelsy thus it is that the christian idea of reformation rather than revenge is slowly but surely incorporating itself in our statute books we have only to look back but a single century to be able to appreciate the immense gain for humanity in the treatment of criminals which has been secured in that space of time then the use of torture was common throughout europe inability to comprehend and believe certain religious dogmas was a crime to be expiated by death or confiscation of estate or lingering imprisonment petty offences against property furnished subjects for the hangman the stocks and the whippingpost stood by the side of the meetinghouse tongues were bored with redhot irons and ears shorn off the jails were loathsome dungeons swarming with vermin unventilated unwarmed a century and a half ago the populace of massachusetts were convulsed with grim merriment at the writhings of a miserable woman scourged at the carttail or strangling in the duckingstool crowds hastened to enjoy the spectacle of an old man enduring the unutterable torment of the peine forte et dare pressed slowly to death under planks for refusing to plead to an indictment for witchcraft what a change from all this to the opening of the state reform school to the humane regulations of prisons and penitentiaries to keeneyed benevolence watching over the administration of justice which in securing society from lawless aggression is not suffered to overlook the true interest and reformation of the criminal nor to forget that the magistrate in the words of the apostle is to be indeed the minister of god to man for good lord ashley and the thieves they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick was the significant answer of our lord to the selfrighteous pharisees who took offence at his companions the poor the degraded the weak and the sinful go ye and learn what that meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice for i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance the great lesson of duty inculcated by this answer of the divine teacher has been too long overlooked by individuals and communities professedly governed by his maxims the phylacteries of our modern pharisees are as broad as those of the old jewish saints the respectable christian detests his vicious and illconditioned neighbors as heartily as the israelite did the publicans and sinners of his day he folds his robe of selfrighteousness closely about him and denounces as little better than sinful weakness all commiseration for the guilty and all attempts to restore and reclaim the erring violators of human law otherwise than by pains and penalties as wicked collusion with crime dangerous to the stability and safety of society and offensive in the sight of god and yet nothing is more certain than that just in proportion as the example of our lord has been followed in respect to the outcast and criminal the effect has been to reform and elevate to snatch as brands from the burning souls not yet wholly given over to the service of evil the wonderful influence for good exerted over the most degraded and reckless criminals of london by the excellent and selfdenying elizabeth fry the happy results of the establishment of houses of refuge and reformation and magdalen asylums all illustrate the wisdom of him who went about doing good in pointing out the morally diseased as the appropriate subjects of the benevolent labors of his disciples no one is to be despaired of we have no warrant to pass by any of our fellowcreatures as beyond the reach of gods grace and mercy for beneath the most repulsive and hateful outward manifestation there is always a consciousness of the beauty of goodness and purity and of the loathsomeness of sin one chamber of the heart as yet not wholly profaned whence at times arises the prayer of a burdened and miserable spirit for deliverance deep down under the squalid exterior unparticipative in the hideous merriment and recklessness of the criminal there is another self a chained and suffering inner man crying out in the intervals of intoxication and brutal excesses like jonah from the bosom of hell to this lingering consciousness the sympathy and kindness of benevolent and humane spirits seldom appeal in vain for whatever may be outward appearances it remains true that the way of the transgressor is hard and that sin and suffering are inseparable crime is seldom loved or persevered in for its own sake but when once the evil path is entered upon a return is in reality extremely difficult to the unhappy wanderer and often seems as well nigh impossible the laws of social life rise up like insurmountable barriers between him and escape as he turns towards the society whose rights he has outraged its frown settles upon him the penalties of the laws he has violated await him and he falls back despairing and suffers the fetters of the evil habit to whose power he has yielded himself to be fastened closer and heavier upon him o for some good angel in the form of a brotherman and touched with a feeling of his sins and infirmities to reassure his better nature and to point out a way of escape from its body of death we have been led into these remarks by an account given in the london weekly chronicle of a most remarkable interview between the professional thieves of london and lord ashley a gentleman whose best patent of nobility is to be found in his generous and untiring devotion to the interests of his fellowmen it appears that a philanthropic gentleman in london had been applied to by two young thieves who had relinquished their evil practices and were obtaining a precarious but honest livelihood by picking up bones and rags in the streets their loss of character closing against them all other employments he had just been reading an address of lord ashleys in favor of colonial emigration and he was led to ask one of the young men how he would like to emigrate i should jump at the chance was the reply not long after the gentleman was sent for to visit one of those obscure and ruinous courts of the great metropolis where crime and poverty lie down together localities which dickens has pictured with such painful distinctness here to his surprise he met a number of thieves and outlaws who declared themselves extremely anxious to know whether any hope could be held out to them of obtaining an honest living however humble in the colonies as their only reason for continuing in their criminal course was the impossibility of extricating themselves he gave them such advice and encouragement as he was able and invited them to assemble again with such of their companions as they could persuade to do so at the room of the irish free school for the purpose of meeting lord ashley on the th of the seventh month last the meeting took place at the hour appointed lord ashley and five or six other benevolent gentlemen interested in emigration as a means of relief and reformation to the criminal poor entered the room which was already wellnigh filled two hundred and seven professed thieves were present several of the most experienced thieves were stationed at the door to prevent the admission of any but thieves some four or five individuals who were not at first known were subjected to examination and only allowed to remain on stating that they were and being recognized as members of the dishonest fraternity and before the proceedings of the evening commenced the question was very carefully put and repeated several times whether any one was in the room of whom others entertained doubts as to who he was the object of this care was as so many of them were in danger of getting into trouble or in other words of being taken up for their crimes to ascertain if any who might betray them were present and another intention of this scrutiny was to give those assembled who naturally would feel considerable fear a fuller confidence in opening their minds what a novel conference between the extremes of modern society all that is beautiful in refinement and education moral symmetry and christian grace contrasting with the squalor the ignorance the lifelong depravity of men living without god in the world the pariahs of civilization the moral lepers at the sight of whom decency covers its face and cries out unclean after a prayer had been offered lord ashley spoke at considerable length making a profound impression on his strange auditory as they listened to his plans of emigration which offered them an opportunity to escape from their miserable condition and enter upon a respectable course of life the hard heart melted and the cold and cruel eye moistened with one accord the wretched felons responded to the language of christian love and goodwill and declared their readiness to follow the advice of their true friend they looked up to him as to an angel of mercy and felt the malignant spirits which had so long tormented them disarmed of all power of evil in the presence of simple goodness he stood in that felon audience like spensers una amidst the satyrs unassailable and secure in the unresistible might of meekness and panoplied in that noble grace which dashed brute violence with sudden adoration and mute awe twenty years ago when elizabeth fry ventured to visit those spirits in prison the female tenants of newgate her temerity was regarded with astonishment and her hope of effecting a reformation in the miserable objects of her sympathy was held to be wholly visionary her personal safety and the blessed fruits of her labors nevertheless confirmed the language of her divine master to his disciples when he sent them forth as lambs among wolves behold i give unto you power over all the power of the enemy the still more unpromising experiment of lord ashley thus far has been equally successful and we hail it as the introduction of a new and more humane method of dealing with the victims of sin and ignorance and the temptations growing out of the inequalities and vices of civilization woman suffrage letter to the newport convention amesbury mass th th month i have received thy letter inviting me to attend the convention in behalf of womans suffrage at newport r i on the th inst i do not see how it is possible for me to accept the invitation and were i to do so the state of my health would prevent me from taking such a part in the meeting as would relieve me from the responsibility of seeming to sanction anything in its action which might conflict with my own views of duty or policy yet i should do myself great injustice if i did not embrace this occasion to express my general sympathy with the movement i have seen no good reason why mothers wives and daughters should not have the same right of person property and citizenship which fathers husbands and brothers have the sacred memory of mother and sister the wisdom and dignity of women of my own religious communion who have been accustomed to something like equality in rights as well as duties my experience as a coworker with noble and selfsacrificing women as graceful and helpful in their household duties as firm and courageous in their public advocacy of unpopular truth the steady friendships which have inspired and strengthened me and the reverence and respect which i feel for human nature irrespective of sex compel me to look with something more than acquiescence on the efforts you are making i frankly confess that i am not able to forsee all the consequences of the great social and political change proposed but of this i am at least sure it is always safe to do right and the truest expediency is simple justice i can understand without sharing the misgivings of those who fear that when the vote drops from womans hand into the ballotbox the beauty and sentiment the bloom and sweetness of womankind will go with it but in this matter it seems to me that we can trust nature stronger than statutes or conventions she will be conservative of all that the true man loves and honors in woman here and there may be found an equivocal unsexed chevalier deon but the eternal order and fitness of things will remain i have no fear that man will be less manly or woman less womanly when they meet on terms of equality before the law on the other hand i do not see that the exercise of the ballot by woman will prove a remedy for all the evils of which she justly complains it is her right as truly as mine and when she asks for it it is something less than manhood to withhold it but unsupported by a more practical education higher aims and a deeper sense of the responsibilities of life and duty it is not likely to prove a blessing in her hands any more than in mans with great respect and hearty sympathy i am very truly thy friend italian unity amesbury mass st mo th read at the great meeting in new york january in celebration of the freedom of rome and complete unity of italy it would give me more than ordinary satisfaction to attend the meeting on the th instant for the celebration of italian unity the emancipation of rome and its occupation as the permanent capital of the nation for many years i have watched with deep interest and sympathy the popular movement on the italian peninsula and especially every effort for the deliverance of rome from a despotism counting its age by centuries i looked at these struggles of the people with little reference to their ecclesiastical or sectarian bearings had i been a catholic instead of a protestant i should have hailed every symptom of roman deliverance from papal rule occupying as i have the standpoint of a republican radical desirous that all men of all creeds should enjoy the civil liberty which i prized so highly for myself i lost all confidence in the french republic of when it forfeited its own right to exist by crushing out the newly formed roman republic under mazzini and garibaldi from that hour it was doomed and the expiation of its monstrous crime is still going on my sympathies are with jules favre and leon gambetta in their efforts to establish and sustain a republic in france but i confess that the investment of paris by king william seems to me the logical sequence of the bombardment of rome by oudinot and is it not a significant fact that the terrible chassepot which made its first bloody experiment upon the halfarmed italian patriots without the walls of rome has failed in the hands of french republicans against the inferior needlegun of prussia it was said of a fierce actor in the old french revolution that he demoralized the guillotine the massacre at mentana demoralized the chassepot it is a matter of congratulation that the redemption of rome has been effected so easily and bloodlessly the despotism of a thousand years fell at a touch in noiseless rottenness the people of rome fifty to one cast their ballots of condemnation like so many shovelfuls of earth upon its grave outside of rome there seems to be a very general acquiescence in its downfall no peter the hermit preaches a crusade in its behalf no one of the great catholic powers of europe lifts a finger for it whatever may be the feelings of isabella of spain and the fugitive son of king bomba they are in no condition to come to its rescue it is reserved for american ecclesiastics loudmouthed in professions of democracy to make solemn protest against what they call an outrage which gives the people of rome the right of choosing their own government and denies the divine right of kings in the person of pio nono the withdrawal of the temporal power of the pope will prove a blessing to the catholic church as well as to the world many of its most learned and devout priests and laymen have long seen the necessity of such a change which takes from it a reproach and scandal that could no longer be excused or tolerated a century hence it will have as few apologists as the inquisition or the massacre of st bartholomew in this hour of congratulation let us not forget those whose suffering and selfsacrifice in the inscrutable wisdom of providence prepared the way for the triumph which we celebrate as we call the long illustrious roll of italian patriotism the young the brave and beautiful the grayhaired saintly confessors the scholars poets artists who shut out from human sympathy gave their lives for god and country in the slow dumb agony of prison martyrdom let us hope that they also rejoice with us and inaudible to earthly ears unite in our thanksgiving alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth he hath avenged the blood of his servants in the belief that the unity of italy and the overthrow of papal rule will strengthen the cause of liberty throughout the civilized world i am very truly thy friend indian civilization the present condition and future prospects of the remnants of the aboriginal inhabitants of this continent can scarcely be a matter of indifference to any class of the people of the united states apart from all considerations of justice and duty a purely selfish regard to our own wellbeing would compel attention to the subject the irreversible laws of gods moral government and the wellattested maxims of political and social economy leave us in no doubt that the suffering neglect and wrong of one part of the community must affect all others a common responsibility rests upon each and all to relieve suffering enlighten ignorance and redress wrong and the penalty of neglect in this respect no nation has ever escaped it is only within a comparatively recent period that the term indian civilization could be appropriately used in this country very little real progress bad been made in this direction up to the time when commissioner lang in visited the tribes now most advanced so little had been done that public opinion had acquiesced in the assumption that the indians were not susceptible of civilization and progress the few experiments had not been calculated to assure a superficial observer the unsupported efforts of elliot in new england were counteracted by the imprisonment and in some instances the massacre of his praying indians by white men under the exasperation of war with hostile tribes the salutary influence of the moravians and friends in pennsylvania was greatly weakened by the dreadful massacre of the unarmed and blameless converts of gnadenhutten but since the first visit of commissioner lang thirtythree years ago the progress of education civilization and conversion to christianity has been of a most encouraging nature and if indian civilization was ever a doubtful problem it has been practically solved the nomadic habits and warlike propensities of the native tribes are indeed formidable but not insuperable difficulties in the way of their elevation the wildest of them may compare not unfavorably with those northern barbarian hordes that swooped down upon christian europe and who were so soon the docile pupils and proselytes of the peoples they had conquered the arapahoes and camanches of our day are no further removed from the sweetness and light of christian culture than were the scandinavian sea kings of the middle centuries whose gods were patrons of rapine and cruelty their heaven a vast cloudbuilt alehouse where ghostly warriors drank from the skulls of their victims and whose hell was a frozen horror of desolation and darkness to be avoided only by diligence in robbery and courage in murder the descendants of these human butchers are now among the best exponents of the humanizing influence of the gospel of christ the report of the superintendent of the remnants of the once fierce and warlike six nations now peaceable and prosperous in canada shows that the indian is not inferior to the norse ancestors of the danes and norwegians of our day in capability of improvement it is scarcely necessary to say what is universally conceded that the wars waged by the indians against the whites have in nearly every instance been provoked by violations of solemn treaties and systematic disregard of their rights of person property and life the letter of bishop whipple of minnesota to the new york tribune of second month calls attention to the emphatic language of generals sherman harney terry and augur written after a full and searching investigation of the subject that the indian goes to war is not astonishing he is often compelled to do so wrongs are borne by him in silence which never fail to drive civilized men to deeds of violence the best possible way to avoid war is to do no injustice it is not difficult to understand the feelings of the unfortunate pioneer settlers on the extreme borders of civilization upon whom the blind vengeance of the wronged and hunted indians falls oftener than upon the real wrongdoers they point to terrible and revolting cruelties as proof that nothing short of the absolute extermination of the race can prevent their repetition but a moments consideration compels us to admit that atrocious cruelty is not peculiar to the red man all wars are cruel said general sherman and for eighteen centuries christendom has been a great battlefield what indian raid has been more dreadful than the sack of magdeburg the massacre of glencoe the nameless atrocities of the duke of alva in the netherlands the murders of st bartholomews day the unspeakable agonies of the south of france under the demoniac rule of revolution all history black with crime and red with blood is but an awful commentary upon mans inhumanity to man and it teaches us that there is nothing exceptional in the indians ferocity and vindictiveness and that the alleged reasons for his extermination would at one time or another have applied with equal force to the whole family of man a late lecture of my friend stanley pumphrey comprises more of valuable information and pertinent suggestions on the indian question than i have found in any equal space and i am glad of the opportunity to add to it my hearty endorsement and to express the conviction that its general circulation could not fail to awaken a deeper and more kindly interest in the condition of the red man and greatly aid in leading the public mind to a fuller appreciation of the responsibility which rests upon us as a people to rectify as far as possible past abuses and in our future relations to the native owners of the soil to deal justly and love mercy reading for the blind to mary c moore teacher in the perkins asylum dear friend it gives me great pleasure to know that the pupils in thy class at the institution for the blind have the opportunity afforded them to read through the sense of touch some of my writings and thus hold what i hope will prove a pleasant communion with me very glad i shall be if the penpictures of nature and homely country firesides which i have tried to make are understood and appreciated by those who cannot discern them by natural vision i shall count it a great privilege to see for them or rather to let them see through my eyes it is the mind after all that really sees shapes and colors all things what visions of beauty and sublimity passed before the inward and spiritual sight of blind milton and beethoven i have an esteemed friend morrison hendy of kentucky who is deaf and blind yet under these circumstances he has cultivated his mind to a high degree and has written poems of great beauty and vivid descriptions of scenes which have been witnessed only by the light within i thank thee for thy letter and beg of thee to assure the students that i am deeply interested in their welfare and progress and that my prayer is that their inward and spiritual eyes may become so clear that they can well dispense with the outward and material ones the indian question read at the meeting in boston may for the consideration of the condition of the indians in the united states amesbury th mo i regret that i cannot be present at the meeting called in reference to the pressing question of the day the present condition and future prospects of the indian race in the united states the old policy however well intended of the government is no longer available the westward setting tide of immigration is everywhere sweeping over the lines of the reservations there would seem to be no power in the government to prevent the practical abrogation of its solemn treaties and the crowding out of the indians from their guaranteed hunting grounds outbreaks of indian ferocity and revenge incited by wrong and robbery on the part of the whites will increasingly be made the pretext of indiscriminate massacres the entire question will soon resolve itself into the single alternative of education and civilization or extermination the school experiments at hampton carlisle and forest grove in oregon have proved if such proof were ever needed that the roving indian can be enlightened and civilized taught to work and take interest and delight in the product of his industry and settle down on his farm or in his workshop as an american citizen protected by and subject to the laws of the republic what is needed is that not only these schools should be more liberally supported but that new ones should be opened without delay the matter does not admit of procrastination the work of education and civilization must be done the money needed must be contributed with no sparing hand the laudable example set by the friends and the american missionary association should be followed by other sects and philanthropic societies christianity patriotism and enlightened self interest have a common stake in the matter great and difficult as the work may be the country is strong enough rich enough wise enough and i believe humane and christian enough to do it the republican party read at a meeting of the essex club in boston november amesbury th mo i am sorry that i cannot accept thy invitation to attend the meeting of the essex club on the th inst i should be glad to meet my old republican friends and congratulate them on the results of the election in massachusetts and especially in our good old county of essex some of our friends and neighbors who have been with us heretofore last year saw fit to vote with the opposite party i would be the last to deny their perfect right to do so or to impeach their motives but i think they were mistaken in expecting that party to reform the abuses and evils which they complained of president cleveland has proved himself better than his party and has done and said some good things which i give him full credit for but the instincts of his party are against him and must eventually prove too strong for him and instead of his carrying the party it will be likely to carry him it has already compelled him to put his hands in his pockets for electioneering purposes and travel all the way from washington to buffalo to give his vote for a spoilsman and anticivil service machine politician i would not like to call it a case of offensive partisanship but it looks a good deal like it as a republican from the outset i am proud of the noble record of the party but i should rejoice to see its beneficent work taken up by the democratic party and so faithfully carried on as to make our organization no longer necessary but as far as we can see the republican party has still its mission and its future when labor shall everywhere have its just reward and the gains of it are made secure to the earners when education shall be universal and north and south all men shall have the free and full enjoyment of civil rights and privileges irrespective of color or former condition when every vice which debases the community shall be discouraged and prohibited and every virtue which elevates it fostered and strengthened when merit and fitness shall be the conditions of office and when sectional distrust and prejudice shall give place to wellmerited confidence in the loyalty and patriotism of all then will the work of the republican party as a party be ended and all political rivalries be merged in the one great party of the people with no other aim than the common welfare and no other watchwords than peace liberty and union then may the language which milton addressed to his countrymen two centuries ago be applied to the united states go on hand in hand o peoples never to be disunited be the praise and heroic song of all posterity join your invincible might to do worthy and godlike deeds and then he who seeks to break your union a cleaving curse be his inheritance our dumb relations it was said of st francis of assisi that he had attained through the fervor of his love the secret of that deep amity with god and his creation which in the language of inspiration makes man to be in league with the stones of the field and the beasts of the field to be at peace with him the world has never been without tender souls with whom the golden rule has a broader application than its letter might seem to warrant the ancient eastern seers recognized the rights of the brute creation and regarded the unnecessary taking of the life of the humblest and meanest as a sin and in almost all the old religions of the world there are legends of saints in the depth of whose peace with god and nature all life was sacredly regarded as the priceless gift of heaven and who were thus enabled to dwell safely amidst lions and serpents it is creditable to human nature and its unperverted instincts that stories and anecdotes of reciprocal kindness and affection between men and animals are always listened to with interest and approval how pleasant to think of the arab and his horse whose friendship has been celebrated in song and romance of vogelwied the minnesinger and his bequest to the birds of the english quaker visited wherever he went by flocks of birds who with cries of joy alighted on his broadbrimmed hat and his drab coatsleeves of old samuel johnson when halfblind and infirm groping abroad of an evening for oysters for his cat of walter scott and john brown of edinburgh and their dogs of our own thoreau instinctively recognized by bird and beast as a friend emerson says of him his intimacy with animals suggested what thomas fuller records of butler the apologist that either he had told the bees things or the bees had told him snakes coiled round his legs the fishes swam into his hand he pulled the woodchuck out of his hole by his tail and took foxes under his protection from the hunters in the greatest of the ancient hindu poems the sacred book of the mahabharata there is a passage of exceptional beauty and tenderness which records the reception of king yudishthira at the gate of paradise a pilgrim to the heavenly city the king had travelled over vast spaces and one by one the loved ones the companions of his journey had all fallen and left him alone save his faithful dog which still followed he was met by indra and invited to enter the holy city but the king thinks of his friends who have fallen on the way and declines to go in without them the god tells him they are all within waiting for him joyful he is about to seek them when he looks upon the poor dog who weary and wasted crouches at his feet and asks that he too may enter the gate indra refuses and thereupon the king declares that to abandon his faithful dumb friend would be as great a sin as to kill a brahmin away with that felicity whose price is to abandon the faithful never come weal or woe will i leave my faithful dog the poor creature in fear and distress has trusted in my power to save him not therefore for life itself will i break my plighted word in full sight of heaven he chooses to go to hell with his dog and straightway descends as he supposes thither but his virtue and faithfulness change his destination to heaven and he finds himself surrounded by his old friends and in the presence of the gods who thus honor and reward his humanity and unselfish love international arbitration read at the reception in boston of the english delegation representing more than two hundred members of the british parliament who favor international arbitration amesbury th mo it is a very serious disappointment to me not to be able to be present at the welcome of the american peace society to the delegation of more than two hundred members of the british parliament who favor international arbitration few events have more profoundly impressed me than the presentation of this peaceful overture to the president of the united states it seems to me that every true patriot who seeks the best interests of his country and every believer in the gospel of christ must respond to the admirable address of sir lyon playfair and that of his colleagues who represented the workingmen of england we do not need to be told that war is always cruel barbarous and brutal whether used by professed christians with ball and bayonet or by heathen with club and boomerang we cannot be blind to its waste of life and treasure and the demoralization which follows in its train nor cease to wonder at the spectacle of christian nations exhausting all their resources in preparing to slaughter each other with only here and there a voice like count tolstois in the russian wilderness crying in heedless ears that the gospel of christ is peace not war and love not hatred the overture which comes to us from english advocates of arbitration is a cheering assurance that the tide of sentiment is turning in favor of peace among english speaking peoples i cannot doubt that whatever stump orators and newspapers may say for party purposes the heart of america will respond to the generous proposal of our kinsfolk across the water no two nations could be more favorably conditioned than england and the united states for making the holy experiment of arbitration in our associations and kinship our aims and interests our common claims in the great names and achievements of a common ancestry we are essentially one people whatever other nations may do we at least should be friends god grant that the noble and generous attempt shall not be in vain may it hasten the time when the only rivalry between us shall be the peaceful rivalry of progress and the gracious interchange of good when closer strand shall lean to strand till meet beneath saluting flags the eagle of our mountain crags the lion of our mother land suffrage for women read at the womans convention at washington oak knoll danvers mass third mo i thank thee for thy kind letter it would be a great satisfaction to be able to be present at the fortieth anniversary of the womans suffrage association but as that is not possible i can only reiterate my hearty sympathy with the object of the association and bid it take heart and assurance in view of all that has been accomplished there is no easy royal road to a reform of this kind but if the progress has been slow there has been no step backward the barriers which at first seemed impregnable in the shape of custom and prejudice have been undermined and their fall is certain a prophecy of your triumph at no distant day is in the air your opponents feel it and believe it they know that yours is a gaining and theirs a losing cause the work still before you demands on your part great patience steady perseverance a firm dignified and selfrespecting protest against the injustice of which you have so much reason to complain and of serene confidence which is not discouraged by temporary checks nor embittered by hostile criticism nor provoked to use any weapons of retort which like the boomerang fall back on the heads of those who use them you can afford in your consciousness of right to be as calm and courteous as the archangel michael who we are told in scripture in his controversy with satan himself did not bring a railing accusation against him a wise adaptation of means to ends is no yielding of principle but care should be taken to avoid all such methods as have disgraced political and religious parties of the masculine sex continue to make it manifest that all which is pure and lovely and of good repute in womanhood is entirely compatible with the exercise of the rights of citizenship and the performance of the duties which we all owe to our homes and our country confident that you will do this and with no doubt or misgiving as to your success i bid you godspeed i find i have written to the association rather than to thyself but as one of the principal originators and most faithful supporters it was very natural that i should identify thee with it the inner life the agency of evil from the supernaturalism of new england in the democratic review for in this life of ours so full of mystery so hung about with wonders so written over with dark riddles where even the lights held by prophets and inspired ones only serve to disclose the solemn portals of a future state of being leaving all beyond in shadow perhaps the darkest and most difficult problem which presents itself is that of the origin of evil the source whence flow the black and bitter waters of sin and suffering and discord the wrong which all men see in others and feel in themselves the unmistakable facts of human depravity and misery a superficial philosophy may attempt to refer all these dark phenomena of mans existence to his own passions circumstances and will but the thoughtful observer cannot rest satisfied with secondary causes the grossest materialism at times reveals something of that latent dread of an invisible and spiritual influence which is inseparable from our nature like eliphaz the temanite it is conscious of a spirit passing before its face the form whereof is not discerned it is indeed true that our modern divines and theologians as if to atone for the too easy credulity of their order formerly have unceremoniously consigned the old beliefs of satanic agency demoniacal possession and witchcraft to miltons receptacle of exploded follies and detected impostures over the backside of the world far off into a limbo broad and large and called the paradise of fools that indeed out of their peculiar province and apart from the routine of their vocation they have become the most thorough sceptics and unbelievers among us yet it must be owned that if they have not the marvellous themselves they are the cause of it in others in certain states of mind the very sight of a clergyman in his sombre professional garb is sufficient to awaken all the wonderful within us imagination goes wandering back to the subtle priesthood of mysterious egypt we think of jannes and jambres of the persian magi dim oak groves with druid altars and priests and victims rise before us for what is the priest even of our new england but a living testimony to the truth of the supernatural and the reality of the unseen a man of mystery walking in the shadow of the ideal world by profession an expounder of spiritual wonders laugh he may at the old tales of astrology and witchcraft and demoniacal possession but does he not believe and bear testimony to his faith in the reality of that dark essence which scripture more than hints at which has modified more or less all the religious systems and speculations of the heathen world the ahriman of the parsee the typhon of the egyptian the pluto of the roman mythology the devil of jew christian and mussulman the machinito of the indian evil in the universe of goodness darkness in the light of divine intelligence in itself the great and crowning mystery from which by no unnatural process of imagination may be deduced everything which our forefathers believed of the spiritual world and supernatural agency that fearful being with his tributaries and agents the devil and his angels how awfully he rises before us in the brief outline limning of the sacred writers how he glooms in shape and gesture proudly eminent on the immortal canvas of milton and dante what a note of horror does his name throw into the sweet sabbath psalmody of our churches what strange dark fancies are connected with the very language of commonlaw indictments when grand juries find under oath that the offence complained of has been committed at the instigation of the devil how hardly effaced are the impressions of childhood even at this day at the mention of the evil angel an image rises before me like that with which i used especially to horrify myself in an old copy of pilgrims progress horned hoofed scaly and firebreathing his caudal extremity twisted tight with rage i remember him illustrating the tremendous encounter of christian in the valley where apollyon straddled over the whole breadth of the way there was another print of the enemy which made no slight impression upon me it was the frontispiece of an old smoked snuffstained pamphlet the property of an elderly lady who had a fine collection of similar wonders wherewith she was kind enough to edify her young visitors containing a solemn account of the fate of a wicked dancingparty in new jersey whose irreverent declaration that they would have a fiddler if they had to send to the lower regions after him called up the fiend himself who forthwith commenced playing while the company danced to the music incessantly without the power to suspend their exercise until their feet and legs were worn off to the knees the rude woodcut represented the demon fiddler and his agonized companions literally stumping it up and down in cotillons jigs strathspeys and reels he would have answered very well to the description of the infernal piper in tam oshanter to this popular notion of the impersonation of the principle of evil we are doubtless indebted for the whole dark legacy of witchcraft and possession failing in our efforts to solve the problem of the origin of evil we fall back upon the idea of a malignant being the antagonism of good of this mysterious and dreadful personification we find ourselves constrained to speak with a degree of that awe and reverence which are always associated with undefined power and the ability to harm the devil says an old writer is a dignity though his glory be somewhat faded and wan and is to be spoken of accordingly the evil principle of zoroaster was from eternity selfcreated and existent and some of the early christian sects held the same opinion the gospel however affords no countenance to this notion of a divided sovereignty of the universe the divine teacher it is true in discoursing of evil made use of the language prevalent in his time and which was adapted to the gross conceptions of his jewish bearers but he nowhere presents the embodiment of sin as an antagonism to the absolute power and perfect goodness of god of whom and through whom and to whom are all things pure himself he can create nothing impure evil therefore has no eternity in the past the fact of its present actual existence is indeed strongly stated and it is not given us to understand the secret of that divine alchemy whereby pain and sin and discord become the means to beneficent ends worthy of the revealed attributes of the infinite parent unsolved by human reason or philosophy the dark mystery remains to baffle the generations of men and only to the eye of humble and childlike faith can it ever be reconciled to the purity justice and mercy of him who is light and in whom is no darkness at all do you not believe in the devil some one once asked the nonconformist robinson i believe in god was the reply dont you henry of nettesheim says that it is unanimously maintained that devils do wander up and down in the earth but what they are or how they are ecclesiasticals have not clearly expounded origen in his platonic speculations on this subject supposed them to be spirits who by repentance might be restored that in the end all knees might be bowed to the father of spirits and he become all in all justin martyr was of the opinion that many of them still hoped for their salvation and the cabalists held that this hope of theirs was well founded one is irresistibly reminded here of the closing verse of the address to the deil by burns but fare ye weel auld nickie ben gin ye wad take a thought and mend ye aiblins might i dinna ken still has a stake im was to think upon yon den fen for your sake the old schoolmen and fathers seem to agree that the devil and his ministers have bodies in some sort material subject to passions and liable to injury and pain origen has a curious notion that any evil spirit who in a contest with a human being is defeated loses from thenceforth all his power of mischief and may be compared to a wasp who has lost his sting the devil said samson occum the famous indian preacher in a discourse on temperance is a gentleman and never drinks nevertheless it is a remarkable fact and worthy of the serious consideration of all who tarry long at the wine that in that state of the drunkards malady known as delirium tremens the adversary in some shape or other is generally visible to the sufferers or at least as winslow says of the powahs he appeareth more familiarly to them than to others i recollect a statement made to me by a gentleman who has had bitter experience of the evils of intemperance and who is at this time devoting his fine talents to the cause of philanthropy and mercy as the editor of one of our best temperance journals which left a most vivid impression on my mind he had just returned from a seavoyage and for the sake of enjoying a debauch unmolested by his friends took up his abode in a rumselling tavern in a somewhat lonely location on the seaboard here he drank for many days without stint keeping himself the whole time in a state of semiintoxication one night he stood leaning against a tree looking listlessly and vacantly out upon the ocean the waves breaking on the beach and the white sails of passing vessels vaguely impressing him like the pictures of a dream he was startled by a voice whispering hoarsely in his ear you have murdered a man the officers of justice are after you you must fly for your life every syllable was pronounced slowly and separately and there was something in the hoarse gasping sound of the whisper which was indescribably dreadful he looked around him and seeing nothing but the clear moonlight on the grass became partially sensible that he was the victim of illusion and a sudden fear of insanity thrilled him with a momentary horror rallying himself he returned to the tavern drank another glass of brandy and retired to his chamber he had scarcely lain his head on the pillow when he heard that hoarse low but terribly distinct whisper repeating the same words he describes his sensations at this time as inconceivably fearful reason was struggling with insanity but amidst the confusion and mad disorder one terrible thought evolved itself had he not in a moment of mad frenzy of which his memory made no record actually murdered some one and was not this a warning from heaven leaving his bed and opening his door he heard the words again repeated with the addition in a tone of intense earnestness follow me he walked forward in the direction of the sound through a long entry to the head of the staircase where he paused for a moment when again he heard the whisper halfway down the stairs follow me trembling with terror he passed down two flights of stairs and found himself treading on the cold brick floor of a large room in the basement or cellar where he had never been before the voice still beckoned him onward and groping after it his hand touched an upright post against which he leaned for a moment he heard it again apparently only two or three yards in front of him you have murdered a man the officers are close behind you follow me putting one foot forward while his hand still grasped the post it fell upon empty air and he with difficulty recovered himself stooping down and feeling with his hands he found himself on the very edge of a large uncovered cistern or tank filled nearly to the top with water the sudden shock of this discovery broke the horrible enchantment the whisperer was silent he believed at the time that he had been the subject and wellnigh the victim of a diabolical delusion and he states that even now with the recollection of that strange whisper is always associated a thought of the universal tempter our worthy ancestors were in their own view of the matter the advance guard and forlorn hope of christendom in its contest with the bad angel the new world into which they had so valiantly pushed the outposts of the church militant was to them not gods world but the devils they stood there on their little patch of sanctified territory like the gamekeeper of der freischutz in the charmed circle within were prayer and fasting unmelodious psalmody and solemn hewing of heretics before the lord in gilgal without were dogs and sorcerers red children of perdition powah wizards and the foul fiend in their grand old wilderness broken by fair broad rivers and dotted with loveliest lakes hanging with festoons of leaf and vine and flower the steep sides of mountains whose naked tops rose over the surrounding verdure like altars of a giant world with its early summer greenness and the manycolored wonder of its autumn all glowing as if the rainbows of a summer shower had fallen upon it under the clear rich light of a sun to which the misty day of their cold island was as moonlight they saw no beauty they recognized no holy revelation it was to them terrible as the forest which dante traversed on his way to the world of pain every advance step they made was upon the enemys territory and one has only to read the writings of the two mathers to perceive that that enemy was to them no metaphysical abstraction no scholastic definition no figment of a poetical fancy but a living active reality alternating between the sublimest possibilities of evil and the lowest details of mean mischief now a tricksy spirit disturbing the goodwifes platters or soiling her newwashed linen and anon riding the stormcloud and pointing its thunderbolts for as the elder mather pertinently inquires how else is it that our meetinghouses are burned by the lightning what was it for instance but his subtlety which speaking through the lips of madame hutchinson confuted the judges of israel and put to their wits end the godly ministers of the puritan zion was not his evil finger manifested in the contumacious heresy of roger williams who else gave the jesuit missionaries locusts from the pit as they were such a hold on the affections of those very savages who would not have scrupled to hang the scalp of pious father wilson himself from their girdles to the vigilant eye of puritanism was he not alike discernible in the light wantonness of the maypole revellers beating time with the cloven foot to the vain music of obscene dances and in the silent hatcanopied gatherings of the quakers the most melancholy of the sects as dr moore calls them perilous and glorious was it under these circumstances for such men as mather and stoughton to gird up their stout loins and do battle with the unmeasured allsurrounding terror let no man lightly estimate their spiritual knighterrantry the heroes of old romance who went about smiting dragons lopping giants heads and otherwise pleasantly diverting themselves scarcely deserve mention in comparison with our new england champions who trusting not to carnal sword and lance in a contest with principalities and powers spirits that live throughout vital in every part not as frail man encountered their enemies with weapons forged by the stern spiritual armorer of geneva the life of cotton mather is as full of romance as the legends of ariosto or the tales of beltenebros and florisando in amadis de gaul all about him was enchanted ground devils glared on him in his closet wrestlings portents blazed in the heavens above him while he commissioned and set apart as the watcher and warder and spiritual champion of the chosen people stood ever ready for battle with open eye and quick ear for the detection of the subtle approaches of the enemy no wonder is it that the spirits of evil combined against him that they beset him as they did of old st anthony that they shut up the bowels of the general court against his longcherished hope of the presidency of old harvard that they even had the audacity to lay hands on his antidiabolical manuscripts or that ye divil that was in ye girl flewe at and tore his grand sermon against witches how edifying is his account of the young bewitched maiden whom he kept in his house for the purpose of making experiments which should satisfy all obstinate sadducees how satisfactory to orthodoxy and confounding to heresy is the nice discrimination of ye divil in ye girl who was choked in attempting to read the catechism yet found no trouble with a pestilent quaker pamphlet who was quiet and goodhumored when the worthy doctor was idle but went into paroxysms of rage when he sat down to indite his diatribes against witches and familiar spirits the quakers appear to have at a comparatively early period emancipated themselves in a great degree from the grosser superstitions of their times william penn indeed had a law in his colony against witchcraft but the first trial of a person suspected of this offence seems to have opened his eyes to its absurdity george fox judging from one or two passages in his journal appears to have held the common opinions of the day on the subject yet when confined in doomsdale dungeon on being told that the place was haunted and that the spirits of those who had died there still walked at night in his room he replied that if all the spirits and devils in hell were there he was over them in the power of god and feared no such thing the enemies of the quakers in order to account for the power and influence of their first preachers accused them of magic and sorcery the priest of wakefield says george fox one trusts he does not allude to our old friend the vicar raised many wicked slanders upon me as that i carried bottles with me and made people drink and that made them follow me that i rode upon a great black horse and was seen in one county upon my black horse in one hour and in the same hour in another county fourscore miles off in his account of the mob which beset him at walney island he says when i came to myself i saw james lancasters wife throwing stones at my face and her husband lying over me to keep off the blows and stones for the people had persuaded her that i had bewitched her husband cotton mather attributes the plague of witchcraft in new england in about an equal degree to the quakers and indians the first of the sect who visited boston ann austin and mary fisher the latter a young girl were seized upon by deputygovernor bellingham in the absence of governor endicott and shamefully stripped naked for the purpose of ascertaining whether they were witches with the devils mark on them in elizabeth horton and joan broksop two venerable preachers of the sect were arrested in boston charged by governor endicott with being witches and carried two days journey into the woods and left to the tender mercies of indians and wolves all this is pleasant enough now we can laugh at the doctor and his demons but little matter of laughter was it to the victims on salem hill to the prisoners in the jails to poor giles corey tortured with planks upon his breast which forced the tongue from his mouth and his life from his old palsied body to bereaved and quaking families to a whole community priestridden and spectresmitten gasping in the sick dream of a spiritual nightmare and given over to believe a lie we may laugh for the grotesque is blended with the horrible but we must also pity and shudder the clearsighted men who confronted that delusion in its own age disenchanting with strong good sense and sharp ridicule their spellbound generation the german wierus the italian dapone the english scot and the new england calef deserve high honors as the benefactors of their race it is true they were branded through life as infidels and damnable sadducees but the truth which they uttered lived after them and wrought out its appointed work for it had a divine commission and godspeed the oracles are dumb no voice nor hideous hum runs through the arched roof in words deceiving apollo from his shrine can now no more divine with hollow shriek the steep of delphus leaving dimmer and dimmer as the generations pass away this tremendous terror this allpervading espionage of evil this active incarnation of motiveless malignity presents itself to the imagination the once imposing and solemn rite of exorcism has become obsolete in the church men are no longer in any quarter of the world racked or pressed under planks to extort a confession of diabolical alliance the heretic now laughs to scorn the solemn farce of the church which in the name of the allmerciful formally delivers him over to satan and for the sake of abused and longcheated humanity let us rejoice that it is so when we consider how for long weary centuries the millions of professed christendom stooped awestricken under the yoke of spiritual and temporal despotism grinding on from generation to generation in a despair which had passed complaining because superstition in alliance with tyranny had filled their upward pathway to freedom with shapes of terror the spectres of gods wrath to the uttermost the fiend and that torment the smoke of which rises forever through fear of a satan of the future a sort of bandog of priestcraft held in its leash and ready to be let loose upon the disputers of its authority our toiling brothers of past ages have permitted their human taskmasters to convert gods beautiful world so adorned and fitted for the peace and happiness of all into a great prisonhouse of suffering filled with the actual terrors which the imagination of the old poets gave to the realm of rhadamanthus and hence while i would not weaken in the slightest degree the influence of that doctrine of future retribution the accountability of the spirit for the deeds done in the body the truth of which reason revelation and conscience unite in attesting as the necessary result of the preservation in another state of existence of the souls individuality and identity i must nevertheless rejoice that the many are no longer willing to permit the few for their especial benefit to convert our common fathers heritage into a present hell where in return for undeserved suffering and toil uncompensated they can have gracious and comfortable assurance of release from a future one better is the fear of the lord than the fear of the devil holier and more acceptable the obedience of love and reverence than the submission of slavish terror the heart which has felt the beauty of holiness which has been in some measure attuned to the divine harmony which now as of old in the angelhymn of the advent breathes of glory to god peace on earth and goodwill to men in the serene atmosphere of that perfect love which casteth out fear smiles at the terrors which throng the sick dreams of the sensual which draw aside the nightcurtains of guilt and startle with whispers of revenge the oppressor of the poor there is a beautiful moral in one of fouques miniature romances die kohlerfamilie the fierce spectre which rose giantlike in its bloodred mantle before the selfish and mercenary merchant ever increasing in size and terror with the growth of evil and impure thought in the mind of the latter subdued by prayer and penitence and patient watchfulness over the hearts purity became a loving and gentle visitation of soft light and meekest melody a beautiful radiance at times hovering and flowing on before the traveller illuminating the bushes and foliage of the mountainforest a lustre strange and lovely such as the soul may conceive but no words express he felt its power in the depths of his being felt it like the mystic breathing of the spirit of god the excellent baxter and other pious men of his day deprecated in all sincerity and earnestness the growing disbelief in witchcraft and diabolical agency fearing that mankind losing faith in a visible satan and in the supernatural powers of certain paralytic old women would diverge into universal skepticism it is one of the saddest of sights to see these good men standing sentry at the horn gate of dreams attempting against the most discouraging odds to defend their poor fallacies from profane and irreverent investigation painfully pleading doubtful scripture and still more doubtful tradition in behalf of detected and convicted superstitions tossed on the sharp horns of ridicule stretched on the rack of philosophy or perishing under the exhausted receiver of science a clearer knowledge of the aspirations capacities and necessities of the human soul and of the revelations which the infinite spirit makes to it not only through the senses by the phenomena of outward nature but by that inward and direct communion which under different names has been recognized by the devout and thoughtful of every religious sect and school of philosophy would have saved them much anxious labor and a good deal of reproach withal in their hopeless championship of error the witches of baxter and the black man of mather have vanished belief in them is no longer possible on the part of sane men but this mysterious universe through which half veiled in its own shadow our dim little planet is wheeling with its star worlds and thoughtwearying spaces remains natures mighty miracle is still over and around us and hence awe wonder and reverence remain to be the inheritance of humanity still are there beautiful repentances and holy deathbeds and still over the souls darkness and confusion rises starlike the great idea of duty by higher and better influences than the poor spectres of superstition man must henceforth be taught to reverence the invisible and in the consciousness of his own weakness and sin and sorrow to lean with childlike trust on the wisdom and mercy of an overruling providence walking by faith through the shadow and mystery and cheered by the remembrance that whatever may be his apparent allotment gods greatness flows around our incompleteness round our restlessness his rest it is a sad spectacle to find the glad tidings of the christian faith and its reasonable service of devotion transformed by fanaticism and credulity into superstitious terror and wild extravagance but if possible there is one still sadder it is that of men in our own time regarding with satisfaction such evidences of human weakness and professing to find in them new proofs of their miserable theory of a godless universe and new occasion for sneering at sincere devotion as cant and humble reverence as fanaticism alas in comparison with such the religious enthusiast who in the midst of his delusion still feels that he is indeed a living soul and an heir of immortality to whom god speaks from the immensities of his universe is a sane man better is it in a life like ours to be even a howling dervis or a dancing shaker confronting imaginary demons with thalabas talisman of faith than to lose the consciousness of our own spiritual nature and look upon ourselves as mere brute masses of animal organization barnacles on a dead universe looking into the dull grave with no hope beyond it earth gazing into earth and saying to corruption thou art my father and to the worm thou art my sister hamlet among the graves an amiable enthusiast immortal in his beautiful little romance of paul and virginia has given us in his miscellanies a chapter on the pleasures of tombs a title singular enough yet not inappropriate for the meekspirited and sentimental author has given in his own flowing and eloquent language its vindication there is says he a voluptuous melancholy arising from the contemplation of tombs the result like every other attractive sensation of the harmony of two opposite principles from the sentiment of our fleeting life and that of our immortality which unite in view of the last habitation of mankind a tomb is a monument erected on the confines of two worlds it first presents to us the end of the vain disquietudes of life and the image of everlasting repose it afterwards awakens in us the confused sentiment of a blessed immortality the probabilities of which grow stronger and stronger in proportion as the person whose memory is recalled was a virtuous character it is from this intellectual instinct therefore in favor of virtue that the tombs of great men inspire us with a veneration so affecting from the same sentiment too it is that those which contain objects that have been lovely excite so much pleasing regret for the attractions of love arise entirely out of the appearances of virtue hence it is that we are moved at the sight of the small hillock which covers the ashes of an infant from the recollection of its innocence hence it is that we are melted into tenderness on contemplating the tomb in which is laid to repose a young female the delight and the hope of her family by reason of her virtues in order to give interest to such monuments there is no need of bronzes marbles and gildings the more simple they are the more energy they communicate to the sentiment of melancholy they produce a more powerful effect when poor rather than rich antique rather than modern with details of misfortune rather than titles of honor with the attributes of virtue rather than with those of power it is in the country principally that their impression makes itself felt in a very lively manner a simple unornamented grave there causes more tears to flow than the gaudy splendor of a cathedral interment there it is that grief assumes sublimity it ascends with the aged yews in the churchyard it extends with the surrounding hills and plains it allies itself with all the effects of nature with the dawning of the morning with the murmuring of wind with the setting of the sun and with the darkness of the night not long since i took occasion to visit the cemetery near this city it is a beautiful location for a city of the dead a tract of some forty or fifty acres on the eastern bank of the concord gently undulating and covered with a heavy growth of foresttrees among which the white oak is conspicuous the ground beneath has been cleared of undergrowth and is marked here and there with monuments and railings enclosing family lots it is a quiet peaceful spot the city with its crowded mills its busy streets and teeming life is hidden from view not even a solitary farmhouse attracts the eye all is still and solemn as befits the place where man and nature lie down together where leaves of the great lifetree shaken down by death mingle and moulder with the frosted foliage of the autumnal forest yet the contrast of busy life is not wanting the lowell and boston railroad crosses the river within view of the cemetery and standing there in the silence and shadow one can see the long trains rushing along their iron pathway thronged with living breathing humanity the young the beautiful the gay busy wealthseeking manhood of middle years the child at its mothers knee the old man with whitened hairs hurrying on on car after car like the generations of man sweeping over the track of time to their last still restingplace it is not the aged and the sad of heart who make this a place of favorite resort the young the buoyant the lighthearted come and linger among these flowersown graves watching the sunshine falling in broken light upon these cold white marbles and listening to the song of birds in these leafy recesses beautiful and sweet to the young heart is the gentle shadow of melancholy which here falls upon it soothing yet sad a sentiment midway between joy and sorrow how true is it that in the language of wordsworth in youth we love the darkling lawn brushed by the owlets wing then evening is preferred to dawn and autumn to the spring sad fancies do we then affect in luxury of disrespect to our own prodigal excess of too familiar happiness the chinese from the remotest antiquity have adorned and decorated their gravegrounds with shrubs and sweet flowers as places of popular resort the turks have their graveyards planted with trees through which the sun looks in upon the turban stones of the faithful and beneath which the relatives of the dead sit in cheerful converse through the long days of summer in all the luxurious quiet and happy indifference of the indolent east most of the visitors whom i met at the lowell cemetery wore cheerful faces some sauntered laughingly along apparently unaffected by the associations of the place too full perhaps of life and energy and high hope to apply to themselves the stern and solemn lesson which is taught even by these flowergarlanded mounds but for myself i confess that i am always awed by the presence of the dead i cannot jest above the gravestone my spirit is silenced and rebuked before the tremendous mystery of which the grave reminds me and involuntarily pays the deep reverence taught of old the homage of mans heart to death even natures cheerful air and sun and birdvoices only serve to remind me that there are those beneath who have looked on the same green leaves and sunshine felt the same soft breeze upon their cheeks and listened to the same wild music of the woods for the last time then too comes the saddening reflection to which so many have given expression that these trees will put forth their leaves the slant sunshine still fall upon green meadows and banks of flowers and the song of the birds and the ripple of waters still be heard after our eyes and ears have closed forever it is hard for us to realize this we are so accustomed to look upon these things as a part of our life environment that it seems strange that they should survive us tennyson in his exquisite metaphysical poem of the two voices has given utterance to this sentiment alas though i should die i know that all about the thorn will blow in tufts of rosytinted snow not less the bee will range her cells the furzy prickle fire the dells the foxglove cluster dappled bells the pleasures of the tombs undoubtedly in the language of the idumean seer there are many who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they can find the grave who long for it as the servant earnestly desireth the shadow rest rest to the sick heart and the weary brain to the long afflicted and the hopeless rest on the calm bosom of our common mother welcome to the tired ear stunned and confused with lifes jarring discords the everlasting silence grateful to the weary eyes which have seen evil and not good the everlasting shadow yet over all hangs the curtain of a deep mystery a curtain lifted only on one side by the hands of those who are passing under its solemn shadow no voice speaks to us from beyond it telling of the unknown state no hand from within puts aside the dark drapery to reveal the mysteries towards which we are all moving man giveth up the ghost and where is he thanks to our heavenly father he has not left us altogether without an answer to this momentous question over the blackness of darkness a light is shining the valley of the shadow of death is no longer a land of darkness and where the light is as darkness the presence of a serene and holy life pervades it above its pale tombs and crowded burialplaces above the wail of despairing humanity the voice of him who awakened life and beauty beneath the graveclothes of the tomb at bethany is heard proclaiming i am the resurrection and the life we know not it is true the conditions of our future life we know not what it is to pass fromm this state of being to another but before us in that dark passage has gone the man of nazareth and the light of his footsteps lingers in the path where he our brother in his humanity our redeemer in his divine nature has gone let us not fear to follow he who ordereth all aright will uphold with his own great arm the frail spirit when its incarnation is ended and it may be that in language which i have elsewhere used when times veil shall fall asunder the soul may know no fearful change nor sudden wonder nor sink the weight of mystery under but with the upward rise and with the vastness grow and all we shrink from now may seem no new revealing familiar as our childhoods stream or pleasant memory of a dream the loved and cherished past upon the new life stealing serene and mild the untried light may have its dawning as meet in summers northern night the evening gray and dawning white the sunset hues of time blend with the souls new morning swedenborg there are times when looking only on the surface of things one is almost ready to regard lowell as a sort of sacred city of mammon the benares of gain its huge mills temples its crowded dwellings lodgingplaces of disciples and proselytes within the gate its warehouses stalls for the sale of relics a very mean idolworship too unrelieved by awe and reverence a selfish earthwardlooking devotion to the leasterected spirit that fell from paradise i grow weary of seeing man and mechanism reduced to a common level moved by the same impulse answering to the same bellcall a nightmare of materialism broods over all i long at times to hear a voice crying through the streets like that of one of the old prophets proclaiming the great first truth that the lord alone is god yet is there not another side to the picture high over sounding workshops spires glisten in the sun silent fingers pointing heavenward the workshops themselves are instinct with other and subtler processes than cottonspinning or carpetweaving each human being who watches beside jack or power loom feels more or less intensely that it is a solemn thing to live here are sin and sorrow yearnings for lost peace outgushing gratitude of forgiven spirits hopes and fears which stretch beyond the horizon of time into eternity death is here the graveyard utters its warning over all bends the eternal heaven in its silence and mystery nature even here is mightier than art and god is above all underneath the din of labor and the sounds of traffic a voice felt rather than beard reaches the heart prompting the same fearful questions which stirred the soul of the worlds oldest poet if a man die shall he live again man giveth up the ghost and where is he out of the depths of burdened and weary hearts comes up the agonizing inquiry what shall i do to be saved who shall deliver me from the body of this death as a matter of course in a city like this composed of all classes of our manysided population a great variety of religious sects have their representatives in lowell the young city is dotted over with steeple houses most of them of the yankee order of architecture the episcopalians have a house of worship on merrimac street a pile of dark stone with low gothic doors and arched windows a plat of grass lies between it and the dusty street and near it stands the dwellinghouse intended for the minister built of the same material as the church and surrounded by trees and shrubbery the attention of the stranger is also attracted by another consecrated building on the hill slope of belvidere one of irvings a shingle palaces painted in imitation of stone a great wooden sham whelked and horned with pine spires and turrets a sort of whittled representation of the manybeaded beast of the apocalypse in addition to the established sects which have reared their visible altars in the city of spindles there are many who have not yet marked the boundaries or set up the pillars and stretched out the curtains of their sectarian tabernacles who in halls and upper chambers and in the solitude of their own homes keep alive the spirit of devotion and wrapping closely around them the mantles of their order maintain the integrity of its peculiarities in the midst of an unbelieving generation not long since in company with a friend who is a regular attendant i visited the little meeting of the disciples of emanuel swedenborg passing over chapel hill and leaving the city behind us we reached the stream which winds through the beautiful woodlands at the powder mills and mingles its waters with the concord the hall in which the followers of the gothland seer meet is small and plain with unpainted seats like those of the people called quakers and looks out upon the still woods and that willowy stream which turns a mill an organ of small size yet as it seemed to me vastly out of proportion with the room filled the place usually occupied by the pulpit which was here only a plain desk placed modestly by the side of it the congregation have no regular preacher but the exercises of reading the scriptures prayers and selections from the book of worship were conducted by one of the lay members a manuscript sermon by a clergyman of the order in boston was read and apparently listened to with much interest it was well written and deeply imbued with the doctrines of the church i was impressed by the gravity and serious earnestness of the little audience there were here no circumstances calculated to excite enthusiasm nothing of the pomp of religious rites and ceremonies only a settled conviction of the truth of the doctrines of their faith could have thus brought them together i could scarcely make the fact a reality as i sat among them that here in the midst of our bare and hard utilities in the very centre and heart of our mechanical civilization were devoted and undoubting believers in the mysterious and wonderful revelations of the swedish prophet revelations which look through all external and outward manifestations to inward realities which regard all objects in the world of sense only as the types and symbols of the world of spirit literally unmasking the universe and laying bare the profoundest mysteries of life the character and writings of emanuel swedenborg constitute one of the puzzles and marvels of metaphysics and psychology a man remarkable for his practical activities an ardent scholar of the exact sciences versed in all the arcana of physics a skilful and inventive mechanician he has evolved from the hard and gross materialism of his studies a system of transcendent spiritualism from his aggregation of cold and apparently lifeless practical facts beautiful and wonderful abstractions start forth like blossoms on the rod of the levite a politician and a courtier a man of the world a mathematician engaged in the soberest details of the science he has given to the world in the simplest and most natural language a series of speculations upon the great mystery of being detailed matteroffact narratives of revelations from the spiritual world which at once appall us by their boldness and excite our wonder at their extraordinary method logical accuracy and perfect consistency these remarkable speculations the workings of a mind in which a powerful imagination allied itself with superior reasoning faculties the marvellous current of whose thought ran only in the diked and guarded channels of mathematical demonstration he uniformly speaks of as facts his perceptions of abstractions were so intense that they seem to have reached that point where thought became sensible to sight as well as feeling what he thought that he saw he relates his visions of the spiritual world as he would the incidents of a walk round his own city of stockholm one can almost see him in his brown coat and velvet breeches lifting his cocked hat to an angel or keeping an unsavory spirit at arms length with that goldheaded cane which his london host describes as his inseparable companion in walking his graphic descriptions have always an air of naturalness and probability yet there is a minuteness of detail at times almost bordering on the ludicrous in his memorable relations he manifests nothing of the imagination of milton overlooking the closed gates of paradise or following the pained fiend in his flight through chaos nothing of dantes terrible imagery appalls us we are led on from heaven to heaven very much as defoe leads us after his shipwrecked crusoe we can scarcely credit the fact that we are not traversing our lower planet and the angels seem vastly like our common acquaintances we seem to recognize the john smiths and mr browns and the old familiar faces of our mundane habitation the evil principle in swedenborgs picture is not the colossal and massive horror of the inferno nor that stern wrestler with fate who darkens the canvas of paradise lost but an aggregation of poor confused spirits seeking rest and finding none save in the unsavory atmosphere of the falses these small fry of devils remind us only of certain unfortunate fellows whom we have known who seem incapable of living in good and wholesome society and who are manifestly given over to believe a lie thus it is that the very heavens and hells of the swedish mystic seem to be of the earth earthy he brings the spiritual world into close analogy with the material one in this hurried paper i have neither space nor leisure to attempt an analysis of the great doctrines which underlie the revelations of swedenborg his remarkably suggestive books are becoming familiar to the reading and reflecting portion of the community they are not unworthy of study but in the language of another i would say emulate swedenborg in his exemplary life his learning his virtues his independent thought his desire for wisdom his love of the good and true aim to be his equal his superior in these things but call no man your master the better land the shapings of our heavens are the modifications of our constitution said charles lamb in his reply to southeys attack upon him in the quarterly review he who is infinite in love as well as wisdom has revealed to us the fact of a future life and the fearfully important relation in which the present stands to it the actual nature and conditions of that life he has hidden from us no chart of the ocean of eternity is given us no celestial guidebook or geography defines localizes and prepares us for the wonders of the spiritual world hence imagination has a wide field for its speculations which so long as they do not positively contradict the revelation of the scriptures cannot be disproved we naturally enough transfer to our idea of heaven whatever we love and reverence on earth thither the catholic carries in his fancy the imposing rites and timehonored solemnities of his worship there the methodist sees his lovefeasts and campmeetings in the groves and by the still waters and green pastures of the blessed abodes the quaker in the stillness of his selfcommuning remembers that there was silence in heaven the churchman listening to the solemn chant of weal music or the deep tones of the organ thinks of the song of the elders and the golden harps of the new jerusalem the heaven of the northern nations of europe was a gross and sensual reflection of the earthly life of a barbarous and brutal people the indians of north america had a vague notion of a sunset land a beautiful paradise far in the west mountains and forests filled with deer and buffalo lakes and streams swarming with fishes the happy huntingground of souls in a late letter from a devoted missionary among the western indians paul blohm a converted jew we have noticed a beautiful illustration of this belief near the omaha missionhouse on a high luff was a solitary indian grave one evening says the missionary having come home with some cattle which i had been seeking i heard some one wailing and looking in the direction from whence i proceeded i found it to be from the grave near our house in a moment after a mourner rose up from a kneeling or lying posture and turning to the setting sun stretched forth his arms in prayer and supplication with an intensity and earnestness as though he would detain the splendid luminary from running his course with his body leaning forward and his arms stretched towards the sun he presented a most striking figure of sorrow and petition it was solemnly awful he seemed to me to be one of the ancients come forth to teach me how to pray a venerable and worthy new england clergyman on his deathbed just before the close of his life declared that he was only conscious of an awfully solemn and intense curiosity to know the great secret of death and eternity the excellent dr nelson of missouri was one who while on earth seemed to live another and higher life in the contemplation of infinite purity and happiness a friend once related an incident concerning him which made a deep impression upon my mind they had been travelling through a summers forenoon in the prairie and had lain down to rest beneath a solitary tree the doctor lay for a long time silently looking upwards through the openings of the boughs into the still heavens when he repeated the following lines in a low tone as if communing with himself in view of the wonders he described o the joys that are there mortal eye bath not seen o the songs they sing there with hosannas between o the thriceblessed song of the lamb and of moses o brightness on brightness the pearl gate uncloses o white wings of angels o fields white with roses o white tents of peace where the rapt soul reposes o the waters so still and the pastures so green the brief hints afforded us by the sacred writings concerning the better land are inspiring and beautiful eye hath not seen nor the ear heard neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive of the good in store for the righteous heaven is described as a quiet habitation a rest remaining for the people of god tears shall be wiped away from all eyes there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain to how many deathbeds have these words spoken peace how many failing hearts have gathered strength from them to pass through the dark valley of shadows yet we should not forget that the kingdom of heaven is within that it is the state and affections of the soul the answer of a good conscience the sense of harmony with god a condition of time as well as of eternity what is really momentous and allimportant with us is the present by which the future is shaped and colored a mere change of locality cannot alter the actual and intrinsic qualities of the soul guilt and remorse would make the golden streets of paradise intolerable as the burning marl of the infernal abodes while purity and innocence would transform hell itself into heaven dora green well first published as an introduction to an american edition of that authors the patience of hope there are men who irrespective of the names by which they are called in the babel confusion of sects are endeared to the common heart of christendom our doors open of their own accord to receive them for in them we feel that in some faint degree and with many limitations the divine is again manifested something of the infinite love shines out of them their very garments have healing and fragrance borrowed from the bloom of paradise so of books there are volumes which perhaps contain many things in the matter of doctrine and illustration to which our reason does not assent but which nevertheless seem permeated with a certain sweetness and savor of life they have the divine seal and imprimatur they are fragrant with heartsease and asphodel tonic with the leaves which are for the healing of the nations the meditations of the devout monk of kempen are the common heritage of catholic and protestant our hearts burn within us as we walk with augustine under numidian figtrees in the gardens of verecundus feuelon from his bishops palace and john woolman from his tailors shop speak to us in the same language the unknown author of that book which luther loved next to his bible the theologia germanica is just as truly at home in this present age and in the ultra protestantism of new england as in the heart of catholic europe and in the fourteenth century for such books know no limitations of time or place they have the perpetual freshness and fitness of truth they speak out of profound experience heart answers to heart as we read them the spirit that is in man and the inspiration that giveth understanding bear witness to them the bent and stress of their testimony are the same whether written in this or a past century by catholic or quaker selfrenunciation reconcilement to the divine will through simple faith in the divine goodness and the love of it which must needs follow its recognition the life of christ made our own by selfdenial and sacrifice and the fellowship of his suffering for the good of others the indwelling spirit leading into all truth the divine word nigh us even in our hearts they have little to do with creeds or schemes of doctrine or the partial and inadequate plans of salvation invented by human speculation and ascribed to him who it is sufficient to know is able to save unto the uttermost all who trust in him they insist upon simple faith and holiness of life rather than rituals or modes of worship they leave the merely formal ceremonial and temporal part of religion to take care of itself and earnestly seek for the substantial the necessary and the permanent with these legacies of devout souls it seems to me the little volume herewith presented is not wholly unworthy of a place it assumes the life and power of the gospel as a matter of actual experience it bears unmistakable evidence of a realization on the part of its author of the truth that christianity is not simply historical and traditional but present and permanent with its roots in the infinite past and its branches in the infinite future the eternal spring and growth of divine love not the dying echo of words uttered centuries ago never to be repeated but gods good tidings spoken afresh in every soul the perennial fountain and unstinted outflow of wisdom and goodness forever old and forever new it is a lofty plea for patience trust hope and holy confidence under the shadow as well as in the light of christian experience whether the cloud seems to rest on the tabernacle or moves guidingly forward it is perhaps too exclusively addressed to those who minister in the inner sanctuary to be entirely intelligible to the vaster number who wait in the outer courts it overlooks perhaps too much the solidarity and oneness of humanity but all who read it will feel its earnestness and confess to the singular beauty of its style the strong steady march of its argument and the wide and varied learning which illustrates it the good are not so good as i once thought nor the bad so evil and in all there is more for grace to make advantage of and more to testify for god and holiness than i once believed baxter to use the language of one of its reviewers in the scottish press beauty there is in the book exquisite glimpses into the loveliness of nature here and there shine out from its lines a charm wanting which meditative writing always seems to have a defect beautiful gleams too there are of the choicest things of art and frequent allusions by the way to legend or picture of the religious past so that while you read you wander by a clear brook of thought coining far from the beautiful hills and winding away from beneath the sunshine of gladness and beauty into the dense mysterious forest of human existence that loves to sing amid the shadow of human darkness and anguish its music of heavenborn consolation bringing too its pure waters of cleansing and healing yet evermore making its praise of holy affection and gladness while it is still haunted by the spirits of prophet saint and poet repeating snatches of their strains and is led on as by a spirit from above to join the great river of gods truth this is a book for christian men for the quiet hour of holy solitude when the heart longs and waits for access to the presence of the master the weary heart that thirsts amidst its conflicts and its toils for refreshing water will drink eagerly of these sweet and refreshing words to thoughtful men and women especially such as have learnt any of the patience of hope in the experiences of sorrow and trial we commend this little volume most heartily and earnestly the patience of hope fell into my hands soon after its publication in edinburgh some two years ago i was at once impressed by its extraordinary richness of language and imagery its deep and solemn tone of meditation in rare combination with an eminently practical tendency philosophy warm and glowing with love it will perhaps be less the fault of the writer than of her readers if they are not always able to eliminate from her highly poetical and imaginative language the subtle metaphysical verity or phase of religious experience which she seeks to express or that they are compelled to pass over without appropriation many things which are nevertheless profoundly suggestive as vague possibilities of the highest life all may not be able to find in some of her scriptural citations the exact weight and significance so apparent to her own mind she startles us at times by her novel applications of familiar texts by meanings reflected upon them from her own spiritual intuitions making the barren baca of the letter a well if the rendering be questionable the beauty and quaint felicity of illustration and comparison are unmistakable and we call to mind augustines saying that two or more widely varying interpretations of scripture may be alike true in themselves considered when one saith moses meant as i do and another saith nay but as i do i ask more reverently why not rather as both if both be true some minds for instance will hesitate to assent to the use of certain scriptural passages as evidence that he who is the light of men the way and the truth in the mystery of his economy designedly delays withdraws and even hides himself from those who love and follow him they will prefer to impute spiritual dearth and darkness to human weakness to the selfishness which seeks a sign for itself to evil imaginations indulged to the taint and burden of some secret sin or to some disease and exaggeration of the conscience growing out of bodily infirmity rather than to any purpose on the part of our heavenly father to perplex and mislead his children the sun does not shine the less because one side of our planet is in darkness to borrow the words of augustine thou lord forsakest nothing thou hast made thou alone art near to those even who remove far from thee let them turn and seek thee for not as they have forsaken their creator hast thou forsaken thy creation it is only by holding fast the thought of infinite goodness and interpreting doubtful scripture and inward spiritual experience by the light of that central idea that we can altogether escape the dreadful conclusion of pascal that revelation has been given us in dubious cipher contradictory and mystical in order that some through miraculous aid may understand it to their salvation and others be mystified by it to their eternal loss i might mention other points of probable divergence between reader and writer and indicate more particularly my own doubtful parse and hesitancy over some of these pages but it is impossible for me to make one to whom i am so deeply indebted an offender for a word or a scriptural rendering on the grave and awful themes which she discusses i have little to say in the way of controversy i would listen rather than criticise the utterances of pious souls in all ages are to me often like fountains in a thirsty land strengthening and refreshing yet not without an aftertaste of human frailty and inadequateness a slight bitterness of disappointment and unsatisfied quest who has not felt at times that the letter killeth that prophecies fail and tongues cease to edify and been ready to say with the author of the imitation of christ speak lord for thy servant heareth let not moses nor the prophets speak to me but speak thou rather who art the inspirer and enlightener of all i am weary with reading and hearing many things let all teachers hold their peace let all creatures keep silence speak thou alone to me the writer of the patience of hope had previous to its publication announced herself to a fit if small audience of earnest and thoughtful christians in a little volume entitled a present heaven she has recently published a collection of poems of which so competent a judge as dr brown the author of horae subsecivae and rab and his friends thus speaks in the north british review such of our readers a fast increasing number as have read and enjoyed the patience of hope listening to the gifted nature which through such deep and subtile thought and through affection and godliness still deeper and more quick has charmed and soothed them will not be surprised to learn that she is not only poetical but what is more a poet and one as true as george herbert and henry vaughan or our own cowper for with all our admiration of the searching fearless speculation the wonderful power of speaking clearly upon dark and all but unspeakable subjects the rich outcome of thoughts that wander through eternity which increases every time we take up that wonderful little book we confess we were surprised at the kind and the amount of true poetic vis in these poems from the same fine and strong hand there is a personality and immediateness a sort of sacredness and privacy as if they were overheard rather than read which gives to these remarkable productions a charm and a flavor all their own with no effort no consciousness of any end but that of uttering the inmost thoughts and desires of the heart they flow out as clear as living as gladdening as the wayside well coming from out the darkness of the central depths filtered into purity by time and travel the waters are copious sometimes to overflowing but they are always limpid and unforced singing their own quiet tune not saddening though sometimes sad and their darkness not that of obscurity but of depth like that of the deep sea this is not a book to criticise or speak about and we give no extracts from the longer and in this case we think the better poems in reading this cardiphonia set to music we have been often reminded not only of herbert and vaughan but of keble a likeness of the spirit not of the letter for if there is any one poet who has given a bent to her mind it is wordsworth the greatest of all our centurys poets both in himself and in his power of making poets in the belief that whoever peruses the following pages will be sufficiently interested in their author to be induced to turn back and read over again with renewed pleasure extracts from her metrical writings i copy from the volume so warmly commended a few brief pieces and extracts from the longer poems here are three sonnets each a sermon in itself ascending they who from mountainpeaks have gazed upon the wide illimitable heavens have said that still receding as they climbed outspread the blue vault deepens over them and one by one drawn further back each starry sun shoots down a feebler splendor overhead so saviour as our mounting spirits led along faiths living way to thee have won a nearer access up the difficult track still pressing on that rarer atmosphere when low beneath us flits the cloudy rack we see thee drawn within a widening sphere of glory from us further further back yet is it then because we are more near life tapestry top long have i methought with tearful eye pored oer this tangled work of mine and mused above each stitch awry and thread confused now will i think on what in years gone by i heard of them that weave rare tapestry at royal looms and hew they constant use to work on the rough side and still peruse the pictured pattern set above them high so will i set my copy high above and gaze and gaze till on my spirit grows its gracious impress till some line of love transferred upon my canvas faintly glows nor look too much on warp or woof provide he whom i work for sees their fairer side hope when i do think on thee sweet hope and how thou followest on our steps a coaxing child oft chidden hence yet quickly reconciled still turning on us a glad beaming brow and red ripe lips for kisses even now thou mindest me of him the ruler mild who led gods chosen people through the wild and bore with wayward murmurers meek as thou that bringest waters from the rock with bread of angels strewing earth for us like him thy force abates not nor thine eye grows dim but still with milk and honeydroppings fed thou leadest to the promised country fair though thou like moses mayst not enter there there is something very weird and striking in the following lines gone alone at midnight as he knelt his spirit was aware of somewhat falling in between the silence and the prayer a bells dull clangor that hath sped so far it faints and dies so soon as it hath reached the ear whereto its errand lies and as he rose up from his knees his spirit was aware of somewhat forceful and unseen that sought to hold him there as of a form that stood behind and on his shoulders prest both hands to stay his rising up and somewhat in his breast in accents clearer far than words spake pray yet longer pray for one that ever prayed for thee this night hath passed away a soul that climbing hour by hour the silvershining stair that leads to gods great treasurehouse grew covetous and there was stored no blessing and no boon for thee she did not claim so lowly yet importunate and ever with thy name she linkd that none in earth or heaven might hinder it or stay one other name so strong that thine hath never missed its way this very night within my arms this gracious soul i bore within the gate where many a prayer of hers had gone before and where she resteth evermore one constant song they raise of holy holy so that now i know not if she prays but for the voice of praise in heaven a voice of prayer hath gone from earth thy name upriseth now no more pray on pray on the following may serve as a specimen of the writers lighter halfplayful strain of moralizing seeking and where and among what pleasant places have ye been that ye come again with your laps so full of flowers and your faces like buds blown fresh after rain we have been said the children speaking in their gladness as the birds chime all together we have been seeking for the fairies of olden time for we thought they are only hidden they would never surely go from this green earth all unbidden and the children that love them so though they come not around us leaping as they did when they and the world were young we shall find them sleeping within some broad leaf curled for the lily its white doors closes but only over the bee and we looked through the summer roses leaf by leaf so carefully but we thought rolled up we shall find them among mosses old and dry from gossamer threads that bind them they will start like the butterfly all winged so we went forth seeking yet still they have kept unseen though we think our feet have been keeping the track where they have been for we saw where their dance went flying oer the pastures snowy white their seats and their tables lying oerthrown in their sudden flight and they too have had their losses for we found the goblets white and red in the old spiked mosses that they drank from overnight and in the pale horn of the woodbine was some wine left clear and bright but we found said the children speaking more quickly so many things that we soon forgot we were seeking forgot all the fairy rings forgot all the stories olden that we hear round the fire at night of their gifts and their favors golden the sunshine was so bright and the flowers we found so many that it almost made us grieve to think there were some sweet as any that we were forced to leave as we left by the brookside lying the balls of drifted foam and brought after all our trying these guelderroses home then oh i heard one speaking beside me soft and low i have been like the blessed children seeking still seeking to and fro yet not like them for the fairies they might pass unmourned away for me that had looked on angels on angels that would not stay no not though in haste before them i spread all my hearts best cheer and made love my banner oer them if it might but keep them here they stayed but a while to rest them long long before its close from my feast though i mourned and prest them the radiant guests arose and their flitting wings struck sadness and silence never more hath my soul won back the gladness that was its own before no i mourned not for the fairies when i had seen hopes decay that were sweet unto my spirit so long i said if they that through shade and sunny weather have twined about my heart should fade we must go together for we can never part but my care was not availing i found their sweetness gone i saw their bright tints paling they died yet i lived on yet seeking ever seeking like the children i have won a guerdon all undreamt of when first my quest begun and my thoughts come back like wanderers outwearied to my breast what they sought for long they found not yet was the unsought best for i sought not out for crosses i did not seek for pain yet i find the hearts sore losses were the spirits surest gain in a meditation the writer ventures not without awe and reverence upon that dim unsounded ocean of mystery the life beyond but is there prayer within your quiet homes and is there care for those ye leave behind i would address my spirit to this theme in humbleness no tongue nor pen hath uttered or made known this mystery and thus i do but guess at clearer types through lowlier patterns shown yet when did love on earth forsake its own ye may not quit your sweetness in the vine more firmly rooted than of old your wine hath freer flow ye have not changed but grown to fuller stature though the shock was keen that severed you from us how oft below hath sorest parting smitten but to show true hearts their hidden wealth that quickly grow the closer for that anguish friend to friend revealed more clear and what is death to rend the ties of life and love when he must fade in light of very life when he must bend to love that loving loveth to the end i do not deem ye look upon us now for be it that your eyes are sealed or clear a burden on them lies too deep and blissful for their gaze to brook our troubled strife enough that once ye dwelt where now we dwell enough that once ye felt as now we feel to bid you recognize our claim of kindred cherished though unseen and love that is to you for eye and ear hath ways unknown to us to bring you near to keep you near for all that comes between as pious souls that move in sleep to prayer as distant friends that see not and yet share i speak of what i know each others care so may your spirits blend with ours above ye know not haply of our state yet love acquaints you with our need and through a way more sure than that of knowledge so ye pray and even thus we meet and even thus we commune spirits freed and spirits fettered mingle nor have need to seek a common atmosphere the air is meet for either in this olden sweet primeval breathing of mans spirit prayer i give in conclusion a portion of one of her most characteristic poems the reconciler our dreams are reconciled since thou didst come to turn them all to truth the world the heart are dreamers in their youth of visions beautiful and strange and wild and thou our lifes interpreter dost still at once make clear these visions and fulfil each dim sweet orphic rhyme each mythic tale sublime of strength to save of sweetness to subdue each morning dream the few wisdoms first lovers told if read in thee comes true thou o friend from heaven that madest this our heart thine own dost pierce the broken language of its moan thou dost not scorn our needs but satisfy each yearning deep and wide each claim is justified our young illusions fail not though they die within the brightness of thy rising kissed to happy death like early clouds that lie about the gates of dawn a golden mist paling to blissful white through rose and amethyst the world that puts thee by that opens not to greet thee with thy train that sendeth after thee the sullen cry we will not have thee over us to reign itself both testify through searchings vain of thee and of its need and for the good it will not of some base similitude takes up a taunting witness till its mood grown fierce oer failing hopes doth rend and tear its own illusions grown too thin and bare to wrap it longer for within the gate where all must pass a veiled and hooded fate a dark chimera coiled and tangled lies and he who answers not its questions dies still changing form and speech but with the same vexed riddles gordiantwisted bringing shame upon the nations that with eager cry hail each new solver of the mystery yet he of these the best bold guesser hath but prest most nigh to thee our noisy plaudits wrong true champion that hast wrought our help of old and brought meat from this eater sweetness from this strong o bearer of the key that shuts and opens with a sound so sweet its turning in the wards is melody all things we move among are incomplete and vain until we fashion them in thee we labor in the fire thick smoke is round about us through the din of words that darken counsel clamors dire ring from thoughts beaten anvil where within two giants toil that even from their birth with travailpangs have torn their mother earth and wearied out her children with their keen upbraidings of the other till between thou tamest saying wherefore do ye wrong each other ye are brethren then these twain will own their kindred and in thee retain their claims in peace because thy land is wide as it is goodly here they pasture free this lion and this leopard side by side a little child doth lead them with a song now ephraims envy ceaseth and no more doth judah anger ephraim chiding sore for one did ask a brother one a king so dost thou gather them in one and bring thou king forevermore forever priest thou brother of our own from bonds released a law of liberty a service making free a commonweal where each has all in thee and not alone these wide deepplanted yearnings seeking with a cry their meat from god in thee are satisfied but all our instincts waking suddenly within the soul like infants from their sleep that stretch their arms into the dark and weep thy voice can still the stricken heart bereft of all its brood of singing hopes and left mid leafless boughs a cold forsaken nest with snowflakes in it folded in thy breast doth lose its deadly chill and grief that creeps unto thy side for shelter finding there the wounds deep cleft forgets its moan and weeps calm quiet tears and on thy forehead care hath looked until its thorns no longer bare put forth pale roses pain on thee doth press its quivering cheek and all the weariness the want that keep their silence till from thee they hear the gracious summons none beside hath spoken to the worldworn come to me tell forth their heavy secrets thou dost hide these in thy bosom and not these alone but all our hearts fond treasure that had grown a burden else o saviour tears were weighed to thee in plenteous measure none hath shown that thou didst smile yet hast thou surely made all joy of ours thine own thou madest us for thine we seek amiss we wander to and fro yet are we ever on the track divine the soul confesseth thee but sense is slow to lean on aught but that which it may see so hath it crowded up these courts below with dark and broken images of thee lead thou us forth upon thy mount and show thy goodly patterns whence these things of old by thee were fashioned one though manifold glass thou thy perfect likeness in the soul show us thy countenance and we are whole no one i am quite certain will regret that i have made these liberal quotations apart from their literary merit they have a special interest for the readers of the patience of hope as more fully illustrating the writers personal experience and aspirations it has been suggested by a friend that it is barely possible that an objection may be urged against the following treatise as against all books of a like character that its tendency is to isolate the individual from his race and to nourish an exclusive and purely selfish personal solicitude that its piety is selfabsorbent and that it does not take sufficiently into account active duties and charities and the love of the neighbor so strikingly illustrated by the divine master in his life and teachings this objection if valid would be a fatal one for of a truth there can be no meaner type of human selfishness than that afforded by him who unmindful of the world of sin and suffering about him occupies himself in the pitiful business of saving his own soul in the very spirit of the miser watching over his private hoard while his neighbors starve for lack of bread but surely the benevolent unrest the farreaching sympathies and keen sensitiveness to the suffering of others which so nobly distinguish our present age can have nothing to fear from a plea for personal holiness patience hope and resignation to the divine will the more piety the more compassion says isaac taylor and this is true if we understand by piety not selfconcentred asceticism but the pure religion and undefiled which visits the widow and the fatherless and yet keeps itself unspotted from the world which deals justly loves mercy and yet walks humbly before god selfscrutiny in the light of truth can do no harm to any one least of all to the reformer and philanthropist the spiritual warrior like the young candidate for knighthood may be none the worse for his preparatory ordeal of watching all night by his armor tauler in mediaeval times and woolman in the last century are among the most earnest teachers of the inward life and spiritual nature of christianity yet both were distinguished for practical benevolence they did not separate the two great commandments tauler strove with equal intensity of zeal to promote the temporal and the spiritual welfare of men in the dark and evil time in which he lived amidst the untold horrors of the black plague he illustrated by deeds of charity and mercy his doctrine of disinterested benevolence woolmans whole life was a nobler imitation of christ than that fervid rhapsody of monastic piety which bears the name how faithful yet withal how full of kindness were his rebukes of those who refused labor its just reward and ground the faces of the poor how deep and entire was his sympathy with overtasked and illpaid laborers with wet and illprovided sailors with poor wretches blaspheming in the mines because oppression had made them mad with the dyers plying their unhealthful trade to minister to luxury and pride with the tenant wearing out his life in the service of a hard landlord and with the slave sighing over his unrequited toil what a significance there was in his vision of the dull gloomy mass which appeared before him darkening half the heavens and which he was told was human beings in as great misery as they could be and live and he was mixed with them and henceforth he might not consider himself a distinct and separate being his saintliness was wholly unconscious he seems never to have thought himself any nearer to the tender heart of god than the most miserable sinner to whom his compassion extended as he did not live so neither did he die to himself his prayer upon his deathbed was for others rather than himself its beautiful humility and simple trust were marred by no sensual imagery of crowns and harps and golden streets and personal beatific exaltations but tender and touching concern for suffering humanity relieved only by the thought of the paternity of god and of his love and omnipotence alone found utterance in evermemorable words in view of the troubled state of the country and the intense preoccupation of the public mind i have had some hesitation in offering this volume to its publishers but on further reflection it has seemed to me that it might supply a want felt by many among us that in the chaos of civil strife and the shadow of mourning which rests over the land the contemplation of things unseen which are eternal might not be unwelcome that when the foundations of human confidence are shaken and the trust in man proves vain there might be glad listeners to a voice calling from the outward and the temporal to the inward and the spiritual from the troubles and perplexities of time to the eternal quietness which god giveth i cannot but believe that in the heat and glare through which we are passing this book will not invite in vain to the calm sweet shadows of holy meditation grateful as the green wings of the bird to thalaba in the desert and thus afford something of consolation to the bereaved and of strength to the weary for surely never was the patience of hope more needed never was the inner sanctuary of prayer more desirable never was a steadfast faith in the divine goodness more indispensable nor lessons of selfsacrifice and renunciation and that cheerful acceptance of known duty which shifts not its proper responsibility upon others nor asks for peace in its day at the expense of purity and justice more timely than now when the solemn words of ancient prophecy are as applicable to our own country as to that of the degenerate jew thine own wickedness shall correct thee and thy backsliding reprove thee know therefore it is an evil thing and bitter that thou bast forsaken the lord and that my fear is not in thee when his way is in the deep in clouds and in thick darkness and the hand heavy upon us which shall turn and overturn until he whose right it is shall reign until not without rending agony the evil plant which our heavenly father hath not planted whose roots have wound themselves about altar and hearthstone and whose branches like the tree alaccoub in moslem fable bear the accursed fruit of oppression rebellion and all imaginable crime shall be torn up and destroyed forever amesbury st th mo the society of friends the following letters were addressed to the editor of the friends review in philadelphia in reference to certain changes of principle and practice in the society then beginning to be observable but which have since more than justified the writers fears and solicitude i amesbury d mo to the editor of the review esteemed friend if i have been hitherto a silent i have not been an indifferent spectator of the movements now going on in our religious society perhaps from lack of faith i have been quite too solicitous concerning them and too much afraid that in grasping after new things we may let go of old things too precious to be lost hence i have been pleased to see from time to time in thy paper very timely and fitting articles upon a hired ministry and silent worship the present age is one of sensation and excitement of extreme measures and opinions of impatience of all slow results the world about us moves with accelerated impulse and we move with it the rest we have enjoyed whether true or false is broken the titledeeds of our opinions the reason of our practices are demanded our very right to exist as a distinct society is questioned our old literature the precious journals and biographies of early and later friends is comparatively neglected for sensational and dogmatic publications we bear complaints of a want of educated ministers the utility of silent meetings is denied and praying and preaching regarded as matters of will and option there is a growing desire for experimenting upon the dogmas and expedients and practices of other sects i speak only of admitted facts and not for the purpose of censure or complaint no one has less right than myself to indulge in heresyhunting or impatience of minor differences of opinion if my dear friends can bear with me i shall not find it a hard task to bear with them but for myself i prefer the old ways with the broadest possible tolerance for all honest seekers after truth i love the society of friends my life has been nearly spent in laboring with those of other sects in behalf of the suffering and enslaved and i have never felt like quarrelling with orthodox or unitarians who were willing to pull with me side by side at the rope of reform a very large proportion of my dearest personal friends are outside of our communion and i have learned with john woolman to find no narrowness respecting sects and opinions but after a kindly and candid survey of them all i turn to my own society thankful to the divine providence which placed me where i am and with an unshaken faith in the one distinctive doctrine of quakerism the light within the immanence of the divine spirit in christianity i cheerfully recognize and bear testimony to the good works and lives of those who widely differ in faith and practice but i have seen no truer types of christianity no better men and women than i have known and still know among those who not blindly but intelligently hold the doctrines and maintain the testimonies of our early friends i am not blind to the shortcomings of friends i know how much we have lost by narrowness and coldness and inactivity the overestimate of external observances the neglect of our own proper work while acting as consciencekeepers for others we have not as a society been active enough in those simple duties which we owe to our suffering fellowcreatures in that abundant labor of love and selfdenial which is never out of place perhaps our divisions and dissensions might have been spared us if we had been less at ease in zion it is in the decline of practical righteousness that men are most likely to contend with each other for dogma and ritual for shadow and letter instead of substance and spirit hence i rejoice in every sign of increased activity in doing good among us in the precious opportunities afforded of working with the divine providence for the freedmen and indians since the more we do in the true spirit of the gospel for others the more we shall really do for ourselves there is no danger of lack of work for those who with an eye single to the guidance of truth look for a place in gods vineyard the great work which the founders of our society began is not yet done the mission of friends is not accomplished and will not be until this world of ours now full of sin and suffering shall take up in jubilant thanksgiving the song of the advent glory to god in the highest peace on earth and goodwill to men it is charged that our society lacks freedom and adaptation to the age in which we live that there is a repression of individuality and manliness among us i am not prepared to deny it in certain respects but if we look at the matter closely we shall see that the cause is not in the central truth of quakerism but in a failure to rightly comprehend it in an attempt to fetter with forms and hedge about with dogmas that great law of christian liberty which i believe affords ample scope for the highest spiritual aspirations and the broadest philanthropy if we did but realize it we are set in a large place we may do all we will save wickedness where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty quakerism in the light of its great original truth is exceeding broad as interpreted by penn and barclay it is the most liberal and catholic of faiths if we are not free generous tolerant if we are not up to or above the level of the age in good works in culture and love of beauty order and fitness if we are not the ready recipients of the truths of science and philosophy in a word if we are not fullgrown men and christians the fault is not in quakerism but in ourselves we shall gain nothing by aping the customs and trying to adjust ourselves to the creeds of other sects by so doing we make at the best a very awkward combination and just as far as it is successful it is at the expense of much that is vital in our old faith if for instance i could bring myself to believe a hired ministry and a written creed essential to my moral and spiritual wellbeing i think i should prefer to sit down at once under such teachers as bushnell and beecher the like of whom in biblical knowledge ecclesiastical learning and intellectual power we are not likely to manufacture by half a century of theological manipulation in a quaker school of the prophets if i must go into the market and buy my preaching i should naturally seek the best article on sale without regard to the label attached to it i am not insensible of the need of spiritual renovation in our society i feel and confess my own deficiencies as an individual member and i bear a willing testimony to the zeal and devotion of some dear friends who lamenting the low condition and worldliness too apparent among us seek to awaken a stronger religious life by the partial adoption of the practices forms and creeds of more demonstrative sects the great apparent activity of these sects seems to them to contrast very strongly with our quietness and reticence and they do not always pause to inquire whether the result of this activity is a truer type of practical christianity than is found in our select gatherings i think i understand these brethren to some extent i have sympathized with them but it seems clear to me that a remedy for the alleged evil lies not in going back to the beggarly elements from which our worthy ancestors called the people of their generation not in willworship not in setting the letter above the spirit not in substituting type and symbol and oriental figure and hyperbole for the simple truths they were intended to represent not in schools of theology not in much speaking and noise and vehemence nor in vain attempts to make the plain language of quakerism utter the shibboleth of manmade creeds but in heeding more closely the inward guide and teacher in faith in christ not merely in his historical manifestation of the divine love to humanity but in his living presence in the hearts open to receive him in love for him manifested in denial of self in charity and love to our neighbor and in a deeper realization of the truth of the apostles declaration pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world in conclusion let me say that i have given this expression of my opinions with some degree of hesitation being very sensible that i have neither the right nor the qualification to speak for a society whose doctrines and testimonies commend themselves to my heart and head whose history is rich with the precious legacy of holy lives and of whose usefulness as a moral and spiritual force in the world i am fully assured ii having received several letters from dear friends in various sections suggested by a recent communication in thy paper and not having time or health to answer them in detail will thou permit me in this way to acknowledge them and to say to the writers that i am deeply sensible of the christian love and personal goodwill to myself which whether in commendation or dissent they manifest i think i may say in truth that my letter was written in no sectarian or party spirit but simply to express a solicitude which whether groundless or not was nevertheless real i am from principle disinclined to doctrinal disputations and socalled religious controversies which only tend to separate and disunite we have had too many divisions already i intended no censure of dear brethren whose zeal and devotion command my sympathy notwithstanding i may not be able to see with them in all respects the domain of individual conscience is to me very sacred and it seems the part of christian charity to make a large allowance for varying experiences mental characteristics and temperaments as well as for that youthful enthusiasm which if sometimes misdirected has often been instrumental in infusing a fresher life into the body of religious profession it is too much to expect that we can maintain an entire uniformity in the expression of truths in which we substantially agree and we should be careful that a rightful concern for the form of sound words does not become what william penn calls verbal orthodoxy we must consider that the same accepted truth looks somewhat differently from different points of vision knowing our own weaknesses and limitations we must bear in mind that human creeds speculations expositions and interpretations of the divine plan are but the faint and feeble glimpses of finite creatures into the infinite mysteries of god they are but broken lights of thee and thou o lord art more than they differing as we do more or less as to means and methods if we indeed have the mind of christ we shall rejoice in whatever of good is really accomplished although by somewhat different instrumentalities than those which we feel ourselves free to make use of remembering that our lord rebuked the narrowness and partisanship of his disciples by assuring them that they that were not against him were for him it would nevertheless give me great satisfaction to know as thy kindly expressed editorial comments seem to intimate that i have somewhat overestimated the tendencies of things in our society i have no pride of opinion which would prevent me from confessing with thankfulness my error of judgment in any event it can i think do no harm to repeat my deep conviction that we may all labor in the ability given us for our own moral and spiritual wellbeing and that of our fellowcreatures without laying aside the principles and practice of our religious society i believe so much of liberty is our right as well as our privilege and that we need not really overstep our bounds for the performance of any duty which may be required of us when truly called to contemplate broader fields of labor we shall find the walls about us like the horizon seen from higher levels expanding indeed but nowhere broken i believe that the world needs the society of friends as a testimony and a standard i know that this is the opinion of some of the best and most thoughtful members of other christian sects i know that any serious departure from the original foundation of our society would give pain to many who outside of our communion deeply realize the importance of our testimonies they fail to read clearly the signs of the times who do not see that the hour is coming when under the searching eye of philosophy and the terrible analysis of science the letter and the outward evidence will not altogether avail us when the surest dependence must be upon the light of christ within disclosing the law and the prophets in our own souls and confirming the truth of outward scripture by inward experience when smooth stones from the brook of present revelation shall prove mightier than the weapons of saul when the doctrine of the holy spirit as proclaimed by george fox and lived by john woolman shall be recognized as the only efficient solvent of doubts raised by an age of restless inquiry in this belief my letter was written i am sorry it did not fall to the lot of a more fitting hand and can only hope that no consideration of lack of qualification on the part of its writer may lessen the value of whatever testimony to truth shall be found in it amesbury d mo p s i may mention that i have been somewhat encouraged by a perusal of the proceedings of the late firstday school conference in philadelphia where with some things which i am compelled to pause over and regret i find much with which i cordially unite and which seems to indicate a providential opening for good i confess to a lively and tender sympathy with my younger brethren and sisters who in the name of him who went about doing good go forth into the highways and byways to gather up the lost feed the hungry instruct the ignorant and point the sinsick and suffering to the hopes and consolations of christian faith even if at times their zeal goes beyond reasonable service and although the importance of a particular instrumentality may be exaggerated and love lose sight of its needful companion humility and he that putteth on his armor boast like him who layeth it off any movement however irregular which indicates life is better than the quiet of death in the overruling providence of god the troubling may prepare the way for healing some of us may have erred on one hand and some on the other and this shaking of the balance may adjust it john woolmans journal originally published as an introduction to a reissue of the work to those who judge by the outward appearance nothing is more difficult of explanation than the strength of moral influence often exerted by obscure and uneventful lives some great reform which lifts the world to a higher level some mighty change for which the ages have waited in anxious expectancy takes place before our eyes and in seeking to trace it back to its origin we are often surprised to find the initial link in the chain of causes to be some comparatively obscure individual the divine commission and significance of whose life were scarcely understood by his contemporaries and perhaps not even by himself the little one has become a thousand the handful of corn shakes like lebanon the kingdom of god cometh not by observation and the only solution of the mystery is in the reflection that through the humble instrumentality divine power was manifested and that the everlasting arm was beneath the human one the abolition of human slavery now in process of consummation throughout the world furnishes one of the most striking illustrations of this truth a farreaching moral social and political revolution undoing the evil work of centuries unquestionably owes much of its original impulse to the life and labors of a poor unlearned workingman of new jersey whose very existence was scarcely known beyond the narrow circle of his religious society it is only within a comparatively recent period that the journal and ethical essays of this remarkable man have attracted the attention to which they are manifestly entitled in one of my last interviews with william ellery channing he expressed his very great surprise that they were so little known he had himself just read the book for the first time and i shall never forget how his countenance lighted up as he pronounced it beyond comparison the sweetest and purest autobiography in the language he wished to see it placed within the reach of all classes of readers it was not a light to be hidden under the bushel of a sect charles lamb probably from his friends the clarksons or from bernard barton became acquainted with it and on more than one occasion in his letters and essays of elia refers to it with warm commendation edward irving pronounced it a godsend some idea of the lively interest which the fine literary circle gathered around the hearth of lamb felt in the beautiful simplicity of woolmans pages may be had from the diary of henry crabb robinson one of their number himself a man of wide and varied culture the intimate friend of goethe wordsworth and coleridge in his notes for first month he says after a reference to a sermon of his friend irving which he feared would deter rather than promote belief how different this from john woolmans journal i have been reading at the same time a perfect gem his is a schone seele a beautiful soul an illiterate tailor he writes in a style of the most exquisite purity and grace his moral qualities are transferred to his writings had he not been so very humble he would have written a still better book for fearing to indulge in vanity he conceals the events in which he was a great actor his religion was love his whole existence and all his passions were love if one could venture to impute to his creed and not to his personal character the delightful frame of mind he exhibited one could not hesitate to be a convert his christianity is most inviting it is fascinating one of the leading british reviews a few years ago referring to this journal pronounced its author the man who in all the centuries since the advent of christ lived nearest to the divine pattern the author of the patience of hope whose authority in devotional literature is unquestioned says of him john woolmans gift was love a charity of which it does not enter into the natural heart of man to conceive and of which the more ordinary experiences even of renewed nature give but a faint shadow every now and then in the worlds history we meet with such men the kings and priests of humanity on whose heads this precious ointment has been so poured forth that it has run down to the skirts of their clothing and extended over the whole of the visible creation men who have entered like francis of assisi into the secret of that deep amity with god and with his creatures which makes man to be in league with the stones of the field and the beasts of the field to be at peace with him in this pure universal charity there is nothing fitful or intermittent nothing that comes and goes in showers and gleams and sunbursts its springs are deep and constant its rising is like that of a mighty river its very overflow calm and steady leaving life and fertility behind it after all anything like personal eulogy seems out of place in speaking of one who in the humblest selfabasement sought no place in the worlds estimation content to be only a passive instrument in the hands of his master and who as has been remarked through modesty concealed the events in which he was an actor a desire to supply in some sort this deficiency in his journal is my especial excuse for this introductory paper it is instructive to study the history of the moral progress of individuals or communities to mark the gradual development of truth to watch the slow germination of its seed sown in simple obedience to the command of the great husbandman while yet its green promise as well as its golden fruition was hidden from the eyes of the sower to go back to the wellsprings and fountainheads tracing the small streamlet from its hidden source and noting the tributaries which swell its waters as it moves onward until it becomes a broad river fertilizing and gladdening our present humanity to this end it is my purpose as briefly as possible to narrate the circumstances attending the relinquishment of slaveholding by the society of friends and to hint at the effect of that act of justice and humanity upon the abolition of slavery throughout the world at an early period after the organization of the society members of it emigrated to the maryland carolina virginia and new england colonies the act of banishment enforced against dissenters under charles ii consigned others of the sect to the west indies where their frugality temperance and thrift transmuted their intended punishment into a blessing andrew marvell the inflexible republican statesman in some of the sweetest and tenderest lines in the english tongue has happily described their condition what shall we do but sing his praise who led us through the watery maze unto an isle so long unknown and yet far kinder than our own he lands us on a grassy stage safe from the storms and prelates rage he gives us this eternal spring which here enamels everything and sends the fowls to us in care on daily visits through the air he hangs in shades the orange bright like golden lamps in a green night and doth in the pomegranate close jewels more rich than ormus shows and in these rocks for us did frame a temple where to sound his name oh let our voice his praise exalt till it arrive at heavens vault which then perhaps rebounding may echo beyond the mexic bay so sang they in the english boat a holy and a cheerful note and all the way to guide their chime with falling oars they kept the time unhappily they very early became owners of slaves in imitation of the colonists around them no positive condemnation of the evil system had then been heard in the british islands neither english prelates nor expounders at dissenting conventicles had aught to say against it few colonists doubted its entire compatibility with christian profession and conduct saint and sinner ascetic and worldling united in its practice even the extreme dutch saints of bohemia manor community the pietists of john de labadie sitting at meat with hats on and pausing ever and anon with suspended mouthfuls to bear a brothers or sisters exhortation and sandwiching prayers between the courses were waited upon by negro slaves everywhere men were contending with each other upon matters of faith while so far as their slaves were concerned denying the ethics of christianity itself such was the state of things when in george fox visited barbadoes he was one of those men to whom it is given to discern through the mists of custom and prejudice something of the lineaments of absolute truth and who like the hebrew lawgiver bear with them from a higher and purer atmosphere the shining evidence of communion with the divine wisdom he saw slavery in its mildest form among his friends but his intuitive sense of right condemned it he solemnly admonished those who held slaves to bear in mind that they were brethren and to train them up in the fear of god i desired also he says that they would cause their overseers to deal gently and mildly with their negroes and not use cruelty towards them as the manner of some hath been and is and that after certain years of servitude they should make them free in the companion of george fox william edmundson revisited barbadoes and once more bore testimony against the unjust treatment of slaves he was accused of endeavoring to excite an insurrection among the blacks and was brought before the governor on the charge it was probably during this journey that he addressed a remonstrance to friends in maryland and virginia on the subject of holding slaves it is one of the first emphatic and decided testimonies on record against negro slavery as incompatible with christianity if we except the papal bulls of urban and leo the tenth thirteen years after in a meeting of german quakers who had emigrated from kriesbeim and settled at germantown pennsylvania addressed a memorial against the buying and keeping of negroes to the yearly meeting for the pennsylvania and new jersey colonies that meeting took the subject into consideration but declined giving judgment in the case in the yearly meeting advised against bringing in any more negroes in in its epistle to london friends it expresses a wish that friends would be less concerned in buying or selling slaves the chester quarterly meeting which had taken a higher and clearer view of the matter continued to press the yearly meeting to adopt some decided measure against any traffic in human beings the society gave these memorials a cold reception the love of gain and power was too strong on the part of the wealthy and influential planters and merchants who had become slaveholders to allow the scruples of the chester meeting to take the shape of discipline the utmost that could be obtained of the yearly meeting was an expression of opinion adverse to the importation of negroes and a desire that friends generally do as much as may be avoid buying such negroes as shall hereafter be brought in rather than offend any friends who are against it yet this is only caution and not censure in the mean time the new england yearly meeting was agitated by the same question slaves were imported into boston and newport and friends became purchasers and in some instances were deeply implicated in the foreign traffic in the monthly meetings of dartmouth and nantucket suggested that it was not agreeable to truth to purchase slaves and keep them during their term of life nothing was done in the yearly meeting however until when the practice of importing negroes was censured that the practice was continued notwithstanding for many years afterwards is certain in a rule was adopted prohibiting friends within the limits of new england yearly meeting from engaging in or countenancing the foreign slavetrade in the year an event simple and inconsiderable in itself was made the instrumentality of exerting a mighty influence upon slavery in the society of friends a small storekeeper at mount holly in new jersey a member of the society sold a negro woman and requested the young man in his employ to make a bill of sale of her mount holly is a village lying in the western part of the long narrow township of northampton on rancocas creek a tributary of the delaware in john woolmans day it was almost entirely a settlement of friends a very few of the old houses with their quaint stoops or porches are left that occupied by john woolman was a small plain twostory structure with two windows in each story in front a fourbarred fence inclosing the grounds with the trees he planted and loved to cultivate the house was not painted but whitewashed the name of the place is derived from the highest hill in the county rising two hundred feet above the sea and commanding a view of a rich and level country of cleared farms and woodlands here no doubt john woolman often walked under the shadow of its hollytrees communing with nature and musing on the great themes of life and duty when the excellent joseph sturge was in this country some thirty years ago on his errand of humanity he visited mount holly and the house of woolman then standing he describes it as a very humble abode but one person was then living in the town who had ever seen its venerated owner this aged man stated that he was at woolmans little farm in the season of harvest when it was customary among farmers to kill a calf or sheep for the laborers john woolman unwilling that the animal should be slowly bled to death as the custom had been and to spare it unnecessary suffering had a smooth block of wood prepared to receive the neck of the creature when a single blow terminated its existence nothing was more remarkable in the character of woolman than his concern for the wellbeing and comfort of the brute creation what is religion asks the old hindoo writer of the vishnu sarman tenderness toward all creatures or as woolman expresses it where the love of god is verily perfected a tenderness towards all creatures made subject to our will is experienced and a care felt that we do not lessen that sweetness of life in the animal creation which the creator intends for them under our government on taking up his pen the young clerk felt a sudden and strong scruple in his mind the thought of writing an instrument of slavery for one of his fellowcreatures oppressed him gods voice against the desecration of his image spoke in the soul he yielded to the will of his employer but while writing the instrument he was constrained to declare both to the buyer and the seller that he believed slavekeeping inconsistent with the christian religion this young man was john woolman the circumstance above named was the startingpoint of a lifelong testimony against slavery in the year he visited maryland virginia and north carolina he was afflicted by the prevalence of slavery it appeared to him in his own words as a dark gloominess overhanging the land on his return he wrote an essay on the subject which was published in three years after he made a second visit to the southern meetings of friends travelling as a minister of the gospel he was compelled to sit down at the tables of slaveholding planters who were accustomed to entertain their friends free of cost and who could not comprehend the scruples of their guest against receiving as a gift food and lodging which he regarded as the gain of oppression he was a poor man but he loved truth more than money he therefore either placed the pay for his entertainment in the hands of some member of the family for the benefit of the slaves or gave it directly to them as he had opportunity wherever he went he found his fellowprofessors entangled in the mischief of slavery elders and ministers as well as the younger and less high in profession had their house servants and field hands he found grave drabcoated apologists for the slavetrade who quoted the same scriptures in support of oppression and avarice which have since been cited by presbyterian doctors of divinity methodist bishops and baptist preachers for the same purpose he found the meetings generally in a low and evil state the gold of original quakerism had become dim and the fine gold changed the spirit of the world prevailed among them and had wrought an inward desolation instead of meekness gentleness and heavenly wisdom he found a spirit of fierceness and love of dominion the tradition is that he travelled mostly on foot during his journeys among slaveholders brissot in his new travels in america published in says john woolman one of the most distinguished of men in the cause of humanity travelled much as a minister of his sect but always on foot and without money in imitation of the apostles and in order to be in a situation to be more useful to poor people and the blacks he hated slavery so much that he could not taste food provided by the labor of slaves that this writer was on one point misinformed is manifest from the following passage from the journal when i expected soon to leave a friends house where i had entertainment if i believed that i should not keep clear from the gain of oppression without leaving money i spoke to one of the heads of the family privately and desired them to accept of pieces of silver and give them to such of their negroes as they believed would make the best use of them and at other times i gave them to the negroes myself as the way looked clearest to me before i came out i had provided a large number of small pieces for this purpose and thus offering them to some who appeared to be wealthy people was a trial both to me and them but the fear of the lord so covered me at times that my way was made easier than i expected and few if any manifested any resentment at the offer and most of them after some conversation accepted of them in love but at the same time with great faithfulness he endeavored to convince the masters of their error and to awaken a degree of sympathy for the enslaved at this period or perhaps somewhat earlier a remarkable personage took up his residence in pennsylvania he was by birthright a member of the society of friends but having been disowned in england for some extravagances of conduct and language he spent several years in the west indies where he became deeply interested in the condition of the slaves his violent denunciations of the practice of slaveholding excited the anger of the planters and he was compelled to leave the island he came to philadelphia but contrary to his expectations he found the same evil existing there he shook off the dust of the city and took up his abode in the country a few miles distant his dwelling was a natural cave with some slight addition of his own making his drink was the springwater flowing by his door his food vegetables alone he persistently refused to wear any garment or eat any food purchased at the expense of animal life or which was in any degree the product of slave labor issuing from his cave on his mission of preaching deliverance to the captive he was in the habit of visiting the various meetings for worship and bearing his testimony against slaveholders greatly to their disgust and indignation on one occasion he entered the market street meeting and a leading friend requested some one to take him out a burly blacksmith volunteered to do it leading him to the gate and thrusting him out with such force that he fell into the gutter of the street there he lay until the meeting closed telling the bystanders that he did not feel free to rise himself let those who cast me here raise me up it is their business not mine his personal appearance was in remarkable keeping with his eccentric life a figure only four and a half feet high hunchbacked with projecting chest legs small and uneven arms longer than his legs a huge head showing only beneath the enormous white hat large solemn eyes and a prominent nose the rest of his face covered with a snowy semicircle of beard falling low on his breast a figure to recall the old legends of troll brownie and kobold such was the irrepressible prophet who troubled the israel of slaveholding quakerism clinging like a rough chestnutbur to the skirts of its respectability and settling like a pertinacious gadfly on the sore places of its conscience on one occasion while the annual meeting was in session at burlington n j in the midst of the solemn silence of the great assembly the unwelcome figure of benjamin lay wrapped in his long white overcoat was seen passing up the aisle stopping midway he exclaimed you slaveholders why dont you throw off your quaker coats as i do mine and show yourselves as you are casting off as he spoke his outer garment he disclosed to the astonished assembly a military coat underneath and a sword dangling at his heels holding in one hand a large book he drew his sword with the other in the sight of god he cried you are as guilty as if you stabbed your slaves to the heart as i do this book suiting the action to the word and piercing a small bladder filled with the juice of pokeweed playtolacca decandra which he had concealed between the covers and sprinkling as with fresh blood those who sat near him john woolman makes no mention of this circumstance in his journal although he was probably present and it must have made a deep impression on his sensitive spirit the violence and harshness of lays testimony however had nothing in common with the tender and sorrowful remonstrances and appeals of the former except the sympathy which they both felt for the slave himself lay was well acquainted with dr franklin who sometimes visited him among other schemes of reform he entertained the idea of converting all mankind to christianity this was to be done by three witnesses himself michael lovell and abel noble assisted by dr franklin but on their first meeting at the doctors house the three chosen vessels got into a violent controversy on points of doctrine and separated in illhumor the philosopher who had been an amused listener advised the three sages to give up the project of converting the world until they had learned to tolerate each other still later a descendant of the persecuted french protestants anthony benezet a man of uncommon tenderness of feeling began to write and speak against slavery how far if at all he was moved thereto by the example of woolman is not known but it is certain that the latter found in him a steady friend and coadjutor in his efforts to awaken the slumbering moral sense of his religious brethren the marquis de chastellux author of de la felicite publique describes him as a small eagerfaced man full of zeal and activity constantly engaged in works of benevolence which were by no means confined to the blacks like woolman and lay he advocated abstinence from intoxicating spirits the poor french neutrals who were brought to philadelphia from nova scotia and landed penniless and despairing among strangers in tongue and religion found in him a warm and untiring friend through whose aid and sympathy their condition was rendered more comfortable than that of their fellowexiles in other colonies the annual assemblage of the yearly meeting in at philadelphia must ever be regarded as one of the most important religious convocations in the history of the christian church the labors of woolman and his few but earnest associates had not been in vain a deep and tender interest had been awakened and this meeting was looked forward to with varied feelings of solicitude by all parties all felt that the time had come for some definite action conservative and reformer stood face to face in the valley of decision john woolman of course was present a man humble and poor in outward appearance his simple dress of undyed homespun cloth contrasting strongly with the plain but rich apparel of the representatives of the commerce of the city and of the large slavestocked plantations of the country bowed down by the weight of his concern for the poor slaves and for the wellbeing and purity of the society he sat silent during the whole meeting while other matters were under discussion my mind he says was frequently clothed with inward prayer and i could say with david that tears were my meat and drink day and night the case of slavekeeping lay heavy upon me nor did i find any engagement to speak directly to any other matter before the meeting when the important subject came up for consideration many faithful friends spoke with weight and earnestness no one openly justified slavery as a system although some expressed a concern lest the meeting should go into measures calculated to cause uneasiness to many members of the society it was also urged that friends should wait patiently until the lord in his own time should open a way for the deliverance of the slave this was replied to by john woolman my mind he said is led to consider the purity of the divine being and the justice of his judgments and herein my soul is covered with awfulness i cannot forbear to hint of some cases where people have not been treated with the purity of justice and the event has been most lamentable many slaves on this continent are oppressed and their cries have entered into the ears of the most high such are the purity and certainty of his judgments that he cannot be partial in our favor in infinite love and goodness he hath opened our understandings from one time to another concerning our duty towards this people and it is not a time for delay should we now be sensible of what he requires of us and through a respect to the private interest of some persons or through a regard to some friendships which do not stand upon an immutable foundation neglect to do our duty in firmness and constancy still waiting for some extraordinary means to bring about their deliverance god may by terrible things in righteousness answer us in this matter this solemn and weighty appeal was responded to by many in the assembly in a spirit of sympathy and unity some of the slaveholding members expressed their willingness that a strict rule of discipline should be adopted against dealing in slaves for the future to this it was answered that the root of the evil would never be reached effectually until a searching inquiry was made into the circumstances and motives of such as held slaves at length the truth in a great measure triumphed over all opposition and without any public dissent the meeting agreed that the injunction of our lord and saviour to do to others as we would that others should do to us should induce friends who held slaves to set them at liberty making a christian provision for them and four friends john woolman john scarborough daniel stanton and john sykes were approved of as suitable persons to visit and treat with such as kept slaves within the limits of the meeting this painful and difficult duty was faithfully performed in that meekness and humility of spirit which has nothing in common with the fear of man which bringeth a snare the selfdenying followers of their divine lord and master went about doing good in the city of philadelphia and among the wealthy planters of the country they found occasion often to exercise a great degree of patience and to keep a watchful guard over their feelings in his journal for this important period of his life john woolman says but little of his own services how arduous and delicate they were may be readily understood the number of slaves held by members of the society was very large isaac jackson in his report of his labors among slaveholders in a single quarterly meeting states that he visited the owners of more than eleven hundred slaves from the same report may be gleaned some hints of the difficulties which presented themselves one elderly man says he has well brought up his eleven slaves and now they must work to maintain him another owns it is all wrong but cannot release his slaves his tender wife under great concern of mind on account of his refusal a third has fifty slaves knows it to be wrong but cant see his way clear out of it perhaps the report says interest dims his vision a fourth is full of excuses and reasonings old jos richison has forty and is determined to keep them another man has fifty and means to keep them robert ward wants to release his slaves but his wife and daughters hold back another owns it is wrong but says he will not part with his negroes no not while he lives the far greater number however confess the wrong of slavery and agree to take measures for freeing their slaves an incident occurred during this visit of isaac jackson which impressed him deeply on the last evening just as he was about to turn homeward he was told that a member of the society whom he had not seen owned a very old slave who was happy and well cared for it was a case which it was thought might well be left to take care of itself isaac jackson sitting in silence did not feel his mind quite satisfied and as the evening wore away feeling more and more exercised he expressed his uneasiness when a young son of his host eagerly offered to go with him and show him the road to the place the proposal was gladly accepted on introducing the object of their visit the friend expressed much surprise that any uneasiness should be felt in the case but at length consented to sign the form of emancipation saying at the same time it would make no difference in their relations as the old man was perfectly happy at isaac jacksons request the slave was called in and seated before them his form was nearly double his thin hands were propped on his knees his white head was thrust forward and his keen restless inquiring eyes gleamed alternately on the stranger and on his master at length he was informed of what had been done that he was no longer a slave and that his master acknowledged his past services entitled him to a maintenance so long as he lived the old man listened in almost breathless wonder his head slowly sinking on his breast after a short pause he clasped his hands then spreading them high over his hoary head slowly and reverently exclaimed oh goody gody oh bringing his hands again down on his knees then raising them as before he twice repeated the solemn exclamation and with streaming eyes and a voice almost too much choked for utterance he continued i thought i should die a slave and now i shall die a free man it is a striking evidence of the divine compensations which are sometimes graciously vouchsafed to those who have been faithful to duty that on his deathbed this affecting scene was vividly revived in the mind of isaac jackson at that supreme moment when all other pictures of time were fading out that old face full of solemn joy and devout thanksgiving rose before him and comforted him as with the blessing of god an extract or two from the journal at this period will serve to show both the nature of the service in which he was engaged and the frame of mind in which he accomplished it in the beginning of the th month i joined in company with my friends john sykes and daniel stanton in visiting such as had slaves some whose hearts were rightly exercised about them appeared to be glad of our visit but in some places our way was more difficult i often saw the necessity of keeping down to that root from whence our concern proceeded and have cause in reverent thankfulness humbly to bow down before the lord who was near to me and preserved my mind in calmness under some sharp conflicts and begat a spirit of sympathy and tenderness in me towards some who were grievously entangled by the spirit of this world st month having found my mind drawn to visit some of the more active members of society at philadelphia who had slaves i met my friend john churchman there by agreement and we continued about a week in the city we visited some that were sick and some widows and their families and the other part of the time was mostly employed in visiting such as had slaves it was a time of deep exercise but looking often to the lord for assistance he in unspeakable kindness favored us with the influence of that spirit which crucifies to the greatness and splendor of this world and enabled us to go through some heavy labors in which we found peace these labors were attended with the blessing of the god of the poor and oppressed dealing in slaves was almost entirely abandoned and many who held slaves set them at liberty but many members still continuing the practice a more emphatic testimony against it was issued by the yearly meeting in and two years after the subordinate meetings were directed to deny the right of membership to such as persisted in holding their fellowmen as property a concern was now felt for the temporal and religious welfare of the emancipated slaves and in the yearly meeting came to the conclusion that some reparation was due from the masters to their former slaves for services rendered while in the condition of slavery the following is an extract from an epistle on this subject we are united in judgment that the state of the oppressed people who have been held by any of us or our predecessors in captivity and slavery calls for a deep inquiry and close examination how far we are clear of withholding from them what under such an exercise may open to view as their just right and therefore we earnestly and affectionately entreat our brethren in religious profession to bring this matter home and that all who have let the oppressed go free may attend to the further openings of duty a tender christian sympathy appears to be awakened in the minds of many who are not in religious profession with us who have seriously considered the oppressions and disadvantages under which those people have long labored and whether a pious care extended to their offspring is not justly due from us to them is a consideration worthy our serious and deep attention committees to aid and advise the colored people were accordingly appointed in the various monthly meetings many former owners of slaves faithfully paid the latter for their services submitting to the award and judgment of arbitrators as to what justice required at their hands so deeply had the sense of the wrong of slavery sunk into the hearts of friends john woolman in his journal for states that having some years before as one of the executors of a will disposed of the services of a negro boy belonging to the estate until he should reach the age of thirty years he became uneasy in respect to the transaction and although he had himself derived no pecuniary benefit from it and had simply acted as the agent of the heirs of the estate to which the boy belonged he executed a bond binding himself to pay the master of the young man for four years and a half of his unexpired term of service the appalling magnitude of the evil against which he felt himself especially called to contend was painfully manifest to john woolman at the outset all about him in every department of life and human activity in the state and the church he saw evidences of its strength and of the depth and extent to which its roots had wound their way among the foundations of society yet he seems never to have doubted for a moment the power of simple truth to eradicate it nor to have hesitated as to his own duty in regard to it there was no groping like samson in the gloom no feeling in blind wrath and impatience for the pillars of the temple of dagon the candle of the lord shone about him and his path lay clear and unmistakable before him he believed in the goodness of god that leadeth to repentance and that love could reach the witness for itself in the hearts of all men through all entanglements of custom and every barrier of pride and selfishness no one could have a more humble estimate of himself but as he went forth on his errand of mercy he felt the infinite power behind him and the consciousness that he had known a preparation from that power to stand as a trumpet through which the lord speaks the event justified his confidence wherever he went hard hearts were softened avarice and love of power and pride of opinion gave way before his testimony of love the new england yearly meeting then as now was held in newport on rhode island in the year john woolman in the course of a religious visit to new england attended that meeting he saw the horrible traffic in human beings the slaveships lying at the wharves of the town the sellers and buyers of men and women and children thronging the marketplace the same abhorrent scenes which a few years after stirred the spirit of the excellent hopkins to denounce the slavetrade and slavery as hateful in the sight of god to his congregation at newport were enacted in the full view and hearing of the annual convocation of friends many of whom were themselves partakers in the shame and wickedness understanding he says that a large number of slaves had been imported from africa into the town and were then on sale by a member of our society my appetite failed i grew outwardly weak and had a feeling of the condition of habakkuk when i heard my belly trembled my lips quivered i trembled in myself that i might rest in the day of trouble i had many cogitations and was sorely distressed he prepared a memorial to the legislature then in session for the signatures of friends urging that body to take measures to put an end to the importation of slaves his labors in the yearly meeting appear to have been owned and blessed by the divine head of the church the london epistle for condemning the unrighteous traffic in men was read and the substance of it embodied in the discipline of the meeting and the following query was adopted to be answered by the subordinate meetings are friends clear of importing negroes or buying them when imported and do they use those well where they are possessed by inheritance or otherwise endeavoring to train them up in principles of religion at the close of the yearly meeting john woolman requested those members of the society who held slaves to meet with him in the chamber of the house for worship where he expressed his concern for the wellbeing of the slaves and his sense of the iniquity of the practice of dealing in or holding them as property his tender exhortations were not lost upon his auditors his remarks were kindly received and the gentle and loving spirit in which they were offered reached many hearts in at the suggestion of the rhode island quarterly meeting the yearly meeting expressed its sense of the wrongfulness of holding slaves and appointed a large committee to visit those members who were implicated in the practice the next year this committee reported that they had completed their service and that their visits mostly seemed to be kindly accepted some friends manifested a disposition to set such at liberty as were suitable some others not having so clear a sight of such an unreasonable servitude as could be desired were unwilling to comply with the advice given them at present yet seemed willing to take it into consideration a few others manifested a disposition to keep them in continued bondage it was stated in the epistle to london yearly meeting of the year that a few friends had freed their slaves from bondage but that others have been so reluctant thereto that they have been disowned for not complying with the advice of this meeting in the following minute was made it is our sense and judgment that truth not only requires the young of capacity and ability but likewise the aged and impotent and also all in a state of infancy and nonage among friends to be discharged and set free from a state of slavery that we do no more claim property in the human race as we do in the brutes that perish in no slaves were known to be held in the new england yearly meeting the next year it was recommended to the subordinate meetings to appoint committees to effect a proper and just settlement between the manumitted slaves and their former masters for their past services in it was concluded by the yearly meeting that any former slaveholder who refused to comply with the award of these committees should after due care and labor with him be disowned from the society this was effectual settlements without disownment were made to the satisfaction of all parties and every case was disposed of previous to the year in the new york yearly meeting slavetrading was prohibited about the middle of the last century in in consequence of an epistle from the philadelphia yearly meeting a committee was appointed to visit those who held slaves and to advise with them in relation to emancipation in it was made a disciplinary offence to buy sell or hold slaves upon any condition in but one slave was to be found in the limits of the meeting in the same year by answers from the several subordinate meetings it was ascertained that an equitable settlement for past services had been effected between the emancipated negroes and their masters in all save three cases in the virginia yearly meeting slavery had its strongest hold its members living in the midst of slaveholding communities were necessarily exposed to influences adverse to emancipation i have already alluded to the epistle addressed to them by william edmondson and to the labors of john woolman while travelling among them in the virginia yearly meeting condemned the foreign slavetrade in it enjoined upon its members the duty of kindness towards their servants of educating them and carefully providing for their food and clothing four years after its members were strictly prohibited from purchasing any more slaves in it earnestly recommended the immediate manumission of all slaves held in bondage after the females had reached eighteen and the males twentyone years of age at the same time it was advised that committees should be appointed for the purpose of instructing the emancipated persons in the principles of morality and religion and for advising and aiding them in their temporal concerns i quote a single paragraph from the advice sent down to the subordinate meetings as a beautiful manifestation of the fruits of true repentance it is the solid sense of this meeting that we of the present generation are under strong obligations to express our love and concern for the offspring of those people who by their labors have greatly contributed towards the cultivation of these colonies under the afflictive disadvantage of enduring a hard bondage and the benefit of whose toil many among us are enjoying in the different quarterly meetings having reported that many still held slaves notwithstanding the advice and entreaties of their friends the yearly meeting directed that where endeavors to convince those offenders of their error proved ineffectual the monthly meetings should proceed to disown them we have no means of ascertaining the precise number of those actually disowned for slaveholding in the virginia yearly meeting but it is well known to have been very small in almost all cases the care and assiduous labors of those who had the welfare of the society and of humanity at heart were successful in inducing offenders to manumit their slaves and confess their error in resisting the wishes of their friends and bringing reproach upon the cause of truth so ended slavery in the society of friends for three quarters of a century the advice put forth in the meetings of the society at stated intervals that friends should be careful to maintain their testimony against slavery has been adhered to so far as owning or even hiring a slave is concerned apart from its firstfruits of emancipation there is a perennial value in the example exhibited of the power of truth urged patiently and in earnest love to overcome the difficulties in the way of the eradication of an evil system strengthened by long habit entangled with all the complex relations of society and closely allied with the love of power the pride of family and the lust of gain the influence of the life and labors of john woolman has by no means been confined to the religious society of which he was a member it may be traced wherever a step in the direction of emancipation has been taken in this country or in europe during the war of the revolution many of the noblemen and officers connected with the french army became as their journals abundantly testify deeply interested in the society of friends and took back to france with them something of its growing antislavery sentiment especially was this the case with jean pierre brissot the thinker and statesman of the girondists whose intimacy with warner mifflin a friend and disciple of woolman so profoundly affected his whole after life he became the leader of the friends of the blacks and carried with him to the scaffold a profound hatred of slavery to his efforts may be traced the proclamation of emancipation in hayti by the commissioners of the french convention and indirectly the subsequent uprising of the blacks and their successful establishment of a free government the same influence reached thomas clarkson and stimulated his early efforts for the abolition of the slavetrade and in after life the volume of the new jersey quaker was the cherished companion of himself and his amiable helpmate it was in a degree at least the influence of stephen grellet and william allen men deeply imbued with the spirit of woolman and upon whom it might almost be said his mantle had fallen that drew the attention of alexander i of russia to the importance of taking measures for the abolition of serfdom an object the accomplishment of which the wars during his reign prevented but which left as a legacy of duty has been peaceably effected by his namesake alexander ii in the history of emancipation in our own country evidences of the same original impulse of humanity are not wanting in memorials against slavery from the society of friends were laid before the first congress of the united states not content with clearing their own skirts of the evil the friends of that day took an active part in the formation of the abolition societies of new england new york pennsylvania maryland and virginia jacob lindley elisha tyson warner mifflin james pemberton and other leading friends were known throughout the country as unflinching champions of freedom one of the earliest of the class known as modern abolitionists was benjamin lundy a pupil in the school of woolman through whom william lloyd garrison became interested in the great work to which his life has been so faithfully and nobly devoted looking back to the humble workshop at mount holly from the standpoint of the proclamation of president lincoln how has the seed sown in weakness been raised up in power the larger portion of woolmans writings is devoted to the subjects of slavery uncompensated labor and the excessive toil and suffering of the many to support the luxury of the few the argument running through them is searching and in its conclusions uncompromising but a tender love for the wrongdoer as well as the sufferer underlies all they aim to convince the judgment and reach the heart without awakening prejudice and passion to the slaveholders of his time they must have seemed like the voice of conscience speaking to them in the cool of the day one feels in reading them the tenderness and humility of a nature redeemed from all pride of opinion and selfrighteousness sinking itself out of sight and intent only upon rendering smaller the sum of human sorrow and sin by drawing men nearer to god and to each other the style is that of a man unlettered but with natural refinement and delicate sense of fitness the purity of whose heart enters into his language there is no attempt at fine writing not a word or phrase for effect it is the simple unadorned diction of one to whom the temptations of the pen seem to have been wholly unknown he wrote as he believed from an inward spiritual prompting and with all his unaffected humility he evidently felt that his work was done in the clear radiance of the light which never was on land or sea it was not for him to outrun his guide or as sir thomas browne expresses it to order the finger of the almighty to his will and pleasure but to sit still under the soft showers of providence very wise are these essays but their wisdom is not altogether that of this world they lead one away from all the jealousies strifes and competitions of luxury fashion and gain out of the close air of parties and sects into a region of calmness the haunt of every gentle wind whose breath can teach the wild to love tranquillity a quiet habitation where all things are ordered in what he calls the pure reason a rest from all selfseeking and where no mans interest or activity conflicts with that of another beauty they certainly have but it is not that which the rules of art recognize a certain indefinable purity pervades them making one sensible as he reads of a sweetness as of violets the secret of woolmans purity of style said dr channing is that his eye was single and that conscience dictated his words of course we are not to look to the writings of such a man for tricks of rhetoric the free play of imagination or the unscrupulousness of epigram and antithesis he wrote as he lived conscious of the great taskmasters eye with the wise heathen marcus aurelius antoninus he had learned to wipe out imaginations to check desire and let the spirit that is the gift of god to every man as his guardian and guide bear rule i have thought it inexpedient to swell the bulk of this volume with the entire writings appended to the old edition of the journal inasmuch as they mainly refer to a system which happily on this continent is no longer a question at issue i content myself with throwing together a few passages from them which touch subjects of present interest selfish men may possess the earth it is the meek alone who inherit it from the heavenly father free from all defilements and perplexities of unrighteousness whoever rightly advocates the cause of some thereby promotes the good of the whole if one suffer by the unfaithfulness of another the mind the most noble part of him that occasions the discord is thereby alienated from its true happiness there is harmony in the several parts of the divine work in the hearts of men he who leads them to cease from those gainful employments which are carried on in the wisdom which is from beneath delivers also from the desire of worldly greatness and reconciles to a life so plain that a little suffices after days and nights of drought when the sky hath grown dark and clouds like lakes of water have hung over our heads i have at times beheld with awfulness the vehement lightning accompanying the blessings of the rain a messenger from him to remind us of our duty in a right use of his benefits the marks of famine in a land appear as humbling admonitions from god instructing us by gentle chastisements that we may remember that the outward supply of life is a gift from our heavenly father and that we should not venture to use or apply that gift in a way contrary to pure reason oppression in the extreme appears terrible but oppression in more refined appearances remains to be oppression to labor for a perfect redemption from the spirit of it is the great business of the whole family of jesus christ in this world in the obedience of faith we die to selflove and our life being hid with christ in god our hearts are enlarged towards mankind universally but many in striving to get treasures have departed from this true light of life and stumbled on the dark mountains that purity of life which proceeds from faithfulness in following the pure spirit of truth that state in which our minds are devoted to serve god and all our wants are bounded by his wisdom has often been opened to me as a place of retirement for the children of the light in which we may be separated from that which disordereth and confuseth the affairs of society and may have a testimony for our innocence in the hearts of those who behold us there is a principle which is pure placed in the human mind which in different places and ages bath had different names it is however pure and proceeds from god it is deep and inward confined to no forms of religion nor excluded from any when the heart stands in perfect sincerity in whomsoever this takes root and grows they become brethren the necessity of an inward stillness hath appeared clear to my mind in true silence strength is renewed and the mind is weaned from all things save as they may be enjoyed in the divine will and a lowliness in outward living opposite to worldly honor becomes truly acceptable to us in the desire after outward gain the mind is prevented from a perfect attention to the voice of christ yet being weaned from all things except as they may be enjoyed in the divine will the pure light shines into the soul where the fruits of the spirit which is of this world are brought forth by many who profess to be led by the spirit of truth and cloudiness is felt to be gathering over the visible church the sincere in heart who abide in true stillness and are exercised therein before the lord for his names sake have knowledge of christ in the fellowship of his sufferings and inward thankfulness is felt at times that through divine love our own wisdom is cast out and that forward active part in us is subjected which would rise and do something without the pure leadings of the spirit of christ while aught remains in us contrary to a perfect resignation of our wills it is like a seal to the book wherein is written that good and acceptable and perfect will of god concerning us but when our minds entirely yield to christ that silence is known which followeth the opening of the last of the seals in this silence we learn to abide in the divine will and there feel that we have no cause to promote except that alone in which the light of life directs us occasionally in considerations on the keeping of negroes the intense interest of his subject gives his language something of passionate elevation as in the following extract when trade is carried on productive of much misery and they who suffer by it are many thousand miles off the danger is the greater of not laying their sufferings to heart in procuring slaves on the coast of africa many children are stolen privately wars are encouraged among the negroes but all is at a great distance many groans arise from dying men which we hear not many cries are uttered by widows and fatherless children which reach not our ears many cheeks are wet with tears and faces sad with unutterable grief which we see not cruel tyranny is encouraged the hands of robbers are strengthened were we for the term of one year only to be eyewitnesses of what passeth in getting these slaves were the blood that is there shed to be sprinkled on our garments were the poor captives bound with thongs and heavily laden with elephants teeth to pass before our eyes on their way to the sea were their bitter lamentations day after day to ring in our ears and their mournful cries in the night to hinder us from sleeping were we to behold and hear these things what pious heart would not be deeply affected with sorrow it is good for those who live in fulness to cultivate tenderness of heart and to improve every opportunity of being acquainted with the hardships and fatigues of those who labor for their living and thus to think seriously with themselves am i influenced by true charity in fixing all my demands have i no desire to support myself in expensive customs because my acquaintances live in such customs if a wealthy man on serious reflection finds a witness in his own conscience that he indulges himself in some expensive habits which might be omitted consistently with the true design of living and which were he to change places with those who occupy his estate he would desire to be discontinued by them whoever is thus awakened will necessarily find the injunction binding do ye even so to them divine love imposeth no rigorous or unreasonable commands but graciously points out the spirit of brotherhood and the way to happiness in attaining which it is necessary that we relinquish all that is selfish our gracious creator cares and provides for all his creatures his tender mercies are over all his works and so far as true love influences our minds so far we become interested in his workmanship and feel a desire to make use of every opportunity to lessen the distresses of the afflicted and to increase the happiness of the creation here we have a prospect of one common interest from which our own is inseparable so that to turn all we possess into the channel of universal love becomes the business of our lives his liberality and freedom from all narrowness as to sects and opinions are manifest in the following passages men who sincerely apply their minds to true virtue and find an inward support from above by which all vicious inclinations are made subject who love god sincerely and prefer the real good of mankind universally to their own private interest though these through the strength of education and tradition may remain under some great speculative errors it would be uncharitable to say that therefore god rejects them the knowledge and goodness of him who creates supports and gives understanding to all men are superior to the various states and circumstances of his creatures which to us appear the most difficult idolatry indeed is wickedness but it is the thing not the name which is so real idolatry is to pay that adoration to a creature which is known to be due only to the true god he who professeth to believe in one almighty creator and in his son jesus christ and is yet more intent on the honors profits and friendships of the world than he is in singleness of heart to stand faithful to the christian religion is in the channel of idolatry while the gentile who notwithstanding some mistaken opinions is established in the true principle of virtue and humbly adores an almighty power may be of the number that fear god and work righteousness nowhere has what is called the labor question which is now agitating the world been discussed more wisely and with a broader humanity than in these essays his sympathies were with the poor man yet the rich too are his brethren and he warns them in love and pity of the consequences of luxury and oppression every degree of luxury every demand for money inconsistent with the divine order hath connection with unnecessary labors to treasure up wealth for another generation by means of the immoderate labor of those who in some measure depend upon us is doing evil at present without knowing that wealth thus gathered may not be applied to evil purposes when we are gone to labor hard or cause others to do so that we may live conformably to customs which our redeemer discountenanced by his example and which are contrary to divine order is to manure a soil for propagating an evil seed in the earth when house is joined to house and field laid to field until there is no place and the poor are thereby straitened though this is done by bargain and purchase yet so far as it stands distinguished from universal love so far that woe predicted by the prophet will accompany their proceedings as he who first founded the earth was then the true proprietor of it so he still remains and though he hath given it to the children of men so that multitudes of people have had their sustenance from it while they continued here yet he bath never alienated it but his right is as good as at first nor can any apply the increase of their possessions contrary to universal love nor dispose of lands in a way which they know tends to exalt some by oppressing others without being justly chargeable with usurpation it will not lessen the value of the foregoing extracts in the minds of the truedisciples of our divine lord that they are manifestly not written to subserve the interests of a narrow sectarianism they might have been penned by fenelon in his time or robertson in ours dealing as they do with christian practice the life of christ manifesting itself in purity and goodness rather than with the dogmas of theology the underlying thought of all is simple obedience to the divine word in the soul not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father in heaven in the preface to an english edition published some years ago it is intimated that objections had been raised to the journal on the ground that it had so little to say of doctrines and so much of duties one may easily understand that this objection might have been forcibly felt by the slaveholding religious professors of woolmans day and that it may still be entertained by a class of persons who like the cabalists attach a certain mystical significance to words names and titles and who in consequence question the piety which hesitates to flatter the divine ear by vain repetitions and formal enumeration of sacred attributes dignities and offices every instinct of his tenderly sensitive nature shrank from the wordy irreverence of noisy profession his very silence is significant the husks of emptiness rustle in every wind the full corn in the ear holds up its golden fruit noiselessly to the lord of the harvest john woolmans faith like the apostles is manifested by his labors standing not in words but in the demonstration of the spirit a faith that works by love to the purifying of the heart the entire outcome of this faith was love manifested in reverent waiting upon god and in that untiring benevolence that quiet but deep enthusiasm of humanity which made his daily service to his fellowcreatures a hymn of praise to the common father however the intellect may criticise such a life whatever defects it may present to the trained eyes of theological adepts the heart has no questions to ask but at once owns and reveres it shall we regret that he who had so entered into fellowship of suffering with the divine one walking with him under the cross and dying daily to self gave to the faith and hope that were in him this testimony of a life rather than any form of words however sound a true life is at once interpreter and proof of the gospel and does more to establish its truth in the hearts of men than all the evidences and bodies of divinity which have perplexed the world with more doubts than they solved shall we venture to account it a defect in his christian character that under an abiding sense of the goodness and longsuffering of god he wrought his work in gentleness and compassion with the delicate tenderness which comes of a deep sympathy with the trials and weaknesses of our nature never allowing himself to indulge in heat or violence persuading rather than threatening did he overestimate that immeasurable love the manifestation of which in his own heart so reached the hearts of others revealing everywhere unsuspected fountains of feeling and secret longings after purity as the rod of the diviner detects sweet cool watersprings under the parched surfaces of a thirsty land and looking at the purity wisdom and sweetness of his life who shall say that his faith in the teaching of the holy spirit the interior guide and light was a mistaken one surely it was no illusion by which his feet were so guided that all who saw him felt that like enoch he walked with god without the actual inspiration of the spirit of grace the inward teacher and soul of our souls says fenelon we could neither do will nor believe good we must silence every creature we must silence ourselves also to hear in a profound stillness of the soul this inexpressible voice of christ the outward word of the gospel itself without this living efficacious word within would be but an empty sound thou lord says augustine in his meditations communicatest thyself to all thou teachest the heart without words thou speakest to it without articulate sounds however i am sure that there is a common spirit that plays within us and that is the spirit of god whoever feels not the warm gale and gentle ventilation of this spirit i dare not say he lives for truly without this to me there is no heat under the tropic nor any light though i dwelt in the body of the sun sir thomas brownes religio medici never was this divine principle more fully tested than by john wool man and the result is seen in a life of such rare excellence that the world is still better and richer for its sake and the fragrance of it comes down to us through a century still sweet and precious it will be noted throughout the journal and essays that in his lifelong testimony against wrong he never lost sight of the oneness of humanity its common responsibility its fellowship of suffering and communion of sin few have ever had so profound a conviction of the truth of the apostles declaration that no man liveth and no man dieth to himself sin was not to him an isolated fact the responsibility of which began and ended with the individual transgressor he saw it as a part of a vast network and entanglement and traced the lines of influence converging upon it in the underworld of causation hence the wrong and discord which pained him called out pity rather than indignation the first inquiry which they awakened was addressed to his own conscience how far am i in thought word custom responsible for this have none of my fellowcreatures an equitable right to any part which is called mine have the gifts and possessions received by me from others been conveyed in a way free from all unrighteousness through abiding in the law of christ he says we feel a tenderness towards our fellowcreatures and a concern so to walk that our conduct may not be the means of strengthening them in error he constantly recurs to the importance of a right example in those who profess to be led by the spirit of christ and who attempt to labor in his name for the benefit of their fellowmen if such neglect or refuse themselves to act rightly they can but entangle the minds of others and draw a veil over the face of righteousness his eyes were anointed to see the common point of departure from the divine harmony and that all the varied growths of evil had their underlying root in human selfishness he saw that every sin of the individual was shared in greater or less degree by all whose lives were opposed to the divine order and that pride luxury and avarice in one class gave motive and temptation to the grosser forms of evil in another how gentle and yet how searching are his rebukes of selfcomplacent respectability holding it responsible in spite of all its decent seemings for much of the depravity which it condemned with pharisaical harshness in his considerations on the true harmony of mankind be dwells with great earnestness upon the importance of possessing the mind of christ which removes from the heart the desire of superiority and worldly honors incites attention to the divine counsellor and awakens an ardent engagement to promote the happiness of all this state he says in which every motion from the selfish spirit yieldeth to pure love i may acknowledge with gratitude to the father of mercies is often opened before me as a pearl to seek after at times when i have felt true love open my heart towards my fellowcreatures and have been engaged in weighty conversation in the cause of righteousness the instructions i have received under these exercises in regard to the true use of the outward gifts of god have made deep and lasting impressions on my mind i have beheld how the desire to provide wealth and to uphold a delicate life has greviously entangled many and has been like a snare to their offspring and though some have been affected with a sense of their difficulties and have appeared desirous at times to be helped out of them yet for want of abiding under the humbling power of truth they have continued in these entanglements expensive living in parents and children hath called for a large supply and in answering this call the faces of the poor have been ground away and made thin through hard dealing there is balm there is a physician and oh what longings do i feel that we may embrace the means appointed for our healing may know that removed which now ministers cause for the cries of many to ascend to heaven against their oppressors and that thus we may see the true harmony restored a restoration of that which was lost at babel and which will be as the prophet expresses it the returning of a pure language it is easy to conceive how unwelcome this clear spiritual insight must have been to the superficial professors of his time busy in tithing mint anise and cummin there must have been something awful in the presence of one endowed with the gift of looking through all the forms shows and pretensions of society and detecting with certainty the germs of evil hidden beneath them a man gentle and full of compassion clothed in the irresistible might of meekness and yet so wise in spiritual discernment bearing a touchstone in his hand and testing all things in the land by his unerring spell quick births of transmutation smote the fair to foul the foul to fair purple nor ermine did he spare nor scorn the dusty coat in bringing to a close this paper the preparation of which has been to me a labor of love i am not unmindful of the wide difference between the appreciation of a pure and true life and the living of it and am willing to own that in delineating a character of such moral and spiritual symmetry i have felt something like rebuke from my own words i have been awed and solemnized by the presence of a serene and beautiful spirit redeemed of the lord from all selfishness and i have been made thankful for the ability to recognize and the disposition to love him i leave the book with its readers they may possibly make large deductions from my estimate of the author they may not see the importance of all his selfdenying testimonies they may question some of his scruples and smile over passages of childlike simplicity but i believe they will all agree in thanking me for introducing them to the journal of john woolman amesbury th st mo haverford college letter to president thomas chase ll d amesbury mass th mo the semicentennial of haverford college is an event that no member of the society of friends can regard without deep interest it would give me great pleasure to be with you on the th inst but the years rest heavily upon me and i have scarcely health or strength for such a journey it was my privilege to visit haverford in in the day of small beginnings the promise of usefulness which it then gave has been more than fulfilled it has grown to be a great and wellestablished institution and its influence in thorough education and moral training has been widely felt if the high educational standard presented in the scholastic treatise of barclay and the moral philosophy of dymond has been lowered or disowned by many who still retaining the name of quakerism have lost faith in the vital principle wherein precious testimonials of practical righteousness have their root and have gone back to a dead literalness and to those materialistic ceremonials for leaving which our old confessors suffered bonds and death haverford at least has been in a good degree faithful to the trust committed to it under circumstances of more than ordinary difficulty it has endeavored to maintain the great testimony the spirit of its culture has not been a narrow one nor could it be if true to the broad and catholic principles of the eminent worthies who founded the state of pennsylvania penn lloyd pastorius logan and story men who were masters of the scientific knowledge and culture of their age hospitable to all truth and open to all light and who in some instances anticipated the result of modern research and critical inquiry it was thomas story a minister of the society of friends and member of penns council of state who while on a religious visit to england wrote to james logan that he had read on the stratified rocks of scarborough as from the finger of god proofs of the immeasurable age of our planet and that the days of the letter of scripture could only mean vast spaces of time may haverford emulate the example of these brave but reverent men who in investigating nature never lost sight of the divine ideal and who to use the words of fenelon silenced themselves to hear in the stillness of their souls the inexpressible voice of christ holding fast the mighty truth of the divine immanence the inward light and word a quaker college can have no occasion to renew the disastrous quarrel of religion with science against the sublime faith which shall yet dominate the world skepticism has no power no possible investigation of natural facts no searching criticism of letter and tradition can disturb it for it has its witness in all human hearts that haverford may fully realize and improve its great opportunities as an approved seat of learning and the exponent of a christian philosophy which can never be superseded which needs no change to fit it for universal acceptance and which overpassing the narrow limits of sect is giving new life and hope to christendom and finding its witnesses in the hindu revivals of the brahmo somaj and the fervent utterances of chunda sen and mozoomdar is the earnest desire of thy friend criticism evangeline a review of mr longfellows poem eureka here then we have it at last an american poem with the lack of which british reviewers have so long reproached us selecting the subject of all others best calculated for his purpose the expulsion of the french settlers of acadie from their quiet and pleasant homes around the basin of minas one of the most sadly romantic passages in the history of the colonies of the north the author has succeeded in presenting a series of exquisite pictures of the striking and peculiar features of life and nature in the new world the range of these delineations extends from nova scotia on the northeast to the spurs of the rocky mountains on the west and the gulf of mexico on the south nothing can be added to his pictures of quiet farmlife in acadie the indian summer of our northern latitudes the scenery of the ohio and mississippi rivers the bayous and cypress forests of the south the mockingbird the prairie the ozark hills the catholic missions and the wild arabs of the west roaming with the buffalo along the banks of the nebraska the hexameter measure he has chosen has the advantage of a prosaic freedom of expression exceedingly well adapted to a descriptive and narrative poem yet we are constrained to think that the story of evangeline would have been quite as acceptable to the public taste had it been told in the poetic prose of the authors hyperion in reading it and admiring its strange melody we were not without fears that the success of professor longfellow in this novel experiment might prove the occasion of calling out a host of awkward imitators leading us over weary wastes of hexameters enlivened neither by dew rain nor fields of offering apart from its americanism the poem has merits of a higher and universal character it is not merely a work of art the pulse of humanity throbs warmly through it the portraits of basil the blacksmith the old notary benedict bellefontaine and good father felician fairly glow with life the beautiful evangeline loving and faithful unto death is a heroine worthy of any poet of the present century the editor of the boston chronotype in the course of an appreciative review of this poem urges with some force a single objection which we are induced to notice as it is one not unlikely to present itself to the minds of other readers we think mr longfellow ought to have expressed a much deeper indignation at the base knavish and heartless conduct of the english and colonial persecutors than he has done he should have put far bolder and deeper tints in the picture of suffering one great if not the greatest end of poetry is rhadamanthine justice the poet should mete out their deserts to all his heroes honor to whom honor and infamy to whom infamy is due it is true that the wrong in this case is in a great degree fathered upon our own massachusetts and it maybe said that it is afoul bird that pollutes its own nest we deny the applicability of the rather musty proverb all the worse of not a more contemptible vice is what is called american literature guilty than this of unmitigated selflaudation if we persevere in it the stock will become altogether too small for the business it seems that no period of our history has been exempt from materials for patriotic humiliation and national selfreproach and surely the present epoch is laying in a large store of that sort had our poets always told us the truth of ourselves perhaps it would now be otherwise national selfflattery and concealment of faults must of course have their natural results we must confess that we read the first part of evangeline with something of the feeling so forcibly expressed by professor wright the natural and honest indignation with which many years ago we read for the first time that dark page of our colonial history the expulsion of the french neutrals was reawakened by the simple pathos of the poem and we longed to find an adequate expression of it in the burning language of the poet we marvelled that he who could so touch the heart by his description of the sad suffering of the acadian peasants should have permitted the authors of that suffering to escape without censure the outburst of the stout basil in the church of grand pre was we are fain to acknowledge a great relief to us but before reaching the close of the volume we were quite reconciled to the authors forbearance the design of the poem is manifestly incompatible with stern rhadamanthine justice and indignant denunciation of wrong it is a simple story of quiet pastoral happiness of great sorrow and painful bereavement and of the endurance of a love which hoping and seeking always wanders evermore up and down the wilderness of the world baffled at every turn yet still retaining faith in god and in the object of its lifelong quest it was no part of the writers object to investigate the merits of the question at issue between the poor acadians and their puritan neighbors looking at the materials before him with the eye of an artist simply he has arranged them to suit his idea of the beautiful and pathetic leaving to some future historian the duty of sitting in judgment upon the actors in the atrocious outrage which furnished them with this we are content the poem now has unity and sweetness which might have been destroyed by attempting to avenge the wrongs it so vividly depicts it is a psalm of love and forgiveness the gentleness and peace of christian meekness and forbearance breathe through it not a word of censure is directly applied to the marauding workers of the mighty sorrow which it describes just as it would a calamity from the elements a visitation of god the reader however cannot fail to award justice to the wrongdoers the unresisting acquiescence of the acadians only deepens his detestation of the cupidity and religious bigotry of their spoilers even in the language of the good father felician beseeching his flock to submit to the strong hand which had been laid upon them we see and feel the magnitude of the crime to be forgiven lo where the crucified christ from his cross is gazing upon you see in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion hark how those lips still repeat the prayer o father forgive them let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us let us repeat it now and say o father forgive them how does this simple prayer of the acadians contrast with the deep damnation of their taking off the true history of the puritans of new england is yet to be written somewhere midway between the caricatures of the church party and the selflaudations of their own writers the point may doubtless be found from whence an impartial estimate of their character may be formed they had noble qualities the firmness and energy which they displayed in the colonization of new england must always command admiration we would not rob them were it in our power to do so of one jot or tittle of their rightful honor but with all the lights which we at present possess we cannot allow their claim of saintship without some degree of qualification how they seemed to their dutch neighbors at new netherlands and their french ones at nova scotia and to the poor indians hunted from their fisheries and gamegrounds we can very well conjecture it may be safely taken for granted that their gospel claim to the inheritance of the earth was not a little questionable to the catholic fleeing for his life from their jurisdiction to the banished baptist shaking off the dust of his feet against them and to the martyred quaker denouncing woe and judgment upon them from the steps of the gallows most of them were beyond a doubt pious and sincere but we are constrained to believe that among them were those who wore the livery of heaven from purely selfish motives in a community where churchmembership was an indispensable requisite the only open sesame before which the doors of honor and distinction swung wide to needy or ambitious aspirants mere adventurers men of desperate fortunes bankrupts in character and purse contrived to make gain of godliness under the church and state government of new england put on the austere exterior of sanctity quoted scripture anathematized heretics whipped quakers exterminated indians burned and spoiled the villages of their catholic neighbors and hewed down their graven images and houses of rimmon it is curious to observe how a fierce religious zeal against heathen and idolaters went hand in hand with the old anglosaxon love of land and plunder every crusade undertaken against the papists of the french colonies had its puritan peter the hermit to summon the saints to the wars of the lord at the siege of louisburg ten years before the onslaught upon the acadian settlers one minister marched with the colonial troops axe in hand to hew down the images in the french churches while another officiated in the double capacity of drummer and chaplain a drum ecclesiastic as hudibras has it at the late celebration of the landing of the pilgrims in new york the orator of the day labored at great length to show that the charge of intolerance as urged against the colonists of new england is unfounded in fact the banishment of the catholics was very sagaciously passed over in silence inasmuch as the catholic bishop of new york was one of the invited guests and hear it shade of cotton mather one of the regular toasts was a compliment to the pope the expulsion of roger williams was excused and partially justified while the whipping earcropping tongueboring and hanging of the quakers was defended as the only effectual method of dealing with such devildriven heretics as mather calls them the orator in the newborn zeal of his amateur puritanism stigmatizes the persecuted class as fanatics and ranters foaming forth their mad opinions compares them to the mormons and the crazy followers of mathias and cites an instance of a poor enthusiast named eccles who far gone in the tailors melancholy took it into his head that he must enter into a steeplehouse pulpit and stitch breeches in singing time a circumstance by the way which took place in old england as a justification of the atrocious laws of the massachusetts colony we have not the slightest disposition to deny the fanaticism and folly of some few professed quakers in that day and had the puritans treated them as the pope did one of their number whom he found crazily holding forth in the church of st peter and consigned them to the care of physicians as religious monomaniacs no sane man could have blamed them every sect in its origin and especially in its time of persecution has had its fanatics the early christians if we may credit the admissions of their own writers or attach the slightest credence to the statements of pagan authors were by no means exempt from reproach and scandal in this respect were the puritans themselves the men to cast stones at the quakers and baptists had they not in the view at least of the established church turned all england upside down with their fanaticisms and extravagances of doctrine and conduct how look they as depicted in the sermons of dr south in the sarcastic pages of hudibras and the coarse caricatures of the clerical wits of the times of the second charles with their own backs scored and their ears cropped for the crime of denying the divine authority of church and state in england were they the men to whip baptists and hang quakers for doing the same thing in massachusetts of all that is noble and true in the puritan character we are sincere admirers the generous and selfdenying apostleship of eliot is of itself a beautiful page in their history the physical daring and hardihood with which amidst the times of savage warfare they laid the foundations of mighty states and subdued the rugged soil and made the wilderness blossom their steadfast adherence to their religious principles even when the restoration had made apostasy easy and profitable and the vigilance and firmness with which under all circumstances they held fast their chartered liberties and extorted new rights and privileges from the reluctant home government justly entitle them to the grateful remembrance of a generation now reaping the fruits of their toils and sacrifices but in expressing our gratitude to the founders of new england we should not forget what is due to truth and justice nor for the sake of vindicating them from the charge of that religious intolerance which at the time they shared with nearly all christendom undertake to defend in the light of the nineteenth century opinions and practices hostile to the benignant spirit of the gospel and subversive of the inherent rights of man mirth and medicine a review of poems by oliver wendell holmes if any of our readers and at times we fear it is the case with all need amusement and the wholesome alterative of a hearty laugh we commend them not to dr holmes the physician but to dr holmes the scholar the wit and the humorist not to the scientific medical professors barbarous latin but to his poetical prescriptions given in choice old saxon we have tried them and are ready to give the doctor certificates of their efficacy looking at the matter from the point of theory only we should say that a physician could not be otherwise than melancholy a merry doctor why one might as well talk of a laughing deathshead the cachinnation of a monks memento mori this life of ours is sorrowful enough at its best estate the brightest phase of it is sicklied oer with the pale cast of the future or the past but it is the special vocation of the doctor to look only upon the shadow to turn away from the house of feasting and go down to that of mourning to breathe day after day the atmosphere of wretchedness to grow familiar with suffering to look upon humanity disrobed of its pride and glory robbed of all its fictitious ornaments weak helpless naked and undergoing the last fearful metempsychosis from its erect and godlike image the living temple of an enshrined divinity to the loathsome clod and the inanimate dust of what ghastly secrets of moral and physical disease is he the depositary there is woe before him and behind him he is hand and glove with misery by prescription the ex officio gauger of the ills that flesh is heir to he has no home unless it be at the bedside of the querulous the splenetic the sick and the dying he sits down to carve his turkey and is summoned off to a postmortem examination of another sort all the diseases which miltons imagination embodied in the lazarhouse dog his footsteps and pluck at his doorbell hurrying from one place to another at their beck he knows nothing of the quiet comfort of the sleekheaded men who sleep o nights his wife if he has one has an undoubted right to advertise him as a deserter of bed and board his ideas of beauty the imaginations of his brain and the affections of his heart are regulated and modified by the irrepressible associations of his luckless profession woman as well as man is to him of the earth earthy he sees incipient disease where the uninitiated see only delicacy a smile reminds him of his dental operations a blushing cheek of his hectic patients pensive melancholy is dyspepsia sentimentalism nervousness tell him of lovelorn hearts of the worm i the bud of the mental impalement upon cupids arrow like that of a giaour upon the spear of a janizary and he can only think of lack of exercise of tightlacing and slippers in winter sheridan seems to have understood all this if we may judge from the lament of his doctor in st patricks day over his deceased helpmate poor dear dolly says he i shall never see her like again such an arm for a bandage veins that seemed to invite the lancet then her skin smooth and white as a gallipot her mouth as round and not larger than that of a penny vial and her teeth none of your sturdy fixtures ache as they would it was only a small pull and out they came i believe i have drawn half a score of her dear pearls weeps but what avails her beauty she has gone and left no little babe to hang like a label on papas neck so much for speculation and theory in practice it is not so bad after all the gravedigger in hamlet has his jokes and grim jests we have known many a jovial sexton and we have heard clergymen laugh heartily at small provocation close on the heel of a cool calculation that the great majority of their fellowcreatures were certain of going straight to perdition why then should not even the doctor have his fun nay is it not his duty to be merry by main force if necessary solomon who from his great knowledge of herbs must have been no mean practitioner for his day tells us that a merry heart doeth good like a medicine and universal experience has confirmed the truth of his maxim hence it is doubtless that we have so many anecdotes of facetious doctors distributing their pills and jokes together shaking at the same time the contents of their vials and the sides of their patients it is merely professional a trick of the practice unquestionably in most cases but sometimes it is a natural gift like that of the bonesetters and scrofula strokers and cancer curers who carry on a sort of guerilla war with human maladies such we know to be the case with dr holmes he was born for the laughter cure as certainly as priessnitz was for the water cure and has been quite as successful in his way while his prescriptions are infinitely more agreeable the volume now before us gives in addition to the poems and lyrics contained in the two previous editions some hundred or more pages of the later productions of the author in the sprightly vein and marked by the brilliant fancy and felicitous diction for which the former were noteworthy his longest and most elaborate poem urania is perhaps the best specimen of his powers its general tone is playful and humorous but there are passages of great tenderness and pathos witness the following from a description of the city churchgoers the whole compass of our literature has few passages to equal its melody and beauty down the chill street which winds in gloomiest shade what marks betray yon solitary maid the cheeks red rose that speaks of balmier air the celtic blackness of her braided hair the gilded missal in her kerchief tied poor nora exile from killarneys side sister in toil though born of colder skies that left their azure in her downcast eyes see pallid margaret labors patient child scarce weaned from home a nursling of the wild where white katahdin oer the horizon shines and broad penobscot dashes through the pines still as she hastes her careful fingers hold the unfailing hymnbook in its cambric fold six days at drudgerys heavy wheel she stands the seventh sweet morning folds her weary hands yes child of suffering thou mayst well be sure he who ordained the sabbath loved the poor this is but one of many passages showing that the author is capable of moving the heart as well as of tickling the fancy there is no straining for effect simple natural thoughts are expressed in simple and perfectly transparent language terpsichore read at an annual dinner of the phi beta kappa society at cambridge sparkles throughout with keen wit quaint conceits and satire so goodnatured that the subjects of it can enjoy it as heartily as their neighbors witness this thrust at our germanenglish writers essays so dark champollion might despair to guess what mummy of a thought was there where our poor english striped with foreign phrase looks like a zebra in a parsons chaise or this at our transcendental friends deluded infants will they never know some doubts must darken oer the world below though all the platos of the nursery trail their clouds of glory at the gocarts tail the lines on lending a punchbowl are highly characteristic nobody but holmes could have conjured up so many rare fancies in connection with such a matter hear him this ancient silver bowl of mine it tells of good old times of joyous days and jolly nights and merry christmas chimes they were a free and jovial race but honest brave and true that dipped their ladle in the punch when this old bowl was new a spanish galleon brought the bar so runs the ancient tale t was hammered by an antwerp smith whose arm was like a flail and now and then between the strokes for fear his strength should fail he wiped his brow and quaffed a cup of good old flemish ale t was purchased by an english squire to please his loving dame who saw the cherubs and conceived a longing for the same and oft as on the ancient stock another twig was found t was filled with candle spiced and hot and handed smoking round but changing hands it reached at length a puritan divine who used to follow timothy and take a little wine but hated punch and prelacy and so it was perhaps he went to leyden where he found conventicles and schnaps and then of course you know whats next it left the dutchmans shore with those that in the mayflower came a hundred souls and more along with all the furniture to fill their new abodes to judge by what is still on hand at least a hundred loads t was on a dreary winters eve the night was closing dim when brave miles standish took the bowl and filled it to the brim the little captain stood and stirred the posset with his sword and all his sturdy menatarms were ranged about the board he poured the fiery hollands in the man that never feared he took a long and solemn draught and wiped his yellow beard and one by one the musketeers the men that fought and prayed all drank as t were their mothers milk and not a man afraid that night affrighted from his nest the screaming eagle flew he heard the pequots ringing whoop the soldiers wild halloo and there the sachem learned the rule he taught to kith and kin run from the white man when you find he smells of hollands gin in his nux postcoenatica he gives us his reflections on being invited to a dinnerparty where he was expected to set the table in a roar by reading funny verses he submits it to the judgment and common sense of the importunate bearer of the invitation that this dinnergoing balladmaking mirthprovoking habit is not likely to benefit his reputation as a medical professor besides my prospects dont you know that people wont employ a man that wrongs his manliness by laughing like a boy and suspect the azure blossom that unfolds upon a shoot as if wisdoms oldpotato could not flourish at its root its a very fine reflection when youre etching out a smile on a copperplate of faces that would stretch into a mile that what with sneers from enemies and cheapening shrugs from friends it will cost you all the earnings that a month of labor lends there are as might be expected some commonplace pieces in the volume a few failures in the line of humor the spectre pig the dorchester giant the height of the ridiculous and one or two others might be omitted in the next edition without detriment they would do well enough for an amateur humorist but are scarcely worthy of one who stands at the head of the profession it was said of james smith of the rejected addresses that if he had not been a witty man he would have been a great man hoods humor and drollery kept in the background the pathos and beauty of his sober productions and dr holmes we suspect might have ranked higher among a large class of readers than he now does had he never written his ballad of the oysterman his comet and his september gale such lyrics as la grisette the puritans vision and that unique compound of humor and pathos the last leaf show that he possesses the power of touching the deeper chords of the heart and of calling forth tears as well as smiles who does not feel the power of this simple picture of the old man in the lastmentioned poem but now he walks the streets and he looks at all he meets sad and wan and he shakes his feeble head that it seems as if he said they are gone the mossy marbles rest on the lips that he has prest in their bloom and the names he loved to hear have been carved for many a year on the tomb dr holmes has been likened to thomas hood but there is little in common between them save the power of combining fancy and sentiment with grotesque drollery and humor hood under all his whims and oddities conceals the vehement intensity of a reformer the iron of the worlds wrongs had entered into his soul there is an undertone of sorrow in his lyrics his sarcasm directed against oppression and bigotry at times betrays the earnestness of one whose own withers have been wrung holmes writes simply for the amusement of himself and his readers he deals only with the vanity the foibles and the minor faults of mankind good naturedly and almost sympathizingly suggesting excuses for the folly which he tosses about on the horns of his ridicule in this respect he differs widely from his fellowtownsman russell lowell whose keen wit and scathing sarcasm in the famous biglow papers and the notes of parson wilbur strike at the great evils of society and deal with the rank offences of church and state hosea biglow in his way is as earnest a preacher as habakkuk mucklewrath or obadiah bindtheirkingsinchainsandtheirnoblesinfettersofiron his verse smacks of the old puritan flavor holmes has a gentler mission his careless genial humor reminds us of james smith in his rejected addresses and of horace in london long may he live to make broader the face of our careridden generation and to realize for himself the truth of the wise mans declaration that a merry heart is a continual feast fame and glory notice of an address before the literary society of amherst college by charles sumner the learned and eloquent author of the pamphlet lying before us with the above title belongs to a class happily on the increase in our country who venture to do homage to unpopular truths in defiance of the social and political tyranny of opinion which has made so many of our statesmen orators and divines the mere playthings and shuttlecocks of popular impulses for evil far oftener than for good his first production the true grandeur of nations written for the anniversary of american independence was not more remarkable for its evidences of a highly cultivated taste and wide historical research than for its inculcation of a high morality the demand for practical christianity in nations as well as individuals it burned no incense under the nostrils of an already inflated and vain people it gratified them by no rhetorical falsehoods about the land of the free and the home of the brave it did not apostrophize military heroes nor strut red wat shod over the plains of battle nor call up like another ezekiel from the valley of vision the dry bones thereof it uttered none of the precious scoundrel cant so much in vogue after the annexation of texas was determined upon about the destiny of the united states to enter in and possess the lands of all whose destiny it is to live next us and to plant everywhere the peculiar institutions of a peculiarly christian and chosen people the landstealing propensity of whose progressive republicanism is declared to be in accordance with the will and by the grace of god and who like the scotch freebooter pattering an ave mary when he rode on a border forray while trampling on the rights of a sister republic and recreating slavery where that republic had abolished it talk piously of the designs of providence and the anglosaxon instrumentalities thereof in extending the area of freedom on the contrary the author portrayed the evils of war and proved its incompatibility with christianity contrasting with its ghastly triumphs the mild victories of peace and love our true mission he taught was not to act over in the new world the barbarous game which has desolated the old but to offer to the nations of the earth warring and discordant oppressed and oppressing the beautiful example of a free and happy people studying the things which make for peace democracy and christianity walking hand in hand blessing and being blessed his next public effort an address before the literary society of his alma mater was in the same vein he improved the occasion of the recent death of four distinguished members of that fraternity to delineate his beautiful ideal of the jurist the scholar the artist and the philanthropist aided by the models furnished by the lives of such men as pickering story allston and channing here also he makes greatness to consist of goodness war and slavery and all their offspring of evil are surveyed in the light of the morality of the new testament he looks hopefully forward to the coming of that day when the sword shall devour no longer when labor shall grind no longer in the prisonhouse and the peace and freedom of a realized and actedout christianity shall overspread the earth and the golden age predicted by the seers and poets alike of paganism and christianity shall become a reality the address now before us with the same general object in view is more direct and practical we can scarcely conceive of a discourse better adapted to prepare the young american just issuing from his collegiate retirement for the duties and responsibilities of citizenship it treats the desire of fame and honor as one native to the human heart felt to a certain extent by all as a part of our common being a motive although by no means the most exalted of human conduct and the lesson it would inculcate is that no true and permanent fame can be founded except in labors which promote the happiness of mankind to use the language of dr south god is the fountain of honor the conduit by which he conveys it to the sons of men are virtuous and generous practices the author presents the beautiful examples of st pierre milton howard and clarkson men whose fame rests on the firm foundation of goodness for the study and imitation of the young candidate for that true glory which belongs to those who live not for themselves but for their race neither present fame nor war nor power nor wealth nor knowledge alone shall secure an entrance to the true and noble valhalla there shall be gathered only those who have toiled each in his vocation for the welfare of others justice and benevolence are higher than knowledge and power it is by his goodness that god is most truly known so also is the great man when moses said to the lord show me thy glory the lord said i will make all my goodness pass before thee we copy the closing paragraph of the address the inspiring sentiment of which will find a response in all generous and hopeful hearts let us reverse the very poles of the worship of past ages men have thus far bowed down before stocks stones insects crocodiles golden calves graven images often of cunning workmanship wrought with phidian skill of ivory of ebony of marble but all false gods let them worship in future the true god our father as he is in heaven and in the beneficent labors of his children on earth then farewell to the siren song of a worldly ambition farewell to the vain desire of mere literary success or oratorical display farewell to the distempered longings for office farewell to the dismal bloodred phantom of martial renown fame and glory may then continue as in times past the reflection of public opinion but of an opinion sure and steadfast without change or fickleness enlightened by those two sons of christian truth love to god and love to man from the serene illumination of these duties all the forms of selfishness shall retreat like evil spirits at the dawn of day then shall the happiness of the poor and lowly and the education of the ignorant have uncounted friends the cause of those who are in prison shall find fresh voices the majesty of peace other vindicators the sufferings of the slave new and gushing floods of sympathy then at last shall the brotherhood of man stand confessed ever filling the souls of all with a more generous life ever prompting to deeds of beneficence conquering the heathen prejudices of country color and race guiding the judgment of the historian animating the verse of the poet and the eloquence of the orator ennobling human thought and conduct and inspiring those good works by which alone we may attain to the heights of true glory good works such even now is the heavenly ladder on which angels are ascending and descending while weary humanity on pillows of storfe slumbers heavily at its feet we know how easy it is to sneer at such anticipations of a better future as baseless and visionary the shrewd but narroweyed man of the world laughs at the suggestion that there car be any stronger motive than selfishness any higher morality than that of the brokers board the man who relies for salvation from the consequences of an evil and selfish life upon the verbal orthodoxy of a creed presents the depravity and weakness of human nature as insuperable obstacles in the way of the general amelioration of the condition of a world lying in wickedness he counts it heretical and dangerous to act upon the supposition that the same human nature which in his own case and that of his associates can confront all perils overcome all obstacles and outstrip the whirlwind in the pursuit of gain which makes the strong elements its servants taming and subjugating the very lightnings of heaven to work out its own purposes of selfaggrandizement must necessarily and by an ordination of providence become weak as water when engaged in works of love and goodwill looking for the coming of a better day for humanity with faith in the promises of the gospel and relying upon him who in calling man to the great taskfield of duty has not mocked him with the mournful necessity of laboring in vain we have been pained more than words can express to see young generous hearts yearning with strong desires to consecrate themselves to the cause of their fellowmen checked and chilled by the ridicule of worldlywise conservatism and the solemn rebukes of practical infidelity in the guise of a piety which professes to love the unseen father while disregarding the claims of his visible children visionary were not the good st pierre and fenelon and howard and clarkson visionaries also what was john woolman to the wise and prudent of his day but an amiable enthusiast what to those of our own is such an angel of mercy as dorothea dix who will not in view of the labors of such philanthropists adopt the language of jonathan edwards if these things be enthusiasms and the fruits of a distempered brain let my brain be evermore possessed with this happy distemper it must however be confessed that there is a cant of philanthropy too general and abstract for any practical purpose a morbid sentimentalism which contents itself with whining over real or imaginary present evil and predicting a better state somewhere in the future but really doing nothing to remove the one or hasten the coming of the other to its view the present condition of things is all wrong no green hillock or twig rises over the waste deluge the heaven above is utterly dark and starless yet somehow out of this darkness which may be felt the light is to burst forth miraculously wrong sin pain and sorrow are to be banished from the renovated world and earth become a vast epicurean garden or mahometan heaven the land unploughed shall yield her crop pure honey from the oak shall drop the fountain shall run milk the thistle shall the lily bear and every bramble roses wear and every worm make silk ben jensons golden age restored there are in short perfectionist reformers as well as religionists who wait to see the salvation which it is the task of humanity itself to work out and who look down from a region of ineffable selfcomplacence on their dusty and toiling brethren who are resolutely doing whatsoever their hands find to do for the removal of the evils around them the emblem of practical christianity is the samaritan stooping over the wounded jew no fastidious hand can lift from the dust fallen humanity and bind up its unsightly gashes sentimental lamentation over evil and suffering may be indulged in until it becomes a sort of melancholy luxury like the weeping for thammuz by the apostate daughters of jerusalem our faith in a better day for the race is strong but we feel quite sure it will come in spite of such abstract reformers and not by reason of them the evils which possess humanity are of a kind which go not out by their delicate appliances the author of the address under consideration is not of this class he has boldly and at no small cost grappled with the great social and political wrong of our country chattel slavery looking as we have seen hopefully to the future he is nevertheless one of those who can respond to the words of a true poet and true man he is a coward who would borrow a charm against the present sorrow from the vague futures promise of delight as lifes alarums nearer roll the ancestral buckler calls selfclanging from the walls in the high temple of the soul james russell lowell fanaticism there are occasionally deeds committed almost too horrible and revolting for publication the tongue falters in giving them utterance the pen trembles that records them such is the ghastly horror of a late tragedy in edgecomb in the state of maine a respectable and thriving citizen and his wife had been for some years very unprofitably engaged in brooding over the mysteries of the apocalypse and in speculations upon the personal coming of christ and the temporal reign of the saints on earth a sort of mahometan paradise which has as little warrant in scripture as in reason their minds of necessity became unsettled they meditated selfdestruction and as it appears by a paper left behind in the handwriting of both came to an agreement that the husband should first kill his wife and their four children and then put an end to his own existence this was literally executed the miserable man striking off the heads of his wife and children with his axe and then cutting his own throat alas for man when he turns from the light of reason and from the simple and clearly defined duties of the present life and undertakes to pry into the mysteries of the future bewildering himself with uncertain and vague prophecies oriental imagery and obscure hebrew texts simple cheerful faith in god as our great and good father and love of his children as our brethren acted out in all relations and duties is certainly best for this world and we believe also the best preparation for that to come once possessed by the falsity that gods design is that man should be wretched and gloomy here in order to obtain rest and happiness hereafter that the mental agonies and bodily tortures of his creatures are pleasant to him that after bestowing upon us reason for our guidance he makes it of no avail by interposing contradictory revelations and arbitrary commands there is nothing to prevent one of a melancholic and excitable temperament from excesses so horrible as almost to justify the old belief in demoniac obsession charles brockden brown a writer whose merits have not yet been sufficiently acknowledged has given a powerful and philosophical analysis of this morbid state of mind this diseased conscientiousness obeying the mad suggestions of a disordered brain as the injunctions of divinity in his remarkable story of wieland the hero of this strange and solemn romance inheriting a melancholy and superstitious mental constitution becomes in middle age the victim of a deep and tranquil because deep fanaticism a demon in human form perceiving his state of mind wantonly experiments upon it deepening and intensifying it by a fearful series of illusions of sight and sound tricks of jugglery and ventriloquism seem to his feverish fancies miracles and omens the eye and the voice of the almighty piercing the atmosphere of supernatural mystery in which he has long dwelt he believes that he is called upon to sacrifice the beloved wife of his bosom as a testimony of the entire subjugation of his carnal reason and earthly affections to the divine will in the entire range of english literature there is no more thrilling passage than that which describes the execution of this baleful suggestion the coloring of the picture is an intermingling of the lights of heaven and hell soft shades of tenderest pity and warm tints of unextinguishable love contrasting with the terrible outlines of an insane and cruel purpose traced with the blood of murder the masters of the old greek tragedy have scarcely exceeded the sublime horror of this scene from the american novelist the murderer confronted with his gentle and loving victim in her chamber her anxious solicitude for his health and quiet her affectionate caress of welcome his own relentings and natural shrinking from his dreadful purpose and the terrible strength which he supposes is lent him of heaven by which he puts down the promptings and yearnings of his human heart and is enabled to execute the mandate of an inexorable being are described with an intensity which almost stops the heart of the reader when the deed is done a frightful conflict of passions takes place which can only be told in the words of the author i lifted the corpse in my arms and laid it on the bed i gazed upon it with delight such was my elation that i even broke out into laughter i clapped my hands and exclaimed it is done my sacred duty is fulfilled to that i have sacrificed o god thy last and best gift my wife for a while i thus soared above frailty i imagined i had set myself forever beyond the reach of selfishness but my imaginations were false this rapture quickly subsided i looked again at my wife my joyous ebullitions vanished i asked myself who it was whom i saw methought it could not be my catharine it could not be the woman who had lodged for years in my heart who had slept nightly in my bosom who had borne in her womb and fostered at her breast the beings who called me father whom i had watched over with delight and cherished with a fondness ever new and perpetually growing it could not be the same the breath of heaven that sustained me was withdrawn and i sunk into mere man i leaped from the floor i dashed my head against the wall i uttered screams of horror i panted after torment and pain eternal fire and the bickerings of hell compared with what i felt were music and a bed of roses i thank my god that this was transient that he designed once more to raise me aloft i thought upon what i had done as a sacrifice to duty and was calm my wife was dead but i reflected that although this source of human consolation was closed others were still open if the transports of the husband were no more the feelings of the father had still scope for exercise when remembrance of their mother should excite too keen a pang i would look upon my children and be comforted while i revolved these things new warmth flowed in upon my heart i was wrong these feelings were the growth of selfishness of this i was not aware and to dispel the mist that obscured my perceptions a new light and a new mandate were necessary from these thoughts i was recalled by a ray which was shot into the room a voice spoke like that i had before heard thou hast done well but all is not done the sacrifice is incomplete thy children must be offered they must perish with their mother the misguided man obeys the voice his children are destroyed in their bloom and innocent beauty he is arrested tried for murder and acquitted as insane the light breaks in upon him at last he discovers the imposture which has controlled him and made desperate by the full consciousness of his folly and crime ends the terrible drama by suicide wieland is not a pleasant book in one respect it resembles the modern tale of wuthering heights it has great strength and power but no beauty unlike that however it has an important and salutary moral it is a warning to all who tamper with the mind and rashly experiment upon its religious element as such its perusal by the sectarian zealots of all classes would perhaps be quite as profitable as much of their present studies the poetry of the north the democratic review not long since contained a singularly wild and spirited poem entitled the norsemans ride in which the writer appears to have very happily blended the boldness and sublimity of the heathen saga with the grace and artistic skill of the literature of civilization the poetry of the northmen like their lives was bold defiant and full of a rude untamed energy it was inspired by exhibitions of power rather than of beauty its heroes were beastly revellers or cruel and ferocious plunderers its heroines unsexed hoidens playing the ugliest tricks with their lovers and repaying slights with bloody revenge very dangerous and unsatisfactory companions for any other than the fireeating vikings and redhanded unwashed berserkers significant of a religion which reverenced the strong rather than the good and which regarded as meritorious the unrestrained indulgence of the passions it delighted to sing the praises of some coarse debauch or pitiless slaughter the voice of its scalds was often but the scream of the carrionbird or the howl of the wolf scenting human blood unlike to human sounds it came unmixed unmelodized with breath but grinding through some scrannel frame creaked from the bony lungs of death its gods were brutal giant forces patrons of war robbery and drunken revelry its heaven a vast cloudbuilt alehouse where ghostly warriors drank from the skulls of their victims its hell a frozen horror of desolation and darkness all that the gloomy northern imagination could superadd to the repulsive and frightful features of arctic scenery volcanoes spouting fire through craters rimmed with perpetual frost boiling caldrons flinging their fierce jets high into the air and huge jokuls or icemountains loosened and upheaved by volcanic agencies crawling slowly seaward like misshapen monsters endowed with life a region of misery unutterable to be avoided only by diligence in robbery and courage in murder what a work had christianity to perform upon such a people as the icelanders for instance of the tenth century to substitute in rude savage minds the idea of its benign and gentle founder for that of the thor and woden of norse mythology the forgiveness charity and humility of the gospel for the revenge hatred and pride inculcated by the eddas and is it not one of the strongest proofs of the divine life and power of that gospel that under its influence the hard and cruel norse heart has been so softened and humanized that at this moment one of the best illustrations of the peaceful and gentle virtues which it inculcates is afforded by the descendants of the seakings and robbers of the middle centuries no one can read the accounts which such travellers as sir george mackenzie and dr henderson have given us of the peaceful disposition social equality hospitality industry intellectual cultivation morality and habitual piety of the icelanders without a grateful sense of the adaptation of christianity to the wants of our race and of its ability to purify elevate and transform the worst elements of human character in iceland christianity has performed its work of civilization unobstructed by that commercial cupidity which has caused nations more favored in respect to soil and climate to lapse into an idolatry scarcely less debasing and cruel than that which preceded the introduction of the gospel trial by combat was abolished in and the penalty of the imaginary crime of witchcraft was blotted from the statutes of the island nearly half a century before it ceased to disgrace those of great britain so entire has been the change wrought in the sanguinary and cruel norse character that at the present day no icelander can be found who for any reward will undertake the office of executioner the scalds who went forth to battle cleaving the skulls of their enemies with the same skilful hands which struck the harp at the feast have given place to christian bards and teachers who like thorlakson whom dr henderson found toiling cheerfully with his beloved parishioners in the hayharvest of the brief arctic summer combine with the vigorous diction and robust thought of their predecessors the warm and genial humanity of a religion of love and the graces and amenities of a high civilization but we have wandered somewhat aside from our purpose which was simply to introduce the following poem which in the boldness of its tone and vigor of language reminds us of the sword chant the wooing song and other rhymed sagas of motherwell the norsemans ride by bayard taylor the frosty fires of northern starlight gleamed on the glittering snow and through the forests frozen branches the shrieking winds did blow a floor of blue and icy marble kept oceans pulses still when in the depths of dreary midnight opened the burial hill then while the low and creeping shudder thrilled upward through the ground the norseman came as armed for battle in silence from his mound he who was mourned in solemn sorrow by many a swordsman bold and harps that wailed along the ocean struck by the scalds of old sudden a swift and silver shadow came up from out the gloom a charger that with hoof impatient stamped noiseless by the tomb ha surtur let me hear thy tramping my fiery northern steed that sounding through the stormy forest bade the bold viking heed he mounted like a northlight streaking the sky with flaming bars they on the winds so wildly shrieking shot up before the stars is this thy mane my fearless surtur that streams against my breast the name of the scandinavian god of fire is this thy neck that curve of moonlight which helvas hand caressed no misty breathing strains thy nostril thine eye shines blue and cold yet mounting up our airy pathway i see thy hoofs of gold not lighter oer the springing rainbow walhallas gods repair than we in sweeping journey over the bending bridge of air far far around stargleams are sparkling amid the twilight space and earth that lay so cold and darkling has veiled her dusky face are those the normes that beckon onward as if to odins board where by the hands of warriors nightly the sparkling mead is poured t is skuld i her stareye speaks the glory that wraps the mighty soul when on its hinge of music opens the gateway of the pole when odins warder leads the hero to banquets never oer and freyas glances fill the bosom with sweetness evermore on on the northern lights are streaming in brightness like the morn and pealing far amid the vastness i hear the gyallarhorn the heart of starry space is throbbing with songs of minstrels old and now on high walhallas portal gleam surturs hoofs of gold the norne of the future freya the northern goddess of love the horn blown by the watchers on the rainbow the bridge over which the gods pass in northern mythology
