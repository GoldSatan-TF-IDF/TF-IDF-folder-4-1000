gary gar the demoness formed into smoke and then into an insidiously lovely human style woman her face was unutterably fair her hair flowed like honey her bosom was so full and wellformed that it was probably sinful just to look at it and the rest of her was moreso but there was something odd about her apparel she eyed the creature sitting in the dry riverbed who was about as opposite from her as it was possible to be my youre an ugly customer she remarked thank you the thing replied gruffly you can speak she said surprised only when i make the effort she walked around it her dainty delicate feet did not quite touch the ground but the ground here was so scabbed and messy that this was just as well she peered closely at every detail you have a face like a cross be tween a lion and an ape with the worst features of each and with an extremely big mouth formed into a perpet ual you have a grotesque compact body with an inane piers anthony tail and four big clumsy feet and you have a pair of re ally ugly stumpy leathery wings overall i cant imagine a worselooking creature thank you you in contrast are unconscionably aes thetic im what she asked frowning disgustingly pretty oh thank you my statement was not a compliment well neither was mine i have just three questions to ask of you monster then will you go away she shook a fine firm finger answer mine then ill answer yours you refugee from a horror house what are you i am a gargoyle who are you gary gar and what are you doing gary gargoyle i am performing according to my geis whats a gaysh forget it demoness you promised to answer mine af ter three of yours she frowned prettily very well gary garble ask your stupid question a large mug appeared in her hand would you like a drink from ein stein first whats tha he started to ask but caught himself al most barely in time she was trying to trick him into wast ing his stupid question no i dont know what that is so i wont risk it too bad she said one drink from this would have made you xanths smartest creature capable of concluding that eeee equals emcee squared the mug disappeared i can live without that conclusion he said who are you she fidgeted beginning to lose definition thats awk ward to answer geis of the gargoyle well make the effort smokeface her features reformed lovelier than before im d mentia but thats only a halftruth whats the other half of the truth im the alter ego of the demoness metria she did something disgusting so im sailing out on my own what did she do she got married got half a soul and fell in love in that order now shes so nice i cant stand her do demons marry forget it gargle i answered three already now its my turn again whats a gaysh a misspelling of geis how can you tell its misspelled when im speaking it i am long familiar with the word youre pronouncing it as it sounds she grimaced sorry about that so what is it an obligation of honor what does an ugly character like you know about a fair concept like honor thats your fourth question mine first why are you wearing a skirt upside and a blouse downside mentia glanced down at herself the clothing faded out leaving a body so barely luscious that any ordinary man who spied it would freak out in half a moment thats hard to explain make another effort bareface gary said looking slightly bored though her face was the least of her bare ness well my better naturethat is d metriahas a cer tain problem with words for example she would say you really dont look properly volant and you would say properly what and she would say feathers uplift flapping sky winging flightworthy piers anthony and she would say whatever crossly thats what volant means uhuh garfield i answered three whats this about honor gary sighed it was a good effort because his stone body was mostly hollow from time vaguely memorial on my family of gargoyles has been in charge of this river the swan knee which flows from drear mundania into xanth as you can see he gestured with a wing sure enough to the north the dry channel wound unhappily through truly dreary terrain the line where the magic of xanth took effect was marked by increasingly magical vegetation such as shoe trees lady slippers and acom trees the mundane equivalents were sadly deficient normally the water flows south and it has been our geis to guarantee its purity so that xanth is not stained by mundanian contaminants normally the water was mostly clean so this was no problem but in recent decades it has become sullied until it was virtually sludge it was awful cleaning it up but now theres a drought and theres no water at all which is worse yet i hope that when the rains return and the flow resumes that it will be cleaner so that it doesnt leave such a foul taste in my mouth but regard less i will do it because my line is honor bound to guar antee the quality of this water no wading swans will get their knees dirty in this river now thats interesting mentia said looking about as bored as he had been when she had lost her clothing but why are you wasting your time here when you could get the job done without all that fuss now the gargoyle began to show some feeling what do you mean wasting my time this is my job demon ess so its your job but why not do it the easy way because its the only way i know he paused count ing thats three questions ive answered my turn whats this easy way geis of the gargoyle how should i know spoutface you dont know how thats right gamishee gary paused realizing that two of his questions were al ready gone by her slightly crazy rules he had already failed to learn why her clothing had been confused and he didnt want to fail to leam how to do his job the easy way so he phrased his question carefully what gives you the idea that there is an easy way to do my job mentia shrugged making ripples all across her front and down her arms there has to be because if you went to ask the good magician about it he would have the an swer the good magician he had never thought of that but he realized that this was not a wise course for him i couldnt go to ask him because the moment it rains the river will resume its flow and i shall have to be here to clarify it anyway i understand hes extremely grumpy and i dont know the way there why dont you make a dam so the water cant pass until you return to process it and whats so bad about grumpiness if it frees you from a lifetimes geis and why not ask me to show you the way there three more questions gary pondered then answered them i could make such a dam a few minutes of grumpiness seem a bargain when i think of it that way and i wont ask you to show me the way there because youre a demoness who surely has mischief in mind she considered that its your turn for questions why dont you ask me if i mean to lead you astray he became interested do you no why not because i have a defect of demonly character im slightly crazy thats why my clothing was mixed up her blouse and skirt reappeared correctly placed i share this with my better half i like to be entertained and you prom piers anthony ise to be entertaining i dont care about you personally of course but i hate being bored that seemed to be a fair answer so gary gambled and asked the expected question will you guide me safely to the good magicians castle yes very well i shall make the dam he got to work there were some wallflowers not far distant and he was able to transplant several to the river bed but there was a problem they needed water in order to flower and he had none well find some water lilies or water melons or water cress mentia suggested impatiently her body was aimed away from him but this didnt matter because her head was now on backwards she had gotten confused again there arent any in sight he pointed out i know only the plants that are in sight because i have been bound to my post in the river for the past century or so oh for illness sake she exclaimed ill find some her lower section fuzzed and formed into a peculiar wheeled vehicle whats that gary asked surprised havent you seen a snit before then a dirty noise pooped out of the things tailpipe its wheels spun and it zoomed away at magical speed she was departing in a snit then it zoomed backward just as rapidly coming to park just under his nose just be thankful it isnt a snot the demoness said and was gone again gary was duly thankful he had not had a lot of expe rience with demons but this one seemed tolerable despite being rather too pretty for his taste soon she was back bearing a boxlike object that doesnt look like a water plant gary said dubiously naturally not she agreed setting it in the river bed beside some of the rocklike pillows there its a closet geis of the gargoyle what good is a closet we need water a water closet she clarified she opened the door and a flood of bright blue liquid poured out thats polluted gary cried he jumped down and placed himself in the path of the flow he sucked up the water then spouted it out ohits water color whatever she agreed it will do wont it he considered tasting more of the water as it changed to red and then to green already some of it was sinking into the ground around the wallflowers and they were growing yes as long as it doesnt flow away from here so make another little damn a what to divert the curse in a short moment he figured it out a dam to divert the course of the flow mentia might be her selfs worse half but she did seem to suffer from a bit of her better halfs problem with vocabulary he hastily scraped dirt and rocks across the path of the stream causing it to puddle that left it nowhere to flow but into the ground around the flowers these responded by developing blue red green and other colored walls depending on the color of the wa ter the walls walled off the main riverbed the job was done lets be off the demoness said floating up she had resumed her full human form and was correctly garbed but gary hesitated im not sure this is appropriate she floated over him becoming even more lovely in her moderate pique why not garlic because my powers of flight are limited i weigh con siderable being lithic being what being made mostly of stone so i can fly only when aided by a steep slope or a galeforce breeze i shall have to proceed along the ground so why not proceed garnet that doesnt mean have to be landbound piers anthony i think it does why garland because from down here i think i can see your pan ties she exploded into roiling smoke flames licked around the roils her voice emerged tinged with soot you arent supposed to look garget i didnt look but i suspect that if i did oh the cloud sank to the ground coalescing into her luscious human formthis time in red jeans point made garden ill walk when you do thanks for not looking thanks for getting my name straight she paused fuzzing briefly before firming again got it gary gar she glanced speculatively at him it occurs to me youre not quite as stupid as you look i dont look stupid i look properly grotesque it occurs to me that youre not quite as careless as you seem you know if you were less ugly i could almost be tempted to think about possibly starting to get to like you if you were less pretty i might be tempted not to dis like you once more she fuzzed you like ugly she exclaimed how fining im a gargoyle were the ugliest creatures in xanth and righteously proud of it what about the ogres gary pondered i suppose you could call them ugly if you dislike that type he concluded grudgingly maybe well encounter some along the way and see then she thought of something else youre no more hu man than i am why should you care about panties i dont but you evidently do well when i emulate the human form there are codes of conduct to be observed or the emulation is imperfect but that does give me a notion she fuzzed and reap peared as a female gargoyle horrendously ugly how do you like me now gary geis of the gargoyle he studied her i wish you were real id be glad to spout water with you ha you mean i can tempt you in this form and end lessly frustrate you this promises to be entertaining after all lets be on our way he said shortly on down the riverbed she said it will take us south to the gulf but i cant swim he protested i would sink right to the bottom then we wont enter the water well proceed along the shore except she broke off evidently waiting for his query except what he dutifully inquired except for the whatever youll have trouble navigat ing that then she brightened but maybe i can figure out a way onward onward he agreed determined not to oblige her by asking again they set off down the riverbed bound by bound using their little wings to steer the bounds and keep them within bounds it was the gargoyle way before long the dry riverbanks changed color turn ing yellow gary paused whats the matter with the ground mentia looked nothing its just doing its thing but its all sickly yellow no it isnt she raked a claw across the dirt golden coins rolled down into the channel this bank is pay dirt and theres a mint she pointed to a plant with odd ob long greenbacked leaves and round golden flowers with serrated edges this is the bank where the money comes from is all money what good is it no good that i know of but i understand they love it in mundania they do they say that the love of money is the root of all evil geis of the gargoyle piers anthony she looked at the mints roots which did look bad if not actually evil but doesnt that mean that they think its bad no mundania is such an awful place that they must love evil gary nodded that does make sense pennies and cents she agreed they bounded on they came to a sign when passing this bog beware of the dog i dont see any bog gary said i dont see any dog either but maybe it doesnt matter thats just doggerel a new kind of tree appeared along the bank there was the sound of barking dogwoods mentia explained theyre harmless if you dont try to rub against their bark which is worse than their bite but then real dogs appeared i thought xanth had no dogs gary said this is close to the border a pack must have crossed over and the dogs havent yet had time to turn magic it happens the dogs converged growling they dont seem to be friendly gary remarked who cares they cant hurt us im a demoness and youre mostly mythic lithic whatever so they bounded on ignoring the dogs but the animals pursued doggedly it got worse ahead was a solid line of canines it was impossible to bound through them so they stopped before the large female in the center who are you and what do you want gary asked hardly expecting an answer i am dogma she replied i want your dog tags we dont have anything like that then well have to eat you just because we dont have something you want he asked incredulously im a real bitch she reminded him then well just have to fight you gary said with re gret for he was a peaceful creature have you ever been chomped by stone teeth dogma reconsidered im really not dogmatic just what kind of a monster are you she demanded im a gargoyle i purify the water coming along this river but im trying to find a better way to do it doggone it she complained why didnt you say so we thought you were pretending to be a dog why would anyone want to be a dog mentia de manded dogma turned to the others let them go dogfaces she growled we dont have a problem with gargoyles and we dont want our river to get spoiled the swans would go away the dogs looked disgusted but gave way and the two moved on down the river channel but they had hardly cleared the dog region before they encountered worse more dogs gary asked seeing the creatures ap proaching no wolves whats the difference arent wolves just wild dogs not in xanth they stopped as the wolves closed in what do you creatures want gary demanded he was getting impa tient with these delays at this rate it would be hard to ac complish his business with the good magician and return before nightfall we are the wolf clan the lead female said changing to human form i am virginia wolf youwerewolves gary exclaimed surprised we still are wolves she said we were wolves yes terday and will be so tomorrow i mean you change form he said flustered she looked around we do where geis of the gargoyle piers anthony right here here there everywhere whats the difference where wolves are more wolves were assuming human form i mean youre magical youre not true wolves virginia shook her head never cry wolf she cau tioned him shes teasing you mentia said gary was catching on to that im the gargoyle who purifies the swan knee water i want to get a better way to honor my geis from the good magician we suspected as much she said otherwise the dog pack wouldnt have let you through but you know you have a long road to run i do how far is it several days plus the gap chasm the what you dont know about the gap chasm ive never been south of the border he said nettled whats this about a gap its a big crevice across xanth she explained it used to have a forget spell on it so nobody remembered it but most folk know about it now you look too heavy to fly far so maybe you cant get there from here gary turned to mentia you didnt tell me about this he said accusingly that wouldnt have been entertaining she retorted and whats this about several days you didnt ask ill never get this done before it rains thats why you built the dam she had him there still if i cant cross the chasm i have an idea how to do that he was frustrated but decided to go ahead maybe it was still possible the notion of returning to his dry river bed to wait for more mundane sludge to come through was appealing less for some reason so will you let us through he asked virginia we might as well we dont want dirty water either it would mess up our apparel your apparel he asked blankly we are underwear wolves she explained were training to crowd out the regular monsters under childrens beds and get a cushier lifestyle he realized belatedly that what he had taken for a spe cialized costume on their human forms was actually under clothing in fact virginia was wearing panties it was a good thing he wasnt human or he would have freaked out because that was the magic of panties they resumed their bounding they made good time but the distance stretched farther and night caught them do gargoyles sleep mentia inquired only when were bored are you bored no frustrated but not bored so lets keep moving i know the way gary was glad to do that they bounded on through the darkness there were surely predators of the night but they evidently elected to leave the demoness and the gar goyle alone the result was that as morning came they were just arriving at what looked like a stall fashioned into a house what is this gary asked a stall fashioned into a house i mean what are we doing here arriving demons could get exasperating on occasion is this go ing to help us cross the chasm no then why are we the occupants may help however she clarified houses dont seem to care much about chasms but the centaurs do the door opened a winged centaur filly about nine years old peered out eeeek she screamed an incred ibly ugly monster piers anthony oh be quiet cynthia the demoness snapped its only me mentia metrias worse aspect but metrias safely married and no longer doing mis chief abroad the filly protested i know its disgusting thats why im abroad mentia assumed human form a demon broad tell chex i could use a favor in a moment a mature winged centaur emerged tying her damp hair back she must have been interrupted as she washed it metria has a split personality she inquired emotional havoc can do that mentia said i couldnt stand her halfsouled loving attitude so i fissioned off now im in charge of the mischief but i got distracted by this ugly brute so im guiding him to the good magi cians castle but the gap chasms in the way and hes too solid to fly so chex gazed at gary why youre a gargoyle arent you she asked we seldom see your kind here thats because most of us are purifying the waters flowing in from mundania according to our geis he ex plained but now if i can find a better way of course she agreed immediately centaurs he re membered were very bright and you need to fly across the gap chasm i can certainly help you to do that you can he asked amazed but my weight she turned and flicked him with her tail suddenly he felt lightheaded and lightbodied he flapped his wings experimentally and sailed into the air she had made him so light that he was able to fly thank you mentia said some day i shall fail to do you mischief when i have the chance chex smiled that seems a fair bargain we do need clean water in any event we winged monsters have to help each other mentia rose into the air i knew that she said then to gary move it monster you dont want to be over the chasm when her magic wears off just how big is this crevice he asked geis of the gargoyle youll see they flew south as the sun made a nest of colors to the east and lifted itself out of the clouds suddenly an enor mous chasm opened out below it was so wide and deep that a few of the pink morning clouds were nestling within it gary could not see to its base that was still shrouded in night but he felt new urgency to get across it already he was feeling heavier they landed beyond the gap on what the demoness as sured him was an enchanted path only folk on legitimate business could use it and while they were on it they would be protected from monsters but im a monster he protested you have to be a nice monster for now can you stand it i was never a nasty monster just an ugly one so youll have no problem well soon reach the cas tle it will be good to get this done with she glanced sidelong at him theres a detail or two i may not have mentioned the last detail or two related to the distance and the gap chasm i hope these arent as bad no not as bad she said smiling worse worse why didnt you tell me you crazy creature thank you i thought it would be more interesting this way you see you dont just walk into the good magi cians castle you have to struggle past three challenges thats because he doesnt like to be disturbed by folk who arent serious if i had known that to be sure she agreed so sweetly that flakes of crys tallized sugar formed on her surfaces he tried to get a grip on his unruly emotion whats the other detail the good magician charges charges one years service for each question he answers piers anthony one year he cried outraged thats ridiculous to be sure she agreed even more sweetly cloying syrup oozed from her pores well this path leads right to it so you cant get lost i have to be going now to realign with my better half bye now just a long moment he said but she had already faded out good magician gary gazed at the castle it looked ordinary being pretty much like his mental image there were walls and turrets and pennants and the rest of the usual but it differed in one significant respect the moat was dry the drought must have affected this re gion too that was sad no castle was worth much without water d mentia had said that there would be three challenges she was slightly crazy but she seemed to have been truth ful when she wasnt omitting key details so he would be prepared there seemed to be a drawbridge to the side he bounded toward it because that was surely better than de scending into the caked gunk at the bottom of the defunct moat the vegetation closed in with thick brambles his stone hide couldnt be hurt by brambles any more than by the bites of dogs but he didnt like getting his finish scratched so he followed the path that offered it curved away from the castle but surely would return to find the piers anthony drawbridge it took him into a small forest of cane of all colors a rather pretty scene he came to a glade there an armored warrior was la boring to harvest some of the canes looking somewhat tired and sweaty perhaps it was someone doing a service for the good magician maybe he could learn more about this situation gary bounded to a halt hello sir warrior he said po litely he understood that human folk liked to be given ti des and since it cost him nothing to humor their foibles he did so the figure paused and turned to him dont sir me it snapped im not a man gary was somewhat set back i apologize he said contritely i took you for human i am human she said straightening into a warlike pose he saw that her metallic armor was curved in front in a manner reminiscent of mentias decolletage when the demoness remembered to have one this did suggest the figure was female im hannah barbarian and if you were a smartmouthed man id cut off three of your legs as readily as i do these hurry canes hurry canes they are used as walking canes she said aggres sively but they make you rush im sure theyre useful but theyre hard to hang on to indeed the one she had just cut was whipping around as if trying to escape her grip and the trussed bundle of them was hopping on the ground eager to go somewhere perhaps i could help you accomplish your task gary said this seemed to make her angrier i dont need any males help now get out of here before i forget myself and practice something feministic on you the cane in her hand whirled menacingly gary hastily bounded on he had heard that human fe males were sweet and soft but evidently he had been mis geis of the gargoyle informed perhaps this was another detail the demoness hadnt mentioned the path curved around and brought him to the draw bridge two young human men stood before it gary bounded to another stop hello he said carefully omit ting the sir so as not to annoy anyone the two eyed him sourly hello yourself one said sharply you are a horrendously ugly creature the other said candidly thank you gary replied he realized that humans liked compliments so he offered one in return youre not exactly handsome yourself he was stretching a point as the man was far from the gargoyle standard of ugliness but social nicety seemed to require it the second man grimaced perhaps we should intro duce ourselves i am frank he is curt i am gary gary said that is not the most original name frank said di rectly hes an animal curt said brusquely all true gary agreed innocently now if you will step aside i would like to cross that drawbridge not a chance curt said tersely i must inform you straightforwardly that we are here to prevent you from trespassing frank said openly but i need to see the good magician gary said per plexedly tough curt said shortly perhaps you dont understand frank said forthrightly this is a challenge oh gary said naively i hadnt realized perhaps because you are not very intelligent frank said boldly youre ignorant curt said bluntly i surely am gary agreed bemused he realized that these two had a job to do and that his own job was to get them out of his way he could simply barge on through knocking them into the stinking muck of the moat but geis of the gargoyle piers anthony though his hide was stone his heart was soft and he couldnt bring himself to do that so he turned away pon dering alternatives what a clod curt remarked gruffly they do not produce challengers the way they used to frank agreed freely gary wandered on around the moat the path gave up after a few paces evidently tired gary had to stop lest he step on some tshaped plants grouped in conic formations bearing what looked like peas he picked a ripe pea and put it in his mouth it turned instantly to fluid it was tea these were tea peas however this didnt help him cross the moat he still didnt want to wade through the muck so he turned his tail on the teapea patch and returned to the drawbridge are you sure you wont let me cross peaceably he in quired artlessly absolutely curt replied abruptly it is not in our job description frank replied openly gary still didnt want to act in a nasty manner so he followed the path back to the cane there was a wind ris ing there now with gusts becoming quite stiff the canes swayed looking as if they wished they could hurry else where hannah was worse off her militantly coifed hair was getting blown all askew and her amazonian skirt was flap ping so badly as to show her stiff knees she did not look particularly pleased hello gary said hesitantly she whirled on him a straggling cane in each hand you again what do you want nothing he said cautiously its just that i discov ered a patch of tea peas maybe if you drank some of them you would feel better hannah paused in midwhirl maybe youre right monster i am thoroughly thirsty from this windy work where is that patch down this path to the drawbridge and turn right you cant miss it she eyed him where are you going now gary shrugged i dont seem to have what it takes to get into the good magicians castle so perhaps ill go home if i can find the way but im still willing to help you gather some cane if there is any way i can be useful youre not exactly a typical male she remarked i havent had much practice he confessed i have worked alone all my life hannah seemed almost unmilitant for half an instant though this was probably a misinterpretation of her mood i know the feeling stick around gargoyle maybe i will accept your help after i take some tea she marched off along the path gary shrugged and followed he was hoping that he would figure out some way to cross the moat because he didnt like giving up and also was not unduly eager to try to cross the larger ditch known as the gap chasm without having something to show for his excursion hannah came into sight of the drawbridge there were prank and curt look curt cried briefly a tart that is one messedup girl frank said in an upfront manner shes wearing a ridiculous military outfit carry ing some kind of clumsy stick and her hair resembles a dismembered mop now theres a pair of typical jacks hannah ex claimed how fortunate that i was already angry she strode forward wielding her cane i never did take any guff from cartoon characters whats up sweetie curt inquired in a sexist way you intrigue us darling frank said i wonder whether under that metallic skirt you wear a pair of then hannah caught up to them there were two thunks and a sudden splash as of bags of rocks falling into mud it was all over in an eyeblink and by the time gary fin piers anthony ished blinking the barbarian woman was on her way to the pea patch and the drawbridge was empty gary realized that he had inadvertently made an oppor tunity for himself hannah who was not particularly soft hearted about obnoxious men had done the job gary had shied away from so he might as well cross the draw bridge while he had the chance but as he bounded to it another figure appeared it looked human but was faintly glowing and it barred the way are you another challenge gary inquired as he came to a stop i am indeed i am piera my talent is the control of fire she lifted her hands tossing a ball of fire between them if you try to pass i will bum you fire he said impressed ive never met anyone who wasnt a salamander who could do that my brother fieros just as hot as i am and together we are even hotter she said proudly were xanths hottest act gary couldnt be hurt by fire any more than by thorns or teeth but he didnt want to have to dump a nice human woman like fiera into the muck so he retreated this time he found a path circling the moat in the other direction in a moment it debouched into a little circle of glassy stones in the middle of the circle was a big feather he picked it up so that it wouldnt get stepped on for it was a pretty feather then he wasnt sure what to do with it because it could get blown into the path again and get stepped on af ter he left so he tucked it into the rock wool between his horns for safekeeping when he found someone who ap preciated pretty feathers he would give it to that person then he saw that one of the glassy stones had fallen out of the circle perhaps having been blown over by the wind he tried to move it back into place with his paws but it splashed astonished he jumped backand it sagged and started slopping onto the ground it was actually a con tainer of water he couldnt just let it pour out after all there was a geis of the gargoyle drought and water was precious so he returned and tried to shape it up with his paws but it still slopped the sides of it were bendy and there was a hole in the top so that as it sat it sagged and as it sagged it flowed it was prob ably his fault he must have inadvertently knocked it over and now it was no longer tight what to do he put his mouth to the edge and caught the side of it between his teeth he bit down gently only hard enough to be able to catch hold and pull it up that stopped the leaking but the moment he tried to let go it sagged again he couldnt let it go without mining it maybe fiera would know what to do she was part of this situation after all so he set his teeth carefully into the rock and slowly dragged it down the path making sure that no more water spilled what are you doing with that quartz fiera demanded when he reached the drawbridge quartz he asked blankly as he did so his teeth let go of the rock and it began to sag and leak again he snapped at it trying to stop the spillage but couldnt get a proper hold yes you have quartz of water she said alarmed thats worse than pintz of water yes the waters leaking and i wondered if you know how to stop it he said nipping again for the edge and missing again the feather fell from his head and landed in the water then something odd happened the quill pointed up and squirted water a jet of it shot up making an arc toward the woman eeeek fiera screamed falling back a fountain pen she was so upset that she managed double excla mation points her pert posterior landed on the wooden drawbridge and set it afire but the quill pen kept foun taining drawing from the quartz trying to escape it she scrambled to her feet and charged past him in a fiery flash im sorry gary cried starting to bound after her but she was already out of sight and the pen was still squirt geis of the gargoyle piers anthony ing he had to turn back and pull out the feather getting roundly squirted in the snoot the jet stopped when he got the feather clear of the water he looked around the planks of the bridge were still burning around the seatshaped spot where fiera had landed she must have lost control of her fire for a mo ment he could put it out but he would have to use the rest of the water in the quartz and he wasnt willing to do that so he dragged the halffull rock back to the stone cir cle now he was able to prop it up without leaking he hoped it would heal in dme he had certainly made a mess of things when he returned to the drawbridge he saw that the fire had burned itself out but the remaining planks were charred and he doubted that they would support his weight he realized that he could have crossed and won the challenge if he had just been willing to use up the rest of the water but he was a stone creature and he had an affinity with stone and just couldnt mistreat the quartz like that he was obviously not the type of creature the good magician wanted to see still there was not much to be gained by departing at this stage he might as well plow onward even if the ma gician wasnt going to let him in he considered the moat again now he saw that the muck in the bottom was filled with fish they must have been stranded by the drought that was no good he didnt want to squish them underfoot of course but neither did he want to let them suffer longer they needed water and plenty of it perhaps this was what the quartz rocks were for to re fill the moat when it got dry but there werent enough of them to do the job he needed to find some other way he lay down beside the moat and put his head over the edge i want to help you but you will have to help me he said do any of you fish know where i can find enough water to fill this moat one big fish wriggled a bit in the muck scales it gasped what do your scales have to do with water gary asked perplexed balance it gasped balance he was no more enlightened but the fish had gasped its last gasp it had no further strength for di alogue it was surely very uncomfortable for a fish to be out of water and talking made it worse still this suggested that there was water to be had somewhere all he had to do was find it at least he could help the fish before he departed he bounded back along the path he discovered another fork leading from the glade in the cane grove the wind was still strong but he was too heavy to be much affected he followed the new path it led to a small mountain on the top of the mountain was a big stone precariously balanced it was a wonder the wind didnt blow it off its perch so that it crashed downward crushing all before it balance the fish had said that this must relate but what did it mean he looked aroundand spied another mountain with another boulder more balancing but he still didnt know how any of this could help he bounded between the two mountains hoping for some clue he saw that the sunlight fell across this region in a checkered pattern interrupted by the shadows of the mountains and stones halfway between the balanced rocks was a square that seemed to have been etched into the ground by the pattern of sunbeam and shadow he wasnt sure how it had happened because normally shad ows did not stay still very long but this was a fairly mag ical region and with magic almost anything was possible there must be some significance a checkered region between the balanced rocks checks and balances the scales of a balance scales now he saw markings around the square as if geis of the gargoyle piers anthony something was being measured he followed the marks and found a single fish scale he peered at it there seemed to be words rain check suddenly he didnt care about scales checks or bal ances this related to rain and rain was what he wanted maybe it was an amulet or other magic device to summon rain he picked it up with his teeth and carded it away the wind was blowing more fiercely than ever but gary flowed on through it he reached the moat and dropped the rain check in rain he cried suddenly the wind whipped into a storm mist formed thickening over the moat from beyond the horizon came a cloud borne along by the fierce wind gary gazed at it he knew that cloud that was fracto cumulo nimbus who loved to float by and withhold rain at critical times that was one reason for the drought fracto must be mag ically bound by a geis of his own to honor the rain check when it was invoked thus the scale between the balances there for gary to findif he could he had more or less blundered across it but had at least recognized it when he spied it now fracto was over the castle and the moat boiling into a frenzy the bottom fell out and water gushed out of the cloud the moat began to fill the big fish swam up thank you it said no longer gasping you saved us youre welcome gary replied i hate to see any creature suffering im surprised there are so many of you in such a small section of water its not normally this crowded the fish confessed were here for the playoffs playoffs this isnt generally known dryside the fish said but we of the wetside have a secret passion for base ball we play it all the time in fact we have twenty thou sand leagues under the sea we gathered here for the xanth championship seriesand got caught by the drought we are extremely fortunate that you managed to abate it yes now you can swim back to the sea gary agreed by no means now we can finish the series weve been tortured by our inability to complete it and determine the winning teams ah i think the moat is full enough now its time for me to go ofishiate thank you and goodbye ill send naia the fish swam away gary hardly had time to consider what to do next before another kind of fish swam up a mermaid hi winged monster im naia naiad wearing my tail for this occa sion she twisted showing him a piece of tail the big fish told me to guide you across the moat so you can make your appointment with the good magician my appointment everyone who gets past the challenges gets to see him didnt you know but i didnt get past them he protested she shrugged you must have well come on hero bemused again he stepped into the water which was now almost to the top of the moat he sank to the bottom being denser than any water it was cloudy because of the stirring of the mud but the naiad swam close enough so that he could keep her tail in sight in fact sometimes he saw more than her tail as she looped around to check on him but since he wasnt human those parts didnt much concern him it did occur to him however that such crea tures must be very good at feeding their babies naia led him to the far bank he couldnt bound very well underwater but he made sufficient progress by slowly flapping his wings instead he climbed out shook his body and wings dry and turned back to thank her but she was gone the surface of the moat was rippling as the storm eased the fish were already into their playoffs he bounded to the inner side of the drawbridge and to the castle gate it opened as he got there admitting him a human young woman of about twenty stood there hello she said looking past him piers anthony hello i am gary gargoyle i am not sure i oh yes we were expecting you im wira the good magicians daughterinlaw come in well im still a bit wet as you can see and i cant see but i know what gargoyles look like im sure a few drops of water wont hurt mother gorgon wants to talk to you she set off down the inner hall he bounded cautiously after her his state of bemuse ment seemed to have become chronic who your mother my husband hugos mother shes very nice but her gaze turns people to stone or it did before she had humfrey make her face invisible and replace it with an il lusion of her face she says she has an affinity for stoned creatures so she came here for this occasion the business about an invisible illusionary face was be yond him so he fixed on something simple i am a stone creature yes they came to a nice inner chamber with stone walls and stone furniture he felt quite comfortable within it stood an older human woman so nice to meet you gary gar goyle she said i am the gorgon we must talk as you wish he agreed but im not sure i should be here i didnt you handled the challenges in your own compassionate fashion you are a good creature worthy of the good ma gicians answer but are you aware that there is a payment in service required i learned that along the way he admitted ruefully i think i dont have the time you see when it rains in mundania and the swan knee river starts flowing again the dam will soon overflow and i must be there to honor my geis that is part of what i wanted to talk to you about a year will not do for you you have a responsibility else where instead the magician will settle for a single service of lesser duration if that is satisfactory to you geis of the gargoyle gary began to realize that his mission might be possible after all if i can return in time then its all right but it is an unusual service and you may not wish to perform it she said thats why i had to talk to you first the magicians answer is one thing but the terms of the service are another if you are not willing to do it your meeting with humfrey is pointless im willing so long as it is brief what is it to tutor a precocious human child but i dont know anything about humans and less about their children he protested precisely and this one is no ordinary child she will be extremely difficult to handle im a winged monster shed think i was going to eat her there must be a hundred better tutors for her apparently there is only one who can do the job in the manner it needs to be done i confess that my husbands dictations dont always make sense to me at the time but he is invariably correct we need you for this gary struggled but could not come up with a suitable argument against this his soft heart was betraying him again if she really needs my help she really does but there is more there always did seem to be more what more he asked warily you will have to be transformed to human form for the duration human form he cried appalled i realize that this is a considerable sacrifice for you but it will be temporary magician trent will transform you and transform you back after the service is complete i suppose if it is temporary i can stand it he agreed grudgingly but privately he was wondering whether he ever should have listened to d mentia who had gotten him into a crazy fix there is more she said with that tone are you trying to dissuade me from this no i very much hope you will accept it but fairness piers anthony requires that you be warned in human form you will not be as competent as you are naturally and your flesh will not be stone your normal reflexes may lead you into mis chief such as assuming that thorns wont hurt or that dragon bites wont damage your flesh you will need magiciancaliber protection until you change back but if you have a magician for this why cant he tutor the child not he she she absolutely refuses to babysit a child alone perhaps she has reason she is ninetythree years old but thats doddering for a human flesh ages so much more quickly than stone she will be youthened to an effective age of about twentythree thats prime for a human female gary shrugged then i dont see the problem there could be a personality conflict she is said to be not the easiest person to get along with gary strained his stony memory for what it knew about human sorceresses only one bad name emerged just so long as it isnt the sorceress iris she is said to be impos sible for anybody but her family to stand for more than two moments the gorgon merely looked at him her illusion face looked soberingly real oh no after a time he bowed to the inevitable maybe if the service really is brief it should be i repeat my husbands dictates can seem peculiar but theres always a rationale it is quite possible that you will be glad of this experience once it is over i shall hang on to that hope he said ruefully excellent now it is time to see humfrey i will take him there wira said gary had forgotten she was there he followed the young woman up endlessly winding stairways until they reached an obscure chamber buried deep within the castle a gnomish man sat at a desk por geis of the gargoyle ing over a monstrous tome this was the good magician humfrey it could be no other he looked about a hundred years old father humfrey here is gary gargoyle wira said well lets hear your question the gnome grumped how can i more readily purify the water get a philter the face returned to the tome but now dont try to argue with him wira said urgently that only makes him grumpier but i have no idea where ask hiatus humfrey said without looking up from the page who is interruption gary asked as wira guided him back down the tortuous stairway hiatus hes lacunas twin brother he grows noses and things on surfaces he must know where the philter is but how can i find it when i have to tutor this child he asked plaintively take her with you the good magicians annoyed voice floated after them i suppose i can do that gary agreed but this still seems perplexingly confused things usually work out in the end wira said reassur ingly somehow even if coincidence chance and com mon sense have to be inordinately strained gary hoped that was the case once more he wished that the demoness had left him alone his life had been simple now it was unduly complicated but he also had to admit that it had been boring and now it was interesting geis of the gargoyle iris gary found himself outside the castle with no idea where to go next in the confusion of the good magicians grudging bits of answer gary had for gotten to get lesser information he needed such as how to find magician trent or the sorceress iris he gazed at the moat and the mixed terrain beyond would he have to find his way out as deviously as he had found his way in and then search for the people he needed it was all so confused you look extremely perplexed someone said behind him i love that in a creature gary didnt bother to look because he recognized the voice shape up or ship out mentia he said gruffly a small ragged brown cloud drifted into his field of vi sion how did you know i was out of shape the demon ess asked disgruntled i dont care about your physical shape he said i just mean that if youre not here to help i dont want to bother with you i have enough problems already thanks to your interference my interference the cloud said forming into a huge smoky exclamation point is this the thanks i get for try ing to help you you want thanks here it is thank you for not smok ing in my presence the smoke solidified into the demoness supposedly natural human aspect are you really annoyed with me she asked looking woebegone gary knew it was an act but fell for it anyway i guess not i know you thought you were trying to help me but now im stuck not knowing where to go and not only am i far from my river i owe the good magician a service i wish id never met you mentia sighed i guess it was sort of crazy to think youd be grateful but im a crazy creature maybe i should help you some more no he cried alarmed not even if i showed you how to find magician trent not even he paused youd do that and the sorceress iris too she said sweetly if that would make you feel good about me why should you care how i feel about you i shouldnt but im a bit crazy as you know im not a bad creature and youre an interesting one so maybe ill get you clear of your confusion gary didnt trust this but seemed to have no viable al ternative agreed then show me how to find trent she paused to consider her feet not quite touching the ground the old folk are down in the brain corals pool waiting for you so well have to go there what kind of pool oh you dont know about that i thought you gar goyles knew all about water we purify running water he said slightly aggrieved we ignore pools this pool is not to be ignored the brain coral is a weird inanimate entity who likes to collect things such as piers anthony living creatures which it keeps in suspended animation in its deep subterranean pool once every decade or so it lets a creature out if theres really good reason and that crea ture is exactly the same age as it was when it went in even if its been there for several centuries of course in the time of no magic back in the year tenfortythree fiftyone years ago everything got messed up and some captives escaped it was decades before the brain coral completed its inventory and knew exactly who was gone menda shrugged in sections like a moving caterpillar her head shoulders breasts midsection pelvis thighs legs and feet taking their turns the effect would have been in teresting had gary been a human male by then it was a bit too late of course but theres still good stuff in those dark waters and right now magician trent and sorceress iris are there they are in the pool in suspended animation of course do you think they want to wait in the reg ular realm getting older every moment iris already has too much of a problem in that respect she does whats wrong with getting older doesnt everyone do it every nondemon i suppose this time mentias right side shrugged in one direction and her left side in the other direction gary did find that interesting especially when her eyes passed each other on the return trip over shooting the mark but iris is ninetythree years old thats ancient and doddering for the average human be ing but magician trent must be old too so theyre even ninetyseven technically but he was youthened to about twentyfive last year and is now one handsome hunk of human why should he mess with a woman of greatgrandmotherly physical age that makes a difference to a human yes the man can be as old as he wants but the woman has to be young or shes a waste thats the way it is with human folk so shell take a youth po geis of the gargoyle tion to knock about seventy years off her physical age thats her reward for helping you after that who knows what she may be up to shes a longsuppressed woman mentias clothing turned transparent for an instant show ing a flash of her considerably curved outer contours gary shook his head you claim to be a little bit crazy mentia but you dont seem any worse than regular hu mans are the demoness caught by surprise by the compliment flushed the contents of her head melted into red fluid and drained down the pipes of her neck leaving a hollow translucent shell the fluid gurgled through her body and pooled in her feet which swelled voluminously then gradually her head filled again the fluid rising from the bottom to the top until it was complete and she resumed normal activity thank you she said when her lips were full again gary realized that for all mentias disclaimers she did care at least a little what other creatures thought of her that didnt seem to be too much of a fault how old are you mentia a hundred and ninetythree but whos counting it doesnt matter for demons she inhaled and her bosom became magnificent and burst out of its halter gary was no judge of such things of course but he suspected that a human man would find her attractive or one year de pending how you count it i havent gone out on my own as metrias alter ego all that long that seemed like a fair dual answer so this ninety threeyearold ancient old woman youthened to her twen ties is assigned to help me on my mission gary said somewhat dispiritedly i suppose i had better get on with it thats what i was up to i can pop to the pool just like that but you cant you need a physical conveyance can you sing that must be her craziness showing again no too bad we could have had you ride a diggle they piers anthony carry folk through rock for a song she pondered her body fuzzing out as she lost focus maybe a figgle a what thats another subspecies of vole all it wants is a fig so you dont give a fig more craziness you dont give it what it wants yes because when it gets its fig it eats it and goes home to snooze so why not promise it a fig after it has helped you it doesnt work that way piggies dont plan for the fu ture they want to know now but you cant give it the fig now she smiled you are catching on stoneface so we cant use a figgle yes we can he knew she was teasing him but he was stuck for it so he asked the obvious question how by telling it what we arent giving it i dont understand well youre only a stone animal now ill summon a figgle for us to ride she was crazy all right but what else was there mentia put two fingers to her mouth inhaled to just short of bursting and blew a piercing whistle that made his stone ears craze there followed a rumbling in the ground and in two moments and half an instant the worm like snout of a huge nether creature poked from the soil ffiigg the sloppy mouth inquired well were not giving you a shoe mentia retorted but if you take us to the brain corals pool who knows what we might give you the figgle cogitated in vermicular fashion its thoughts evidently twisting deviously ffiigg it repeated gary was starting to begin to think about catching on were not giving you a castle he said mentia stepped onto the creatures broadly rounded back her solidly fleshed thighs straddling it gary did the same as well as he could straddling it with four legs the geis of the gargoyle creature was so solid that this did not feel as precarious as it looked go poool the creature said then ffigg were not giving you a parasol mentia said the creatures snout angled down and plunged into the earth as if it were water the body followed sinuously gary wondered whether he should be alarmed but before he could come to a conclusion they were descending through the ground there was only the faintest sensation as of dirty fog sliding by but after most of a moment the fog thickened becoming more like sludge get your mouth in gear mentia said and dont repeat anything that confuses it oh were not giving you a purple rock gary said and the sludge thinned around them he did not care to discover what happened when the figgle got confused deep in the ground or a green pair of socks mentia added gary warmed to this were not giving you the talent of conjuring things from the void he said when the ground around them began to solidify again or stanley steamers birthday which happens to be dismember twofour mentia said so it went the figgle seemed to be satisfied as long as they reassured it that they werent giving it something other than a fig that suggested by implication that they might give it a fig the fact that there was an almost in finite number of things that werent figs didnt seem to matter the figgles strength was not intelligence so they mentioned shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbages and kings and apples and ideas as well as acoms and mountains and pictures of things best left undescribed through it all die figgle plowed on down through earth rock and whatever well before they had run out of things not to give the figgle they arrived at the brain corals pool they were sliding through layers of rock when the environment abruptly became thin and gary realized with a start that geis of the gargoyle piers anthony this was because it was air there was a flat cave floor and beyond it a deep dark cave pool fed by a slow lazy river the walls and water glowed faintly so that there was no problem seeing it was a rather pretty region though of course to a gargoyle any place with plenty of flowing wa ter was appealing now we have to give our steed the whatever mentia announced yes its time gary agreed give it the fig ffigg the figgle exclaimed coiling with eagerness the demoness writhed emulating the figgle me i dont have a fig dont you have one ffigg the creature said hungrily of course i dont how could i have known i would need a fig ffigg the very rock shuddered with the urgency of it and the surface of the pool rippled nervously well you had better find one quickly mentia re marked in a rare flash of sanity because a figgles pa tience grows short when payoff time is delayed so it appeared what happens if the figgle doesnt get awhatever oh i wouldnt recommend finding out indeed the creature was thrashing around with increasing force and since part of it was anchored in the rock the whole cave was shaking gary had heard of earthquakes and was catching a glimmer of what caused them but what could they do they had no fig a chunk of stone fell from the ceiling and splashed into the water cracks were opening in the stone floor the walls were blurry not because of any problem with garys vision but because they were vibrating so violently then desperation gave gary wit mentiayoure a de moness he exclaimed her mouth drew down into a pout that became so large it made her face pearshaped you noticed you can assume any form you wish he continued i thought that had become evident her head ex panded until it was like a watermelon and the rest of her body shrank so that only little arms and legs projected from the giant fruit and you cant be hurt by mortals not physically she agreed or mentally now that i think of it however a mortal can hurt a demon emotion ally if shes stupid enough to get half a soul so become a fig he said the watermelons eyes expanded in surprise then the entire big juicy fruit shrank into a little dried fruit gary reached out with a forepaw and picked it up here is your fig he said to the writhing figgle im giving you a fig the creature snapped up the fig and dived into the wall so quickly that anything as long as an instant would have been lost in the shuffle suddenly gary stood alone in a quiet cave and he knew that one thing he would never say hereafter was i dont give a fig he had learned the consequence now he had to find magician trent and sorceress iris that should not be difficult as he understood that both were human beings he walked along the ledge beside the pool no person whether of animal or human shape seemed to be in the vicinity then he remembered that the things were stored in the pool in suspended animation that explained why it was so quiet here outside the pool he would have to go down into it to find the folk he needed he found a shallow place and stepped carefully into the water the pool was neither cold nor hot it seemed to be perfectly neutral of course it didnt matter to him be cause he was made of stone but it probably made a differ ence for those stored within it they wouldnt want to be shivering with cold for hundreds of years he continued down until the water was over his head that didnt matter either he didnt need to breathe he wondered how the flesh creatures managed though now he saw something it seemed to be a wooden struc piers anthony geis of the gargoyle ture maybe it was an office but as he came to it he saw that it was just a collection of boards piled somewhat hap hazardly together gary was no neatness freak but it did seem that these would take up less space if carefully piled so he might as well do that before moving on he took hold of a board hey the board protested startled gary paused did you talk to me he asked do you see any other ugly stone monster idiots in the vicinity the board demanded in a warped tone what do you think youre doing i was just going to pile you more neatly so you wouldnt be scattered around gary explained well ill thank you knot to interfere with our board meeting it said we want to get our business done be fore we season you know sorry gary said and quickly moved on he had not realized that boards talked or that they had meetings and was a bit embarrassed for his ignorance he came to a man reading a book maybe he would know where magician trent was i say may i interrupt you a moment gary inquired cautiously i wish you would the man said without raising his face his voice was somewhat muffled i am looking for magician trent who i understand is in this pool somewhere could you direct me to his loca tion love to but i cant cant the man lifted his face the book came up with it cov ering his eyes my nose is stuck in this book and i cant see around it that did seem to be a predicament can i help you re move it gary inquired solicitously no my nose would come off my face if you pulled the book away unless you know where theres some sol vent i dont know but ill see if i can find some gary looked around and saw a tree deeper in the water grow ing as if on land there were many signs of activity around it though at the moment nothing was actually moving so he approached it do you happen to have any solvent he inquired of course i have solvent the tree retorted im an industree its one of the things needed in construction and manufacture soon gary had plucked a can of solvent from one of the industrees twigs he put a drop on the book attached to the mans nose and it came free oh thank you strang er the man said it has been a bore not being able to turn the page he reburied his face in the book so firmly that gary realized that it wouldnt be long before his nose got stuck again the man hadnt even noticed that gary was not a human being he returned to the industree can you tell me where the first sample was free the tree told him severely you will have to pay the going rate for anything more do you think im in business for my health gary hadnt realized that the industree was in business at all embarrassed again he retreated this was certainly a strange region apparently not all the things in it were suspended because he had had no trouble talking with several even if they hadnt proved to be very helpful gary walked on he heard music so he went toward the source it turned out to be a harpy with very stiff erect tailfeathers she was reaching back and plinking them with her claws so as to generate a nice tune it occurred to gary that if a human man hadnt helped him and an inanimate board hadnt and a tree hadnt maybe an animal type of creature would but he knew that harpies were perverse so this might require some finesse he approached the harpy thats awful music he told her gruffly why thank you she screeched flattered im a harpychord and i love to annoy folk piers anthony you are surely succeeding and i know youll never tell me where magician trent is yes ill never tell you to look twenty paces to your left she screeched plinking a few more notes a curse on you you miserable creature he said and turned to his left the harpy really had appreciated his comment on her music so had answered his question in the only way she could without soiling her reputation negatively twenty paces later he came to a handsome young man snoozing against a pillow bush he remembered that ma gician trent had been rejuvenated so this could be him he did not want to disturb the magician but he didnt have much choice magician trent he inquired hesi tantly the man woke yes are you lost just settle down anywhere youre comfortable the moment you relax youll tune out and years or centuries will pass in an in stant no i was lost but now im found that is i found you i am gary gargoyle hello gary gargoyle the magician responded po litely you were looking for me the good magician didnt tell you humfrey never wastes information if he can help it what did he tell you actually he did not tell me much but others in the castle explained i think and what did they explain the magician inquired pa tiently gary grimaced that you would transform me into manfbrm for this quest that i would have to babysit a difficult human child ah yes surprise she will be a handful and that the sorceress iris would come with me the magician nodded now it comes together iris did want to go on a quest where she could be useful this must be it we shall have to notify her geis of the gargoyle gary was amazed the good magician told you noth ing about me you have to take this all on faith magician trent smiled he had a warm smile and it was reassuring i have known humfrey a long time i un derstand his ways this is his way come we shall rouse my wife he got lithely to his feet and walked deeper into the depths of the pool bemused gary followed trent led him to a weird kind of chamber it seemed to have been fashioned from old cooked cereal she is of advanced years the magician remarked glancing back she prefers a soft residence this is her mushroom now gary recognized the configuration a room made of mush probably it was pretty soft throughout inside the mushroom was a mushbed and on the bed lay a distressingly ancient old woman sleeping iris the magician said your quest has come the crones eyes flickered open is it morning she asked sleepily who knows magician trent said smiling faintly your quest is here then another strange thing happened the three of them were abruptly no longer in a room of mush under dim wa ters but in the receiving chamber of an elegant palace rather gary and the magician were the hag had been re placed by an elegant queen of moderately middling age for her species he knew she was a queen because she wore a crown as well as a sumptuous ornately bejeweled royal gown the queen looked around but where is the quest per son she inquired a royal frown crossing her noble fea tures allow me to introduce gary gargoyle magician trent said gesturing to gary the queen looked at gary blinking but i cant stand gargoyles she protested theyre horrible dank stony grotesque monsters and this the magician continued grandly is queen geis of the gargoyle piers anthony emeritus iris sorceress of illusion all that you behold at the moment is her work gary was amazed he knew of illusion but this was so much more than he had imagined that it was daunting the withered old harridan was making all this it seemed so real pleased to meet you gargoyle im sure the queen said seeming not sure at all likewise your majesty gary said with similar con viction of course i am to transform him to manform for the occasion trent added iris looked relieved and humfrey left me some youth elixir to delete seventy years from your physical age my dear when the time came it has come iris looked delighted i will be twentythree again i wish i didnt have to be transformed gary said but at least i can return to my natural shape after the quest is done i assure you that such transformation will improve yourum that is that you will get used to it iris said evidently making an effort to be polite i have the impression you dont very much like me gary said i assure you that the feeling is mu impressions are transitory trent said quickly it is wise not to judge by anything other than direct experi ence iris nodded i apologize for being prejudiced gary gargoyle i had a bad experience some time ago with which a gargoyle was associated but actually the creature didnt do anything and anyway im sure youre not like that i hope im not gary said cautiously just what is the quest iris inquired i have to tutor a child a child of merfolk she asked i understand that gar goyles know something of water it is the little daughter of grundy golem and rapun zei trent explained a tyke they call surprise i didnt realize that they had a baby delivered iris said it must have been after my time yes it was trent agreed she was delivered to them a year and a half ago a squalling baby iris said with distaste what kind of tutoring could a gargoyle give her swimming les sons she is six years old trent said she turned to him are you teasing me magician i distinctly heard you say she was delivered a year and a half ago delivered at the age of five years he explained both gary and iris stared at him so great was the sor ceress shock that the illusion palace developed fuzziness but that is not the most remarkable thing about her trent continued blithely she has an impossible talent nothing is impossible iris said getting a faltering grip on her manner and her illusion except that any per son have more than a single talent she seems to possess an indefinite number of talents trent said how can you know this she demanded it must be illusion i met her in the course of my own quest when i was helping gloha goblinharpy find her ideal husband oh is there a male flying goblin she asked i thought she was unique there is now i converted him from an invisible giant she married a giant however did they come to gether that is a story for another tome this story is about a remarkable child who i think will be a handful like none other why she should require the special attention of a gargoyle i have no notion but i suspect it will be an ad venture finding out iris sighed i should have known there would be a stiff piers anthony price for youthening but i would give half my soul to be young again in body and this seems to fall within that range lets get on with it as you wish my dear first let me transform gary gargoyle since this is his quest oh im satisfied to wait gary said being as uneager to change his form as the sorceress was to change hers but even as he spoke something truly awful happened to him he found himself standing on his two hind legs while his front legs changed their orientation becoming shorter and far less sturdy his head diminished and his teeth shrank into tiny dull pegs almost useless for combat his forepaws became weak fleshy digits with pale flat nails and his wings horrors disappeared entirely he felt na ked but he wasnt there was a cloth covering hanging on his torso iris surveyed him well thats an improvement he makes a halfway handsome young man she turned to trent now its my turn to be sure trent handed her a vial containing a clear liquid drink and be merry my dear she almost snatched it and put it to her lips gulping it down then she stood there unchanged perhaps we should dispense with the illusion for the nonce trent suggested oh yes she agreed then the mushroom reappeared around them and the water of the pool but the shriveled old woman was gone now there stood a woman in the most vibrant flush of hu man youth the effect was diminished somewhat by her clothing which hung on her body in some places and was stretched painfully tight in others perhaps you should change your dress trent sug gested with threequarters of a smile iris looked down at herself yes out with you both while i see to some alterations geis of the gargoyle oh we have no objection if you prefer to strip now and remake your outfit trent said out she cried women tend to be unreasonable for no particular rea son magician trent remarked as they stepped out and heard the mushdoor slam closed behind them with a squishy sound but gary had problems of his own the moment he took a twolegged step he lost his balance he wasnt used to this vertical positioning trent steadied him with a hand you can do it he said reassuringly most of my transformations have no trou ble the ways of their bodies are inherent but you have had your natural form for centuries so may be a bit set in your ways emulate me he strode a few steps turned and strode back gary started a stride tilted over caught himself and veered off the other way but in a few steps he began to get the hang of it it was after all possible to walk this way however awkward it seemed soon you will not even notice the difference the ma gician reassured him but your intellectual adjustment may be more difficult you have human form now but your spirit remains gargoyle already gary was learning he found that he did best when he simply let his body handle motion instead of try ing to dictate to it the human form required constant bal ancing but seemed to have inherent mechanisms to accomplish this he also found that he had to be careful of the clothing which tended to snag on things in ways that stone fur did not he would have preferred simply to re move the clothing and be natural as before but realized that this was not the human way all human beings he had seen were dressed and though parts of their flesh showed the central torsos seldom did the mushdoor opened and iris emerged now her cloth ing fit being tight around her narrow waist loose around her upper torso and flaring around her slender legs gary piers anthony was of course no judge of human anatomy but he sus pected that she was now a reasonably aesthetic example of her species you look ravishing my dear magician trent said po litely youth becomes you thank you iris said and smiled at him she looked nice when she did that for a human even her hair which had been whitish and straggly before when not enhanced by illusion was now a rich reddish brown and it flopped in loose curls about her shoulders now i think you must be on your way the magician said we do not know what dme constraints are in oper ation iris looked as if she might wish to linger in the pool somewhat longer but did not argue how do we find the golem residence she asked him im sure the demoness will be able to locate it once you are on the surface he turned to gary and you should be able to summon the demoness by speaking her name she seems to be interested in you so will probably appear but we arent on the surface gary said using his funny human mouth for the first time well need to find another figgle a figgle iris exclaimed i wouldnt want to mount one of those oversized worms there should be an easier way trent said i believe that brain coral has a private freight elevator to ship freed creatures up in he lifted his chin coral a golden glow appeared before them it was in the form of a path leading away trent smiled follow the yellow slick road he sug gested yes we had better iris agreed come on gargoyle man we have a quest to get out of the way gary shrugged using his human shoulders and fol lowed her he still wasnt sure that this quest was a good notion but he seemed to be stuck for it the path led up out of the pool and across the dry cave floor neither gary nor iris dripped as they emerged from the water they were dry gary real ized that the pool was magical in several ways but as he walked through air instead of water the slight change in environment eroded his orientation and he be gan to stumble he half fell into iris whats the matter with you she demanded sharply are you trying to paw me if i had my paws i wouldnt be stumbling gary said embarrassed oh thats right youre as new to human form as i am to youth she said and you are an animal so pawing has no meaning for you should it he asked perplexed just follow the path and try to stay steady in two or perhaps three moments gary adjusted to the different feel of balancing in air and was able to walk without stumbling you might try swinging your hands iris suggested piers anthony swinging my hands it helps you balance when you walk he moved his hands in circles as he took another step but it didnt seem to help like this she said and strode briskly forward her arms pumping vigorously he tried it but suffered worse problems than before opposite sides dummy she snapped opposite he asked blankly this was all very confus ing when he walked four footed one hind leg came for ward and landed before the forefoot on that side took off here she sounded exasperated she came to stand behind him putting her hands on his human elbows this foot that hand she pushed at his left leg with hers and shoved his right elbow forward gary tried it putting the left foot ahead and bracing himself to retain his balance now the other two she said shoving at his right leg and left elbow and swing back your arm on the opposite side this time dont stop just keep going ill fall he said wary of this awkward combination of moves no you wont try it he tried it and got all fouled up he began to fall and she was entangled with him she braced her legs between his and looped her arms around his chest hauling him back to upright they swayed precariously together before steadying you were right she gasped you tried to fall but now that he was steady he became aware of some thing else your front is soft she let go of him and stepped back this isnt work ing dont you coordinate your limbs when you walk four footed i dont see why you should have so much trou ble yes i have a fourbeat gait when i walk twobeat when i trot threebeat when i canter geis of the gargoyle twobeat she cried thats it move your arms as if youre trotting he tried itand suddenly he was beautifully in balance so human folk trot when theyre walking he said amazed but what do they do when theyre trotting they still trot she said then what about cantering they remain hot to trot she said firmly they have no other gaits surely when they gallop no they trot at any speed theyve got permanent trots then she looked surprised but did not amend her statement the trots he agreed it seems so limited but it did work for him he found he was able to go at any speed using the same oppositeside armleg coordination she had solved his problem thank you youre welcome she said they moved with greater ease along the glowing path soon they came to a blank wall the path had deadended in a squaredoff cave what now gary asked we must have to do something iris examined the wall there were several glowing spots on it she touched the lowest one there was a grinding clank behind them startled gary turned suddenly the floor gave way gary and iris both alarmed by the sensation of falling grabbed on to each other for support now her softness was jammed against his front but he didnt object because their balance to gether did seem to be better than it was apart the floor was still falling but so were the walls the two of them seemed to be in a plunging cage there was even a wall behind them now where one hadnt been be fore it had a window and through the window they could see a dimly lighted wall zooming upward then the chamber slowed and they felt heavy it clanked to a halt and the windowed wall split in half and the halves parted and separated and slid into the walls on piers anthony either side leaving them standing in another deadend cave they pushed away from each other and stepped back along the passage but there was no glowing path this does not seem like the surface iris remarked there was a rumbling roar as of some enormously gi gantic huge big animal sounding defiance the walls shook we went down gary said it must be deep he re ally did not feel like remaining here long especially while not in his natural stone body do you think i touched the wrong spot gary was privately gratified that the sorceress was as doubtful in this situation as he was maybe if the bottom glow made it go down the top one would make it go up they returned to the dead end iris touched the top glow this time gary saw what happened the two halves of the wall came out from the sides and clanked together then the newly formed cage lifted carrying them up with it they were being elevated the cage quickly got up speed and they saw the dim lights plunging downward beyond the little window sometimes there seemed to be holes in the wall and he re alized that these could be other passages there were many levels to this cave then the cage slowed and stopped moving and the walls parted this time there was an open landscape beyond with trees they had reached the surface they stepped out the walls clanked behind them gary turnedand there was the blank wall of a cliff it was part of a mountain there was no sign of any chamber or ele vator truly the ways of the nether realm were marvelous we must be somewhere south of the gap chasm iris said looking around and east of castle roogna but i have no idea where the golem residence is i fear i wasnt paying much attention to routine things during my dot age your dotage geis of the gargoyle i was old and feeble and querulous of mind at age ninetythree now i have shed seventy years and my wits are close about me i can appreciate how much i was miss ing so maybe it is time to summon your demoness friend and see whether she will help us gary nodded d mentia he called are you there a cloud of purple smoke formed who wants to know it inquired oh let it be mentia gary said you got me into this so you should help me see it through the cloud solidified into the familiar shape of the slightly crazy demoness but you know what you got me into worm intestines they were interesting ive never been digested before have we met before iris asked i doubt it ive only existed for less than a year as a halfseparate entity and i dont recognize your face any way i am the sorceress iris i doubt that too shes an old and feeble crone ne glectful of whats what in her dotage rejuvenated to a vigorous twentythree iris clarified here is what i used to look like her appearance changed to that of the ancient old woman oh sure id recognize that old hag anywhere but you almost never looked that way because i used my illusion to look more like this iris said evenly reverting to her real appearance now i dont have to i am reveling in my newfound youth so are you going to show us the way to the grundy golem resi dence mentia considered why should i because its bound to be interesting gary said good point very well follow me the demoness walked roughly west passing through a tree oh great iris said sourly shes a bit crazy gary explained then he called to geis of the gargoyle piers anthony the demoness mentia if you want us to be interesting you will have to show us a route we can use the demoness reappeared close oh she put her feet to the ground and walked around the tree there was a faint path there they walked west past in nocuous trees and shrubs gary spied a breadfruit tree and felt a strange sensation it was a kind of distress below the midpoint of his new body his fleshy innards burbled you must be hungry iris remarked hungry when did you last eat gargoyles dont eat were made of stone not any more she stepped off the path and plucked a loaf of bread from the tree then she took another pace and took a butternut from a butternut tree bread and but ter try it still he hesitated not knowing what to do with the things she brought him oh for pitys sake she said it seems i have to show you how to eat too yes she took a slice of bread from the loaf and squeezed the butternut so that butter spread across the surface of the bread then she put the edge of the slice to her mouth and bit into it she wrinkled her nose needs something she decided she looked around until she spied an orange egg on the ground gooda manna nested here heres what the manna laid she picked up the egg and squeezed some of its orange onto the slice then she took another bite yes this is good then she set up a second slice similarly for gary just bite and chew she said gary took the bread and bit into it to his surprise the weird combination did taste good he chewed a mouthful swallowed it and took another eating was all right soon they had finished the loaf and the butternut and the orange marma laid i forgot how hungry the young healthy folk get iris said wiping her face i never knew how hungry flesh folk get gary agreed they finished with some fluid from a leaning beerbarrel tree someone had kindly provided it with a spigot and there were some mugwumps nearby with pretty mugs the stuff was dusky colored and it foamed but it tasted good and gary drank several mugsful after that he felt better than ever if somewhat unsteady they resumed their trek but before long there was a growl that sounds like a dragon iris said her tone hinting that she was not completely pleased of course its a dragon mentia said whose path do you think this is this is mischief iris muttered ill go first and it will break ish teeshits teeth on my body gary suggested you are forgetting that you are no longer a stone ani mal but a flesh man iris said and i am no longer a leathery husk but a plump young chick we have a prob lem garys thinking had become somewhat fuzzy for some reason but he realized that she was right the dragon would want to eat them both maybe we should gesh get off its path too late mentia said cheerfully here comes the dragon why didnt you tell us this was a dragon path before iris demanded you didnt ask that makes so much sense it cant be the reason youre right im too crazy to have a straight reason meanwhile the dragon was charging down on them gary wasnt sure what kind it wassmoker steamer or fire breatherbecause wisps of smoke hovered around its mouth and jets of steam hissed from its ears and there was fire in its eyes its huge fbreclaws gouged divots and its great mouth was cranking open to chomp the first victimwhich happened to be mentia of course that didnt work the teeth passed right geis of the gargoyle piers anthony through the demoness without effect what are you trying to do she inquired breathing on her nails the dragon made a fiery snort of disgust realizing her nature and oriented on the second morsel which was iris then a giant serpent replaced the young woman huge and green it lifted its enormous head and bared its sword like teeth its mouth was just about big enough to take in the dragons whole head what is the meaning of thiss it hissed the dragon blanched and its fire went out ssorry naga it hissed back apologetically then it quickly turned tail and was gone in threequarters of an instant but you arent of the naga folk gary protested some what confused iris reappeared as the serpent vanished how was the dragon to know that it saw a woman transform into a ser pent as the naga do i think its conclusion was reason able her illusion had done it you saved us he said weakly well i wasnt going to let the thing chomp us she said whats the use of going on a quest if you just get eaten gary realized that there might be advantages to having the sorceress along her power of illusion could be as good a defense as real weapons if the enemy did not know the difference they walked on but another threat developed a hungry roc bird spied them as they crossed a flat plain it folded its wings and dived toward them but a boulder appeared around them gary was inside it yet it looked real the roc blinked twitched its beak and sheered off thinking it had gotten confused birds are not phenomenally smart iris observed gary understood that but still had he been a roc he would have sheered off too because that boulder was so realistic still he wondered what would happen if some creature called her bluff and charged on through the veil of illusion they continued entering a deep valley in its center was a chasm an arm or maybe a leg of the great gap chasm which had offshoots extending far afield how are we to get across this gary asked as they approached the brink he was feeling less dizzy now which was just as well be cause it would not have been good to lose his balance and fall into the depths of the cleft there must be a bridge somewhere iris said is that right demoness mentia appeared sure right beyond that copse to the north but then another threat appeared this was a truly fero cious creature with the head of a serpent body of a lion cloven hooves and a formidable stinger it bayed as it spied them making a hideous noise theres the blatant beaste mentia remarked inter ested it has a thousand tongues and it doesnt let any thing stand in its way not even a naga or a boulder i wonder what kind of illusion will help you now we shall see iris said she looked around i see that this chasm offshoot is highly irregular that is the nature of gap radiations gary agreed watching the beast nervously he had never been much concerned about such creatures when he was stone but now in this feeble flesh manform he felt extremely inse cure lets get beyond that jag she said wont it just skirt the edge as we do and get at us with only a small delay perhaps not they walked quickly around the jag putting its depth between them and the monster then they turned to look back gary was surprised he had evidently misjudged the position of the jag because they had not after all gotten beyond it we had better move farther over he said no this will do iris decided geis of the gargoyle piers anthony but trust me stone beast gary did not trust her judgment but since it didnt make a lot of difference anyway he settled down with her to wait for the arrival of the blatant beaste this was horri ble because of its noise it really did seem to have a mouthful of tongues and all of them were shaping pierc ing screams it was definitely intending mayhem it charged right toward them gary gazed desperately around trying to find something that this puny human body could use as a weapon but there was only level dirt leading up to the edge of the chasm to the side the beastes screams became deafening it was only three bounds and ten paces from them and there was noth ing to stop it not even an illusion wall yet iris seemed unconcerned in fact she even lifted her spread hand put her thumb to her nose and waggled her fingers at the crea ture the blatant beaste became if anything even more baleful it picked up speed charging straight across the level sand and suddenly dropped out of sight there were only the continuing sounds of its screams rising from under the ground then iris banished her illusion the jag of the chasm re appeared right where gary had first thought it was she had covered it with the image of sand and the beaste had been fooled and plunged headlong in blatant beastes arent very smart either the sorceress remarked as she resumed walking north gary hadnt been any smarter he realized it hadnt oc curred to him that illusion could cover up something that wasnt there as well as making something appear she had made an illusion chasm to the side and concealed the real one as gary walked he found that he was uncomfortable in the midsection again but this time he wasnt hungry so he tried to ignore it soon they reached the bridge and crossed over the track continued wending generally west apparently they had gotten beyond the dragon path and were now on a more established route i recognize this now iris exclaimed its one of the enchanted paths yes we intersected the enchanted network at the bridge mentia said and here i was worrying about staving off more mon sters why didnt you tell us mentia shrugged her shoulders misjudged the range and went on up over her head before she thought to draw them back down into place again why didnt you ask iris decided to ignore that and just where along this is the golem residence just north of the gap chasm they live in a club house north of the gap but again she hadnt actually asked gary had assumed as iris evidently had that it was south had they struggled to avoid monsters when they might have taken a more direct route and avoided them entirely gary made a mental note not to take the demon ess on faith it wasnt worth it meanwhile garys discomfort of the midsection hadnt eased maybe his soft human body was just getting tired they came to a campsite we might as well stop here iris said the day is getting late yes gary said she glanced at him you look uncomfortable i am but im not hungry iris considered you havent been a flesh creature be fore you didnt have to eat yes i didnt then maybe i can guess what else you didnt have to do you had better go to that toiletree over there and do it do what he asked i really dont feel up to anything very energetic piers anthony precisely just go there and maybe you will figure it out then she thought of something else but maybe you should take off your clothes before you do what has my clothing to do with it she shrugged and her shoulders stayed in proper place maybe you will have to find out on your own so gary went to the toiletree stepped behind it and pulled off his awkward clothing he still felt quite uncom fortable then he saw something floating by it seemed to be a dot it was followed by a second dot and then a third dot are you feeling better now iris inquired as he rejoined her in the main section of the camp much better and he did but the curious thing was that he couldnt remember what had happened by the toiletree he had seen the three floating dots and then he was here dressed and in good order apparently those dots had made him forget about whatever happened if anything had happened then you must have seen the ellipsis she said the ellipsis the three dots they cover up anything thats unmen tionable such as stork summoning or natural functions that makes it possible for us to live without perpetually blushing that explained it but now gary was hungry again for tunately there was a pie tree growing at the camp with many kinds of pies and there were milkweeds too they had everything they needed as the sun set they made piles of pillows and blankets harvested fresh from their bushes and settled down for the night gary had never seen the purpose of pillows be fore but now that he was flesh he took great comfort in them he lay relaxedand found himself in a weird other realm yo he cried startled what now iris asked sleepily from her bed nearby geisof the gargoyle i was somewhere else and everything was in frag ments and confused oh you were dreaming dreaming its what living folk do when they sleep but i was seeing things and doing things i was awake you were awake in your dream but asleep in real life when you dream your soul enters the gourd realm and you get the dreams they make for you just forget them when you wake forget them you mean they dont matter not in ways we need to remember so you can ignore anything that happens while you are sleeping most live creatures do that was a relief gary settled back down on his bed of pillows and if he dreamed again he didnt remember it was possible to get along as a flesh creature once he learned the knack of it what was that gary asked alarmed what was what that hurtling whatever that just went by oh that just a time break iris explained its so we dont have to go into boring detail all the time its like the ellipsis only moreso oh he relaxed he realized that he had seen similar things before but hadnt paid attention now that he was in vulnerable flesh form every detail bothered him until he knew it was safe they ate breakfast used up another ellipsis or two and resumed their trek the demoness mentis wasnt in evi dence apparently she was quickly bored when things were dull so faded out gary was satisfied to leave her out now that they had a safe path to follow they intersected a path heading north and followed it wp vo tine nmsftae bridge across fce gap chasm iris used it without hesitation so gary did too though it looked like geis of the gargoyle piers anthony nothing at all and it took them right across the yawning gulf that surprised him then he realized that even the gap chasm might get bored and sleepy when nothing much was happening so yawning was natural at last they came to the golems club house but the club was lying on the ground the family seemed to have moved into a more conventional home recently there it was a small cottage industree it looked like a cross be tween the industree he had seen before and a big cheese gary approached the treetrunk and knocked on the door there in a moment a tiny woman with very long hair opened it stranger we dont mean to be unfriendly but this region isnt safe for visitors she said looking wor ried i am gary gargoyle in manform he said and this is the sorceress iris in youthform the good magician sent us toto tutor surprise oh youre the one the little woman exclaimed oh wonderful we just cant handle her any more shes out of control im her mother rapunzel here she is she reached back inside the tree and brought forth a small bun dle but but his protest was stifled because there in his hands was the bundle it seemed to be a tiny little girl the door to the house was closed but shes so small iris said almost as doubtful about this as gary was surprise the tot exclaimed her tiny eyes crossed suddenly she was full normal sixyearold little girl sized being awkwardly held by garys arms she kissed him on the cheek do you like me why i dont know gary said as he carefully set her down are you likable sure when i want to be are you going to be interest ing or dull i have no idea thats interesting surprise decided lets go but we cant just take you from your family he pro tested we have to talk to your parents first then he be came aware that she wasnt standing before him any more where are you there was a giggle from somewhere he looked around and iris looked around but they couldnt spy the source of the giggle so gary knocked on the door again the door opened yes rapunzel asked as if they hadnt just met we seem to have lost your daughter gary said em barrassed oh thats all right we lose her all the time its one of her talents one of her she cant be found when she doesnt want to be found rapunzel explained she has a number of ways to get lost but then how can we find her youll just have to make her want to be found do you have anything that might interest her gary was blank but iris came to the rescue i can make very interesting illusions surprise reappeared you can let me see a miniature replica of the golems cottage tree appeared in the air before the sorceress complete with tiny figures of the four of them it looked extremely realistic gee the child exclaimed i like it her eyes crossed and before her appeared an even smaller replica with even tinier figures iris gaped but im the only one who can do this kind of illusion she protested im sorry surprise said and her replica vanished she just does anything she wants to rapunzel said we love her but we cant handle her when she knocked over our club house in a fit of superstrength we gave up and petitioned the good magician for relief he said he would send a tutor were certainly glad to see you bring her back when shes under control she closed the door again piers anthony but gary began helplessly but he realized it was futile this was his service to the good magician and he would have to try to perform it despite his complete in competence the little girl did not seem to be mean spir ited just wild and im supposed to help iris said morosely can youth be worth it youth surprise exclaimed crossing her eyes sud denly iris was her apparent age six her clothing was piled around her as it had not shrunk to fitand in any event it wouldnt have fit because the proportions were different iris took only half an instant to realize what had hap pened surprise restore me this instant she said se verely okay the little girl said contritely iris reappeared in full size but now her collapsed clothing was bunched around her midsection leaving her top bare gary had not seen a grown womans top exposed since assuming manform and he found it interesting gary look away iris screamed surprise restore my clothing too gary started to turn away obedient to the voice of com mand but before he completed the effort the sorceress clothing jumped into proper place making it unnecessary why didnt you just clothe yourself with illusion he asked as she adjusted herself i didnt think of it she confessed but this needs to be dealt with she addressed the child surprise you must not fool with other people its not nice why surprise asked her cute little brow furrowing in perplexity i told you its not nice promise not to do it again surprise frowned but its fun gary realized that there was a problem reasoning with a child he remembered how young gargoyles were disci plined because if you do it again he said firmly the sorceress will make the illusion of a monster that looks geis of the gargoyle like a he hesitated not certain what would properly scare a human child he grasped at a straw like a big stone gargoyle iris obliged by conjuring the illusion of a creature that looked just like gary himself before his transformation he had to admire it he had not realized what a fine spec imen he was surprise stared at the gargoyle daunted then she sum moned her childish courage aw that doesnt scare the gargoyle opened its ponderous mottled marble mouth and spewed forth a splash of water eeeeeek surprise screamed vanquished i promise please no cold baths the gargoyle vanished thats nice iris said gra ciously she shot a glance of gratitude at gary for his help it was slowly becoming muddily clear why the two of them had been selected to handle this mission they had just worked together to pass the first hurdle in bringing the wild child under control but what was he supposed to tutor surprise about he doubted that she needed to know how to purify water and she certainly wouldnt have the patience to sit still for a century spouting fluid from her mouth his expertise was in no discipline that related well to the needs of a human child yet it was widely believed that the good magician never gave a wrong answer however farfetched or irrele vant it might seem initially gary had to hope that this was not the exception now we had better go somewhere iris said i dont think this childs folks want her back until she has been um properly tutored the good magician said to take her with me on my quest to find a philter gary said so we might as well get started a philter iris inquired what for to purify all the water of xanth so that there wont be any more pollution from mundania piers anthony geis of the gargoyle iris glanced significantly at surprise maybe someone could find or make that philter for you whats a filter surprise asked then again maybe not iris concluded the good magician also said that hiatus would know where it was i think hiatus the brother of lacuna she asked sharply i remember those two mischievous tots they were com pletely empty of responsibility it was just one lapse after another do you know what they did at the wedding of humfrey and the gorgon no gary admitted was it interesting it was outrageous they used their talents to entirely disrupt the ceremony they gee the child said interested iris glanced again at surprise and evidently changed her mind gary understood why the child was too apt to im itate any talent anyone mentioned well thats irrelevant no doubt hiatus has matured some in the interim it has been a number of years we shall have to enlist his assis tance in your quest yes but i dont know where to find him hes probably at castle zombie if not the zombie master or millie the ghost will know where to find him theres a ghost among the zombies gary asked a ghost surprise exclaimed her eyes crossed a humansized translucent spook appeared before the three of them with dark holes for eyes and a booshaped mouth iris paused harmless she murmured ignore it the ghost actually seemed as surprised by them as they were by it in a moment it floated away somewhat out of sorts gary realized that this was probably the best course when feasible to ignore surprises magic tricks castle zombie i know where it is but its a long walk from here i wish we had a carpet to ride there carpet the child said and a carpet appeared with several socks on it iris looked at it where did this come from mundania surprise said the talent of summoning things from mundania iris said pretending a calmness she probably didnt feel a rug with whatever happened to be on it this surely ex plains why mundanes are always losing their socks but this isnt what i was thinking of dear oh the carpet and socks vanished what did you mean why a magic carpet of course then iris caught her self but dont magic carpet surprise exclaimed brightly as her eyes crossed a carpet appeared floating at about knee level can we trust it gary asked warily iris peered closely at it this seems to be the good magicians carpet i recognize it it is quite trustworthy but we should return itafter were done with it she sat on the edge of the carpet and it bowed down a bit with her weight then firmed in place she lifted her legs swung them onto the carpet and tucked her skirt closely around them get on ill hold you surprise gary climbed onto the back of the carpet and drew up his knees in the manner iris had his impulse had been to crouch on it gargoyle style but this human form just wasnt suited for that the little giri sat on the womans lap approximately and his held her in place with her arms carpet rise slowly iris commanded it the carpet re sponded lifting somewhat in the manner of the elevator until it floated above the trees gary wondered what it would have done if she hadnt cautioned it to be slow they might have slid off the back as it zoomed forward carpet proceed in moderate manner to castle zom bie iris said and the carpet turned and moved smoothly south gary had never been partial to heights because a bad fall could crack stone but discovered that he felt secure on the carpet its magic held him in place without confining him so there was no danger of falling off he saw the geis of the gargoyle piers anthony trees passing below and then the gap chasm and then more trees with crisscrossing paths through the forest and occasional fields xanth was interesting viewed from above he tried to spy where they had walked before but couldnt see the invisible bridge and wasnt sure which particular trails were the ones he couldnt even be sure which particular jag from the gap they had crossed after dumping the blatant beaste but it was fun looking before long a castle came into view ahead it looked somewhat slimy and its stones were greenish and its moat was clogged with gook obviously this was castle zom bie they landed before the drawbridge and got off carpet go home iris told it and the carpet took off smoothly without riders spiraled into the sky and headed northeast that was a useful thing to summon iris informed sur prise when all your magic is that helpful to others you will be ready to go home but i was starting to get bored surprise said pouting gary realized that the ride had been more chancy than it had felt if she had done some mischief such as sum moning a basilisk to join them on the rug it would have become dangerously interesting this adventure probably had most of its complications still ahead iris took the childs hand and marched forward across the decrepit planking of the drawbridge gary hesitated uncertain whether it would support the weight of stone iris glanced back saw himand abruptly the drawbridge assumed the look of a fine stout iron and stone bridge he knew it was illusion but it helped he followed them across a zombie guard challenged them at the portcullis whoo he demanded moving his rotting arms to bring a rotting spear into play gee surprise said thrilled a real zombie let me handle this dear iris murmured quickly then to the guard queen emeritus sorceress iris to see millie the ghost in a moment a surprisingly appealing older woman came out iris she asked you dont look like like this millie iris asked clothing herself with il lusion so as to appear her real age iris millie exclaimed it is you what a wonderful surprise i thought you had gone to a fadeout party i did along with magician trent bink chameleon crombie and jewel the nymph but there was a compli cation there must have been millie said come in and well catch up on everything who is your friend and you have a child with you too they joined millie who was clearly no ghost in her nice apartment which was free of the rot elsewhere in the castle surprise played with a zombie werewolf changing forms herself to match him that seemed to be as good a diversion as any so gary and iris studiously ignored it iris quickly explained about how their fadeout party which had been intended to see them fade gracefully from the current xanth scene so it wouldnt be cluttered by too many old folk had been postponed gloha goblinharpy was on a quest in search of a suitable husband she being the only crossbreed of her kind so magician trent had been designated to help and protect her until she found her man since ninetysix was too old for adventure he had been youthened and his subsequent story of that adventure had convinced her to try it too so now she was per forming her service for the youthening by helping gary gargoyle tutor surprise but we need to consult with hi atus she concluded we hoped he would be here oh he is millie said somewhat sadly but he lacks ambition in life something is missing theres no continu ity im not sure how much help he will be to you iris pursed her lips the good magicians ploys act in devious ways she said do you suppose that we repre sent some kind of encouragement for him i wonder millie said turning hopeful i really fear there is no cure for him but it would be wonderful if he piers anthony were to take an interest in marrying and having grandchil dren the way his sister lacuna did after suffering empti ness in her life at least you can talk with him at least we can iris agreed gary wondered what hiatus problem was and hoped it wouldnt make it im possible for him to help them find the philter millie sent a zombie to call hiatus soon he appeared a touslehaired man nearing forty looking morose millie introduced the others except for surprise who was con juring miniature zombie animals and setting them to run ning around the floor by mutual silent consent they let her be perhaps you should tell them your story dear millie suggested in a kindly tone are they interested hiatus asked listlessly gary knew that the man would never be of any use in the quest if they didnt understand his problem yes so hiatus sat in the remaining chair and began to speak hiatus i was a wild child and my twin sister lacuna was mis chievous and together we drove our mother wild she was millie the ghost who was a ghost no more but preferred that title to zombie none of us were zombies of course but she was the wife and we were the children of the zombie master so folk tended to assume that we had at least some zombie ooze in us the truth was that millie was one of xanths most lovely women or had been before my sister and i wore her down we were a se vere interruption to the steady course of her current life and we disrupted whatever we encountered lacunas talent was to form print on anything such as walls or blankets or even to superimpose it on existing print changing the text of a printed page of course her print faded out when she lost her concentration doing no harm but it could be quite mischievous on occasion such as when she made the words kick me form on the rear end of a fat man as he bent to pick up a heavy rock in the presence of a literalminded zombie my talent was to grow temporary organs on various surfaces such as eyes geis of the gargoyle piers anthony ears or noses on windows treetrunks or rocks i never quite understood why some adults got so upset when one of my noses sprouted and sniffed audibly as they walked by or when one of my eyes formed on the ceiling or floor and peered down a ladys blouse or up under her skirt and winked it was just good clean fun but somehow lacuna and i were not too popular at formal occasions like wed dings or funerals today i can appreciate whybut today i am considerably more experienced and responsible than i was as a child i dont remember exactly what it was i did on the par ticular day im thinking of but im sure in retrospect that my mother was justified in screeching me out of the house and slamming the door i was then eleven or twelve years old and thought that all xanth owed me entertainment outraged by her overreaction to an innocent prank i de cided to run away from home so i called doofus our zombie dragon and climbed on his back and told him to gallop as far away as he could doofus wasnt smartfew zombies are because their heads are filled mostly with disgusting goobut his legs and back were strong so he galloped off in the direction he happened to be facing at the time which was sloppily southeast i didnt care i just wanted to get so far away that i could never be found but after a time doofus began to slow what are you getting tired already i demanded he just snorted some soggy smoke i realized that he was under standing orders not to go too far from castle zombie so as he approached the limit of his territory he lost momentum i could not override those orders for they had been impressed on him by my father the zombie master himself and all zombies owed their ultimate allegiance to him doofus obeyed me only so long as my directives did not conflict with those that were more deeply entrenched finally the dragon stopped entirely disgusted i got off him all right go home then you rotten creature i yelled he obeyed immediately and galloped off in the ap proximate direction of home i was left alone in a strange forest i looked around my anger fading into something like apprehension i knew that strange places were dangerous all i saw were trees and some rocks and rolls each rock rolling around and bang ing into things so that there was a series of loud sounds as each roll rocked with the vibrations well that was better than nothing i went to grab one of the rolls being hungry but its rock got in my way threatening to squish my fin gers and i had to leave the roll alone i heard some music and hoped that there might be some people there but when i made my way through the forest i discovered that the music was coming from another col lection of rocks or rather from the way they were being eaten a very nicelooking animal was grazing on them probably a dear and with each bite the rocks popped making attractive music but i wasnt sure i was ready to eat pop rocks however tasty they might be to the dear so i set my face in the direction it was facing and began to march straight ahead i wasnt sure where i was going but i was surely going somewhere child a womans voice called me i paused orienting on the sound there was a woman standing by a spreading acorn tree she wore a brown dress and seemed adult at this point my bravado had just about expired i wanted very much to have an excuse to go back home or failing that to find another home where someone like my mother would feed me and give me a safe place to sleep and take care of me of course i couldnt admit that even to myself but it may have influenced my reaction i went to her iicould you tell me where the near est human village is i asked politely i seem to be be lost she inquired gently i nodded abashed how did you come to this region she asked me with that tone of unconscious authority that comes naturally to all adults piers anthony naturally i had to answer i rode my pet zombie dragon but he went home perhaps you should go home also she suggested with more of that inherent authority making it somehow seem reasonable i uh suppose i agreed reluctantly where is your home i uh live atat castle zombie i faltered preferring to remain anonymous oh you must be the zombie masters little boy she said brightly im not little i protested bravely im eleven she gave me a glance that made me feel nine without actually insulting me of course what is your name hi then as she continued to gaze at me i realized that my answer was incomplete atus i added hiatus she repeated dont you have a sister lacuna i agreed our names mean the same thing a gap or a missing part our parents thought that was cute that was very clever of them i am desiree dryad i remembered my rudimentary manners pleased to meet you ms dryad she nodded well hiatus are you ready to go home i scuffled my feet i guess i happen to know a nice magic path that will take you there before nightfall i think you would not care to remain in this forest at night i was uncomfortably aware of that i guess id better take it desiree eyed me again but i think not without some food i wouldnt want your mother to think i had sent you home hungry i have some hybiscuits and finger and toe matoes she stepped around the tree and returned in a moment with a plate of these things exactly the kind of wholesome food i really wasnt much keen on eating but i knew better than to protest because thats a sure way to geis of the gargoyle make adults get even more set in their ways so i reached for the plate but first you had better go to that toiletree and clean up she said firmly oh yes i went to the tree and cleaned up then i took the plate from her and ate the healthy food and it was surprisingly good once i got into it even if i would have preferred dragon steak and chocolate milkweed juice i did try to wheedle some though in my naive childish cunning im thirsty i exclaimed do you have some tsoda popka or beerbarrel tree juice i knew she wouldnt let me have those but might compromise on flavored milkweed no hiatus she replied gently just some excellent water in the little spring there she gestured to a pleasant depression i hadnt noticed before where a spot of clear water showed oh there was no help for it but to go and glug some straight unadorned flavorless water actually it wasnt bad i hadnt realized that truly fresh water could quench thirst so well i burped and returned to desiree wiping my wet mouth on my sleeve i guess i better go now i said wheres the path she frowned there might be a more polite way to ask a favor she remarked to no one in particular i realized that she meant something huh she made a moue dont you usually say please oh that i obeyed the adult protocol please show me where the path is i said formally she smiled exactly as if she meant it adults are good at that of course it is right that way she gestured i peered but all i saw was a tangle of brush where she was silent and after a moment i realized that this was a hint that i had used the wrong phrasing adults were funny about such things i mean please show me more clearly where the path is ms dryad she smiled again turning and i realized that though i piers anthony was a boy and she was a woman she was no taller than i was and she probably weighed less that surprised me because adults had always seemed by definition to be larger than children it is concealed by foliage as most private paths are if you walk directly between those two laurel trees you will find it and once you are on it you will see it clearly but be careful not to stray from it until you get in sight of your castle because the moment you step off it you will not be able to see it again oh an invisible path i exclaimed delighted in a manner of speaking she agreed seeming to find something amusing we prefer to think of it as being vis ible to those who appreciate nature i was about to protest that i appreciated nature but then i realized that she probably meant things like dull vegeta bles and plain water thank you i said somewhat doubt fully because it sure didnt look like any path there perhaps i should lead you there desiree said gee yes i agreed immediately she walked in the direction she had indicated and i followed i marveled again at her smallness because she certainly had that adult woman way of walking its as if their bones are more bendy when we reached the two lau rel trees suddenly there before us was a nice little path winding on through the forest i blinked wondering how i could have missed it before desiree turned and saw my confusion if you step back a pace it will disappear she said i stepped back and the brush closed in leaving no path in sight oh its magic i said catching on what we call situational magic she agreed adults al ways had complicated words for simple things i think you would have had trouble seeing it even when on it if i were not showing you so it would be better not to be tempted by things like lollipop plants just off the path those can be mischief yeah i agreed impressed i sure better not get off it till im home geis of the gargoyle yes you certainly had better not do that she agreed i realized that she was correcting my speech in the mad deningly oblique way adults had but she had fed me and shown me the way home so i had to forgive her her adultish ways thanks ms dryad i said about to go i know im just a kid but i do like the favor youre a nice woman for a grownup a curious ripple of emotions crossed her face maybe she realized that i was making a real effort to be proper by adult definitions that i wasnt a bad boy just an ordinary kid crude around the edges but gradually getting polished hiatus what are your hopes for the future she in quired oh thats easy i said with enthusiasm ill grow up and get famous growing big eyes and ears and noses on everything in sight and everybody will be amazed that is an interesting ambition she agreed but what of romance huh i mean whats that normally boys grow up and get interested in girls and marry them and form families of their own have you no such ambition oh sure i guess i agreed catching her drift girls were always more interested in the mushy stuff than boys were my sister was stupid in the same way ill marry the most beautiful girl in xanth and let her do the house work that is all something concerned her but i couldnt tell what naw ill be out growing big noses on trees and things making them sneeze i said on trees sure trees look real funny with noses its real fun to grow a mundane elephant nose on a tree get it a trunk on a trunk i had to laugh at my cleverness for some reason she seemed annoyed but she didnt make anything of it what about your wife geis of the gargoyle piers anthony her i dunno i guess shell do what women do you know laundry cooking sewing making beds sweeping dust all that dull stuff they like desiree still seemed to have some kind of subtle prob lem are you sure they like it well maybe not but who cares mom never com plains desiree considered as i recall your mother was a ghost for eight hundred years perhaps she had her fill of freedom so was glad to be mortal again even if it meant tolerating dull routine but do you ever thank her for what she does for you huh the dryad seemed to come to a decision perhaps it would be better if you did not marry she remarked irrel evantly better for womankind i shrugged ill find someone cause ill be handsome and theyll all want to marry me i said confidently perhaps so she agreed but then she contradicted her self and perhaps not huh desiree faced me squarely child look at me she said look deep into my eyes and at my hair and at the rest of me curious i did as she bid me i met her gaze and some thing happened her eyes were green and as deep as the spring i had drunk from like two grassy pools i felt myself drifting into them now swimming now floating now sinking just getting encompassed by the way of them her hair was brownish red with leaves on it like a tree in autumn it was as if i stood within a quiet magic forest just looking at her it was wonderful in a way i had never before appre ciated when you are a man she said with quiet conviction you will never see a girl as fair and i realized that she was fair and more than fair she was the most beautiful creature i could ever have imag ined strange that i hadnt noticed that before but maybe it was as it was with the magic path i couldnt see it until she showed me there was simply nothing in all xanth that could possibly be as lovely as this maiden of the for est i had known that dryads were pretty creatures but never actually experienced it now i knew completely and forever she moved her tiny hands and they were like delicate leaves fluttering in the breeze she made a little turn and for the first time i saw just how slender yet wellformed her body was i had never thought to notice any such thing before in my life she lifted her arms above her head and swayed in the wind and it was as if she were a graceful fern or a slender tree yielding to the force of the air and returning to equilibrium as it passed she came to a halt and met my gaze again and what have you to say now hiatus she inquired gently oh when im a man ill have a girl just like you i swore i doubt it she smiled a bit sadly it seemed but you will remember me for the rest of your life then she walked away from me i started to follow her suddenly unwilling to let her out of my sight what a transformation there had been she had seemed like an ordinary woman and now she was more lovely and precious than anything i could dream of but she walked around the tree where i had first seen her and behind the trunkand did not appear on the other side i ran there and around the tree but she was gone desiree i cried suddenly desolate where are you but already i realized that she was a magic creature a dryad a nymph of the wood and would appear only at her desire not mine she was through with me so i returned to the two laurels and the path reap peared i took one look back at desirees tree marking its exact place then set my face firmly toward home the magic path led me promptly to castle zombie there may have been lollipops growing beside it but i piers anthony never noticed them i was still bemused by the vision of the girl in the wood how gorgeous she had so suddenly been never again would i encounter a dryad without re membering i stepped off the path and walked to the castle then i thought to verify the location of the path so i could follow it back on another day but i couldnt find it though i must have crossed and recrossed it several times like the dryad it was gone there was nothing to do except return to the castle and make what i could of the rest of my life next day i searched for the path again trying to track my own footprints back but there was nothing i realized that it was foolish to seek something magical a mortal could never find such a thing without the help of a magic creature yet i kept trying day after day until finally my heart realized what my mind did and i gave up the effort but for some time thereafter i cried myself to sleep i dont know why it didnt occur to me to find my way directly to the dryads tree by my original route perhaps there was a spell on me to make me miss the obvious but that may not have been feasible anyway because i really hadnt paid attention when trying to run away from home doofus dragon had taken me he had found his way home but was too stupid to find his way anywhere else he would be as likely to take me in the opposite direction and i would hardly know the difference so i suffered at home and told no one not even my twin sister lacuna who after all would understand i didnt understand my self all i knew was that i wanted to see desiree again i didnt know why or what i would say to her i just wanted to be with her even if she fed me more finger matoes in fact i found that i had developed a taste for them and for unadulterated spring water especially from green grassy pools and for the sight of acom trees in their autumn col ors for desiree was a dryad a nymph associated with a tree she resembled the things of the forest and her hair surely changed color with the seasons i had known about geis of the gargoyle dryads of course but now i cared one might wonder why i didnt seek some other dryad and the answer is that not all trees have dryads they are relatively scarce in any event it was only this one dryad i wanted to be with no other in fact i was in love but too young to know it desiree had fascinated me in the nicest possible way she had shown me her beauty and i was destined to remember her as she had said for the rest of my life time passed and i became a man i was as i had ex pected handsome and the girls did flock around me but the memory of the girl in the wood made all of them un interesting not one of them came close to matching desiree none of them possessed that first wild beauty that only i could see it was as if the dryads face was super imposed on the face of any girl i saw a model for compar ison representing perfection and in each case the mortal face deviated and was imperfect the same was true of their bodies all seemed gross and unfinished like sculp tures that had been done by an unskilled artisan they turned me off so while i would have liked to marry i just could not i did not even want to touch any ordinary girl as time passed my mother and sister became con cerned my mother tried to be delicate about her concern but my sister lacuna was blunt a line of print appeared on the table before me dont you like girls that was the question i like one girl i told them i just cant find her then they had the story from me my mother was ap palled a dryad how could you i didnt know it was going to happen i said she was just a woman to me an adult treating me like a child she asked me what i was going to do with my life when i grew up and i told her and she flashed her beauty at me and vanished you told her about your low opinion of women my sister said accusingly that all were good for us to wash dishes and clean house piers anthony well sure its true isnt it millie and lacuna exchanged a glance that was almost two and a half glances long then my sister resumed so she decided that maybe you werent going to be xanths gift to womankind so you shouldnt marry so she saw to it that you wouldnt and you arent i began to understand desiree was for all her nymphly nature a woman then i guess im doomed to bachelor hood i said because there isnt any mortal woman i want to marry but by this point i wished that desiree had never looked at me that way flashing her loveliness she had indeed doomed any future romance i might oth erwise have had no mortal woman would have to suffer through my attitude millie sighed there seems to be no help for it you will simply have to find her how much i would like to do that but how i cant find the path and its no good searching for every acom tree in xanth lacuna said you could go right by it and never see her because she wouldnt show herself but i looked carefully at her tree i protested i would know it if i saw it and i know the general area its southeast of here the distance doofus can go in a run then perhaps there is a chance ride doofus there then grow some ears and eyes and make them tell you what they have heard and seen i never thought of that i exclaimed because she didnt want you to lacuna said she wanted you to remember her but not where she was but now time has passed and the peripheral magic is wearing off so you have a notion but she still may not show her self if you do locate her tree if i found the tree id just go there and beg her to join me i said shed have to listen and if she didnt lacuna said wickedly you could threaten to chop down her tree geis of the gargoyle i felt as if a shaft had pierced my heart oh no i could never do that i could never hurt her i love her i didnt say to do it she retorted i said to threaten to to make her appear i couldnt even threaten her i said still feeling pained very well no threats millie said decisively but you can at least try to locate the tree maybe shell appear when you ask her to she doesnt sound like a bad sort in deed i rather understand her attitude if you locate her and apologize perhaps shell relent she focused on me frowning but you have to understand that a dryad cant leave her tree normally she has to be in it or near it so if you want to be with desiree and if shes willing you will have to stay there too i dont care where i am so long as its with her i said so we organized the search and i rode doofus southeast as far as he could go the region began to look familiar i got excited thinking my quest was going to be success ful but then came disaster something none of us had an ticipated the dryads tree was in a region of high magic in fact it was not far from the region of madness where there was so much magic that things went crazy i discovered that the madness had expanded or shifted perhaps be cause of a change in the prevailing winds and now the dryads section of forest was within it i knew better but such was my desire for desiree that i entered the fringe of madness hoping to find her naturally i got hopelessly lost and fouled up i encountered a limbbow which looked like a branch of a tree with ribbons in fact all the branches of all the trees here were like ribbons tied into huge bows they seemed harmless until they started to untie themselves and reach for me then i ran back the way i had come but i was lost the more i ran the less familiar things seemed so i forced myself to pause because i was after piers anthony all no longer a child i decided to grow an ear on a boul der and an eye so that i could inquire the way out and the eye could look in the proper direction but to my horror i discovered that i could not grow either ear or eye instead the rock formed a vile purple excrescence with waving green tentacles what was the matter this had never hap pened to me before then i heard a voice it sounded rather wooden but this was after all a forest i went toward it and discovered a man standing under a chair addressing an empty glade meeting will come to order he was saying firmly meeting will come to order i didnt want to interrupt the meeting but there just wasnt any meeting here so i entered the glade and ap proached the man hoping he could advise me on the best way out of here then i stopped so suddenly i almost fell on my face for this was no ordinary man he was not standing under a chair his top was a chair the chair was there instead of his head i tried to back away but he saw me i told you to come to order he snapped one of the rungs of his head making an emphatic pop as it snapped uh sorry i said hastily sitting on a stump who are you i am the chairman of course he said now that you are here the meeting is in session but i was only looking for the way out i said the exit is that way he said pointing meeting ad journed i got up and started in the direction more than eager to get out thank you wait the chairman called have you paid the stump age fee i paused uncertain what would happen if i didnt the what you sat on a stump there is a stumpage fee of course i didnt care to argue what would a stump want geis of the gargoyle surely not anything human i checked my pockets and found a twig that must have snagged when i was charging heedlessly through the brush and had broken off i brought it out and tossed it toward the stump here it is i said then i turned and ran out of the glade and the chairman did not challenge me again but i was not yet out of the woods i almost stumbled over another chair but this was no ordinary chair it was made out of human arms you must be related to the chairman i said trying to edge around it of course i am it said i am going to attend the meeting it occurred to me that it was odd to have such a chair talk but of course the chairman had talked too so it must be all right the meeting is in that glade behind me i said thank you the armchair wiggled the fingers on those of its arms that pointed down and fingerwalked to ward the glade but then it paused are you by any chance trying to get out of here it asked yes i said how did you know no offense but you are such a peculiar creature that i knew you didnt belong here but since you were courte ous enough to help me on my way i will help you on yours you will need to don a coat of arms in order to get out of here a coat of arms i asked blankly yes it is hard to depart this region if you arent suit ably armed and you have only two arms theres a coat hanging behind you don that and you should be all right i looked behind me and almost leaped out of my shoes there was a mass of arms almost touching me but i realized that this was no ordinary situation so i nerved myself and took hold of the mass the arms were linked forming a clumsy kind of jacket i put this on over my shoulders it was heavy but not uncomfortable thank you i told the armchair i moved on in the direction i hoped was out but the piers anthony brush and foliage closed in so thickly that it seemed im possible to proceed then my coat of arms began to react the arms writhed and reached out all around me grabbing branches nettles thorns spikes and unidentified obstacles and pushing bending twisting shoving and hauling them out of my way i walked forward into the opening cleared in this fashion and soon was beyond the otherwise impen etrable thicket thank you coat of arms i said gratefully glancing down but now my coat was merely woven of sticks and twigs i was baffled for a moment then realized what had hap pened the coat had lost its special magic that meant that i was out of the region of madness the coat of arms had given up its animation to get me through i took it off being careful not to damage anything i shall do for you what you did for me i said i shall re turn you to your environment then i heaved it back the way i had come i saw it fall to the ground but as it landed it changedto a mass of human legs it was now a coat of legs maybe the wind had shifted inside the madness bringing a different flavor of magic one leg kicked up in what looked like a wave then the coat ran on into the thicket so i had managed to win clear of the madness but it was clear that i had been fortunate i knew better than to enter it again the mad things within it might not be as friendly next time so i could not reach desiree that grieved me but i knew when i was beaten with heavy heart i faced back toward home and so it remained for some time as i was resigned to being a bachelor the rest of my life until my sister went to see the good magician humfrey and got retroactively married and with a family she had become rather dowdy in her thirties but now she was busy and happy hi i have a great idea she told me why dont you go see geis of the gargoyle the good magician and ask him how to find desiree dryad but he charges a years service i protested its an awful nuisance just to get in to see him and his answers are so cryptic you wish you hadnt bothered but hes always right she said she had a point so i went to see humfrey it was in deed a nuisance getting in and he didnt even give me an answer he just told me to go home and wait for my quest which would serve in lieu of my years service what quest i asked surprise he said and he would say no more so here i wait disgruntled and unsatisfied waiting for the surprise i dont suppose you know what it could be madness surprise surprise exclaimed suddenly taking note of the discussion that does seem to be the answer gary said the good magician told you to wait for your quest and you thought he meant it would be a surprise instead it is this child named surprise who is with us i must tutor her as i pursue my own quest so come with us and we will try to unravel the good magicians mystery hiatus shook his head bemused a child this is a sur prise but it must be so and it must be that desiree knows where to find the philter iris said so we will help you find her and she will help us find it meanwhile well all help surprise learn selfcontrol teaching her what is needful needle the child cried her eyes crossing a slew or two of needles appeared piling up on the floor in the shape of an evergreen tree they smelled fresh and trailed green threads yes dear pine needles iris said carefully pulling geis of the gargoyle some of them out of the hem of her skirt however the word was needful not needle oh the needles disappeared why cant the child be tutored at home hiatus asked cause im out of control surprise said happily so i get to go on a venture an adventure yes iris agreed warily now perhaps we should be off before someone gets bored board surprise exclaimed and the boards of the board meeting appeared on the floor on the back of one of them was printed the word education and on another board was room and the others said circuit across the and surf it seemed to be a convoluted discussion exactly gary said they had to keep things interest ing or the child would make them become so in her own fashion hiatus at first evincing astonishment was starting to catch on but he surely did not yet understand the whole of it because all surprise had done recently was conjure things yes lets go but i thought you would like to visit for a while millie protested we would iris said but its not s a f e essay effeesurprise cried her eyes crossing a scroll appeared on which was written an essay consisting entirely of the word effee repeated endlessly now millie pursed her lips appreciating the possible awkwardness of the childs continuing presence but if you really must be going we must hiatus agreed they bundled out of the castle they were now a party of four and their adventure could not be delayed i wouldnt think of complaining iris remarked as they rode their beasts but i cant say i truly enjoy being on a zombie cameleopard some crossbreeds are weirder than others crossbreed surprise exclaimed suddenly she was a piers anthony merchild her tail making riding awkward so she became a harpy chick but her birds legs werent much of an im provement so she became a reverse naga child with the head of a snake and the legs of a human being it seemed that her current talent was the ability to assume the form of any human crossbreed real or imagined i believe your regular form will prove to be more com fortable dear iris said mildly the childs regular form reappeared gary agreed with iris about the awkwardness of their steeds but did not care to make an issue of it after all the zombie master was trying to be nice by providing them with transportation to the region of madness so they wouldnt wear themselves out walking why not hiatus inquired from his zombie unicorn they behave well and they get the job done but theyre a bit icky im getting ick on the seat of my skirt i wish we could dehydrate them a bit dehydrate surprise exclaimed from her zombie werecat steed crossing her eyes suddenly the creature dried up unfortunately since it was mostly made of vis cous ick this meant that it shriveled into bones and pow der and became useless ixnay dear iris said quickly gary was impressed with her emotional control she had not wanted to take care of a child but was doing a fine job considering the severe challenge of it he had not wanted to associate with her but was coming to realize that she was invaluable its not nice to dry up the zombies they dont like it you had better ride with me she hauled the little girl up on the cameleopard but i saw that child do conjuring hiatus said she cant be doing other magic um maybe best not to mention gary started other magic surprise exclaimed she became a girl sized teddy bear but thats prince dolphs talent of selftransformation hiatus said she cant do that geis of the gargoyle maybe you had better change back dear iris said gently you wouldnt want to get stuck in that form now would you and the girl changed back she can do surprising things gary explained quietly we try not to encourage it because change something else surprise inquired she looked at a nearby pillow bush and the pillows became stones and sank to the ground but this cant be hiatus protested in vain nobody has multiple talents nobody has controlled multiple talents iris clarified surprise has uncontrolled talents we need to make her leam how to bring them under control meanwhile surprise looked crosseyed at the pillow stones and they became invisible hiatus managed to con trol his gape realizing that it was true surprise had wild talents ive never seen anything like this hiatus said such varied talents shes a little sorceress sorceress the child echoed her hair changed color and quality matching iris after a bit hiatus recovered enough to explore the mat ter she does seem to have some control he said sur prise can you cut any of that corn for they were now passing a field where corn wheat oats and barley grew i wouldnt iris started sure surprise cried her eyes crossing the entire field of plants fell flat all of them had been invisibly cut down youre a cereal killer hiatus said amazed anew can you even transform thats enough iris cried alarmed for excellent rea son sure surprise said a bunny that was watching them abruptly turned to stone hiatus who wasnt strong mentally opened his mouth to say more but gary cut in before him can you muffle him he asked surprise piers anthony sure her eyes crossed and a muffler appeared on hi atus head effectively silencing him then the child bored dropped off to sleep in the manner only the young could manage gary and iris were finally able to relax somewhat you know i craved youth and adventure and ro mance iris remarked i got the youth and am getting the adventure but not of precisely the type i had envi sioned romance gary asked whats that thats when a boy and girl get together and find each other intriguing she said sending him an intriguing glance gary however being ignorant of the matter let the glance fly right past him without effect i thought old married human folk didnt do any of that true she said and my marriage to magician trent was political rather than romantic he never loved me he just wanted me under control so he married me she frowned it was an effective tactic we just barely man aged to summon the stork that brought our daughter irene i always knew i had missed something vital i know exactly how that is hiatus said so now that im young again and on an adventure i mean to make up for what i missed before this is my sig nificant opportunity but arent you still married to magician trent gary asked i mean even if it isnt romantic doesnt your kind disapprove of any other associations i married trent when i was fortyone years old she said grimly of course i made myself look like this suddenly she was clothed in illusion and had the appear ance of a splendidly curvaceous human woman of about thirty years age with a golden crown and gemstudded robe somewhat open in front to reveal the top halves of very full breasts gary found the outfit interesting he could identify the gems as striped diamonds green rubies blue emeralds geis of the gargoyle firewater opals and other more exotic stones fascinat ing he remarked staring thank you iris said inhaling the robe fell farther open unfortunately that caused the intriguing stones to be harder to see there was too much dull flesh in the way but now i am twentythree and in that sense wont be married for another eighteen years i consider myself free to seek romance she darted another glance at him but this one also missed its mark then there was a swirl of smoke before them any thing interesting happening it inquired nothing at all mentia gary said immediately i can tell when youre fibbing gargoyle the demon ess said assuming her usual shape demoness surprise exclaimed awakening and turned into swirling smoke stop that iris cried distraught even mentia paused for a moment her shape distorting as she forgot to focus you have a demon child surprises smoke became a smaller replica of mentia teehee she laughed just wild talents iris said you wouldnt be inter ested mentia got back into shape can you do this she asked the child making one eye small and the other huge surprise matched me expression after first crossing her eyes how about this the demoness swelled to twice her normal size but retained her proportions surprise swelled to four times her size matching the de moness perfectly now there were two voluptuous human female figures floating above the path um iris began oh come on im not going to hurt her mentia said frowning and the figure beside her frowned similarly were just having fun well rejoin you in a while maybe its all right gary murmured especially since we cant stop them geis of the gargoyle piers anthony iris was quick on the uptake very well be back in an hour that put her effectively in control of the situation she had given permission come on surprise mentia said lets go sail over the mountaintop she zoomed away and the duplicate figure followed giggling iris turned to the others this is even chancier than i thought if that child gets lost or hurt well be responsi ble i know gary said but until we figure out a way to get her under control we have no choice but to play along at least this will keep the child entertained for an hour and maybe after that shell be tired enough to sleep i see your problem hiatus said that childs a real handful just as you and your sister were in your day iris said grimly i know i really regret that in retrospect we both made up for it by becoming vacuously dull adults how ever meanwhile gary had been looking around i think we have a problem he said are we getting lost iris looked no were just passing through a tall corn field well be beyond it in a moment but it seems like a puzzle gary said its not cornits maize hiatus said we should have gone around it maize iris exclaimed youre right were lost in its puzzle indeed they seemed to be stuck in a confusing ar ray of paths between rows of corn that looped around leading nowhere i can find the way through hiatus said ill grow eyes on all the stalks and theyll spy the way out he rode around and wherever he passed eyes appeared and noses to sniff the way out he added and noses also sprouted and mouths to tell us the way out soon his ploy was effective out out said a mouth and they went to it and then to the next outmouth ignor ing those that said no way no way it seemed that the organs hiatus grew were able to communicate with each other perhaps in some sniffing or blinking code so the mouths knew it didnt take long to emerge from the maize i must admit hiatus your talent has its uses iris said it is my hope to do enough useful tilings to make up for the mischievous ones i did as a child hiatus said thats probably impossible she said but a worthy ambition they rode on making better time now that they didnt have to be watching surprise because of this they soon approached the region of madness gary could tell be cause the terrain ahead became weird the trees had green trunks and brown leaves and the forest animals seemed to be rooted to the ground hiatus gazed at that and gulped thats the madness all right its different from when i was here last but i suppose it does keep changing ii really dont feel much like trying to go in there i am not exactly sanguine about it either iris said particularly not with a wild child like surprise suddenly i grasp something i didnt quite understand hiatus said her talents arent uncontrolledshe is precisely she seems to be able to do what she chooses but shes a child she doesnt see the point in be having perfectly we have to persuade her that there is a point thats why gary was assigned to tutor her and i still have no idea how gary said its bad enough being in manform and that confusion makes it worse manform hiatus asked remember im a stone gargoyle magician trent transformed me for this quest and i think wont transform me back until i complete it so i really have to accomplish it a gargoyle hiatus echoed iris told me but i forgot we are an unusual group indeed piers anthony with an impossible mission iris said i think humfrey overreached himself on this one two clouds of smoke appeared before them were baaack the larger one said it was fuuun the smaller one said it is just as well that you returned before we entered the region of madness iris said oh do you have to go there the larger magic cloud asked shaping into mentia its a mean place the smaller magic cloud said two eyelike swiris crossing before it shaped into surprise we didnt dare go in so there was a region the demoness avoided gary made a mental note in case the information should ever be use ful its where desiree dryad is iris said we have to find her youll get lost the demoness said everythings weird in there how well i know hiatus said but how can we find her if we dont go in mentia considered you might ask the fringe dwellers the what gary asked richard and janet surprise said we met them theyre nice they are human beings iris asked uncertainly sure the child said they live right next to the mad ness and sometimes the wind changes and sweeps it across them so they know what its like gary exchanged two glances with iris and hiatus maybe theyll know something useful he said both iris and hiatus looked relieved yes lets consult first with them iris said they turned the zombie animals and traveled beside the madness rather than into it but the boundary wasnt smooth filaments of madness reached out from it and there were cracks extending into it they stayed suitably clear because any stray breeze could mischievously move geis of the gargoyle the madness across them they could see plants turning weird as the filaments passed them they came to a giant gourd rotting at the edges thats a hypnogourd hiatus exclaimed stopping before its giant peephole shielding his eyes a zombie gourd i didnt know there was one here why not iris asked shielding her own eyes so that she couldnt get locked into its spell with mad magic anything can happen thats rightit must have grown in the madness and then the madness retreated a bit and left the gourd out here i must tell my father when i return home because he can use it to travel travel gary asked as a stone gargoyle he hadnt worried about gourds but now he took the cue from the others and did not look directly at the peephole a person can walk into one and walk out another one on the far side of xanth if he knows the route through hiatus explained my father marks routes so he can use them safely but i thought it was the dream realm inside the gourd gary said that people couldnt enter them phys ically they can when the gourds are big enough hiatus as sured him but its not smart to do it without a marked route because the dream realm is well its a lot like the madness anything can happen there was a rattle near their feet then a snake ap peared biting the leg of the cameleopard the creature leaped shaking off the snake which quickly slithered into the gourd oh now ive lost my steed iris said irritated but the cameleopard did not collapse instead it seemed to be healthier than before oh its one of those hiatus said its bite cures zombies they hate that instead of killing zombies it makes them alive gary asked amazed why i know someone who would love to be bitten piers anthony his said zora zombie shes almost alive as it is i must tell her before i return to the caves her husband xavier will be pleased too a zombie married a live man gary asked well zora wasnt very far gone iris explained and shes remarkably well preserved for her condition they moved on leaving the giant gourd behind his cameleopard was stepping along with renewed vigor be ing now completely alive gary was sure iris appreciated the fact that it was no longer icky as the day waned they reached the house where rich ard and janet lived it was a neat cottage surrounded by clusters of toadstools and flowers why those are irises his exclaimed delighted and really fancy ones too they dismounted and approached the cottage hey folks come on out mentia called appearing a man appeared in the doorway oh its the lady de mon again he said and the demon child and some real live folk too surprise said turning smoky and floating up to join mentia a woman joined the man in the doorway then both stepped out hello the man said im richard and this is my wife janet were from mundania originally but we like it better here are you native folk yes his said stepping forward i am the sorceress his and these are gary and hiatus we dont mean to bother you but we thought you might help us locate some thing we understand you know something about whats behind the veil of madness we really havent been in xanth long janet protested only a year or soits hard to remember exactly i couldnt see very well at first and i havent traveled so im afraid i wont be of much help i havent traveled either richard said only far enough to explore the immediate surroundings and to meet janet but i have talked with folk who travel through and exchanged stories with them perhaps i will have heard of something useful to you geis of the gargoyle we are looking for desiree dryad gary said shes a tree nymph we hope she will know where to find a phil ter janet brightened oh yes we met her not long ago when the madness shifted away from her tree we try to stay clear of the madness richard ex plained its weird in diere weird a voice exclaimed as two clouds of smoke ap peared one smaller than the other oh the madness is returning janet said alarmed no those are the other two members of our party iris said grimacing theyre already weird she addressed the clouds mentia surprise shape up for a formal intro duction the woman form and girl form took form for the formal introduction im the demoness mentia im a lit tle crazy im surprise golem im out of control so nice to meet you formally janet said doubtfully would you like something to eat richard asked all we have at the moment are orangebemes but they are tasty he stepped into the house and brought out a bowl of orange berries i want an icecream berry surprise said i would find some if i could richard saidthen stared for the child was holding a chocolateshelled icecream berry and licking it with gusto gary was coming to appreciate the uses of diplomacy perhaps the others would like some icecream berries too he suggested oh sure surprise said her eyes crossed suddenly the bowl richard held was filled with chocolatecovered icecream berries she can change one fruit to another richard said surprised among other things gary agreed we had better eat these before they melt piers anthony they did so each berry was a different flavor under the chocolate but all were good you inquired about desiree dryad richard said her tree is within range when the madness shifts away but most of the time its in the madness shes not happy about that what does it do to her hiatus asked with restraint he was surely excited about this but afraid to hope too much nothing to her directly janet said but it affects her tree and therefore her indirectly it gives her tree square roots and they dont work well so the tree suffers if it werent for the occasional periods of unmadness that tree might have died by now died hiatus cried anguished richard and janet looked perplexed he met desiree before the madness came iris explained he loves her but cant reach her because of the madness but tree nymphs dont usually marry ordinary men richard said they just like to tease them if they show themselves at all they dont like adults they relate best to children children surprise exclaimed her eyes crossed but for once nothing happened she was already a child but how could you talk to desiree if she wont meet adults gary asked were somewhat childlike about xanth janet said blushing it is taking us time to believe much of what we see we didnt know desiree was different until she told us i think she was a bit lonely after the madness rich ard said disoriented maybe when she saw how little we knew she was glad to talk but her tree is suffering we wish we could help her but wed just get lost in the madness so we visit only when it clears when it comes here we hide in the house and hardly move janet said fortunately it usually doesnt stay geis of the gargoyle long usually we can sleep through it though our dreams are weird it sounds as if the madness is constantly changing gary said what makes it move the wind mostly richard said a storm will blow it across and then the wind from the opposite direction can clear it so were very careful about the weather sometimes we wish we could control the weather janet said but of course no one can do that weather surprise said suddenly there was a swirl of cloud above her head it expanded into a tiny storm with little lightning jags that struck the ground and made stray dry leaves jump then it rained over a small area i see i still have things to learn about xanth richard said i had somehow gotten the notion that each person had only a single talent iris smiled somewhat wanly thats a notion quite a number of us had it seems to be a general rule but not an absolute one as is the case with the nonrepetition of tal ents talents do repeat on occasion and now it seems that they can also come in bunches surprise seems to have just one talent at a time but that can be almost anything she chooses we are trying to encourage her to use her magic wisely rather than for mere fun and mischief but so far with imperfect success gary had a notion suppose surprise made a storm to blow the madness away from desirees tree im not sure that would be wise richard said storms are unpredictable it could bring more madness in or get you trapped in it when you thought it was clear and the effect wouldnt last unless she could exert a more thorough control of the elements of the weather hiatus said to change the ac tual climate here so that the madness would stay away iris shook her head as she glanced at the child who was inspecting the irises sure enough one of them had sprouted an eye making it an eyeris it was not wise to let the child get bored she would never have the pa piers anthony tience her attention span is very brief shes a little tom boy boy surprise exclaimed overhearing part of it and suddenly she was a crosseyed little boy richard whistled soundlessly that is one remarkable child understatement of the month iris muttered i think we had better move on before she causes more mischief here well have to brave the madness what direction is desirees tree that way richard said pointing but i wish you would reconsider about going into the madness i know what you mean hiatus said but we seem not to have much choice ill grow some noses on the trees to point the way from each nearby trunk sprouted a human nose or other projection pointing the direction richard had indicated gary had seen hiatus talent in operation before but was impressed they looked around for their zombie steeds but those had wandered away they wouldnt care to enter the madness anyway hiatus said best just to let them go home come child iris said briskly to the surprise boy who was searching out slugs and snails when he ignored her she put out a hand to catch his armbut her hand passed right through his body he had become intangible in the manner of a demon oh for pitys sake iris said suddenly a gargoyle ap peared before the boy opening its mouth as if to spew out clean water im coming surprise cried back in her natural gen der and solidity iris illusion had frightened her into com pliance but gary wondered how long that would be effective they needed to find a better way to control the child they bid goodbye to richard and janet and followed the noses surprise soon got bored with walking and geis of the gargoyle adapted her arms into wings she flapped them vigorously until she lifted into the air but then she was unsteady so she tried to sprout a tail her clothing got in the way so she landed reverted her arms to normal then stretched them far ahead so they could grab on to a sapling after that she let them spring elastically short again hauling her rapidly forward but then she stumbled and fell scraping her little knees and let out a wail it shaped itself into the cloudy image of a huge sea creature and swam away jet ting a gaseous fountain into the air we need some healing elixir iris said in a matterof fact tone i dont have any hiatus said gary found a puddle of water he scooped up a double handful this was one thing his natural body couldnt do please change this to healing elixir he said to surprise the child only glanced at it but he felt a change in his hands all their little abrasions had suddenly faded he splashed some of the elixir onto the childs scraped knees and they instantly healed after this just make yourself stronger iris suggested without any great store of sympathy gee yes surprise agreed she jumped up her mus cles suddenly stronger i see a funny bug she said look ing ahead the others looked but all they saw was a small tree some distance away where gary asked on the top branch of that tree they walked to the tree there on the top branch was a tiny bug i hear a funny bird where gary asked again way up in the sky she said pointing they looked after a moment a shape appeared wing ing toward them it was a bird and as it passed overhead it fluted pleasantly making an unusual melody she strengthened her sight and hearing along with her muscles iris said as if this were ordinary gary knew piers anthony why she was afraid that if she made anything of it the child would do something even wilder they came to the edge of the madness they could tell by the line of weirdness ahead the trees had regular noses mouths or ears on them but at the fringe of mad ness the projection looked like some kind of machine there were even little wheels and pistons on it moving what is that gary inquired it was supposed to be an ear hiatus said now its an engine so its an engine ear iris said impatiently now are we plunging into this madness or are we hesitating some more mentia appeared are you actually going to do it she asked this should really be interesting you lead the way demoness iris said grimly well follow no you lead and ill follow mentia said im a lit tle crazy not a lot crazy well go together gary said suffering a fit of deci sion he grabbed mentias hand with one of his and iris hand with the other after an additional flicker of hesita tion mentia took hiatus hand and iris took surprises hand the five of them stepped forward linked garys breath caught there was air but it seemed dif ferent the wrong color or sound it was as if he were look ing down from the bottom of a pool or up from the top of a mountain the landscape had a bulgy curving shape as if he were looking through the eye of a fish when he took a step forward it was as if he were zooming a long way while hardly moving at all he turned to look at mentia on his left she looked composed since a person would have to be slightly crazy to be at ease in this madness that made sense he looked at iris to his right she was clothed in illusion looking middleaged perhaps in the confusion forgetting that her physical form was now much younger they let go of each others hands and looked at each geis of the gargoyle other this is different than it was before hiatus said not as bad maybe its the luck of the draw iris said uncertainly draw surprise said crossing her eyes she picked up a thin stick and drew a figure in the dirt it was of course a stick figure with a balloon head i wouldnt hiatus began but of course he was too late the stick figure jumped off the dirt leaving the ground bare behind it surprise drew a simple house in the manner of her age just a square with a door and windows and a peaked roof she put her free hand to it and lifted it up it was like a wire figure two dimensional but firm she drew an ani mal with a boxlike body four stick legs a curl of a tail and a round head with two ears sticking up it bounded out of the picture and away having height and length but no depth has her talent changed hiatus asked its hard to tell gary said we didnt see that partic ular talent outside of the madness we had better move on iris said hiatus grow some more noses so we can follow the direction hiatus concentrated things appeared on the trees those arent noses hiatus said i had noticed iris said nose hairs perhaps hiatus went to inspect the nearest one this looks more like a root he said ill try again this time round flat green things appeared on the trunks i think those are leaves gary said leave surprise cried oh no you dont iris said snatching the little girls hand but gary saw that she would have been too late if surprise had used magic to depart her eyes had already crossed instead of leaving the girl had stayed that sug gested that her magic was fouled up just as hiatus magic was piers anthony geis of the gargoyle but i cant grow leaves on things hiatus said dis mayed it seems you can now in the madness mentia said it seems like a reasonable talent but ive always grown ears noses mouths and eyes hiatus said what will i do with leaves leaves leaves leaves who cares iris snapped fleas fleas fleas surprise cried suddenly there were cracks all through the ground where they stood those arent fleas hiatus pointed out theyre flaws so her talent is changed gary said she tried for fleas and got flaws the madness has changed our talents what about yours i dont have one in this form in my natural form id probably be polluting water instead of purifying it what about mentia my talents are inherent the demoness said i can still do the usual demonly things but you dont seem crazy oh she said appalled youre right im perfectly sane this is awful shall we get on with our journey iris demanded im patiently then she forged ahead on her own but maybe shes a little crazy now hiatus muttered they proceeded through a region that wasnt as bad as they had feared perhaps because this was actually the fringe of the region of madness where the effects were not really intense there was silence for a time as they passed through a field of deafodils and then they had to dodge to avoid a group of hopping plants which turned out to be rabbits foot ferns and then they had to duck out of sight lest they be caught by a mad dentist who was deter mined to dent anything he could find the brassies must really hate him hiatus remarked as the sound of denting moved on beyond theyre made of brass and dents re ally spoil their appearance they should hate this too gary said for now they encountered several metal sheep who were grazing on ironwood leaves and twigs and on ironweed they were covered with steel wool at last they came to the dryads tree they could tell it was the right one because the roots and leaves that sprouted from trcetrunks in lieu of ears and noses led right to it there was a somewhat haggard nymph resting against the trees base desiree hiatus cried i have found her at last see how beautiful she is gary iris mentia and surprise exchanged a combina tion of glances beautiful the nymph was hardly that in her present state i think we have a problem iris murmured and the others nodded agreement ruins but hiatus was already plunging ahead and they had to follow desiree he cried i have found you at last the nymph saw him and tried to hide but both she and the tree were so gaunt that there was no way so she leaned against the twisted trunk and faced him with weak resignation please pass on by stranger she said i have no dealings with adults dont you know me im hiatus desiree looked blank im sorry but i dont know you or your companions please go away because i am very shy i look awful i dont have the strength to turn invis ible and im afraid youll hurt my tree iris stepped in let me introduce myself im the sor ceress iris with the power of illusion she made the scene change so that the forest seemed to become a vast grimy dump oh thats not what i meant she said the scene changed to a bleak plain nor that whats the mat ter with me i wanted a nice meadow your talent is being fouled up by the madness just as geis of the gargoyle the other talents are mentia said try making a horrible scene ill make hell itself iris said heaven formed around them a lovely place with sculptured cloudbanks and soft music in the background what the sorceress was about to say is that we are a party on a special quest mentia told the dryad perhaps she can enable you to look as you once did dont bother with me desiree said beautify my tree iris focused on the tree it worsened becoming a rotting column the nymph was a hideous crone oops then the tree turned beautiful with a rich brown trunk and enor mously spreading crown of leaves the nymph was radi antly lovely gary realized that desiree was a reflection of her tree prospering or suffering as it did even when only in illusion now it was clear how anyone could have fallen instantly in love with her for she was as pretty as the hu man form could be he was a gargoyle who hardly appre ciated beauty but maybe the madness was interfering with that because the dryad definitely looked appealing and what hiatus is trying to say mentia continued with perfect sanity is that he was a child of eleven or twelve when he met you twentyseven years ago oh then desiree said but now he is grown thats different you told me that i would never see a girl as lovely as you hiatus reminded her and i never have so you are the one i want to marry marry desiree exclaimed appalled dryads dont marry especially not mortals but you i never promised to marry anyone she said with all the firmness of her present appearance i merely said you would never see a mortal girl quite as fair hiatus seemed somewhat discommoded but i thought shes right iris said nowhere in your story of her piers anthony did she say that she had any intention of marrying you or even of seeing you again she was just teasing you but butt surprise exclaimed crossing her eyes a bunch of balloonlike faces appeared and floated away her magic had been diverted upward by the madness it occurred to gary that this was probably just as well its what dryads do mentia said just as demonesses do teasing foolish men is amusing because they are so readily deluded by appearance they dont care about sub stance at all i do care about substance hiatus protested i want to hug her and kiss her and feel her substance against me what about her personality iris asked her what point made mentia said hiatus im afraid your dream is as empty as your own personality the dryad isnt interested in you but theres no one else he said plaintively she spoiled me for any mortal woman as she intended to mentia agreed soberly there must be some way he said mentia shrugged is there some way she asked the dryad no way desiree said a way surprise cried making her expression the dryads tree glowed what way hiatus asked the child save her tree mentia turned back to desiree would you marry hia tus if he saved your tree i would do anything no matter how awful to save my tree the dryad said because without my tree i will cease to exist there you have it iris said with a third of a smile save her tree hiatus and she will do the awful thing of marrying you geis of the gargoyle then ill save her tree he said enthusiastically how do i do that make the madness go away desiree said since the madness came my tree has wilted and lost its leaves its roots have turned square im afraid it will die if the mad ness doesnt go away soon how do i do that i wish i knew desiree said sadly the madness has been expanding and taking up more territory than it used to i saw it coming but i hoped someone would stop it every year it was closer until finally it got here and my poor tree started suffering then it must be more than just the vagaries of the wind mentia said there must be more madness than there used to be but the madness is merely the intensification of magic near where the magic dust emerges from the ground iris said it should dissipate as it gets carried away intensification gary asked shouldnt that mean you can do your magic better it should but for some reason it doesnt it just fouls things up this doesnt seem to make much sense gary said mentia nodded agreement nothing makes much sense in the region of madness then i suppose we should just get on with the quest gary decided ill at ease he didnt like leaving the dryad to her fate but saw no alternative but we need desirees help for that hiatus reminded him why else would the good magician have put us to gether so gary spoke to the dryad i need to find the philter do you know where it is not exactly she said i understand its in the ruins beyond a veil in ruins gary exclaimed i need a good philter not a broken one piers anthony in the ruins she said mentia clarified beyond a vale veil desiree said mentia frowned whatever where are the ruins then i used to know before the madness changed every thing desiree said then how can you help me gary asked i could show you the path to the fallen giant what good would that do he may know where the ruins are he blundered around a good deal before falling then show me the path to the giant what deal will you make what do you mean what deal he demanded frus trated if i help you you should help me in return oh what deal do you want save my tree i dont know how to save your tree i cant make the madness go away mentia stepped in again rationally we do not know that desirees information will truly help you find the phil ter she pointed out the giant may not remember where the ruins are or we may not find the philter at the ruins we simply have to take the effectiveness of her help on faith which makes it an even worse deal gary said it is also true that you do not know how to save her tree the sane demoness continued so you can not agree to do that however you can reasonably promise to try to find a way just as she can reasonably give you informa tion that may help your quest this seems like a fair deal why so it does iris said you each try to help the other without being certain of success gary looked at the dryad does that make sense to geis of the gargoyle im not a man at all im a gargoyle in manfonn oh then its all right gargoyles are very constant but if gary saves her tree she wont marry me hi atus protested gary will try mentia said reasonably you will try whoever first succeeds will have his reward and desiree has two chances to survive but if you fail and gary succeeds would you prefer to see her tree die rather than be saved his way hiatus looked stricken no of course not i want her and her tree to prosper even if i dont the dryad glanced at him surprised the first faint flicker of maidenly interest crossed her face then i will undertake to try to find a way to save your tree gary said the path is over there she said pointing but thats just a tangle of nettles i trust her hiatus said he marched into the nettles and through them without getting snagged meanwhile the second flicker of interest touched the dryad as the illusion surrounding her faded and she and her tree turned gaunt again the others followed him and lo there was a paa there gary was the last to go ill try he repeated i have no idea what will help but ill try to find it and bring it back to you thank you she called and her tree almost seemed to wave a branch though that was probably just from a breeze after a suitably maddening trek they stumbled across the giant that was because he was invisible as most giants of xanth were he was lying on the ground his huge outline roughly marked by the foliage that was start ing to grow around him ahoy there giant mentia called where is your head piers anthony over here the giant responded the brush was so thick that they could not get through it so they scrambled up onto the giants leg and walked toward his distant head now they seemed to be floating though they were as solid as ever because they were half the height of the surrounding trees with only air showing beneath them actually it wasnt air but giant flesh it would have been scary if the leg werent so solid to touch the giant was enormously huge they reached the chest which was rising and falling with the quakelike fluxes of his breath and concluded that this was close enough are you injured his asked no merely confused the big headshaped space re plied with a gust of warm wind that smelled as if it had crossed a burning landfill on a bad day i cant find my way out of this madness so im resting im jethro giant were a party consisting of a demoness a gargoyle a child a sorceress and an ordinary man iris said were looking for the ruins i lumbered through there jethro said just follow my footprints back did you see a veil mentia asked its not a vale its more like a plain will that do not vale as in vole she said precisely veil as in maiden oh no no maidens there its too harsh for them arent you going to try to make a deal surprise asked deal for your information iris clarified grimacing toward the little girl should i jethro asked the dryad did gary said we thought you would want us to find you a way out of here or something like that no i will surely blunder my way out in due course just as i blundered my way in the giant said once i geis of the gargoyle have rested and have my brute strength back i will wait until you are well clear so i dont step on you thank you for that consideration mentia said but will you answer a question i will make the effort jethro said but my mind is not nearly as big or strong as my body or my breath so i may be unable why are you so large why all giants are large thats part of the definition i know that but my better aspect metria has been around for centuries and on occasion she has encountered invisible giants she spoke with one fifty years ago and he was only a tenth your height are you a giant among giants why no jethro said sounding perplexed i am the same size as any other invisible giant as far as i know we cant see each other of course but we leave similarsized footprints i was a lad of about forty fifty years ago and i was the same size as my friends then youre ninety years old iris asked surprised when were you delivered in the year one thousand and one thats when i was delivered were the same age the tremendous face must have been squinting no of fense sorceress but you dont look ninetythree i would have guessed more like twentythree or are you using il lusion no i have been rejuvenated but now that mentia mentions it i too have had some concourse with giants and i remember that when i was in my maidenly forties they stood about ten times the height of a normal man but you must be a hundred times a mans height how do you explain this i must have continued to grow jethro said now that you mention it i do seem to remember that trees and houses have gotten smaller than they used to be but nor mally giants dont increase much in size after they reach their maturity this does seem odd piers anthony extremely odd mentia agreed one of several odd things there are others gary asked some for example the centaurs used to be slower liv ing than straight human folk so they would take about four times as long to fade out from old age but now they seem to age at the same rate and sphinxes faded out cen turies ago but now they are back as if they had never been gone these are curious matters to explain you are right iris said i have lived long enough to remember things have changed and the madness has expanded hiatus said could that be related thats right mentia said the madness seems to have been expanding for some time but not prior to this century all these changes seem to have occurred recently i wonder why if we could figure out why hiatus said growing ex cited we might know how to reverse the madness it would help to pinpoint the time of change his said i think things were stable while i remained on the isle of illusion but after i married trent and moved to castle roogna it was different i never really thought about it until now that is my impression mentia agreed my better half wasnt much concerned about giants because they were invisible but each time she encountered one it was bigger was there anything special that happened gary asked i mean something that might have affected the whole of xanth like the time of no magic or the time of no magic iris and mentia exclaimed to gether that must have been it jethro said that disrupted myriads of the old spells and started the break up of the forget spell on the gap chasm so that now we can remem ber it who knows what else it did who knows indeed iris breathed all the men geis of the gargoyle stoned by the gorgon returned to life and returned to their wives her jaw dropped and thereafter her talent ma tured some more and she started stoning females as well as males we thought it was simply a matter of compe tence with age but now i dont think so but could the time of no magic cause the madness to expand gary asked that seems farfetched not if there were some ancient spell holding the mad ness in check mentia said that the time of no magic wiped out so that the mischief could spread since the madness is an effect of concentrated magic dust that wider spread of dust could have had sundry effects such as mak ing the giants grow or the centaurs to align with humans or some talents like that of the gorgon to intensify it could have had scores of slews of smaller effects folk never really noticed because the changes happened grad ually the time of no magic was in the year one ten fortythree fiftyone years ago and those changes are still occurring who would notice a single years change but it seems it has been happeningand it may indeed repre sent the key to our dilemma it may gary asked the demoness was now making so much sense that she was leaving him behind you started getting overwhelmed by mundane pollu tion in the water in that same period gary mentia said you need the philter so you can keep up your quest may be because of another consequence of the time of no magic it did make sense but the philter is only for water how can we restore an unknown spell that confined the madness that is what we shall have to find out mentia said we shall have to hope that there is more in those ruins than your philter they looked pretty bare to me jethro said but of course i wasnt looking carefully we shall have to look carefully iris said she faced the empty giant face thank you for your valuable assis r piers anthony tance in this matter jethro you may have been far more help to us and to the land of xanth than any of us antic ipated gee the giant said pleased they climbed down his arm and made it to the ground then they followed his huge tracks on into the heart of the madness there were the usual weird effects and confu sions but gary felt encouraged and knew that his compan ions did too but the day was late and this was no region to try to traverse in the dark so they found a reasonably sedate al cove formed by wallnuts and foraged for pies and juices and settled down for the evening or at least they tried to but this was the region of madness and it couldnt leave them alone long surprise tired from the days events wasnt bothered she was floating just above the ground sound asleep but gary and the others took longer to settle the trees took on alien forms and seemed to nudge qui etly closer extending hooked branches gary thought it was his imagination until a branch tugged at his human clothing sleeve he knew that branch had not been that close before but he didnt say anything so as not to make a fuss about nothing this was no tangle tree and was probably harmless he removed his manstyle shoes which were pinching his human toes in the prescribed manner and set them be fore him they made two little sighs and small gobs of vapor rose from them what is this he asked hiatus glanced at him those are the souls of your shoes of course he said they get uncomfortable with your weight on them all day and only at night do they have a chance to relax let them be theyll need their strength for tomorrows trek i didnt know shoes had souls gary said i thought only creatures had souls shoes are special hiatus assured him they have to work very hard geis of the gargoyle actually usually only human creatures have souls iris said or parthuman creatures like harpies or cen taurs the shoes must get their souls from association only humanrelated creatures have souls gary asked troubled then what about gargoyles do you have any human derivation not that i know of then you must lack a soul no he must have a soul mentia said in her rational way because his shoes do they could not get souls from association if there were no source well he is in human form iris said form alone does not count we demons can assume any form we choose she illustrated by becoming a toad stool complete with a frog the frog croaked with surprise and jumped off im supposed to be a toad it said with disgust the madness is interfering again iris said do demons have souls gary asked we are souls mentia said resuming her normal form so we dont have souls not that we miss them but what about your better half the demoness grimaced she did get half a soul when she married and suddenly she had love conscience loy alty selfsacrifice and all the better human traits it was disgusting thats why i had to split i am her soulless remnant i at least remain demonly pure but if you are souls shouldnt you have the good traits gary asked shrugging away another branch no all our energy is used just maintaining our exis tence mentia said we dont have any left over for those awkward things you have to have a physical body before your soul can get into the mushy stuff what about the humandemon crossbreeds iris asked mentia shrugged an argument can be made that they have two souls their demonly aspect is one and their hu man aspect can have another they might even be able to piers anthony have two talents because each soul can have its own tal ent their eyes turned to the sleeping child i wonder iris murmured no she is not a demon mentia said i would know she is just a child with wild talents she will surely be less interesting when she gets them under control but her family will be relieved gary said this time he had to remove two branches that were plucking at his clothing am i imagining it or is this tree trying to grab me it is trying to snatch your clothing hiatus said an other has been trying to do the same thing to me but i am discouraging it by growing warty excrescences on it this twisted talent of mine still has its uses another has been trying for mine mentia said but without success since i am in smoky form at the mo ment snatching clothing iris asked eeeek one has taken my blouse it was so slow i never noticed it is dark enough so that we cant see you anyway hiatus said reassuringly but now i shall have to clothe myself partly in il lusion she said irritated and illusion isnt warm enough i will try to find a blanket bush gary said a blan ket should help you actually he was getting cold him self ill help iris said a light flared and gary saw that she was carrying a lamp it illuminated her slipcovered upper torso you conjured a lamp hiatus asked surprised no this is illusion iris explained an illusory lamp makes real light gary asked sur prised in turn the light is illusory too she said come on lets find that blanket bush they stepped out by the illusory light which spread geis of the gargoyle widely enough to prevent them from walking into trees or holes in the ground gary decided not to question the mat ter further he was afraid that if he did he would no longer be able to see clearly enough to pick his way past the sharp stones and sticks that lurked for his tender bare human feet there seemed to be no blanket or pillow bushes to be found but iris spied a lowlying cloud maybe some of that will do she said going for it but thats just mist gary protested no we havent missed it yet but it wont remain there long fog i meant vapor no substance not necessarily clouds can be solid enough to hold pools of water only when they get tilted or shaken does it come down as rain and this is in madness that probably affects its nature she reached the cloud and caught hold of its substance with her free hand then she set the lamp on her head so she could use both hands a big puff of cloud stuff came away in her arms yes this will do just fine help me get enough gary gary put forth his human hands and touched the cloud it felt like fluffy cotton he pulled and an almost weight less chunk of it came away from the main mass he followed iris back to the wallnut tree ill put mine on the ground and well use yours for a cover she said we cant let go or it will float away i got this for you he said i will return for more for me dont be silly youll never find your way in the dark ness well share but what about hiatus and mentia arent they cold too i dont think so she said she lifted her lamp high and he saw by its expanding light that hiatus was now set tled comfortably on a feather bed under surprise who was still sleeping while floating piers anthony where did that come from he asked and where is mentia the bed opened a mouth on the side dont be silly gargoyle it said the demoness had formed herself into the bed he real ized still he had a question if your magic is messed up by the madness how could you choose to do that by trying to turn myself into a block of concrete the bed said madness can be managed when you understand itand i being a bit crazy normally have not had much trouble relating to it though i remain uncomfortably sane so gary sat on the bottom puff of cloud and found it quite comfortable he lay back on it and it was heavenly soft without yielding so far as to let him touch the ground the cloud substance retained some of its daytime warmth and he realized that it was probably better for this purpose than a blanket would have been iris settled beside him and pulled the other fragment of vapor over them both her body was warm and soft too and very close but he started oh thats right left the light on she said the lamp disappeared leaving them in darkness comfy now butyou arent wearing anything i think theres no need to maintain illusion clothing in dark ness she pointed out i will make a new illusion outfit in the morning and perhaps use what remains of this cloud to fashion a new blouse but your body is so close why so it is she said as if surprised however al low me to remind you mat i no longer need illusion to make my ancient bones appear young i am physically twentythree years old which i believe is about your hu man physical age we match rather nicely i think match for what well we might start with a kiss on the ear she said suiting action to word geis of the gargoyle gary was so surprised he slid right out of the cloud cover and landed on the cool hard ground oh come on iris said hauling him back between the layers in the process her body got even closer than before what are you trying to do he asked isnt it obvious im trying to seduce you gary was amazed to what she laughed arent you interested no i dont understand this at all there was a pause consisting of perhaps two and a half moments i have been so old so long that it is a real re lief to be young again in body she finally said what use is it to be young if you cant enjoy the potentials of youth i dont know what are the potentials of youth there was another pause not as long you perhaps hesitate to indulge with a married woman let me assure you that i will never tell this is purely passing fun a pri vate diversion indulge in what he asked baffled in signaling the stork you idiot she snapped he began to get a bit of her drift possibly the stork but for that i would need a female what the bleep do you suppose i am a wallrus why youre human he said perplexed by her vehe mence precisely so what is your objection i am a gargoyle i have no stork interest in any other species for pitys sake you are in human form at the mo ment gary remembered that it was true still i am really a gargoyle just as you are really an ancient hag we have no human relationship this time the pause was so many moments long that he lost track he drifted peacefully off to sleep he assumed that iris did the same piers anthony in the morning they foraged for grapefruit and passion fruit the grapes were good but gary didnt eat the other he remembered that the cloudbed he had shared with iris rested on passion vines that accounted for her attitude he realized belatedly he would try to avoid those in the fu ture so as to be able to get better sleep it would have been nice had there been a girl gargoyle though mean while surprise conjured several livers looked disgusted and finally got what she wanted by trying to conjure the most loathsome liverworts she might imagine she got a punkin pie and a honeycomb she poured the honey on the pie and stuck the comb in her hair so it wouldnt flop around then she gobbled down the pie with an appetite that would have done credit to a goblin the sorceress iris seemed somewhat out of sorts gary realized that it might have been polite to pretend some sort of interest in her of the sort that he presumed a human man his seeming age and health would have but there was just no denying the fact that she was not a gargoyle the follies of the human folk seldom cease to amuse demons mentia remarked as she glanced at the passion vines would you like me to assume the shape of a gar goyle of course not we gargoyles never confuse any other creature for one of us no others can hope to match our impressive ugliness to be sure the demoness agreed still amused they followed the giants footprints on into what seemed to be the very center of the region of madness though mentia explained that this could not be so because the center was the magic dust village nevertheless the maddening effects remained with the trees coming to re semble enormous sea monsters and sometimes acting like them too iris had to use her illusion frequently to fend them off and hiatus was kept busy growing loathsome hairy excrescences on those branches that werent daunted by the illusions when both these measures failed mentia geis of the gargoyle assumed the form of a treechomping hugeasaur and crunched off their reaching limbs still they were glad when the jungle thinned somewhat and they climbed through a moderate range of hills the hills themselves resisted their passage becoming moun tainous and angling their slopes unexpectedly so as to cause the travelers to lurch into treetrunks or boulders and bash their own noses i think i know of these hills mentia said theyre called the pokeanose at last they emerged onto a level plain that was a re lief because their noses were pretty sore by this time but they were wary knowing that soon enough some new threat would materialize here the trees were somewhat stunted though the mad ness was frighteningly strong gary who specialized in stone discovered why there is hardly any place here for their roots to gain purchase the ground is covered with chunks of stone doesnt stone underlie most land hiatus asked deep down it does gary agreed but it is usually covered by layers of sand and soil so that plants can get purchase these seem to be artificially carved stones per haps parts of buildings that collapsed some seem to form ancient roads so there just isnt much soil and the plants cant make much progress this is our fortune because most of the plants here seem to be hostile i wonder iris mused the trees and plants around castle roogna do their best to repel unfriendly strangers but it isnt malice they were instructed to do that to pro tect the castle they also did their best to encourage any magician to remain there so maybe we simply dont properly understand these particular plants then a nettle vine tried to curl around her ankle and yank her into the bed of nettles but i could be wrong she said as an af terthought whatever they were in the past they must be different piers anthony now hiatus said because the madness changes every thing surprise found a stone in the general shape of a chair she crossed her eyes and it quivered and started walk ing the child jumped up onto it and rode in style for a while until a leg tripped on an irregularity in the ground and the animated chair toppled dumping her out they continued to follow the giants tracks the stones in the ground became larger and some rose up above the ground presenting ragged silhouettes these are defi nitely artificial gary said i mean that they have been quarried and moved here i begin to see the outlines of large buildings then we must have found the ruins mentia said maybe our quest is almost done that would be nice gary agreed doubtfully but finding the ruins is only one step we have to find the philter and we have to try to find a way to save desirees tree i dont see either yet iris gazed ahead at the barren plain this is a waste land for sure it seems to me that if the philter were here it would be purifying water and making an oasis or some thing but all i see are more ruins gary had to agree but what could they do except search the ruins as well as they could hoping to find what they sought now thats odd mentia remarked staring up at a par ticularly large stone set endwise in the ground the others looked too gary saw that it seemed to con sist of two stones connected at the top with a band of a different kind of stone odd hiatus said thats down right weird why prop two stones together like that to make an arch iris suggested too narrow mentia said far too narrow those stones are right together so that no one can pass between them let alone have anything useful here surprise approached the stones then claws extended from her hands and she dug them into the stone and pulled geis of the gargoyle herself up climbing to the linked top she inspected the connection hinge she announced a stone hinge iris asked ridiculous but she re considered immediately yet that does look like what it is a hinge made of stone connecting the two big stones why would a stone be hinged hiatus asked it would take a giant or a pair of ogres to lift up one of these stones they each are the size of small buildings and neither giants nor ogres go in for fancy construc tion mentia said only humans and termites do as a rule and termites dont ordinarily work in stone gary considered the matter gargoyles dont work stone he said but we do appreciate it i would say that this is one support for a fancy building one stone is set deep into the ground while the other rests on top of the ground that second stone could be lifted to a horizontal position and connected to another stone column here he touched a nearby pillar other stones could be lifted sim ilarly and form a solid roof for the building i see columns appropriately placed all around you do hiatus asked i see nothing but lumps of broken stone they are broken but they are in a pattern see here is another hinged column and there is one whose hinged stone has broken off this city has been destroyed by time and weather but it once contained some marvelous build ings the others shook their heads not seeing it but to gary it was clear enough he wished he could show them his vi sion of stone but they werent gargoyles they walked on through the ruins but found nothing special there might have been greatness here a long time ago but it was forgotten nowand had been forgotten long before the madness overran it and there was no phil ter they could find they searched all day but only suc ceeded in getting more tired and depressed even surprise had become bored and passive in the center of the plain was a sodden pool it was piers anthony overgrown with disreputable weeds that hissed at anyone who tried to dip water but hiatus grew some truly loath some shapes on them and they shut up this was as good a place as any to camp for the night this time iris did not try to bother gary to his relief she did try to distract hiatus but hiatus could think only of desiree she finally made herself a fancy pavilion of il lusion and retired there with surprise who formed her own smaller pavilion within it gary lay on his human back and stared up at the stars he was familiar with the constellations having contem plated them many rimes over the centuries but tonight something was wrong he didnt recognize any of them instead he saw a merman swimming through a field of grazing mice the merman spied gary watching and mouthed words at him what are you looking up here for gargoyle where are the regular constellations gary demanded we are the regular constellations the merman retorted angrily not where i came from you are not where you came from stoneheart and the merman and mice glared you are from the dull side of the veil gary thought about that and concluded it was true this is the region of madness so it figures that there are mad constellations you got that right manrump how long have you been here fishtail gary asked responding in kind the merman mellowed insignificantly perhaps it had been some rime since anyone had taken him seriously as long as the madness has reigned then you must have seen these ruins back when they were a magnificent stone city how do you know about that the merman demanded im a gargoyle we admire stone i wish i could see geis of the gargoyle this one as it was in its greatness perhaps there were gar goyles here there were along with all manner of other creatures but it was doomed i wonder whether they had the philter gary said mus ingly the philter the merman exclaimed youre after that yes its my quest do you know where it is dont fetch it the merman cried alarmed its dan gerous return to your own side of the veil so it was here gary exclaimed and it must still be here because it isnt mortal the way flesh folk are i must have it cease this disaster the merman said ill not help you recover that thing and he swam away with such force that his tail stirred up the entire field of mice and the scene blurred into blah but gary now knew that his quest was not in vain the philter was here among the ruinsif he could just find it animation in the morning the others were ready to give up the quest except for surprise who was busily searching for colored pebbles but gary would have none of it i know the philter is here he said how do you know iris asked disdainfully the constellation told me the what the merman constellation i saw in the sky last night he saw the city before it was in ruins and he said the philter was there he told me not to fetch it a talking constellation hiatus asked remember we are in madness mentia said these things happen iris sighed so they do i seem to remember bink say ing something about talking constellations but they werent trustworthy except that this one was trying to prevent me from finding the philter so it must be where i can find it mad logic mentia said it will do but how shall we find it since weve already looked and failed geis of rhe gargoyle the secret must be in the stone gary said i can read stone i just need to find the right one you mean an obelisk iris asked something with writing on it not exactly i merely need a stone that has seen things at the right time what nonsense is this stones cant see anything not the way we do gary said but they do see and they can be read by gargoyles but the process is slow and meaningless if the stone hasnt seen what is needed and what exactly is needed she demanded the philter of course but it may be as hard to find a stone that has seen it as it is to find the philter itself so i shall search for a stone that has seen the old city in its heyday maybe there will be a hint there now look iris said impatiently hasnt every stone here been part of that city so they all have seen it havent they but many faces of stone are turned inward they see only what was inside the building and perhaps only the back of whatever carpets were hung on those inner walls the walls facing outward may see only alley streets or things piled up before them i need a stone face that has seen the whole city or enough of it to enable me to see it too you to see it too she asked skeptically because of this mysterious writing on it oh there would be no writing on it unless some human person did that i read the stone itself iris threw up her hands i give up this is beyond mad ness i am not certain of that mentia said sensibly gar goyles do know stone as they know water and gary is speaking in the manner of one who knows whereof he speaks gary just how do you read stone i look closely at it and refocus my eyes until i can see the images behind the surface then i interpret them he piers anthony paused oh i am not sure i can do it in this human body i keep forgetting its limitations and its potentials iris muttered from the edge the thing to do is to make the attempt mentia said seriously then we shall know whether this is viable but if i dont have a good stone i wont learn any thing useful he protested for testing your potential useful information is not necessary if you find you can read stone in this form then we shall search out the most knowledgeable stone on the plain why yes he agreed you are remarkably sensible mentia she made a grimace that extended off the side of her face it is not by choice gargoyle once we get this mis sion accomplished we can leave this madness and i can revert to normal youre a demoness hiatus said why havent you popped away already the grimace floated entirely away from her face leav ing it without a mouth nevertheless she spoke without difficulty because the madness also reverses my natural irresponsibility it would not be proper to desert you folk in your hour of need so i am not doing it i assure you that this attitude distresses me almost as much as my bet ter halfs acquisition of a conscience i might as well have stayed with her conscience is madness to a demon gary agreed but i must say that i like you better this way and am glad for your present company but shes not even being seductive iris said an noyed exactly he agreed what a nuisance iris muttered nuisance surprise said her eyes crossing she had found a handful of pretty colored pebbles now these floated up to form a pattern in the air geis of the gargoyle but thats not a nuisance iris said those are nice stones that is the nature of the nuisance mentia said sur prise suffers as i do becoming more responsible borrow one of those little stones to test your ability gary this one surprise said a fragment of granite in the shape of a smiley face left the formation and jumped to his hand i like it so gary held the stone and focused on it seeking the message within it his human eyes lost their focus then recovered it in a different style he read the patterns on the surface of the stone evoking the rock pictures maybe if you cross your eyes surprise suggested nothing here but recent events he said because this is a chip from a larger piece and before it chipped away all it saw was the other stone around it once it landed on the ground it saw plants growing and bugs foraging and the silhouette of the column from which it had fragmented nothing of interest to us but you can read it mentia said thats of interest to us why so i can gary agreed startled so it is so now we must find some stone that has seen some thing significant that can pierce the veil of time yes but theres a great deal of time and space to check this may be slow and tedious ive had enough of slow and tedious iris snapped this whole adventure has been unconscionably dull cant we find a way to speed it up mentia looked thoughtful it occurs to me that we have a bottleneck gary is the only one of us who can read the rock pictures if we could find a way to help him do it faster how iris asked eagerly im not sure but i wonder whether it might be possi ble to animate the pictures gary describes so that we could all see them then we could all join in the search piers anthony animate hiatus asked but which of us has such magic iris does mentia said her enormous power of illu sion can make anything appear but my illusions dont make things actually exist iris said they are just as i see them rightly or wrongly but if gary can give you a detailed enough description of what he sees so that you can translate it to illusion that should do the job we know it isnt realat least not real today but if we can in this manner see what has happened in the past and where someone may have left the philter you are making sense iris said very well you find the perfect stone and ill try to relate closely enough to gary so that i can readily translate his images to illusion but remember here in the madness my illusion tends to reverse so ill make some mistakes before i get the full hang of countering it gary wasnt sure he liked this but the notion did seem sensible so he couldnt object lets practice on that pebble iris said you saw plants growing what kind gary peered into the stone again and described the plants at first completely different plants appeared as iris got caught by the madness but she muttered a nasty word and tried again in a moment similar plants were growing around them in large size because that was the way the small pebble had seen them then the bugs came by as suming ever more precise detail as gary corrected iris im pressions this is working she said but i think not well enough lets see if we can get closer she put a hand on his hand but im not trying to vamp you at the moment i just think that i may be able to pick up some of your impressions from the reactions of your body and that may help me get them right without as much verbal correction i want to try geis of the gargoyle to bypass my instincts because they keep revising the im ages maybe if i can attune more closely to yours it will come out right illusion is my business im good at it when i can do it straight they continued to work on it and to garys surprise she was right she was more than good at it she was a genius of illusion the miscues became fewer and finally disap peared every part of what she showed was authentic in image and was responsive to his corrections when he de scribed a day passing the shadows moved across it as they had in life when he described a season passing the trees dropped their leaves and then sprouted new ones when it rained and temporary streams flowed they appeared in the scene in fully animate manner there were aspects of illusion he had not appreciated before such as a thin screen that gave him a translucent mapimage of the scene overlying the stone without obscuring it he no longer had to keep looking at the illusions to correct the errors he fo cused entirely on the pebble telling what he saw in a gen eral way and it took form around them complete with most of its details sometimes a tiny illusion image of iris herself appeared pointing to one aspect of the scene or an other so that he was able to direct her the right way they were making an increasingly effective team he had not liked iris much but now he was coming to appreciate her better she could do good work when she made the effort as last he looked up disconnecting himself from his reverie of the stonebut the illusion image remained in all its detail this is good he said if we find the right stone we can recreate history itself iris smiled yes i think we can you have a marvelous ability to fathom the secrets of stone gary discovered that his tacit dislike of her was fading she had clothed their surroundings with illusion but left herself as she was a well constructed young mature hu man woman he was beginning to see the appeal d mentia appeared they have found a good stone we think she announced it sits high enough to survey piers anthony the entire plain everything within the ring of hills they are making scaffolding so you can get up to read it all oh did they find fallen timbers for construction iris asked as they set off for the site no surprise made them and nylon cord for the lash ings hiatus has a notion how to construct such things it seems what is nylon gary asked it is something they make from stockings taken from nymphs mentia explained you know nymph plus long legs one of their salient attributes its why they run so well and have such attractive legs she formed into a slenderlegged nymph as she spoke sometimes the stockings even run by themselves but that is frowned on folk prefer them without runs the stockings are twisted up so tightly that they form a strong cord they link them together and have as long and supple a cord as is needed i understand that if they squeeze the stockings together tightly enough they form a tough solid mass all derived from that magic intended for the nymphly legs amazing how do they catch the nymphs to take their stockings im not sure it must be hard to do because normally they are able to run teasingly close but always just out of reach of the pursuing men only fauns can catch them reg ularly and thats because the fauns are really their kind and have goat feet to make them faster the nymphs dont really try to get away from them so maybe someone bribes fauns to get the stockings i could use a pair of those stockings myself iris re marked so that i wont have to use illusion on my legs as i grow older is there anything similar for the upper por tion of the body but she didnt get an answer because they had arrived at the site there was the largest standing stone yet tow ering despite being hinged there was now scaffolding around it and a wooden ladder so that gary could climb geis of the gargoyle to a wooden platform circling the top of the stone they had done a nice job so tell them mentia murmured how did you know what i was thinking gary asked common sense something i now have too much of it also tells me that folk are happier and more cooperative when complimented on their achievements that hadnt occurred to him but he was coming to re spect her judgment as it existed here in the madness so he tried it hiatus and surprise that is a very nice job you have done it will be ideal for my purpose the result was impressive the man smiled so broadly that his mouth threatened to emulate the demoness trick of extending beyond the limits of his face and the child sank blissfully backwards onto a small pink cloud shaped like the number which then floated gently in a circle it seemed that they did appreciate the compliment gary realized that he had also inadvertently compli mented the sorceress iris before about her facility with il lusion and she had complimented him about his ability with stone and he had felt quite positive thereafter and disliked her less this was an interesting form of magic that apparently the madness did not interfere with he would try to remember that as magic that anyone could do was rare it occurred to him that if the stone had been hinged to be upright during its heyday he might get most of what he needed right at ground level reading the second stone but that could wait lest it seem that he did not properly appre ciate the scaffold so he climbed the ladder to the plat form and iris followed soon all of them were up there enjoying it indeed the view from up here was good he could see the entire plain without difficulty and the ring shape of the mountains was clear now he saw how many of the standing stones there were they were scattered throughout the region more abundantly than he had real ized while trying ineffectively to search the ground for the philter what a city this must have been piers anthony gary picked a spot on the stone at random and refo cused his eyes he found the range quickly now that he had practiced with his human eyeballs and the pictures leaped into sight they were of the bleak surroundings but those merely overlaid the earlier impressions he plunged right through to the very first ones when the stone was erected and shown the light of day on this site the first pictures were fragmentary seeming to relate to the quarrying and shaping and moving of the stone it took awhile for a stone picture to form and when a person was in view only briefly the image was blurred or ghostly when a scene was steady as was the case with features of the surrounding landscape it became clear in any event the quarrying wasnt important it was the living city he needed to see but the stone tamed out to be a foundation it was cov ered by other stones and by wood so offered no good vi sions until it was abruptly uncovered by fleeting ghost figures at the time the building was hinged down and de serted thereafter there was only the view that existed at present only with most of the folded buildings still erect this stone doesnt offer what we want gary said re gretfully it was covered while the building was active and must have been one of the last to be shut down so that it didnt see the active city then we must find a better stone mentia said sensi bly but i hate to see all this work on the scaffolding wasted we can move it hiatus said we made it to be read ily taken apart and reassembled they dismounted from the platform and took it apart mentia had spied a doublehinged stone that seemed to start with a massive foundation continue with a folded down upper segment and finish with a foldedup spire this wasnt a building she said this was a steeple it should have had a good view of the city from its point gary agreed they set up the scaffolding and climbed to geis of the gargoyle the platform as before now he examined the blunt tip of the spire oh my he breathed awed tell me iris said urgently let me animate it her illusion screen appeared ready to respond to his words and reactions gary began talking i see a city being constructed so vast it fills the entire plain within the ring of mountains so new it shines in the sunlight so intricate it is like nothing xanth has known since it is as if every building is a pal ace and on the distant hills are castles linked by walls of such magnitude that they seem like mountains the illusion took shape first on the screen between him and the surface of the stone where he could readily cor rect it and amend it then beyond where everyone could see it there was a murmur of awe that echoed his own as hiatus surprise and mentia saw a wedge of the great city of the distant past take shape around them it might be il lusion but it was patterned on the reality of long ago gary walked slowly around the stone reading the rock pictures as he didand as he did the illusion city spread out in other directions as seen by the stone that faced that way when he completed his circuit there was a complete ancient city around them maintained in illusion though gary could no longer look at the images on the far side iris talent provided a stability that his eyes alone lacked she could hold the image once it had been evoked now the other three of us must search the city to see who has the philter and where he put it mentia mur mured we will not be able to touch anything but we can see everything see the illusion is threedimensional we can look at the far sides of buildings not if we stay up here we cant hiatus said then we shall go down to the ground but be cautious because the illusion city is covering up the real things and we can stumble into them we must remain aware that what we see is not what is there today piers anthony can you feel the way for us hiatus asked guide us so that we can look without stumbling and hurting our selves why yes thats a good idea i will become a fog and touch the ground ahead of you i will make a green stripe where it is safe for you to walk there were the sounds of their descent to the ground then gary and iris were alone working on the image gary was still examining it concentrating on one detail and then another and as he did so iris clarified the illu sion image to match the buildings which had been shown in general outline became more specific these buildings are hollow surprise cried from be low oops gary said i should have realized that the stone can see only what is in its line of sight whatever was never in its sight remains blank but once we have what this stone offers iris said we can go to other stones and get other views we can make this city whole in time but if we take the time to do that we wont be able to follow it forward in time to see what happens to the phil ter lets save that until we actually spy the philter she said our first priority is to get the most complete replica of the city that we can so that we dont miss anything she was right so he worked to complete the description of this region as seen by this stone then the two of them went down to the ground and through the illusion follow ing a green stripe sure enough the buildings were hollowbut it was comparatively easy to fill them in from the spot viewpoints of other stones it was not necessary to climb them for this limited purpose the ground views suf ficed it was merely necessary to find projections on the stones that had not been covered by paneling or paint the views were limited but adequate they worked in their separate fashions all day gary geis of the gargoyle reading one stone after another iris building the most phe nomenal structure of illusion of her oldyoung life hiatus and surprise eagerly searching every street and building that was sufficiently defined and mentia coordinating and guiding all of them but by the end of the day they knew two things they had not gotten even a glimmer of the philter and they were ravenous there arent any people hiatus complained we cant see what theyre doing only what theyve done gary explained about the need for people to stay in the vicinity of the stone for long enough to make an impres sion rock pictures usually arent very good for animate creatures i might evoke some if i concentrated on exceed ingly fine definition but that would take time and proba bly wouldnt be as good as the larger view is lets not bother with that for now mentia said when we find a really promising area then we can do the fine focus theres no point in wasting the effort ran domly i hate to shut down this magnificent restoration after we have made it gary said but we must rest and sleep i can maintain it iris said what even while you sleep he asked amazed i told you i was good at illusion once i have crafted it i can maintain it with minimal effort he shook his human head i think i never understood before the power of a sorceress i never imagined such a thing thank you what are you mortals going to eat tonight mentia asked we have already foraged for most of the berries and things that grew in this wasteland eat surprise said crossing her eyes suddenly a bar rel of fish livers appeared it smelled awful the little girl stared at it appalled but i tried to conjure a huge choc olate layer cake she said not codfish i hate cod liver oil piers anthony geis of the gargoyle your magic got twisted again mentia said ill get rid of it no mentia said keep it it is good food for you and the next thing you conjure might be worse yuck surprise cried in true child fashion the demoness turned to iris can you spare some illu sion for this without losing the city some iris agreed cautiously can you make these fish livers look feel and taste like chocolate layercake yes i can do that much iris glanced at the barrel and it became a giant cake overflowing with chocolate icing it looked and smelled as good as the fish livers were awful wow surprise cried delighted your magic is pretty good thank you dear iris said wryly iris made an illusion pavilion for them all under the shelter of stones that were hinged in an a formation they gathered dry grass and leaves for beds and these seemed to become downy mattresses they slept in comfort each in his or her own chamber at least gary assumed that the others did he found himself beset by a growing apprehension not of some thing wrong or threatening just confusing his dreams got downright weird he remembered the constellations that had become animated and feared that they were doing it again fortunately the sorceress illusion dome shielded him from a view of the night sky and prevented the con stellation merman from seeing him but the weirdness seeped in anyway in the morning they held another conference and con cluded that it was after all time to search out the finer de tail what we really need are to talk to the people of this ancient hinge city mentia said i dreamed i did hiatus said i asked a man what the city was called and he said hinge he said that when they shut it down they called it unhinge and that strangers called it stone hinge i dreamed too iris said but all i saw were odd crossbreed species like merchickens and micephants i asked one about that and it said it was because they couldnt avoid the love spring i dreamed i was stultifyingly normal surprise said scowling cutely fortunately demons dont dream mentia said but that animated constellation gives me the creeps that made gary feel less secure i think something is affecting us all he said well of course it is mentia said its the extra wash of madness that flowed through in the night its getting to us so they found what seemed to be a significant spot in the city where ancient metal tracks had crossed by a spe cial stone building and gary and iris concentrated on evoking whatever had been there they were eager to get this job done before the madness infiltrated their bodies too deeply and affected more than their dreams but what gary found was not a picture of a person or people it was some sort of huge wagon or vehicle linked to another like it in fact there seemed to be a chain of them each as big and blocky as the next what could this be a train of thought surprise exclaimed clapping her hands i want to ride on it that is not the kind of train you can ride on mentia cautioned the child but then as the train took shape she reconsidered however here in the madness maybe it is possible its an illusion train iris reminded them an image from the past all we can do is look at it nevertheless as gary explored its finer detail and iris improved the picture it seemed like a very real vehicle there was an engine steaming in the distance at one end piers anthony seeming as hot as the gap dragon and a caboose at the other end with a red light in the middle was a chain of wheeled cars with lines of windows this is just like the stories some travelers have told of mundane trains iris said trent mentioned seeing one during his exile do you suppose that when such trains died they went to the region of madness it seems possible mentia agreed the city of hinge is a strange place and so deserves strange vehicles per haps such a train transported the philter somewhere the philter gary said do you really think so more likely the train carried people to wherever the philter was hiatus said or wherever else they wanted to go i think some zombie animals would have been bet ter for such transport but they evidently had odd tastes iris mouth quirked clearly so she agreed perhaps we can follow this train as it travels and see if it passes the philter i think ill ride it mentia said she floated up and to ward the entrance steps at the end of the nearest car me too surprise said clapping her hands she ran to the steps and scrambled up them you cant do that iris cried dashing after the child nyaa nyaa you cant catch me surprise called run ning inside the car we shall see about that iris retorted grimly she charged up the steps after the child hiatus exchanged a heavy glance with gary of course we know this isnt possible he said but we had better see that those three females dont get into trouble gary agreed the two of them followed the others up the steps and into the long car this is sheer madness hiatus said this is the place for it gary agreed iris and surprise were in the main compartment of the car the child was running up and down the long central aisle while iris was sitting in one of the comfortable re geis of the gargoyle dining chairs she glanced back and saw them sit down men she suggested if i can walk into one of my own illusions why not you too they joined her you know this is crazy gary said mentia appeared this is a feature of joint imagina tion she said i think the madness has lent substance to the sorceress illusion thus what we are experiencing is a partial truth there was a jerk that shook them all the train is mov ing hiatus cried we must get off it iris shrugged why since its all imagination why not go along for the ride hiatus looked surprised i suppose we can he peered out the window the city is going by outside this will make it easier to search the city iris said we might as well enjoy it they looked out the windows as the train of thought gathered speed the buildings seemed to be moving back while the train was still but gary knew that was just an other effect of illusion since as iris pointed out it was all just imagination it hardly mattered but where did they think they were going gary pondered this as he watched the buildings thin out to be replaced by trees and fields with an occasional small lake his quest was to find the philter would this train of thought take him thereif he thought it should once he had the philter he wouldnt care how it had been achieved so he concentrated on that philter philter phil ter the train slowed we are arriving somewhere iris re marked was this where the philter was gary kept up his thought doing his best to train the train to respond the train squealed to a halt i believe we have ar rived mentia said i am not at all sure we shall be com fortable with where we are there is entirely too much madness here to suit me any time we get tired of it iris said i can simply abolish the illusion and we will be back among the ruins perhaps mentia said grimly that bothered gary because mentia was now their sanest member but he did not want to leave the illusion until he had located the philter they got out of their chairs and walked in file toward hinge gary led the way out of the train wary of what might lie outside the illusion of the ancient city remained but he wasnt sure whether they had ac tually traveled anywhere in reality if they had where had the train of thought taken them here in the madness any thing could be dangerous or nonexistent or both there was a small group of people gathered on the sta tion platform one of them evidently recognized him for she stepped briskly forward she was armed and her hair was militantly coifed hannah barbarian he exclaimed dismayed what are you doing here my lord surely you jest she replied diffidently could he be mistaken she looked like the aggressive woman he had encountered at the good magicians castle but she wasnt acting like her am i confusing you with someone else she smiled which was another disconcerting thing my lord gar the good you know i exist merely to serve your will let me help you down the step you are surely piers anthony fatigued after your wearisome travel and she reached forth to take firm hold of his elbow steadying him as he descended gary got smart realizing that this had to be an aspect of illusion or madness i confess i am a bit confused humor me your name is hanna the handmaiden of course my lord as it has ever been i see you are in sore need of my ministrations it seemed better to play along with this illusion rather than challenge it maybe sorceress iris was having a bit of fun with him but iris was the next off the train what is this she asked startled queen iri have you forgotten me hanna asked i am handmaiden to my lord gar the good loyal and sub servient subservient gary asked surprised again my lord you tease me cruelly hanna said looking woeful when was i ever other than your most humble and obedient servant i didnt conjure this image iris said looking per plexed and faintly alarmed this madness is getting out of hand not for naught is she called iri the irate hanna mur mured to gary then smiling brightly to iris my lady i apologize most humbly for making you angry i said mad not angry iris said but she seemed to have come to the same decision as gary to play along un til she had a better notion what was happening surprise appeared next and how good it is to see you again princess supi the super hanna said i pray your esteemed mother the queen has not been wroth with you too the child startled changed color she turned bright green supi the super she echoed i like it iris glanced back dear you had better change back before someone notices she said guardedly geis of the gargoyle surprise changed to blue then back to normal super she repeated smiling my lord do you encourage her in this hanna in quired anxiously encourage her gary said blankly how can i pre vent her from doing whatever she chooses but you are her tutor my lord it is your prerogative to instruct her in all things mannerly and magical so that she does not waste her powers waste her powers gary was still having trouble ori enting you know as well as do we all that though supi being the sole heir to the crown of xanth has more magic than any other she can invoke each aspect of it once and once only thus it is horrible to waste it frivolously lest we need it for the final conjuration once only gary asked and saw that iris was as sur prised as he can this be true but the next person was descending from the train this was mentia ah my lady menti the mentor hanna said and it is good to see you again too mentor to what his asked her voice carefully con trolled why to princess supi of course for she is ever in need of attention and you her mother are naturally often too busy to be bothered iris frowned but did not respond mentia rationally quick on the uptake merely nodded certainly we take excellent care of the child she agreed now hiatus appeared another person stepped from the background group my lord hiat she cried i am so glad to see you safely home desiree he cried astonished for indeed it was she desi the desolate she agreed surely you have not so soon forgotten the nymph you rescued from evil and befriended and who now serves you in any way you al low geis of the gargoyle piers anthony but he started we all have titles or descriptions it seems gary told him we feel it best not to debate them descriptions hiat the hedonist hanna offered helpfully i nevercalled you that desi protested i honor you as uncle of princess supi closest in the royal descent after her and a bold and handsome man hiatus seemed stunned by this description but not an noyed he too was coming to realize that something odd was occurring here i am glad to be with you again desireei mean desi and now that the introductions have been accom plished iris said perhaps we should go where we are going why to the palace of course hanna said we know you all are tired after your sojourn abroad abroad gary asked to the very nonmagical extreme edge of xanth where the awful mundanes threaten to overrun hanna said surely a harrowing excursion very true iris agreed quickly and now we really must get home and rest for a time please convey us there by the simplest route we have merely to cross the street hanna said how clever of my lady to express it so but her sober expres sion suggested that she did not regard the queen as all that clever so they followed hanna out of the station and across the street which was now being used by assorted cross breeds a small sphinx was hauling a wagon of fruit and a clean harpy was sweeping the street by blowing the de bris and dirt away by the force of her wingbeats an ogre was scrubbing the palace windows using an assortment of sponges mounted on long handles gary was amazed he had never heard of a sphinx serv ing as a beast of burden or of a harpy cleaning anything up or ofan ogre being gentle with windows these were illusion figures of course but usually illusions echoed the natures of the creatures they represented he glanced at iris dont look at me she muttered none of these peo ple or creatures are my handiwork hiatus took note they arent then whos making them how should i know she asked irritably i thought i was the only one with illusion of this caliber maybe theyre real mentia said no theyre illusion iris said trust me to know my art they just arent mine i knew desi was too good to be true hiatus said mo rosely the real desiree isnt interested in me and the real hannah is a militant feminist gary said not at all like hanna the handmaiden something very strange is occurring mentia said its a function of the increased madness of course but not of any type i have heard of its fun surprise said iris was thoughtful actually my husband trent re marked how he entered the madness and encountered fig ures from his past in mundania they seemed real and acted as they had when he knew them but were actually animated by his companions in the quest he was on among whom was my better self metria mentia agreed remembering she became sober in the madness as i have and developed a taste for love that was the mischief that drove me outand now i am discovering as pects of it myself so perhaps this is the normal course of madness after all but what of the people and creatures we arent remem bering or imagining iris asked they arent like those we may have known other than in their appearance that remains odd the demoness agreed they reached the palace gate gary admired the fine stone structure as it had a number of rare facets including a selfcleaning panel of detergent stone he would have piers anthony liked to study it more closely but didnt want to separate from the party the interior of the palace was of course palatial with arched ceilings and spacious chambers the group was guided up an elaborate spiraling stone stairway to the res idential floor where it seemed their apartments were clus tered gary saw desi take hiatus to their suite after guiding iris and surprise to theirs hanna showed mentia to hers then took gary into his i must massage your tired body my lord hanna said solicitously i know how traveling wearies you beyond endurance actually i didnt travel that far gary said and the train was comfortable first we must get these grimy clothes off you she said as if he hadnt spoken he realized that as an illusion imitation person she probably didnt have a lot of person ality but her hands seemed surprisingly solid as she drew off his jacket and then his shoes and trousers he knew that illusion was remarkable stuff but hadnt realized that it could be felt this solidly as well as seen and heard she made him lie on a stone pallet and she pressed and kneaded his human shoulders and back suddenly he real ized how tired he actually was and how wonderfully re laxing this massage was hanna the handmaiden was a maiden who really knew how to use her hands but he knew he could not afford to relax mentally there were strange things here that could be dangerous and he had a quest to pursue he did not know how long this dreamlike illusion would persist so he wanted to take advantage of it to locate the philter as soon as feasible hanna exactly what is our relationship he inquired why my lord gar i am your everloyal and obedient servant she replied as her competent hands moved on down his body i do anything you require of me why did you call me gar the good this is your description everyone knows that you are the best intentioned of all the few remaining humans in geis of the gargoyle xanth and that you have only the very most noble aspira tions that is why you were selected to tutor supi the super that she not abuse her great magic powers and bring our cause to ruin the others arent well intentioned oh some are but they lack discretion or temper or competence princess supi is a wild child and queen iri notorious for her angry outbursts menti does her best to pacify them both but she is merely a demon nanny with out authority as for lord hiat the hedonistif there is any way of selfish indulgence he has not discovered it is not for lack of trying she paused as her hands kneaded his legs though recently he has become sinister which makes me nervous an illusion could be nervous how so he still supports the cause but somehow his support seems measured as if it springs less from the heart than from a schooled aspect of the mind i do not trust himor the dire effect he has on the princess this was getting more interestingand alarming what dire effect he keeps trying to tempt her with notions of pleasure for its own sake and suggesting that she employ her power to gratify her appetites such as for endless cake and eye scream instead of saving them for the benefit of the cause she being but a child is prone to pay attention so far you have managed to counter that my lord but i fear you are losing ground what is this cause she laughed as she did his feet you have not teased me like this in ages my lord playing the ignorant when in fact you are our most knowledgeable remaining purebreed it is the cause of preserving the nature and sanctity of xanth that it be neither overrun by brutish bar barians from mundania nor depleted entirely of mankind surely there can be no more noble enterprise than this yet success hangs by a thread we need to be fully united in this ultimate endeavor yet we are notbecause of lord piers anthony hiats subtle malignity was ever there a sadder state she finished his feet now i am done my lord and shall garb you anew that you be ready for the final effort gary got off the table feeling wonderfully refreshed final effort she brought him a fine cloth robe it is time to assem ble the masterspell securing xanth for all future existence after that it will not matter if our pitiful remnant of hu mankind is extinguished xanth as we knew it will en dure gary donned the robe it fit him as if it had been made for him and worn to his contours there is a threat of ex tinction of our kind he did not think it expedient to mention that he was not actually a man she laughed somewhat wanly as if you had not no ticed that only this palace remains inhabited by full hu mans in all the vasty city when we are gone there will be only crossbreeds remaining and they will not remain long for they prefer concourse with the growing populations of their own kind xanth will have to be resettled by mundanesbut at least they will not destroy it once the masterspell is made but what threat is there against us he asked arent we secure in this fine city secure from all but ourselves she said sadly every time one of us is tempted to drink from the unprotected spring that one is lost after the masterspell is established it will not matter but too many have not seen fit to wait unprotected spring the gargoyle must travel from spring to spring there being no other willing to brave the madness we must con fine our drinking to the times she is present lest we be en sorceled and forfeit our species future gary fixed on one word gargoyle and now you claim not to remember gentle gayle goyle who alone among her kind still serves the welfare of the city of hinge we could not endure without her gary was so surprised and thrilled that he did not speak geis of the gargoyle for a moment in that moment hanna proceeded to a new mission i must go help the staff prepare the homecoming banquet my lord may you rest refreshed before he could protest she opened the door and was gone the moment he was alone he was not alone demoness mentia appeared i thought shed never go she mut tered do you realize when this is theres a gargoyle in the city he said dazed this is the year minus one thousand she said this is before known human history this is the last remnant of a twelvehundredyear prehistoric human colony that got his attention the dawn of time the un known period of xanth exactly when the stage was set for what we thought was the settlement of xanththe first wave of human colonization which wont occur for another thousand years but hey whos counting this is when it was all made possible but there cant have been history before the dawn of history he protested there was fantastic history it merely was lost to later knowledge now we can discover it all from an illusion replica we are merely imagining it i dont think so gary if iris knows illusion i know reality being a creature who is seldom bound by it this city is not drawn from imagination it is drawn from real ity it existed and what we are experiencing now is how it was we must learn all we can about it because when we return to our own time we will be the only ones who can tell this story we arent here to leam lost history gary protested we are here to find the philter that too she agreed but theres one other thing one of those illusions let slip did you hear how surprise can invoke a particular variant of magic only once yes i wondered about that he agreed can it be true if so we need have no concern about bringing her piers anthony under control she will soon enough have no magic requir ing control that may require some time because it seems that she doesnt lose whole disciplines of magic merely the spot variants she has conjured many things though we have seen her conjure no one thing twice still it will definitely limit her what i wonder is how can it be mere illusions who tell us this if theyre not real they should not know anything if theyre animations of the distant past they shouldnt know about the present yet i have the feeling that they do know and that this is what limits surprise but i dont know whether to discuss it with her mother you dont mean rapunzel shes not in this scene queen in mentia paused then knocked her head with the heel of her hand and some dottle flew out her opposite ear i mean iris im getting into the part despite myself i was thinking that a mother would not want to hear about such a liability in her child but i suppose ids can handle it but we dont know that its true we should find out yes mentia hovered in place for a stretchedout mo ment evidently ill at ease but im her governess i dont want to break the poor childs heart by establishing such a thing you want me to do it gary asked disturbed for no good reason youre her tutor its your job to teach her things he realized that in the framework of this episode that was true it was his job to educate the child in fact it was true in the present too because he had agreed to be her tutor he had not done a very good job of it so far then i had better do it he agreed great go to their room and do it mentia faded out clearly relieved even when her image was fuzzy gary gathered up his gumption and stepped out of the room he walked down the hall to the queen princess suite he knocked on the door after a moment iris opened it she too had changed geis of the gargoyle clothing and was in a gown that revealed about as much of her upper torso as when she had tried to tempt him he found the flesh more interesting now than he had before yes gar the good she said smiling i come on serious business he said i fear that sur prise can invoke particular magic only once thats what the local folk claim she agreed we had better verify it though she opened the door wider to ad mit him im not sure how she will react gary realized that a severely disappointed or disturbed child could evoke wild magic indeed if she tried to deny such a limitation he needed to find a circumspect way to address the matter surprise was sleeping she was on a princesssized bed and looking angelic gary felt guilty for what he was about to do but it did have to be done he didnt want to wake her but he suspected that her sleep was lighter than it seemed so he addressed the bed so can you repeat magic he inquired conversationally an eye opened in the footboard and stared at him then it formed into a mouth cant you see the princess is sleeping the mouth asked irritably gary glanced at iris who shook her head no it wasnt her illusion i shall be happy to talk to you instead eye sore he said all i want to know is whether what the foolish illusion maiden said is true all you have to do to put her in her place is reform your eye the mouth became an ear eh the ear said im hardwood of hearing form the eye again the ear shifted into the eye which gazed placidly at him then it pursed its lids into a kind of mouth like this you mean it observed gary exchanged half a glance with iris thats very good he said but it occurred to him that any magic had a certain duration and this might be part of a single magic series rather than a repetition can you erase yourself en tirely then reappear piers anthony the eye blinked out nothing remained but the polished grain of the wood then the eye reappeared well that does look like a repetition to me gary said with mixed feelings ixnay iris murmured thats illusion and she knew illusion when she saw it different magic i mean a real eye gary said the illusion eye vanished there was a pause then the grain of the wood curled into the shape of an eye that is not the same gary said the air stirred by the footboard fog appeared twisting into the shape of an eye not the same gary repeated a heavy certainty was infusing him she was demonstrating a remarkable variety of similar effects but once a particular magic was abol ished it was not reappearing the fog dissipated in demonly fashion then an eyeball popped into existence in a moment it was clothed by up per and lower eyelids not the same gary said once more i am very much afraid we have our answer surprise burst into tears the tears flew out in an ex panding sphere soaking everything in the room including gary and iris they were hot and salty iris went to the bed to comfort the child im so sorry dear but we had to know you must conserve your magic gary said to save it for when you really need it you have enough to last you for a lifetime if you are careful just dont waste it surprise looked miserable for the first time she under stood her limit she had just matured enormously but by the most painful route he turned and left the chamber depressed he had done his job as tutor he had broken the heart of a child mentia reappeared as he entered his own suite she will be no problem when she returns home she said she will no longer use magic wildly i might as well have beaten her geis of the gargoyle you might as well have mentia agreed her eyes were reddening im sorry i asked you to do that it had to be done but now his own vision was blur ring demons dont cry she remarked apropos of nothing neither do gargoyles then they were standing together holding each other crying what else was there to do later hanna returned she had changed her dress and was resplendent in a full evening gown that destroyed any remaining vestige of militarism she might ever have had dinner is served she said gary gaped at her he was beginning to appreciate the appeal of human females the way her unbound hair spread out like a little cloak and curled around the archi tecture of her shoulders and chest and the way the very act of breathing caused her contours to shift configu ration am i uncomfortable to perceive hanna inquired after a moment by no means gary said hastily i was merely sur prised by the change perhaps i will change again for you later she mur mured then she turned and walked from the room in the process demonstrating the manner in which her hindside contours shifted also that was another type of thing he had not noticed in any woman before their forms were actually more intriguing than he would have credited when closely inspected she paused half turning in a graceful manner are you coming lord gar bemused he followed he had never suspected that hannah barbarian had any such aspect human beings were constantly surprising him and interesting him in creasingly the others joined him in the hall iris and surprise were subdued but stable in wellfitted queenly and princessly piers anthony robes and mentia was demurely but quite attractively garbed gary was aware that as a demoness she could as sume any form she wished but she had a role to play and she was playing it perfectly she was the childs governess so was quite prim and proper yet by no means devoid of aesthetic appeal in simpler terms she looked great for a human which she of course was not hiatus was now in a tailored suit whose upturned collar and descending tails looked elegant he was suddenly a broodingly handsome man the banquet hall had been decorated for the occasion ornate carpets carpeted the walls and plush rugs were rugged on the floor an enormous table was in the center garlanded with blue and green roses with places set for five oh but i must not be at the table modest menti protested nonsense iris said you must make sure the prin cess behaves do you think i wish to bother doing it myself also gary realized it was best to keep their small party close together maybe the illusion folk were their friends but maybe they werent mentia the most sensible and re sponsible person among them needed to be kept close iris had evidently not forgotten that this was madness and what seemed pleasant could become otherwise in a hurry the five of them sat around a giant oval table while desi and hanna served them with a series of fancy courses there was white whine in elegant goblets fash ioned in the shape of the heads of little goblins there was head and tail lettuce there was pumpernickel bread in the form of shoes and coins with butterflies waiting to spread themselves on it there were purple stakes cut from the juiciest portions of the stakeout trees and quickly at the end there was hasty pudding when the illusion maidens were out of the room gary grabbed the chance to talk to iris what are we really eat ing he asked geis of the gargoyle stale squash pie and hard water she replied with a grimace he had suspected as much he preferred the illusion after the meal the maidens cleared the table do you wish your usual entertainment hanna inquired by all means hiatus said before the others could work up a sufficient degree of caution hanna and desi jumped up onto the table and began dancing first one took the stage as it were and then the other their feet were bare and their skirts flared as they turned showing their delicate but healthy lower legs in fact when they spun more rapidly some of their upper legs showed also gary found the sight increasingly intriguing the angle of view was such that it should soon be possible to see their enough of this nonsense iris snapped is there noth ing better to be seen yes as the dance progresses desi said pausing when we remove our costumes piece by piece that isnt what i mean iris said with increasing ire im sure no one cares about costumes speak for yourself queen iris hiatus said i find the view delightful and shall be happy to see the rest of it yea even to their wicked panties there was a faint flush in the air after his utterance of the provocative word the childs eyes grew large iris glanced angrily around at the others who else wants to witness this sorry spectacle surprise clapped her little hands gleefully i do she seemed just about ready to scramble onto the table herself but that would not be princessly mentia cautioned her oh pooh why do i have to be princessly i want to dance and throw my clothes away and show my princess menti said sharply supi realized that she had gone too far she subsided who else iris asked grimly gary would have liked to see the rest of the dance be geis of the gargoyle piers anthony cause he was coming to appreciate the pleasures of the hu man form but he realized that if he voted to see the dance that would make a majority and he did not want to embarrass iris so he practiced his diplomacy what are the alternatives the two maidens considered why we could tell a story desi said but usually the menfolk have preferred to see us dance and then never mind what then iris snapped what kind of story we have numerous tales of dragons and damsels hanna said of course those usually end sadly what about history mentia asked history both maidens looked perplexed the story of humankind in xanth leading up to this point iris said suddenly gary saw her purpose they were here to lo cate the philter and to do that they needed to understand the history of this ancient city they were getting dis tracted into entertainment instead it was time to orient on their quest yes the story of the city of hinge he said but thats so dull hanna protested dancing and dragons are much more interesting desi said yes surprise agreed eagerly history iris said firmly pictures surprise said animate it mentia suggested from the beginning in summary skipping the dull parts from the demon xanth on gary agreed the two maidens shrugged together then a picture formed around them occupying the center of the table it was of a desolate peninsula way back in the time of mi nus four thousand years give or take ten thousand or so before the xanth chronology proper commenced the de mon x arrived in this dreary and isolated place hannas voice said from somewhere within the scene he settled into the rock beneath and lost himself in contem plation his thoughts percolated through the caverns and made them very strange the picture showed a huge de mon seated on a boulder deep underground his head propped on one hand surrounded by wiggling snakelike thoughts he was oblivious to his surroundings desis voice said he did not move for thousands of years but there was a fringe effect his magic slowly spread outward from his body suffusing the rock causing the denizens of that region to become magical nickelpedes voles and rock dragons developed then the magic rock welled upward and reached the surface the scene showed a volcano spewing out hot stone then the creatures and plants of the surface became magical there were sea serpents in the water and tangle trees on land around the year minus twentytwo hundred a colony of human folk arrived from what was later to be called mundania hannas voice resumed the picture showed a ragged group of men and woman with their clinging chil dren they lacked magic so had a hard time at first in the picture a serpent slithered out of a lake encountered a man stared him in the eye until the petrifaction spell took hold breathed slimy vapor on him then swallowed him whole but their children delivered in xanth arrived with magic talents and that helped a huge serpent lifted its head to stare down a child but the little boy made his head swell until it was far too large for the serpent to swallow and the reptile had to give up in disgust so for several hundred years human folk migrated to the magic land preferring it once they learned how to sur vive in it desis voice said they moved to the area of greatest magic now known as the region of madness and their descendants became very talented magically indeed there were a number of full magicians and sorceresses not all of these were nice people one known as the sea hag was finally banished from human society and she dis appeared for several millennia but most remained to con tribute to the welfare of the main colony piers anthony however hannas voice said this influx was not necessarily peaceful life in xanth for those who learned to stay clear of dragons and similar creatures became rel atively easy because food could be conjured or simply plucked from obliging trees the picture showed a woman harvesting a fresh cherry pie from a cherry pie tree so the folk of xanth soon became moderately gen tle the people of the picture relaxed under pleasant trees but the incoming mundanes were hungry violent and often cruel desi said in the picture tough men with swords drove the relaxing folk away and took over the treeswhich they then chopped down of course those with magic could stop them but often they preferred to re treat rather than fight so they went to the hinterlands driven away by their barbarian neighbors such as my ancestors hannas voice said disapprov ingly then xanth became an island the picture showed the sea extending an arm across the top to cut it off we arent sure whether the demon x arranged it so as to have more privacy or whether it was coinci dence that cut off the inflow of pure humans and other mundane creatures peace was restored however it turned out the folk of xanth were con cerned that it might not always remain an island and when it returned to peninsula status there would be more brutal invasions worse because of the longer period without dan ger they felt it would be foolish simply to ignore the mat ter and hope for the best their children or grandchildren might pay a hideous price it might happen even if xanth remained an island forever because mundanes might use boats to cross to it so they gathered together and pon dered ways to protect themselves from invasion yet there was a problem while xanth remained an is land too the human population was diminishing at first no one realized that this was happening and then the rea son for it was not clear but finally they understood man kind was fissioning off into crossbreed species there were numerous magic springs including those with love geis of the gargoyle elixir any human who drank from one of these fell pas sionately into love with the first creature of the opposite sex he or she saw and proceeded to summon the stork with that creature the storks being literalminded crea tures delivered babies split evenly between the two species when those babies grew up they preferred cross breeds like themselves and so magically new breeds ap peared some humans changed size or form somewhat even without crossbreeding at this time there appeared the first harpies merfblk naga sphinxes fauns nymphs ogres goblins elves fairies werefolk and other cross breeds and variants all derived at least in part from hu man stock but many preferred not to admit that their lineage had been debased by such a connection and be came the enemies of pure human folk some human communities were able to make deals with gargoyles to purify their water so that no more of them were lost gary was jolted back into selfawareness at this point in the historical narration but sometimes there were misunderstandings or disagreements and the gargoyles would move on at other times foolish young humans would deliberately drink from love springs thinking them selves invulnerable to their effects some did it on dares whatever the reason their later offspring were lost to the core human species as time passed the human population slowly but steadily shrank finally the remaining humans realized that they had to address this problem they decided to collect the remnant of their pure human folk and live in a completely protected region so that there would be no further fissioning but they remained concerned about the other threat of inva sion from mundania for they saw that the water was slowly retreating in the north in time there would once more be a land connection and the brute mundanes would charge savagely down again overrunning xanth and over whelming the magic humans already there yet they did not want to prevent all immigration because they desper ately needed new pure human stock to replace what had piers anthony been lost to crossbreeding how could they address the problems of too much and too little at the same time from this dilemma came an answer that was to change the future history of xanth they decided to devise a mixed rampart of illusion and confusion to wall off xanth from mundania working from a special city in the one place this could be done the region of madness because only here was there magic of such intensity as to be able to power the special device they contemplated there should be few other species in this region and in any event they would make sure to have a gargoyle to protect their water supply they would wall the city in so that their foolish young could not readily go outside to imbibe mischief and dangerous creatures outside could not enter for there were indeed dangers here of more than the mor tal kind it was an act of special courage for the commu nity of mankind to come here thus came to be the greatest and most special city in all the history of xanth stone hinge the picture faded but we see you are tired and sleepy hanna said we must let you retire now and continue this history another time gary was satisfied to agree he found the story fascinat ing especially the parts concerning gargoyles but he needed to have some human sleep and time to ponder it all before he would be ready for much more he saw that the others had a similar sentiment so by common consent they departed the banquet hall and went upstairs to their chambers surprise was already asleep mentia had to carry her gary entered his suite and before he knew it he was asleep on the bed he was hardly aware of hanna helping him to get there his human body had a need of rest that his real body had not keystone in the morning gary woke refreshed but there was someone in the bed with him perplexed he lifted away the cover to discover it was hanna the hand maiden not only was she sound asleep she had lost her nightclothes he hadnt realized that she lacked a place to sleep he would have given her the bed if she had asked for it he was accustomed to sleeping on the ground though the human body required some cushioning that his natural body did not he got up carefully so as not to disturb her and tended to the various inconveniences of the fleshy human condi tion but he did wonder passingly how an illusion could be sleeping surely she should simply fade into nothingness when not consciousif she had any true consciousness at all and even if she did why should she be in his bed she must have her own place to sleep if she required sleep then he realized with a pang of guilt that she must have given him her own room that was why she now lacked a private place that explained why the chamber was so piers anthony geis of the gargoyle nice he would have to apologize for unwittingly displac ing her dressed and ready for the day he stood gazing at her she was certainly an aesthetic creature by human stan dards with a torso reminiscent of a sandglass fine long dark tresses firmly fleshed legs and fine facial features she made him think oddly of flying storksmany of them now there is an artful pose mentia remarked appear ing beside him whoever is grafting her seems to know what hes doing grafting her gary asked blankly you dont think illusions generate themselves do you someone is projecting likenesses of hanna and desi and hes pretty good at it of course he cant animate them both at once he cant but they were both with us last night didnt you notice how they took turns dancing and talking only one at a time was truly animate while the other was on autopilot on what a term derived from pilot fish who are good at navi gation they can do it in their sleep a sleeping fish may be moving but is not responsive to others thats the way the alternate maiden is right now desi is active seducing hiatus so hanna is on standby mode she glanced side long at him her eyes gravitating to the side of her face so that her head did not have to turn it might be interesting if you were to accept her seduction now to see what would happen possibly your hand would pass right through her body or maybe the touch would wake her that is attract the attention of her master to you so that he would animate her perhaps desi would have to turn off in the midst of her activity seduction mentia laughed and you did not realize as you did not with iris because you are a gargoyle but since we are in serious business here with possible danger i had better educate you a human woman never exposes any portion of her body between the elbows knees and neck acciden tally not when a man is present the more she shows the more interested in his reaction she is her eyes moved back to the front of her face i would judge that illusion hanna is about as interested in yours as she can be be cause that is what we demons term xrated not even any panties well of course i wouldnt have looked if there were panties gary said righteously i know the human con vention perhaps not enough of it panties represent the limit of what an unrelated male is supposed not to see what hanna is showing you now is beyond that limit i dont understand she smiled perhaps a bit wistfully innocence is such precious stuff she said irrelevantly for now just accept my word hanna is extremely interested in you but how can an illusion be interested in anything ah theres the rub she said lifting a hand to rub her face which rubbed out at that spot so for the moment she was missing half an eye illusions have no consciousness and therefore no will it simply means that whoever is grafting hanna wishes to seduce you being ignorant of your true nature perhaps it is some magically talented fe male who admires your looks a woman like iris theres another rub she said rubbing out the rest of the eye iris is the sorceress of illusion and is unique among human women in the nature and magnitude of her talent there is no other human woman like her but there may be some other kind of female with a similar though surely not identical talent of illusion she may like you but realize that you would not be interested in her true form so she tries to seduce you by means of a human il lusion this could not be iris herself it could be but i am almost sure it isnt at this mo piers anthony ment iris is sleeping which means that her illusions are on auto now i realize that this does not exclude hanna who is on auto now but it doesnt explain desi who is intrigu ingly active unless lord hiat is made of sterner stuff than i judge he will very shortly be discovering exactly how far an illusion can go i also have seen that iris denies grafting these particular illusions as she denies grafting last nights banquet and i have no reason to doubt her word in this respect she is privately quite curious and an noyed at this rival illusion which does seem to approach her own in power and finesse so i think iris is innocent apart from the fact that she evinces no interest in hiatus who is a pretty dull fellow whom she knew as an obnox ious child then who could it be or what could it be i fear we are encountering some thing mindboggling and the only reason it isnt boggling our minds is that we have next to no notion of its nature then what should we do play along until we do get boggled but im not here to get boggled im here to find the philter and we are here to help you albeit with our own di verse purposes also in mind and in that helpful spirit i suggest that you not do anything foolish such as trying to break up this massive structure of illusion because not only would that be likely to mess up your quest it could be dangerous in its own right we need to understand bet ter the nature of the entity with whom we are interacting before we do anything bold or devious there was as usual very good sense in what she said so we play along and stay alert he said and try not to let on about what we leam she agreed i consider it safe to talk candidly with you now only be cause i verified that the entitys attention is elsewhere at the moment hanna stirred gary and mentia exchanged a hasty geis of the gargoyle glance and she made a zipmouth gesture her mouth be coming a zipper then she faded so either hiatus seduction was complete or it had halted for some reason hanna was returning to animation and what should he do now he decided that it would be safer to take the initiative than to let her take it ah you are awake he said warmly i was glad to see you sleep so well after every thing you did yesterday now we can go to breakfast hanna seemed a trifle out of sorts yes of course she said after a moment she got out of bed spreading her bare legs in his direction when gary politely averted his gaze she made a little exclamation of modesty oh i am inadvertently indecent thank you for not looking pan ties appeared and then a prim day dress formed around her they stepped out into the hall hiatus was already there looking uncomfortable whats the matter gary asked hiatus shook his head if she had only been real i would have done it he muttered but i know the real desiree would never be like that not without marriage but before they could join the others and go down for another presumably sumptuous meal there wasan odd wavering in the scene oops hanna said a storm is coming mentia appeared something strange justoh i see you noticed hanna says a storm is coming gary told her hiatus shrugged a storm shouldnt bother a stone ed ifice much a madness storm hanna clarified we shall have to go into defensive mode hurry we cant stay in the build ing she led the way down the stairs almost at a run ill wake iris and surprise mentia said popping out gary and hiatus followed hanna out of the palace there was the ogre tromping up the others will be out in a moment hanna told him you can start now the ogre went to the outer wall of the castle and piers anthony pounded a fist against a stone panel the stone shook with the impact and the whole palace shuddered there were clicking sounds throughout iris and surprise emerged following a bouncing ball the ball took one last bounce then sprouted arms and legs in a moment a body filled in everyones out except desi mentia announced then desi appeared i am here she said gary glanced covertly at hanna she was standing still with no expression she was as mentia had pointed out on autopilot there was only one presence with alternat ing presentations he looked at the real people iris seemed understand ably harried but the child was unusually quiet probably the realization of the limit of her talent still depressed her she had thought she could do anything without limit and now knew that she could do anything only once perhaps gary had accomplished his tutoring with that discovery and surprise was now ready to go home once they found the philter the ogre pulled at the overhanging section of the palace roof the roof separated with widening cracks running up to the peak and radiating down from there then the ogre pushed up on the overhang and the rest of the roof section hinged down toward the ground the chamber beneath it collapsing into flatness the other palace sections shut down similarly they had thought that it would require a pair of ogres to fold these stones but perhaps this was an especially strong one or one ogre sufficed for a palace that was in large part illusion gary glanced again at the illusion maidens without be ing obvious and saw that now both were unmoving the animation was being focused on the ogre and the palace so this spectacle while impressive was not as extensive as it lookedand of course most of the scene was illusion anyway hanna came back to life we must go to the center cir cle she said there we will be safe geis of the gargoyle they followed her away from the folding palace along an avenue lined by large stone buildings being similarly compacted the whole vast city was being reduced to a se ries of folded stones but gary saw that all the other ogres working on other buildings followed exactly the pattern of the ogre working on the palace they were in lockstep or perhaps lock image more autopiloting and they worked only when hanna was walking in a straight line neither speaking nor gesturing so the illusion had limits as mentia had explained but who was directing it for what purpose this had started out as iris image of the ancient city based on garys reading of the rock pictures now another party was con tributing but why and what danger might there be meanwhile signs of the coming storm were growing winds were tugging at distant pennants and dust was stir ring into clouds obscuring the more distant buildings there was a faint keening getting louder the sky was overcast and turning troubled in the center of the city was a clear region and in the center of that was a round pool of clear water hanna re laxed we shall be safe from the storm here she said howso mentia asked the folded buildings may be able to withstand severe battering but this is exposed the battering is only partly physical desi said it is the madness that makes them vulnerable see she ges tured and they saw that one of the buildings had been missed either there werent enough ogres for them all or each ogre had several buildings to do and this one hadnt been done yet the dusty wind swirled around the buildingand the structure changed its stone turned translucent and faintly pink when a strong gust of wind pushed against it the building gave way like a mound of gelatin the madness changes things hanna said thats why we cant depend on the firmness of stone the struc ture will revert to stone after the storm passes but it may be deformed into some other shape if it remains intact piers anthony and it may not be much fun for the people in that building iris said wincing true desi said they may lose their lives or their sanity in which case they will not return to normal after the storm that still doesnt explain why it should be any better here iris said this inner circle is safe hanna said because the city of hinge is so designed that the pattern of folded buildings generates a madnessfree zone here magic within the circle is normal or below normal depending on the strength of the storm then why not simply live in the circle hiatus asked because when there is no storm the level of magic within the circle is very low desi said talents dont work ogres lose their strength crossbreeds get sick as their bodies try to separate into the components of their ancestry magic plants wilt or even die in short its like mundania mentia said a drear place of no magic yes hanna said and demons cant function at all mentia winced it was impressive her entire face drew back folding inward so that her nose inverted and dragged her eyes and mouth along after it i wont stay here after the storm is gone she said from the other side of her head but if you go out during the storm desi said you will be overloaded with magic and perhaps explode into a cloud of madness gary looked around so this is why the city is hinged so it can be shut down during madness storms and readily restored after they pass yes hanna agreed we suffer very few losses during the storms and these can be repaired so we are able to work well at all other times stone hinge protects us both with and without the madness this is very clever iris said appreciatively geis of the gargoyle do the individual buildings have similar effect gary asked that is reducing the madness yes desi said they ease the effect of the ambient background madness but their effect is limited they cant withstand a storm when not folded down iris glanced sharply at him how did you guess that i noticed that mentia was reverting to normal when i talked with her this morning her eyes traveled around her face and just now her face reversed itself thats part of her regular craziness she does such things without notic ing but when the madness is around us she usually in dulges in no such foolishness not even unconsciously hiatus nodded appreciatively gary you are smarter than the average the average young human man iris finished she might have been a bit crazy in the madness but was back to her sensible self here as she had been in the palace hi atus had reverted to his somewhat vacant innocence so had forgotten that they were trying not to speak of garys true nature isnt the average young man interested in shapely young women hanna inquired yes but sometimes a bit shy mentia said covering for him much as iris had would you believe that there are some who could see a maiden in the altogether and not immediately think of the stork yes iris said somewhat sourly im thirsty surprise said she left iris and ran to the pool she was back to her normal impetuosity gary had thought that her good behavior stemmed from her discov ery of the limit of her talent but now he realized that the surrounding madness could also have accounted for it wait dear iris cried pursuing her we dont know what kind of water that is it might be enchanted or poi son actually its a love spring desi said a love spring iris screeched she made a grab for the piers anthony child but was too late surprise had already plopped down beside the pool and put her face to the water but its the city supply hiatus said so it must be pure gary touched a finger to the water yes this is pure he agreed excited hanna looked sharply at him how do you know gary knew better than to give away his true nature i have a talent for reading water he said i know when it is pure this is exceptionally so surprise lifted her face yes its scrumshus for water hiatus stared at hanna you were having a little fun with us not telling us that this water is good yes desi said i have tried to have fun with you hiatus grimaced there are different kinds of fun this is a spring that is unaffected by the madness around it iris inquired doubtfully yes it rises by the keystone on the island in the cen ter hanna said keystone surprise said dont do any magic dear iris told her quickly yes the keystone is in the very center of hinge desi said as long as thats in place all is well impossible gary said this water is too pure to have percolated directly from the depths mentia looked at him sharply what are you suggest ing im suggesting that theres a gargoyle involved oho let me check mentia walked across the water to the little island in the center there was a fancy fountain there from which water gushed into the pool right she called back after a moment there is a gargoyle here gary dived into the water and swam in clumsy human manner to the island the fountain had a high stone foun dation surmounted by the fountain spout he walked around it until he found a door the door was closed but opened outward when he tried it within a short passage geis of the gargoyle angled upward curving he walked its length and finally saw what was in the center some keystone gary exclaimed but he was hardly displeased he had confirmed what he expected and in the process made a wonderful discovery it was a horrendous stone gargoyle spouting water a female gary gazed upon her hugely ugly countenance and stone contours and was instantly in love easy gary mentia murmured dont say anything we all might regret she seemed quite sane and sober now she meant that he should not announce his own nature lest the illusion folk of hinge overhear he wasnt sure why anyone else should care that he was a transformed gargoyle but he respected the demoness caution he nod ded the female gargoyle saw them she closed her throat shutting off the flow of clean water hello strangers she said are you real or illusion a bit of both mentia said quickly we are not nec essarily what we appear to be i for example appear hu man but i am a demoness she changed to the form of a striped green cloud for a moment illustrating her nature then reformed as human but apart from that we are real being two members of a party of five visiting the stone city of hinge that is a relief the gargoyle said its been so long since ive seen any but illusion folk she twitched her whiskers i am gayle goyle i am d mentia and i am gary gar gayles eyes fastened on him but before she spoke mentia did we prefer to leave it at that for now no fur ther introduction is needed gayle nodded though her eyes had narrowed perhaps that is best but i would ask of you one favor i dislike be ing fooled by illusions would you touch me gary so that i can verify that you are tangible piers anthony gladly gary said he stepped forward and put one human flesh hand on one of her stone lion paws the touch sent a thrill through him not only was she real she was desirable by the standard of his species and he knew that she recognized his nature through his touch for gargoyles did know their own and he knew she liked him do not let them know your nature she had spoken to him in his mind he hadnt realized that gargoyles could do that but of course it had been centuries since he had encountered another of his species he might have forgotten it is this intense magic that enhances my nature do not trust the illusions hanna appeared ah there you are meeting the gar goyle gary removed his hand reluctantly yes i wanted to be sure sheit wasnt more illusion to be sure the water really is pure mentia added the two of you would not be standing apart from each other if this spring retained its original nature hanna said with a smile love elixir doesnt affect demons mentia said a bit primly this spring might there is very strong magic here now gary became aware of it an aura like that of the madness but worse he had been so interested in the gar goyle that he hadnt realized that part of the magic of their touch stemmed from this but you said this was a safe circle mentia said strictly speaking its a safe torus hanna said are you conversant with the principle of a magnifying glass oh you mean the magic disk that sets fire to things mentia asked the same its magic focuses the light of the sun into a very small hot center but it takes light away from the re gion around that center so that region is in shadow sim ilarly the center circle of hinge takes magic from most of geis of the gargoyle that area and puts it in the focus island that makes the circle safe for most folk during storms but the island is dangerous not for me gayle said it has little effect on animate stone and i can purify what remains purging myself the demoness looked at the illusion so you make your safe haven by dumping the extra magic where it doesnt hurt anyone mentia said yes this is the keystone of our defense hanna said gayle has been here for the past several thousand years loyally purifying the water well its the geis of the gargoyle gayle said mod estly someone has to do it she wiggled an ear now if you dont mind i must return to work for the magic is building up it is pretty strong here that was perhaps the understatement of the millennium the strength of the magic here was appalling and gary knew that only the fact that he was a gargoyle himself and mentia a demoness enabled them to survive it without go ing utterly mad in fact if he didnt get away from it soon his human body would succumb anyway he couldnt be sure what would become of him then by all means gary said i congratulate you on your constancy thank you she sent one more glance his way then opened her mouth wide and resumed spouting they walked out of the fountain enclosure and closed the door then gary swam across the pool while hanna and mentia walked across it what did you see hiatus inquired a gargoyle mentia replied assuming gargoyle form big and ugly spouting water nothing to interest any of us the form fuzzed slightly as if not quite true to be sure iris agreed so gary was correct that is what keeps this water pure otherwise it would be ex tremely risky for any of us to drink from it gary emerged from the pool he realized that he felt different he was of course excited by the discovery of gayle goyle but it was more than that the magic had di geis of the gargoyle piers anthony minished it had indeed been intense and now was ordi nary but there was still something else you swam in your clothing iris remarked tartly youre all wet oh that was it well get out of those things iris said youll catch new monia which can proceed on into middle monia and even old monia if neglected yes lets see you in the altogether mentia said rolling her eyes right over the top of her head we are already all together gary protested he knew that human folk were supposed to be clothed i will clothe you in illusion iris said you can strip off your wet things under it a barrel appeared around him it wasnt real for he could pass his hands right through it but it looked solid he stripped off his clothing beneath it he had to admit that the clothing had become uncomfortable in his natural state he never used clothing so he tended to forget about it iris stooped to pick up his fallen sodden things no fair peeking mentia said her eyes stretching out from her face in the manner of a snails the sorceress turned her face away from the base of his barrel frowning it occurred to gary that she might indeed have been about to peek she was back to normal too in this reduced magic circle which meant she was looking for the excitement and irresponsibility of youth yet she also was acting like a mother who had raised a willful daughter insisting that wet clothing be changed if the madness increased she would become more like the daughter and less like the mother and perhaps the mad ness was increasing because he could see that the storm was intensifying beyond the rim of the circle indeed a sharp gust of wind cut across the circle it passed through his barrel as if it werent there and chilled his flesh in toward the bone he shivered which he real ized was his human bodys reaction to the discomfort oh you poor thing mentia said you need a warm blanket she dissolved into vapor and the vapor formed into a bright polka dot blanket and the blanket slowly sank toward the ground then undulated sinuously and moved toward him it came up under the barrel and wrapped itself around his cold bare torso one fold of it tweaked his behind he would have protested but realized that the blanket really was comfortingly warm then we wont be needing the barrel iris said dis gruntled the barrel vanished leaving him in the blanket but we shall have to get this clothing dry we have a sun screen hanna said a small square screen appeared glowing faintly desi picked it up and set it right at the edge of the safe circle a sun screen gary asked perplexed where do you think the sun goes when its not on duty desi asked rhetorically it retires to its sun house constructed of sun blocks and drinks sundaes from sun glasses we borrowed the pattern of one of its screens is all the sun will never miss it you can borrow things from the sun hiatus asked as surprised as the others we illusions are not as limited in imagination or per formance as are you nonillusion folk hanna said this is of course an illusion copy of the screen the blanket around gary opened a mouth how can an illusion screen dry real clothing this is a pretty strong illusion desi said this made sense to gary who remembered how iris il lusion lamp had made real light iris shrugged and brought the clothing to the screen she held up garys limp shirt stretching it out flat the sun screen brightened in fact it became so bright that it was difficult to look at it so gary looked at the shirt instead steam was rising from it then iris dropped it oh she cried my hands are getting scorched fortunately its already dry hanna said picking up geis of the gargoyle piers anthony the shirt come and put it on gary she stood at the edge of the circle holding the dry shirt up and how can an illusion pick up a real object the blanket asked were pretty strong illusions now too desi said picking up the undershorts she held them before the sun screen which brightened again gary walked to hanna ooo the blanket said that magic is strong at the fringe in fact its dangerous i tell you this in utterly sincere sanity but the shirt is warm and dry hanna said holding it out let me put it on you gary stood before her with the blanket sliding down somewhat and she set the shirt on him passing it over one arm and then the other her hands were firm and gentle the shorts were dry desi brought them over hanna took them and helped put them on him this is weird the blanket said floating away finally the trousers were ready gary insisted on putting them on himself they were warm and dry too mentia reformed in her usual image what is going on here she demanded how can you two illusions be physical a stronger illusion is merely a clearer more de tailed one not a physical thing note that we are standing near the fringe of the circle desi said the storm has intensified the magic and it is now more powerful outside the circle than any normal per son can handle so strong that it even lends the semblance of substance to some illusions that seemed to make sense but now gary remembered how hanna had massaged him in his room in the palace her hands had felt quite solid then also the covers of his bed had been supported by her body when she was sleep ing there in the morning she might have been on auto pilot but shouldnt her substance have faded then the illusions were capable of some solidity even when they werent at the fringe of a storm mentia went to stand at the fringe of the circle she put an arm out into the madness beyond it is stronger out side she said soberly but not nearly as strong as in the gargoyles chamber nothing matches that strength hanna said it too varies with the ambient magic but it is always by far the strongest on the surface of xanth it enables the gargoyle to purify highly enchanted water thus we make a virtue of excess the magic we dont want in the main circle helps provide the water that makes the circle safe meanwhile hiatus was gazing out at the city it is re ally strange out there he said the others looked indeed it was strange all the build ings were now affected by the madness they had been compacted by the folding process but were swaying and twisting in the winds of the storm their colors were shift ing constantly and some were stretching and bobbing as if pulled or banged by a giant unseen hand snow was flying in one section mounding up on and around the structures burying them in green red yellow and plaid ice was forming in another coating the stones so thickly that they scintillated but elsewhere the swirling clouds seemed to be producing black and white sand which outlined the sharp angles of the stones making them stand out in stark relief the storm swept right up to the edge of the circle but was unable to penetrate it the stone structures seemed to be the pedestals supporting an invisible dome that arched over land pool and island marked by the sudden change in the aspect of the storm the rampaging winds formed themselves into a kind of funnel broad at the top narrow at the bottomand the tip was right at the island within the funnel was the color of madness too compelling even to look at for more than an instant while outside it was the calm of the protected area this construction truly is a wonder iris murmured ap preciatively i never dreamed that such a city ever ex isted naturally not desi said hinge is excluded from the geis of the gargoyle piers anthony realm of dreams dreams are mad enough already without being fouled up by storms of madness how long do these storms last hiatus asked not long hanna said this one is already waning i dont see it raining hiatus said you are so clever desi said making an illusory effort to look appreciative the storm is diminishing oh soon we will be able to restore the city and return to more comfortable surroundings hanna said something had been bothering gary and now it sur faced all this is interesting he said but it is not ac complishing our purpose what is your purpose desi asked we are looking for the philter both illusions froze for a moment then both came back to life we thought you were interested in the history of xanth hanna said we are ins said but that is a means to an end the end is the philter which will free the gargoyles of their geis we understand that the philter is somewhere in this city hanna exchanged a glance with desi both seemed dis turbed gary wondered again how illusions could have feelings he also noticed that though the two still alter nated speech they were now acting at the same time the heightened magic at the edge of the circle was enhancing them in several ways we wouldnt know about that desi said but maybe we can help you find out how gary asked eagerly hanna met his gaze her face serious you know that desi and i are illusions our roles are limited we can show you only what we know if you want to know more you must get seriously into your roles what are you talking about mentia asked from the circles edge very seriously you have the roles but you arent truly into them desi said you are not living them the roles hiatus said you mean like my being hiat the hedonist yes hanna said a sinister man who argues self interest but whose true loyalty is shrouded and iri the irate iris said the imperious queen menti the mentor surprise said loyal nanny for supi the super governess not nanny mentia said firmly and gar the good gary said though i cant see that i fit any such role they are the ones who made the xanth interface desi said when you live their lives perhaps you will have what you desire not so fast iris said exactly where did you two il lusions come from why are you here showing us around and explaining things we are animations of the madness hanna said drawn from images of two who thought of you at the time we were formulated we know you have a job to do and we are here to help you do it what job iris demanded that we are unable to explain desi said but it is surely important or you would not have come here we came here to find the philter gary repeated both illusions shook their heads you may have thought you did but there must have been a deeper pur pose hanna said you must discover that purpose and honor it mentia was thoughtful you were assigned a job by the good magician gary he always has some devious pur pose in mind and he almost never lets anyone else know about it maybe we do indeed have a mission we have not realized it did make obscure sense then lets do what we have to do to get it done gary said both illusions smiled do it when you return to the t piers anthony palace desi suggested you may find it a significant ex perience she darted a look at hiatus and gary almost thought he saw stork wings propelling the look along it was clear that she had not given up on lord hiat then he glanced at hanna and definitely saw wings on her returning glance but he wasnt interested because he had found a gargoyle the storm passed and soon the ogres were out again unfolding the buildings nothing seemed to have come un hinged and the city was returning to its former splendor at least they now knew the reason for its odd construction it was time to return gary took a last covert longing look at the isle where gayle goyle was hidden he in tended to see her again when he could manage it interface as they entered the palace a rumble from gars hu man stomach reminded him that they hadnt eaten recently the storm had distracted them as they were about to go to breakfast lets go directly to the banquet hall he suggested brilliant notion iri agreed without irony which was unusual for her im famished brunch will be served presently hanna said just take your seats she and desi bustled off into the kitchen the five of them sat around the huge table iri glanced significantly after the two illusions and spoke in a low tone can we trust them no gar said remembering gayle goyles warning i will spy on them mend said to make sure they are out of hearing she vanished gar shrugged getting into his role of educated person it is not as if we are able to conceal our activity from the servants he pointed out and why should we have any concern about their motives geis of the gargoyle piers anthony hiats smile almost resembled a sneer always the pos itive outlook eh gar he remarked gar concealed his irritation lest he spoil his reputation in some other setting he would have liked to present the man with an item he had once seen a punching bag this was an innocent paper sack that looked as if it contained something interesting but when a person opened it a box ing glove shot out and punched him in the snoot at any rate it is best that we proceed with our business expedi tiously we shall need the servants assistance as we are unable to handle all the details ourselves we are simply too few in number its that infernal crossbreeding the queen said scowl ing theres absolutely no excuse for it as the gargoyle is reliable and no elixirpollution enters the citys water supply the fools must be sneaking out of town and drink ing carelessly they think its a myth or that theyre invul nerable or they just dont care hiat shrugged this is the nature of youth to be wild and gambling and full of potent juices he eyed iri sug gestively you look young yourself cousin do you not feel the urge iri flushed angrily your impertinence does not amuse us cousin were your contribution not essential to the project i would find a pretext to have you banished hiat made a rather too windy mock sigh ever the can tankerous royal presence is it such an imposition to sug gest that on rare occasions you take half a moment to relax that would surely improve your disposition queen iri merely glared at him but princess supi evinced her amusement with a girlish giggle it was fun to hear the adults cutting each other up verbally menti reappeared caution warning brunch is arriv ing she settled into her place hanna and desi appeared with covered platters these turned out to bear eggons lined with bakeons and bake offs potatoe puncakes sinnerman toes and red yellow and orange juice gar decided to accept it without ques tion suspecting that he wouldnt like the answer menti did not eat but that wasnt noticeable because she was kept busy catering to the princess hiat and iri seemed to enjoy their repasts when they were done desi approached are my lords and ladies ready to retire to the observatory for the days tutoring session certainly iri snapped did you think we were about to go out bean harvesting i am sure they did not think that hiat said his tone suggesting that only an idiot would have raised the issue its past season for those hasbeans the little princess tittered and lord hiat favored her with a conspiratorial smile it was clear that the two got along well at the expense of other members of the group the rogue relative and the child the observatory was a dome in the upper section of the palace shaped like a giant eyeball they could focus it on almost anything in the line of sight and that turned out to be a fair amount of xanth because it was above the height of the city wall they could see beyond the region of madness to the rocks and rills of normal xanth where harpies perched in trees merfolk swam in rivers and lakes and many other crossbreeds and variants disported them selves but there were no straight human folk in view they had crossbred their species out of existence in xanth except for the desultory remnant here in stone hinge hanna appeared and here are my lords notes she said opening a cabinet containing an assortment of scrolls thank you gar said gruffly he addressed supi do you recall the essence of yesterdays lesson not at all master tutor the child replied smirking harrumph then we shall have to go over it again he unrolled a scroll id rather go harvest hasbeans hush child menti murmured dont sass lord gar like that r geisof the gargoyle piers anthony supi turned a pair of eyes big with naughty innocence on her then how should i sass him nanny governess menti said patiently perhaps i can offer a suggestion hiat said his devi ous smile implying nothing proper perhaps you can stuff it up your nose the queen retorted harrumph gary repeated importantly i shall now review the lesson material the princess opened her mouth for a sass but it was in tercepted by a glare from the queen and had to be stifled supi made a face evidently the sass had a bad taste when held too long in her dear little mouth hiat turned away ostentatiously bored with the proceedings menti relaxed seeing that the lesson was getting under way at last the lesson concerned the proper formulation of the spell for the interface of xanth the artisans of the city of hinge had been working on it for centuries tediously per fecting its every trifling detail and now at last it was ready to be invoked it consisted of a thin veil of repulsion around the west south and east coasts of the peninsula of xanth so that no mundanes would even think to cross into magic territory in fact they would not even realize that they had turned away from it they would just avoid it satisfied that there was nothing there of interest or they might label it as some kind of void a shivery sensation a scare square or a shimmery circle those boats that man aged to cross over into magic territory would be assumed to be lost in storms it was good protection boooring the princess muttered yawning it was clear that she was not the most avid scholar and that there was nothing here of interest to her either it was as if she were surrounded by her own little repulsion veil the north side of xanth which was now rejoining the ugly mainland of mundania because of the disappearance of the inlet of the sea would be covered by a veil of slightly different texture illusion it would make it seem that xanth remained an island separated from the mun dane coast by sharkfilled water sharks were the mundane equivalent of small sea serpents real sea serpents could not be used because they were magical and there was to be no hint of magic lest some idiotic mundane put one and one together and realize that magic existed however since it probably was not possible to eliminate the whiff of magic entirely the spell would deflect its seeming position somewhat so that the magic seemed to be off to xanths east in the middle of the sea it would generate another scary feeling a brrr mood supi exclaimed forgetting her boredom for half an instant better that response than a closed mind gar realized yes a brrrmood triangle in the sea to make mundanes nervous about the region without ever quite being able to fathom why very good supi brrr mood triangle she repeated pleased but since they did need to allow some access to mun danes because they were needed to replenish the human stock of xanth distressing as the prospect was there would be one small section of apparent access this would be at the northwestern tip of xanth as far from the rest of the peninsula as possible it was hoped that this would give the mundanes time to leam the ways of xanth as they made their inept way on into it and to have some children who would have magic talents thus becoming true xanth natives by the time these new colonists got down to cen tral xanth they might even be bearable many of them would of course be eaten by dragons along the way which was another consolation dragonfbod the princess cried clapping her little hands chomp chomp she was beginning to get into the lesson but even this very limited access had to be restricted because otherwise it would be like a pot with a hole in it endless slop could pour through here was where the most sophisticated portion of the interface was to come it would neither repel nor delude intruders it would instead geis of the gargoyle piers anthony displace them somewhat in time thus they would be con fused when they entered xanth and probably would not manage to come through in force this portion of the in terface being small would be hard to find and deceptive in its effect deceptive hiat inquired becoming interested despite his disdain for the proceedings folk merely pass through it so time differs on the other side how are they to know or care about the difference gar wondered about that himself he perused the scroll because its effect differs depending on the side you start from he said a mundane crossing into xanth has no control over the time in xanths history he enters when he crosses back he has no control over the time or place in mundania he returns to it seems random so he is likely to be lost he cant enter xanth return home fetch his family or friends and reenter xanth where he left it this makes mundane intrusion in force difficult but what about the waves menti asked oh be quiet you ignorant nanny iri muttered there wont be any waves for another thousand years governess menti said chastened of course there could be groups of mundanes crossing together gar said so that families can come to xanth without getting split apart but they cant cross back and forth without risking great confusion it seems like a rea sonable compromise to restrain mundane entry without stopping it altogether still doesnt sound deceptive to me hiat grumbled but the answer was in the scroll when natives of xanth with magic talents crossed the interface they could go to any time or place in mundania they wished with certain restrictions for example there had to be a peninsula in that region of mundania because the interface was at tached to the peninsula of xanth and had a natural affinity for the form it was also necessary to pay attention to the sea near the interface which changed colors when it was red the crossing would be to a peninsula near a red sea or tide of mundania when it was black it would be to a black sea when green a green sea or maybe a green land by the sea i want to go to a plaid sea supi said dont get anachronistic iri said it will be three thousand years before plaid makes its impression on xanth the child daunted by the impossibly complicated word anachronistic which no one in her right mind could un derstand settled back into good behavior furthermore the interface would lock on to a xanth native and when that person returned to xanth after an ex cursion anwherewhen in mundania he would be exactly where he left it and exactly when he would have been had he spent the time in xanth without crossing so if he spent one day in mundania he would return one day later in xanth if he spent a year he would return a year later so crossing the interface would not disrupt him or his associ ations in xanth it would be just as if he had visited an other part of xanth for that time unless for some devious reason he preferred to return at another time in which case it was possible if he was lucky the interface in short would be kind to xanthians but wheres the deception hiat demanded he seemed obsessed with the matter gar delved into the scroll again because it treats xanthians differently from mundanes he said if a xan thian crosses into mundania he will say that there is no problem going backbecause there is none for him but if the mundane then crosses to xanth and back he may be totally lost in some other time or place oho hiat said liking it but as gar read further he discovered another aspect of the situation mundanes it seemed spoke many different languages it wasnt clear why they hampered themselves in this manner but the fact was that a mundane from one section could rarely converse with one from another sec tion when a xanthian entered mundania he too was piers anthony unable to understand the speech but when a mundane en tered xanth he spoke the common language of xanth be ing magically converted so probably the deception would occur when a mundane was in xanth talking to a native who thought that it was safe to cross either way the mun dane would then cross backand wish he hadnt yes indeed hiat agreed a very nice feature suit ably treacherous queen iri shot a dark glance at him but he fended it off without effort the folk of hinge had spent several centuries perfecting the details of the interface it had been endlessly compli cated to work out and refine each aspect with many false starts for example they had made and tested prototypes of the interface and had folk cross repeatedly back and forth discovering the effects they had thought that groups would cross close together but when one mun dane member of a group hung back for a look at an in teresting flower he had landed in a sea of mundane blue grass instead of the blueskied region the others entered so a special detail spell had to be devised that caused the interface to recognize the various members of a xanth party and keep them together even if they werent physi cally or temporally quite together all in all a great deal of parchment scroll was used up in the course of perfect ing such details now it was time to invoke the masterspell for the inter face because if they lost one more person it would no longer be possible to do queen iri would craft the illusion aspect while lord hiat would craft the roots the interface would grow to anchor itself securely and the antennae it needed to sense those who passed through it demoness menti would provide the demonly substance it needed as well as popping back and forth to make sure it was being set up exactly right she could do what the others could not check the actual location of the parts of the interface all around xanth as they formed princess supi though the littlest of the people had the biggest magic she would make the raw magic essence of the interface giving it geis of the gargoyle strength to perform and endure forever and ever gar was the organizer making sure that all the others were coordi nated and that the spell was being crafted exactly right for it had to be done right because once it was done it was set and could be changed only in multiples of a thousand years this was to prevent idle tinkering after the installation if they made any trifling mistake during the compilation of the spell that error would be almost for ever locked into the interface because there might never be another group capable of fixing it if they made a big mistake the work of centuries might turn out to be for nothing this was the major reason why the education of the princess was so important she had the most powerful magic but was the least responsible person she was at once their greatest strength and weakness so do you understand the importance of your participa tion princess gar inquired sternly after we compile the interface our job is done and we can all relax then you can play all you want to in whatever way you want to but first we must save xanth from possible mundane invasion he expected resistance but to his surprise the child agreed i can use each talent only once so i want to make my magic count in the most important way supi said this is the way but princess hiat protested that will use up most of your magic you will be left a shell of your former self magically all that will be left for you to do will be to grow up into a dull irritable adult like your mother dont you want to save your magic for your lifelong pleasure what the side are you on cousin iri rapped using one of the dreaded fourletter words that no child was supposed to hear however gar realized that this was back in xanths dark prehistoric age before the adult conspiracy took firm hold the primitive folk of that time simply didnt know any better are you deliber ately trying to subvert the effort of the centuries what side supi asked intrigued by the slight scorch geis qf the gargoyle piers anthony marks and vilesmelling smoke the forbidden word had left in its wake no side dear mend said rolling her eyes right over her head my lady the queen merely misspoke herself she sent a properly subservient warning glance at iri i am on the side of enlightened selfinterest and com mon sense lord hiat said as for that word my lord hiat is being facetious gar said quickly that is he is joking of course he supports the great and important effort we are making he sent a challenging look at hiat who arranged to turn away just before it ar rived so that it bounced harmlessly off the back of his head but privately gar wondered exactly what was with lord hiat that he continually sought to distract supi from her vital dedication to the project the matter was compli cated enough without such interference im confused supi said you would not be dear if you could see it through my eyes iri said okay supi crossed her eyes no gar cried but too late queen iris eyes crossed and for a moment she looked almost like the child what was happening then supi spoke up again oh i do understand now that ive seen through your eyes you are trying to do the right thing and to you it looks as if lord hiat isnt but maybe he doesnt really mean it you hope yes dear iri agreed looking both discomfited and impressed you did see through my eyes but please dont use up any more of your magic frivolously gee yes its a good thing i didnt use the talent of switching places with you an excellent thing iri agreed quickly in any event we cant accomplish it today hiat said we must do it only at the height of a major magic storm and we must be in the center of the magic focus gar agreed where the gargoyle is ah wonderful thought to visit her again but now you must rest hanna said to be prepared for the supreme effort when the time comes gar was glad enough to agree these tutoring sessions tended to be emotionally fatiguing and actually the prin cess already knew what she needed to the moment an other storm came they would be ready to act they retired to their several chambers from which they would emerge later for the evening banquet his chamber had been cleaned during his absence he saw the last rug bee departing from the spotless rug on the floor gar sought to lie down on his bedbut hanna was there be fore him having somehow lost her clothing again dont you have a bed of your own handmaiden he asked her somewhat shortly if i have taken yours i apol ogize and will seek another place of repose why should i need one she asked in turn im an il lusion then what are you doing on my bed i hope to help you relax by making me signal the stork with you i can relax better in your absence no you cant youre all tense and tight from the bur den of the tutor session you need help to relax fully no im not no i dont she sat up her upper torso changing its outline as she did so it did make him think of storks and the notion was increasingly intriguing after all this was a human body perhaps he should explore its potentials yes you are yes you do maybe it would be simplest just to oblige her but sev eral things made him wary first she was an illusion which meant that her half of the activity would not be real even if it should seem real to him and how could it seem real when he couldnt actually touch her but she had touched him more than once that was another mystery he was unsatisfied with the strong magic explanation piers anthony as the magic was of about normal level here second he was a gargoyle and there was a gargoyle he would much prefer to be with whether indulging in stork summoning or anything else if only he had his natural stone body back third he didnt trust her motive werent there other ways she could help him relax why did she insist on this that region of doubt loomed larger as he pondered it what did he know of these illusions anyway something had to be making them and he was satisfied that it wasnt the queen if iri wanted to seduce him right now she would be here in her own young body he did not want to play the illusions game without understanding their pur pose perhaps you are right he said however i prefer to relax in my own fashion if you will not let me rest alone i shall simply ignore you he walked to the bed and lay down beside her closing his eyes then i shall massage you she decided she put her hands on his shoulders and started kneading it felt good very good so he rolled over to let her do his back as well but that reminded him of one of his questions how is it that you an admitted illusion can touch me here where the magic is of normal level she laughed you can touch me too if i wish you to we are in the region of madness and though the palace reduces the power of magic somewhat so as not to dis comfit you we do draw on it for our purposes such as fix ing food and helping you at the moment i am making only my hands solid but i could with a special effort make most of my torso solid too for a little while if you should wish to clasp it that answered one of his questions but not the others so he tried another why are you trying to seduce me i am merely trying to satisfy you if a massage is all you wish then that will suffice but if you should change your mind i am sure i can be all that you might wish that he doubted but then his doubt wavered she was geis of the gargoyle an illusion in human form couldnt she assume some other form suppose she chose to resemble a gargoyle but he did not want her to do that he already knew the gargoyle he wanted to be with and there was his third question a massage will do nicely thank you who is grafting you desi and i are merely your servants she said her hands moving down his back we wish only to for a moment step out of the role he said you are helping us reanimate the distant past what of the pres ent we are animations of the ambient madness she said we are here to help you so you said before but i doubt that madness animates itself to please intruders there must be some person ani mating you directing your images and responses who is that person some other person she asked sounding bewildered you are an illusion you have no being of your own you are merely an image a voice and a pair of hands be ing projected for my benefit who is projecting you i can not answer that any more than you can say who is projecting you i know my creator no more than you know yours gar considered that and realized that she had a point who among the living could know the true source of his life so though he wasnt satisfied with her answer he re alized that she had found a refuge from his curiosity we have learned much about the origin and purpose of the ancient stone city of hinge he said but this has not brought us closer to the completion of our mission but surely it has she protested as she worked in his legs she was certainly good at this you have to come to understand a great deal when you grasp it all you will know the answer to your quest perhaps he said not entirely satisfied he just wasnt quite comfortable with evasive illusions but her hands were so soothing that he was soon asleep geis of the gargoyle piers anthony several days later another storm came they were ready the five of them hurried out as the city hinged into its de fensive configuration going to the protected circle and its mad island gar had wanted to go there before but every time he thought he had a chance to sneak out one of the illusions happened by he did not want to give away his nature so could not go while they were watching it was frustrating but now there was reason and he would see gayle goyle again the storm was fierce they barely made it to the circle before the buildings sprouted stone tentacles and tried to grab them in the manner of tangle trees it was all the ogres could do to get the buildings folded down into their secure formats even the safe circle was highly charged they could all feel the madness laying siege to them this was a fero cious storm what would it be like on the island we must link hands and hold tight menti said grimly supported by each other we can survive the intense mad ness but if anyone lets go we shall be lost the others nodded knowing it was true they linked hands forming a circle gar was between menti and iri with hiat and supi completing it beyond them the intan gible pressure eased it was as if they were stones making their own protected space the madness battered at their backs but their faces were calm they came to the pool we cant swim while holding hands gar said we wont have to menti said supi this is the occa sion for that spot spell we discussed yes the child said she was neither mischievous nor childish now she was as deadly serious as the others she turned her head and glanced crosseyed at the pool done this way iri said stepping toward the water and bringing the others along with her they stepped on the water and it was firm like a slightly yielding mat they walked across holding their circle when they reached the island they had to flatten the cir cle so as to enter the inner passage gar found himself pressed face to face against iri but there was nothing re motely seductive about it her face was tense and her pu pils oscillated from pinpoint to enormous and back again constantly he suspected that his own were doing the same they entered the inner chamber gayle halted her spout ing you are here she said you are at the center menti said we must surround you but to do that we must break the circle gar said put your hands on me gayle said i am proof against the madness and will secure you for this time they broke the circle cautiously putting their hands on her and moving around her until she was the center of a new circle now the worst intensity of madness was at their faces blasting outward like an intangible furnace gar knew that they would not be able to endure this long but they didnt need to now i craft the illusion of the template queen iri said within their circle appeared a vertical column trans lucent like a wall surrounding gayle now i give it substance supi said concentrating the illusion became tangible scintillating like a living thing the madness diminished it was being absorbed by the cir cular wall now i give it roots and antennae hiat said and the wall became firmer below and more sensitive above now i give it demonly presence to guide it where it must go menti said and the column took on further an imation and now i direct it to go out to surround xanth itself gar said on the count of three all of us will send it there he paused making sure they were ready one two three piers anthony the column expanded leaping outward it passed them and disappeared but they could sense its progress because of its demonly awareness in a moment there was a feeling of a shudder and of settling it is done menti said the interface has been set in place yes gar agreed now we must extricate ourselves as well as we can for the madness though much dimin ished by the energy absorbed by the interface remained intense must you go so soon gayle asked wistfully we must mend said we can not endure this mad ness long but perhaps i can visit when the storm has passed gar said that will be nice gayle said they shifted around breaking and reforming their circle and wending their way deviously out to the lake they crossed it and stood in the protected circle the lessening of the intense magic was a relief the storm was fading they stood and watched as it cleared and the ogres unfolded the buildings then they returned to the palace gar knew that they had accom plished something truly significant but he would need at least one good nights sleep and perhaps several days re flection before he truly understood it discovery ill just pop off to make sure the interface is in good order menti said vanishing and the rest of you can simply relax desi said taking hiatus hand the two illusions had not accompa nied them to the center of magic gary wondered whether they had taken advantage of the occasion to have a private dialogue but suspected that they had simply faded out for the duration gary retired to his room fatigued by their recent mag ical effort but as he sought to relax on his bed queen iris appeared sh she said putting her finger to her lips i want to talk with you while desis taken with hiatus hanna is out of action now isnt she i believe so he agreed shes not here at the mo ment and if she were shed be unanimated they usually cant animate at the same time i know except when the magic intensifies so im us ing my own illusion to contact you gary was surprised youre an illusion i took you for real geis of the gargoyle piers anthony thank you she stepped forward and held out one hand he touched itand passed through it but if you prefer i can plant the illusion in my chamber and come here in person no need he wasnt sure what she had in mind and her illusion self was likely to mean less mischief we have learned a lot and i value it iris said i find it easy to identify with my current persona but we have not accomplished our mission thats right gary agreed we havent located the philter and i think we wont as long as we depend on the two foreign illusions they have done everything to help us learn about anything except that and they have done it with such finesse that we havent noticed yes he agreed seeing it hannas been trying to dis tract me every night and succeeding no there was no seduction succeeding in her mission of distracting your atten tion iris clarified she looked thoughtful id like to know her technique persistence he said you tried to seduce me only once and stopped when i demurred she merely gives me a massage and tries again another day she arranges to show me her fair bare body often as if by accident oh like this iris inquired her gown fading out gary contemplated her nude torso yes like that i must say your body is even better formed than i thought i enhanced it she confessed my real body looks more like this the elaborate contours simplified some what still quite appealing for a human he said if i hadnt met gayle persistence she said her robe reappearing thank you but at the moment im here on business i want to accomplish our mission and i think we shall need to di vert the illusions in order to succeed she paused gazing at him thoughtfully would it be too much to ask that you let hanna do it you mean to seduce you so that her attention will be taken up while menti and i do some serious searching of our own you think you can find the philter im not sure but i think we shall never find it if we continue to depend on those two illusions for informa tion she had a point but what about right now desi is with hiatus and and she has influenced him in a sinister manner havent you noticed we can not trust him in this context she had another point i really dont care to mentia appeared theres a problem with the inter face she announced tersely it oops iris said they both vanished gary looked around hanna had appeared ive ne glected you my lord she said smiling with false cheer gary hoped that iris and mentia had gotten clear in time to avoid detection he would have liked to talk with them longer but he did have the gist of their concerns which he shared they needed opportunity to search for the philter in this ancient context and to check the interface closely without any participation by the two illusions from mad ness evidently desi had finished with hiatus once he was asleep hanna could concentrate on gary he needed to take up her attention so that iris and mentia could take their search farther but the thought of being seduced by hanna simply did not appeal to him it was gayle he wanted to be with yet he did not want to betray his real nature by being open about that gayle herself had warned him not to he looked at the illusion what was he to do i know you are really worn after your effort hanna said approaching him i know just how to relax you piers anthony her gown went translucent then transparent showing him the form that had become increasingly alluring despite his better understanding of her nature he was becoming en tirely too human for comfort she wanted to distract him and he wanted to distract her all he had to do was let her do it but he lacked the desire in a certain way im not sure she stepped into him and kissed him on the mouth caught by surprise and somewhat off balance he grabbed on to her to steady himself his hands landed on her nar row back and plump rear both were rather interesting in their fashions she had said she could make herself as solid as she needed to be and she was doing so now the illusion of sight had been augmented by the illusion of touch maybe her body was a mere shell without innards and her mind did not exist but that did not seem to make much difference at the moment yet it was her mouth that commanded his main atten tion what an interesting sensation this firm pressure of lips on lips generated he had never realized how nice it could be she drew back a bit let me take off your robe she murmured her hands went to it drawing it clear of his shoulders and body as she did this he looked at the front of her body realizing just how intriguing it was he had thought he lacked the desire but he had not really given it a proper chance this was not an objectionable process at all let her do it he would help her do it in a moment she had him bare and was embracing him again now his interest was intensifying in the manner of a storm of madness all his prior cautions faded like for gotten illusions he just wanted to proceed with what she had in mind maybe on the bed she murmured in his ear go to the bed he would have leaped out the window with her if she suggested it now he moved eagerly to the bed and flung himself down on it with her geis of the gargoyle suddenly they had company the queen and governess had returned ixnay iris said get out of here you nuisance gary retorted separate mentia said tugging at him go away hanna cried seeming even more annoyed than gary this isnt your business yes it is iris said putting her hands on the handmaid ens bare shoulders but her hands passed right through the seeming flesh without effect iris might or might not be il lusion at the moment but hanna was she could be touched only when and where she chose to be get away from her mentia told gary shes defi nitely not for you how would you know he demanded struggling to free himself from her hold demons dont love thats why we can be rational about the matter this pseudocreature is deadly mentia hauled harder with considerable strength begone hanna screamed so maybe i cant touch you most places iris said but i can stop you from touching him where it counts she put her hands on the illusions torso they passed through of course and came to the edge of garys body now gary could no longer feel hannas torso either hanna could make parts of her body seem solid but not for one person only as a result there was nothing to hold him close and mentia was able to pull him away hanna shrieked making the air turn bilious then feel thisi her hands formed into large sharp claws and her face sprouted long fangs she leaped at iris but mentia popped away from gary and appeared be tween iris and hanna the claws sank into demon flesh and caught there as if embedded in a thick mat you cant hurt me you horror the demoness said but i may hurt you if you dont let go ill break your nails she reached for the claws her hands forming into metallic pin piers anthony geis of the gargoyle cers and pull your teeth her head became a giant pair of pliers hanna hissed and vanished the odor of the word was like burning garbage gary had landed on the floor when mentia quit her sup port but he hardly felt it whats going on he de manded why did you break it up when i was doing exactly what you asked me to you explain mentia told iris i must safeguard sur prise she vanished because we learned the folly of our strategy iris said coming to help him up she was solid this was the real queen we almost did you great harm harm i was just getting to like it to be sure the queen said grimacing and had you been with me you could have continued and had a grand experience maybe well get to that another time but we have learned that those two fetching illusions are in fact our deadly enemies and now that we have caught on to that were apt to have real trouble gary began to realize that the queen and demoness had not just been making mischief actually he might have suspected it when hanna screamed the unprintable four letter words and sprouted claws and fangs she had then seemed more like the hannah barbarian he had known be fore so what was the harm she was about to do me he asked she was going to steal your soul this was so unexpected that gary was unable for a mo ment to assimilate it my what iris picked up his clothing and offered him some of it to put back on i realize what a shock this is to you it shocked us too but when we discovered it we knew we had to act immediately the two things the illusions desire are substance and souls they can get some substance from the madness it seems that the magic is so thick within it that it can be distilled into temporary solidity but it cant be distilled into the stuff of souls so those are what they have to steal if they ever hope to become real but illusions arent real gary protested how can they even have desires true illusions cant have desires but those two do de sire substance and souls she said which of course is two more than the illusions i craft thats why i was so long about coming to this conclusion i assumed that all il lusions were like mine which are really part of me but you see i have substance and soul so i dont miss them and neither do my illusions but illusions that lack these things are different it turns out perhaps only in the re gion of madness can there be such illusions but it is clear that they do exist here but arent they projected by someone gary asked still confused the way they alternate in speech and an imation except when in the strong madnessisnt that be cause that person cant focus on two animations at once they may be projected by someone who lacks a soul she said in which case hanna was merely trying to col lect your soul for her master or mistress the consequence to you would be similar someone without a soul she handed him another item of apparel there are a number of creatures without souls it seems that most an imals lack souls and dont miss them but all who have any human ancestry such as the humananimal cross breeds do have souls and value them so there might be an intelligent unsouled animal like a dragon hiding here in the region of madness it might eat us but then our souls would be lost to it because killing the host frees the soul so it is being more careful it wants to get our souls first then it can safely eat us now that we have balked it it may decide to eat us anyway thats why a situation that has been polite may now become dangerous a dragonhiding in the madness he repeated his appreciation of the danger growing smart enough to craft illusions that emulate us and talk to us intelligently geis of the gargoyle piers anthony its a frightening notion she said but yes thats what we think were up against a dragonor something worse then we had better get out of here in a hurry im not sure thats wise she gave him the last of his clothing but if its going to eat us we think it wont eat us as long as it has the hope of getting at least one soul the soul is incalculably valuable to it as it is to us but if we leave the region of madness it will lose us it would probably rather eat us than let us go so thats when its most likely to attack physically we dont dare try to leave until we know a good deal more about the nature of our enemy and then well have to do it by surprise so we can get clear before it realizes but if we act as if were staying it will probably hold off after all it hasnt even tried for my soul yet or surprises probably it would have to shut down the two female il lusions entirely and craft male illusions instead gary said yes and it may know that females are less foolish than males so cant be seduced as readily it was a close call with youand with hiatus what happened with him thats how we got the key hes in love with desiree and desi is areal temptation but he knows shes just an image and he wants the original he was willing to go along with the image to an extent because males are fool ish about nymphs and the like but he didnt rum off his mind and finally he got her to admit what she was really after why did she tell him hiatus role as lord hiat is a pretty devious character he hinted that he might be more seducible if he knew desi truly loved him she said she could truly love him if she got a soul that gave him the hint he told mentia and she told me and we realized what hanna wanted from you i never even thought of it gary said shuddering with reaction she said she just wanted to help me relax yes so you would let go of your soul more readily howhow would she actually take my soul were not sure but we think that at the moment of the ellipsis of stork summoning a persons soul is loosened its the desire to share with ones partner the two souls wish to embrace even as the two bodies are doing so that instant of generosity may allow an unscrupulous partner to snatch the soul once its done its done i think you would have a hard time getting it back i think i owe you my deepest appreciation for interced ing gary said feeling weak in the human knees iris smiled she was surprisingly attractive that way just do the same for me if it is ever required but you are forewarned you will never let your soul be loose this thing is smart very smart it is surely figuring out a new strategy even now we may find that as tricky to grasp and oppose as we did this one with its command of illusion we will hardly know what is real and what isnt thats another thing if talents never repeat how can it have the same talent as i have that has bothered me all along actually its not quite true that tal ents never repeat a person in one historical time may have a talent used by another person in another time and the curse fiends or curse friends as they call themselves all seem to have the same talent of cursing but i have never known of a magiciancaliber talent repeating there have been close variants though sometimes different talents can have similar effect so think this creature has a talent for illusion that may seem similar to mine but differs in its mechanism at any rate its an interesting situation i have learned how to identify its illusions which comple ment mine if i deleted my illusions hinge would become a mere shadow of itself i see no point in that so i main tain them i think thats best until we know more about piers anthony our enemy for one thing it might assume that i would shut down my illusions preparatory to departing maintain your illusions gary agreed so now we had better get together with the other mem bers of our party and decide what to do next we should keep searching for the philter gary said thats why we came and why we would be expected to stay once we find it the crunch will come she said because our enemy will know were done here good point they left garys room and went to the one where mentia and surprise stayed the other two were there as was hiatus i understand i helped interrupt something hiatus said to gary thank you gary said feelingly the queen ex plained just as i have explained to surprise mentia said the child turned to gary how come you werent ex plaining it to me tooter tutor gary said i was he caught iris warning glance he couldnt tell a child what he had almost done with hanna i was getting dressed oh i thought maybe you were getting duced by desi seduced by hanna gary said before he caught him self i meanoh never mind we have a serious situation here what are we going to do about it on top of that we messed up with the interface mentia said i was about to tell you before the illusion got hot for you it was supposed to incorporate a filter el ement so that the water passing through it from mundania isnt polluted but that isnt there philter gary asked filter its right there in the specs they worked out over the centuries we forgot to include it in our invocation now the bad water comes right in gary was stricken thats why the geis of the gargoyle had to continue it was supposed to be abated by the inclu geis of the gargoyle sion of the filterof the magic philter how could we have overlooked that allimportant detail desi appeared its our fault she said i am desolate because of it desi the desolate hiatus said somewhat cynically what do you care that we made a mistake because if hanna and i hadnt been distracting you you might not have made it desi said distraction hiatus exclaimed you were trying to steal my soul i didnt realize it was so important to you desi said sending him a desolate glance i never had a soul of my own she looked so sad that gary was almost tempted to try to console herand she hadnt even been directing her effort at him ill do anything to make it up to you she put one hand to her dress not that iris snapped if you really want to help tell us how to fix that omission from the interface why of course desi said just assign the gargoyles to the inflowing rivers but thats what we came to end gary protested im tired of then he caught himself of having to depend on gargoyles to do what should be automatic im sorry for the gargoyles desi said but the inter face is permanent it can only be fixed by being corrected and recompiled recompiled thats what you just did in your roles as ancient folk you compiled it and set it in place and now we are at the threethousandth anniversary of that compilation mentia said so we can fix it you could recompile it desi said but there doesnt seem to be much point why not because the reason you didnt include the filtration factor is that you lost the philter since you dont have that you cant improve on the interface as it stands the outer and inner filters will have to remain as they are piers anthony inner filter iris asked sharply what is that the one that confines the madness to a small region desi explained with that filter in place only ordinary magic can escape to the main part of xanth the expanding madness hiatus exclaimed because of the missing filter how iris asked firmly can we fix the inner filter patch it with more gargoyles desi laughed of course not for that you need a spot filtration spell then the interface thus patched will be as good as it was supposed to be except that the gargoyles will be stuck forever doing a job they shouldnt have to do gary said dryly which was unusual for his species who cares desi asked theyre only animals iris spoke before gary could we as compassionate folk do not care to subject any species whether human crossbreed or animal to unnecessary drudgery we must fix the interface mentia had another angle that spot filtration spell that contains the madnesshow durable is it oh thats no problem it will last as long as the magic does until the magic stops iris said sending a significant glance around gary realized that she was thinking of the time of no magic that was what had terminated the spot spell the ancients had made so that the madness started overrunning its boundary and making all manner of mis chief in xanth that was the last piece in the mystery of the problem of the presentand the philter could fix it too they really had to find that thing we must find the philter hiatus said we know it is here somewhere can you help us do that no desi said it is impossible to find the lost phil ter lets speak frankly iris said we are here to find the philter and we do not intend to leave without it why do you say it is impossible to find geis of the gargoyle you want to speak frankly desi asked then you shall have it you can not find the philter because the an cients whom you have just reprised could not find it they patched the interface by means of gargoyles and spell and then folded down hinge for the last time and went to reg ular xanth where they soon crossbred the last of their spe cies to extinction if they couldnt find it then neither can you three thousand years later nevertheless we intend to find it gary said not only was this his determination he now knew that it could be dangerous to suggest that they might be leaving at all soon it was better to make it clear that they would be here for some time so that the thing behind the illusions did not decide to eat them immediately if you illusions do not care to help us we shall proceed without you we shall be glad to help you try desi said but you are doomed to failure anyway because we dont know where it is either nobody knows where it is or if it still exists it exists gary said desi turned a disconcertingly intense gaze on him what makes you so sure because the good magician humfrey told me to get the philter and he wouldnt have done that if it wasnt possible to get who is this good magician you dont know that i thought everybody knew that not anyone who is an illusion confined to the region of madness gary grew canny but you know of hannah barbarian who is outside the madness and of desiree dryad who has spent most of her life outside it we drew these images from your mind you said you drew them from their minds because they were thinking of us we lied we cant go beyond the madness or be aware of anything beyond it except through the minds of those who enter our region geis of the gargoyle piers anthony how can an illusion lie hiatus asked we can do anything we find in your minds the sor ceress ins knows much of xanth and is apt at deception you can read our minds gary asked i dont believe it why dont you desi asked because if you could you would know my secret we do know your secret what secret is that that you are actually a gargoyle transformed into the shape of a man gary saw that the others were as taken aback as he was you knew this from the first why didnt you say some thing what does it matter it is easier to deceive someone who is practicing deception iris pursed her lips shes right you know you were concentrating on not letting hanna know your true nature while she was concentrating on seducing you but she should have known i wasnt interested he protested but she also knew that you lacked experience with the human form desi said and soon enough she turned that ignorance to her advantage had your friends not in terfered she would have had your soul by now she was right gary was chagrined the illusions had been outsmarting them all along so why have you illusions been so helpful hiatus asked why didnt you just try to seduce us at the out set he glanced across to surprise concerned about the devious subject but the child bored had fallen asleep in iris embrace we did try desi said but you were too intent on your mission and too busy trying to figure out what was what so we had to put you somewhat at ease and wait for our opportunities we almost succeeded right again but you wont succeed now gary said because we know what you want and we wont give you any of our souls so you might as well go away no you are interesting folk the first we have seen in hinge for some time we shall continue to associate with you suppose we dont want you to hiatus asked were illusions you cant stop us there is something wrong about this iris said you illusions had reason to associate with us before but now you dont you know you wont get our souls you dont care whether were interesting or boring so you must have continuing reason to be near us what is that rea son desi shrugged i have no answer obviously whatever is grafting these illusions is inter ested in us gary said so it wants to use them to spy on us what i dont understand is why it is interested perhaps we can work it out iris said obviously it has been around a long time because it knows how hinge was when it was inhabited it knows about the interface what could remain here three thousand years unaffected by the madness and still care what a small party of human folk is doing here i can think of one thing hiatus said no desi said you read it in my mind hiatus said and you dont want me to say it so it must be right what is it iris asked looking slightly nettled the thing that is making these illusions must be the philter itself the philter iris and gary said together amazed no desi cried and faded out the philter hiatus said grimly that managed to avoid being incorporated in the interface and now wants to avoid being found because if we find it we can recom pile the interface with the philter included and free the gargoyles and confine the madness but the philter is just a thing gary protested piers anthony no mentia said hes right i see it now the philter is a demon a demon gary was amazed again but which explains something that bothered me the de moness continued the ability of the illusions to become partly solid they said it was because of the intensity of the magic but they were also doing it here in the palace where the level of magic is ordinary illusions cant turn solid but demons can she made a huge fist and banged it against the wall solidly a demon iris repeated that does make sense we have been dealing not with two animate illusions but with a single demon who animates first one and then the other she pondered a moment but there are illusions too the ogres unhinging the buildings and the quality of the food served and the decorations of this palacei have not been grafting these appearances she glanced at mentia can you do such illusions doubtful mentia said i would have to spread my substance thin she concentrated and thinned and a shape appeared across the room it formed into anogre but it was translucent this is me the ogre said con nected to the rest of me by an invisibly thin thread of my essence as you see its not a really good show then the ogre solidified as the female figure faded out unless i get myself all together the ogre shifted back to female form then how could one demon handle the rather extensive distant illusions of the ogres in the city iris asked maybe a screen hiatus suggested can you make a screen with images on it mentia like this a wisp of the demoness substance curled out spread out and formed into a vertical screen on it pictures formed of buildings and ogres moving among them yes gary agreed that looks just like the scene we saw outside but my powers in this respect are limited mentia geis of the gargoyle said it divides my attention and what about the food and beds and pillows here i can emulate one bed at a time but i cant change the taste of a whole banquet i think iris said soberly that the demonly arts may account for some of the effects we have seen but there must be some substantial illusion along with it and it must be an extremely powerful demon a demon like none we know mentia agreed except the demon x iris breathed and he wouldnt bother he leaves the creatures of xanth alone and hes a whole lot stronger than this demon of mad ness mentia said no this is not x this is some considerably lesser demon but a greater demon than any ordinary one with a remarkable combination of powers because of the madness gary said it has spent thousands of years in the madness gaining power so it has learned illusion or maybe has the power to make a screen surrounding us with fake illusion and to pad stones to seem like beds and to run one imitation person at a time and make her seem a bit solid at times and to read our minds iris said though that is probably the limit of its strength mentia said most of its power is in illusion and it cant match even me in physical manifestation so it does a lot of illusion guided by what it reads in our minds and but tresses it by just a bit of substance but why does it want our souls hiatus asked when we thought we were dealing with mere illusions their wish for souls to make them become real was understand able but demons dont want souls i am no longer so sure of that mentia said when my better half got a soul she really annoyed me but here with you folk and when we are in the ambience of stron ger magic and madness i have been coming to appreciate the virtues of souls almost to envy you your qualities of love and conscience if i had a soul i would become like you in such respects and if the philter had a soul geis of the gargoyle piers anthony it might be able to become enough like a person to be freed of confinement to the region of madness iris said a soul would give it the independence it must crave maybe it doesnt realize the significance of conscience it thinks that its power would be vastly magnified arent we conjecturing too much gary asked why should there be a demon in the interface the interface is an extremely sophisticated spell mentia said to operate properly it has to assess all things that pass through it and treat them as they deserve living things too even people only a demon could do that reliably a demon who could read minds enough to know what folk want without their telling it and use illu sion to see and shape aspects of the interface and to define and confine the region of madness there must be many specially talented demons bound to it but one got away but we didnt summon any demons when we compiled it we didnt really compile it iris said we simply re enacted what the ancients did they knew what they were doing we merely pantomimed they could have sum moned and bound demons into it all except the one that sneaked out by the time they realized what had happened it was too late they couldnt recompile for a thousand years so had to patch it up here and there and that worked well enough mentia said until the time of no magic when the inner spell dissipated the main external interface must contain mechanisms of resto ration so reappeared when the magic returned and the gargoyles of course remained loyal but the spot spell con taining the madness was gone and slowly the effects of that loss manifested now at last we know the whole truth now we know why the good magician sent us here iris said he wants us to deal with it to save xanth from madness hiatus agreed and help ourselves in the process gary said they gazed at each other this mentia said soberly may be the most important quest any of us have ever dreamed of the most important quest anyone in xanth ever under took iris added and were such a motley crew and we dont even know what to do gary said the others nodded agreement geis of the gargoyle future so we shall simply have to try again to find the phil ter and incorporate it in a recompiled interface iris concluded that will not only abate the geis of the gargoyle it will enable us to leave the madness safely it occurred to gary that finding the philter might not be any easier than it had been before and incorporating it into the interface might be still more difficult if they could figure out how to do a recompilation for real instead of in emulation but he did not want to be negative so he remained silent but we looked for it before hiatus said and got nowhere on the contrary iris said we got here we have made enormous strides in understanding and vision so we must be on the right track we must continue our search gary had to agree with that but he had a question of his own we looked everywhere we could think of be fore where else is there to look we looked everywhere in the present ruins she said now we have seen the history of the city of hinge we must look throughout that history somewhere along it we are bound to find the philter but there is so much to search hiatus said how can we possibly cover it all iris nodded we shall have to split up again to multi ply our efficiency with five separate searches i dont think so mentia said remember that the philter is aware of us and is trying to stop us we dont know the extent of its powers but i am the only one of us who is proof against the mischief of a demon it would be foolhardy to let it attack us individually um fair point iris agreed but we do need to in crease our efficiency of searching im not sure how else to do it efficiency is no use if the philter picks us off individ ually hiatus said looking around nervously i hate to say it gary said but there is another con sideration the philter doesnt seem to be able to focus on two things at the same time that is when desi is ani mate hanna is on autopilot and vice versa iris eyed him so you and hiatus cant be seduced si multaneously cant you live with that if we remain in one party the philter can easily watch us but if we make several parties it can watch only one at a rime then the others can search without distraction now theres a point mentia said iris nodded a point indeed so it seems we must take the risk for the sake of an additional benefit suppose we break up into two groups three would be better though maybe you mentia could search alone safely i could but im not sure the rest of you could make safe pairs i should probably be with one of you gary had an idea gayle goyleif we stop drinking water from the pool for a while she can go off duty maybe i could search with her because shes a gargoyle i know i can trust her and when i explain the situation to her im sure shell agree to help us and she should have an excellent notion where the piers anthony philter might be mentia agreed because shes been here for three thousand years but only on the island in the pool in the enclosure iris pointed out thats not a good place to see anything only illusions gary agreed ruefully still shes se cure against the demon because it cant pull her soul from stone and a gargoyle in its natural state fears no other creature except maybe a roc bird that could pick up a gar goyle and drop it from a great height so that it cracks into pieceswhich im sure this philter demon cant do iris exchanged a glance with the others seems viable to me if she cares to help you search she considered that leaves four of us to make two parties we should have one strong person in each party none of us are hiatus began in the sense of being able to handle the demon philter mentia said perhaps i should accompany you hiatus ill do my best to protect you hiatus said mentia made an obscure smile thank you gary real ized that it was the demoness who would protect the man which leaves me with surprise iris said i can keep alert and she has enough magic if it is required now where shall we spread out to search since we have no idea where to look maybe we should just follow our noses hiatus suggested and meet here by evening iris agreed but men tiaif you would you might pop back and forth every so often to make sure that none of the parties are in trouble we dont know what the philter will be up to but we can be fairly sure it doesnt want to be found and if we see either of those two illusions again mentia said grimly remember that they arent just illu sions and they arent our friends and that they are going to try to prevent us from find ing the philter gary said and steal our souls so thats not the time to push the search too hard but if we can take up their attention for a while the other two parties may be able to get through the standing illusions better geis of the gargoyle yes iris agreed if were smart we can turn the sit uation to our advantage and distract the philter instead of letting it distract us but watch it remember that it can read our minds when one of its figures is close so try not to think of what were doing then which is one tricky order hiatus said but i know one way to do it think instead of how the figures may be there to try to destroy us that should be effective iris said thank you so much for giving us that lovely notion she looked around as nervous as any of them but it was the way it had to be where were those two philter figures were they planning some special mischief or was the philter merely resting they left the palace gary felt the intensity of magic in crease as they stepped outside hanna and desi had been right about that but he could handle it when there wasnt a madness storm he made his way to the charmed inner circle then he swam across the pond in the middle of his swim hanna appeared what are you up to gary she inquired walk ing on the water beside him he glanced up at herand right up under her flaring skirt along her legs almost to her knees he lost his swimming stroke there had been a time when he wouldnt have noticed such a display which display he suspected was not accidental but he had been in this hu man form too long and was reacting as it did only when he started to breathe water did he manage to yank his clinging eyeballs away from the sight but now he couldnt answer because he was too busy sputtering you poor thing she said solicitously squatting before him let me mop your face a handkerchief appeared in her hand and she dabbed at his watering eyes the odd thing was that it helped in a moment his vi sion cleared and he lookedstraight between her slightly spread knees and tried to breathe more water only sheer luck and some strategic shadow had prevented him from seeing her panties piers anthony my you really have a problem she remarked in dul cet fashion perhaps you should get out of the pool before you drown just get out of my way he gasped desperately re suming his forward motion unfortunately she did not she remained squatting on the water and his face passed right through her flesh heading for the darkest shadow only an emergency clamping of his eyelids prevented him from getting his eyeballs petrified and of course that was her intention as a creature mostly of illusion she couldnt do him much physical damage or perhaps did not want to while there was any hope of stealing his soul but she could threaten to freak out his mind maybe she thought that if he lost his mind she would be able to get his soul he wasnt abso lutely sure she was wrong yet he knew she did not really exist she was an anima tion crafted by a cynical demon legs and panties meant nothing to her they were merely presented to make mis chief for him so why was he taking it so seriously the answer was that he shouldnt she hadnt actually shown him anything critical and whatever she had was not real anyway after all he had seen her whole bare body in the bed of course that was an important qualification there had been no panties on it so his brain hadnt gone into overload probably there werent any on it now it was all a bluff yet considering what mentia had told him about such thingsmaybe now that he knewsuch a sight would indeed freak him out he felt the slope of the center island coming up beneath him he had made it across so he put down his feet and opened his eyes ready to wade out of the pool there stood hanna garbed only in pale blue panties gary fell backwards in the water stunned he had been completely unprepared for such a frontal assault his eyes were unable to tell the difference between illusion and re ality sputtering again he realized that he had after all sur geis of the gargoyle vived her worst or maybe her nexttoworst she had tried to make him drown but he hadnt he crawled up the slope and out of the pool keeping his eyes peering down when he stood on the island and looked around hanna was gone he had defeated her he knew that if she showed him her panties again he would be better able to handle it now that he knew that such handling was possi ble she knew it too all repeated shocks could do was harden him to the sight he was after all not a true man so was probably less vulnerable than say hiatus would be he tramped on inside feeling the magic intensify around him he hoped it would not take long to persuade gayle to join him he had of course suggested that he ap proach her not merely to make a third team but because he really liked the idea of being with her too bad he wasnt in his natural form but he had to admit that this human form had been useful so far despite its liabilities of soft flesh hunger and vulnerability to the sight of panties he saw the gargoyle what a lovely creature she was from her grotesque face to her reptilian wings hello gayle goyle he said suddenly shy she closed her mouth cutting off the waterspout and turned her head why hello gary gar its so nice to see you again even in she broke off its all right he said they know im a gargoyle so i dont need to conceal it any more i wish i had my nat ural body back i wish you did too she said what brings you here gary iwe are searching for the philter and i wondered if youif you would like tothat is gayle shook her head sadly i do not know where the philter is gary if you would like toto help me search for it because we need it to abate the geis but i must purify the water here why he asked there have been no people to drink geis of the gargoyle piers anthony from it for thousands of years the illusions dont need pure water we have been using it but we are merely vis itors who wont drink from it while youre away from it but the geis applies to water flowing into xanth from mundania what you are doing here is merely a service to the inhab itants of the stone city of hinge who are long gone i think you are entitled to a break and if we find the philter i hadnt thought of it that way she said i suppose i can relax for a few hours she moved on her pedestal stretching her lovely muscles yes i will help you search gary gar she said but i want you to know it is mainly because i like you i asked you mainly because i like you he admitted come on i will carry you out of the strong magic your present form is really not adequate to handle it no offense oh i agree but when my quest is done i will be transformed back to my natural shape that is one reason i hope to conclude it quickly i hope i can help you to conclude it quickly she squatted down and he climbed on her stone back between her wings and took hold of her mane it was a joy to be so close to her she rose and bounded down the passage carrying his slight weight easily she emerged to the pool and leaped in of course she sank to the bottom but he hung on knowing that she would be across it and back in air very soon indeed she was now where were you thinking of looking she inquired as the water coursed off her sleek stone hide no dont get off i can readily carry you and we can move more swiftly this way i really have no idea he confessed glad to remain on her i had thought no further than gaining your company does it matter where we look since i have no idea where the philter is a random search is probably as good as a planned one the others of my party are searching similarly elsewhere do you have any preference actually i do she said shyly what is it for three thousand years i have heard the trains of thought passing close by and wondered where they go i would like to follow one do you think theres any chance the philter could be where the trains live why i dont know gary said i think it could be there as readily as any other place perhaps more readily because we did not search to the end of the line we merely rode the train here and got off then lets intercept the next train and follow it to its lair there we can search we dont need to follow it gary said grandly suffer ing a flash of inspiration we can ride it there oooo wonderful she cried delighted they went to the station soon a train pulled in on its broad front was a sign that said future gary got off her his clothing remained wet but he knew it would dry in time we shall go to the future he said the train ground to a massive halt no one got off so gary led the way up the steps to a coach gayle bounded up after him she was solid stone but the train was metal and did not even settle perceptibly under her weight they entered the coach oh i forgot these are human seats he said they wont do for you maybe we can find a coach made for gargoyles as they walked down through the coach the train started moving at first slowly then more swiftly the second coach was much better it was open in the center with seats lining the sides that could be turned around to face out the broad windows gary took one and gayle lay beside him on the floor quite comfortable the scenery had changed the stones of hinge were geis of the gargoyle piers anthony gone now there were fields forests rivers mountains and chasms passing in their separate splendors when he looked out the other side he saw that the train tracks were forming a large turn for they curved before and af ter and allowed nothing to make them deviate from it where there was a river they crossed it with a bridge where there was a mountain they bored through it with a tunnel where there was a forest they cut a narrow swath through it they were inflexible about their course gayle was delighted oh it has been millennia since i have seen scenery like this what a pleasure it is gary had thought the sights routine now he looked again appreciating them as she saw them all of xanth was open to exploration without limit suddenly he wanted to bound out into that scenery and range through it all with gayle beside him but he was in his human form if he tried to bound out of the train he would probably break a limb so he had become a prisoner of another kind in a limited body when this is done and i have my real body back lets run together through all of this until we have seen it all he said its a date she agreed they spied a billboard welcome to the future we are arriving gary said some buildings appeared they were of stone so it seemed they had circled back to hinge had the train changed its mind about going to the future but these buildings differed from those they had seen before they were sleeker and of odd architectural designs some had grown exceedingly tall so that their tops scraped against the clouds others spread wide with flying buttresses and projecting ledges as if determined to cover as much ground as possible there was another big sign hencepopulation mixed the train passed a large pavedover field where a house with a pointed dome and tubular foundations squatted there didnt seem to be any doors or windows in its sides what a peculiar structure gayle remarked i wish we could tell what it houses gary said hanna appeared entering the car i shall be glad to oblige she said that is the spaceship of thought which will take you farther than this train of thought can it is based here in the great future city of stone hence hence gayle asked all the ships start here and get themselves hence in a hurry hanna explained gary wasnt pleased to see her were not trying to travel far were trying to find your master the philter and i doubt you have any intention of helping her master gayle asked perplexed we have concluded that the philter is a demon who doesnt want to be found and that it is using two images to divert us from finding it so hanna the handmaiden is not our friend indeed she has been trying to distract me all along what did she do gayle asked when i swam across the pool to join you she showed me her panties but human girls arent supposed to do that precisely i almost drowned if i had been a real man i probably would have no i would have saved you hanna said and taken my soul well it might have come loose in the process so it was the philter making the illusions gayle said i never realized because we didnt want you to hanna said gary felt a thought bobbing just below the surface of his mind and finally it worked its way up you mean hanna was talking to you before we came along no the image was of a gargoyle gayle said i was lonely for company of my own kind but i knew it wasnt real thats why i asked to verify you i was thrilled to discover you were real even if you looked like a man geis of the gargoyle piers anthony how did you know him for a gargoyle hanna asked gargoyles know their own kind his body was like il lusion but i felt the reality beneath just as i knew you were no gargoyle i knew he was no man and now you are helping him find the philter yes gayle returned her gaze to the window evidently losing interest in the figure do you know what they mean to do with the philter use it to abate the geis of the gargoyle but that will make it prisoner in the interface gayle shrugged we gargoyles have been prisoner of the geis ever since the philter defaulted on its purpose in existence it is time to correct that situation hanna frowned so you are no friend to the philter i dont wish the philter any harm gayle said im just tired of having to do what it was supposed to as am i gary said so its time to set things right i thought you gargoyles liked purifying water we do gary said but we have had no time off from it we would like to be free to explore sometimes i have an idea gayle said suppose your master the philter purifies the water of xanth half the time and we gargoyles do it the other half no hanna said you wont meet us halfway gary asked no one quarter of the way gayle asked no then how much of the way gary asked no part of the way the philter isnt interested in being harnessed does that seem fair to you gayle asked what does fairness have to do with it demons have no conscience gary said they dont care whats right or wrong only what works for them gayle was outraged you mean that for three thousand years i have loyally confined myself and purified the water of the pool of stone hinge because my conscience told me to honor the geis and the one for whom i was filling in doesnt care exactly hanna said you have a problem with that now i do gayle admitted i think i have been a fool well youre an animal and you have a soul hanna said all souled creatures are foolish then why do you want my soul gary demanded dont you know it would make you just as foolish no it wouldnt im a demon i know better gary exchanged a glance with gayle id almost like to give her a soul so shed find out he said dont do it gayle said demons dont necessarily react to souls the same way as others do and this is a very hardened demon gary agreed its not worth the risk some souled folk are pretty mean i un derstand yes there seem to be some degraded souls gayle agreed and surely any soul the philter got hold of would soon be degraded so it mustnt have any of ours hannas eyes narrowed so its like that she said grimly i think it always was like that gary said you watched gayle doing your job for three thousand years and you dont care you have shown that you are not a worthy creature so go away and let us continue our search i will go when i choose to go hanna said and i choose to remain for now i will guide you through the fu ture why should we pay any attention to you gayle de manded since we know you are trying to hinder us because you wont be able to ignore me hanna said both gargoyles laughed then garys laugh was choked off as hannas dress went translucent showing the fuzzy outline of her panties he tried to close his eyes but they refused to close they geis of the gargoyle piers anthony were locked on to the almost vision as if he were peering into the peephole of a hypnogourd after a moment gayle realized that he had stalled out then she realized why she bounded between him and hanna blocking his view then he was able to blink and clear his gaze he had thought he would have less trouble with such sights but realized he had misjudged the case his human reactions were too strong then gayle stiffened her whole body became as rigid as the stone it was making her like a statue what had happened to her surely the sight of human panties wouldnt bother her both because she was inhuman and female he needed to find out what hanna was doing to freak out gayle but did he dare risk getting freaked out again himself he realized he had to because it was his fault gayle was here he peered around her there was the image of a pool of water but it had a hole in it in fact it was a water hole oh no the hole was sucking in the water and making it vanish that was the bad thing about it the water around it tried to fill it in and got consumed until no water was left that was an awful sight to a gargoyle who lived to make good water available to others where would the gargoyles be if all the water disappeared into the water hole he stepped between gayle and the image he was in manform so not quite as horrified as she was by the sight men were typically careless about water though they needed it as much as any other creatures did when her gaze at the water was interrupted gayle re laxed oh thats horrible she breathed i cant abide a water hole no gargoyle can gary said the vision fuzzed hanna reappeared fully clothed had enough she asked gary stifled an angry retort maybe we should have a truce he suggested well be halfway civil to you if you are halfway civil to us agreed but we wont give up our search for the philter even if you found it you wouldnt know what to do with it hanna said so you might as well enjoy your tour of the future we might as well gary agreed less than pleased he looked out the window again and saw the fanny building on the paved field but we havent moved he said sur prised well i was distracted hanna said i cant focus on too many things at once that will change when i get a soul gary remembered how hanna and desi had alternated speech and animation when they were together he under stood the principle hanna had been continuously active so the outside illusion had frozen in place but did this mean that the train and the scenery and indeed the whole land of the future was all an illusion crafted by the phil ter if so it was another distraction from their search but illusion could be penetrated if he and gayle kept alert they might spy what they sought anyway and there was one benefit if they were taking up the philters atten tion then the other two searching parties were free of it and would have a better chance so gary and gayle might be accomplishing more than they seemed to be so how does that building travel in space gary asked as the train moved on by it watch they watched in a moment smoke poured out from the base of the building it rose into the air now it was appar ent that fire was jutting out of its bottom like a dragon in terrible trouble to get away from that fire the building was hauling itself ever higher but the fire followed it burning its tail the building shot right up into the sky the fire in relentless pursuit piers anthony and so the spaceship is off to alpha centauria hanna said and you can go there too if you wish a centaur named alpha gayle asked impressed a centaur world named alpha not xanth this is the future hanna said the magic has spread to other worlds now each species has its own world the centaurs really appreciate that because they never liked associating with ordinary creatures gary had heard that centaurs were pretty snotty cross breeds but that made him realize something else there were no centaurs in hinge where were they they did not appear until hinge was deserted hanna said a few more fresh human beings straggled in with their horses and inadvertently drank from a love spring the centaurs dont speak of that they are ashamed to admit that there is human stock in their lineage gary had heard that too he could understand their po sition he didnt like to think that there was human influ ence hidden somewhere in his own ancestry though the evidence of the souls was suggestive the hinge spring of course not gayle said i kept it pure oops of course how could i forget so it was some unfiltered spring yes hanna agreed the early centaurs did come to hinge and live there for a while but in the end they pre ferred to avoid the madness storms and migrated south to centaur isle it didnt matter because there was no need for inhabitants in the madness region once the interface had been established established without the philter gayle said which absence cost us gargoyles dearly gary said and is now costing the rest of xanth more subtly poor desiree hiatus will take care of her stupid tree hanna said disdainfully how when he cant even grow ears straight in the madness geis of the gargoyle but he can grow round roots in the madnessand thats what that tree needs to replace its square roots the nymph of the tree will be most grateful how do you know all this gary asked this is the future all things are known including how well find the philter you will never find the philter and you will never tell the truth about that he re torted she shrugged we shall see the train pulled into another station this is where you get out hanna said suppose we prefer to ride on to another station you cant this is the end of the line you can proceed farther only on the ship of thought gary looked at gayle and shrugged the illusions would be whatever the philter decided they were and if there were another station that would probably just be an other variant of the same city so well search in stone hence he agreed grudgingly they left the train the future city spread out around them and towered above them impressively at the street level there were many fancy shops with lighted displays was the philter likely to be in any of them he had a bright idea lets see if there are any plumb ing shops here he said to gayle as they looked down the street they saw an especially bright store with a marquee plumbing galore that was almost too convenient but still worth checking inside the store were many weird objects they seemed to relate to water but their purposes were unclear what is this gary asked thats a flush toilet hanna said what does it flush she said a dirty word after a moment he realized that the answer had been literal that was what it flushed embarrassed he went on piers anthony they spied a kind of enameled basin with an impossible array of things jammed in it what is that the kitchen sink everything is in it except itself what does this shop have in the way of water filters he asked wondering how she would react was it possible by some devious rule of mad magic that she would have to show him what he asked for she showed him a collection of little meshes and screens there were hundreds of them one of these might be the philterbut how would they know it from all the others and if they spotted the real one how would they handle it a demon could not be held in the hand it would simply fade out and appear elsewhere the more he thought about it the more hopeless his quest seemed how had the good magician expected him to capture a demon you look as if you are realizing that your quest is hopeless hanna said smugly then he remembered she could read his thoughts thats where she had gotten the image of hannah barbar ian from so even if he got a good notion where the philter was she would know it as soon as he did and would do something to prevent him from following up you are catching on hanna murmured appreciatively he sighed he turned to gayle she knows what im thinking that means the philter knows so i dont have a chance to surprise it and if i get close to it it can move or divert me before i catch it i dont know what to do but can it read my thoughts gayle asked of course i can hanna said then what am i thinking now why should i tell you what you already know because i dont think you can read stone thoughts gayle said evenly you can get into garys fleshly head but my soul and thoughts are secure from you prove it isnt so hanna scowled that was answer enough geis of the gargoyle then you take the lead gary said relieved and if you locate the philter grab it with stone gayle smiled showing formidable teeth i shall i think i owe it a reckoning youre fooling yourself hanna said i call your bluff find the philter ill guide you anywhere you ask lets take that spaceship building gayle said i would like to see alpha centauria as you wish hanna led them from the shop and to the spaceport another ship was waiting there they took an odd moving stairway up to a door that opened in the side of the ship gary was bemused this just wasnt his idea of a ship as it had no sails and was stand ing on its tail end but he had seen the other one flee from the fire at its tail so it evidently had strong magic propul sion what kind of stair is this gayle asked as she bal anced somewhat nervously on forepaws and hindpaws it is called an escapelater hanna said escalator for short because it takes more time to get in and out of the ship with it but is more convenient more convenient than what gary asked than jumping she had a point it was now a long way down hanna entered the ship and gary was about to follow when there was a noise behind he turned startled and saw gayle catching at the steps the esklater seemed to have lost a step or two putting her in peril of falling quickly he reached out catching her by a stone wingtip as her hind feet broke through the stairway he hauled her inbut her stone weight was much greater than his and he succeeded only in jerking himself toward her let go she cried youll just hurt yourself too not without you he said he caught the rail with his free hand and hung on desperately gayle scrambled with all four feet precariously bal anced but in a moment his pull on her wing enabled her to get more of a grip and haul herself up to secure footing piers anthony geis of the gargoyle that escalator is intended for human use hanna said your great weight must have overstressed it she did not seem unduly alarmed i must be more careful gayle said somewhat shaken gary was shaken too a fall from this height could have shattered her into a dozen pieces the interior of the ship was fairly nice there were a number of small compartments and special seats with har nesses these are acceleration couches hanna ex plained you must strap yourselves in but they dont fit me gayle protested that may be a problem hanna agreed maybe you will be all right on the deck gary strapped in and gayle crouched down now the acceleration will be strong at first but will ease once the ship attains escape velocity hanna said just hang on until it passes she faded out the ship shuddered then gary felt a huge invisible hand press him down so heavily that it was hard to breathe he gasped and clenched his muscles fighting to maintain consciousness somehow it seemed that the pres sure was not merely down but out as if something wanted to dump him out the window but he managed to realign internally and shore up his constitution his flesh might be human for the nonce but his nature was gargoyle and there was stone in his personality as well as his natural body after what probably was not as long as it seemed the pressure eased and he was able to function normally again there was still pressure there making him weigh perhaps twice what he normally did but he could handle that readily enough he looked downand gayle was gone alarmed he looked all around he saw claw scrape marks on the floor they streaked back to the rear of the compartment where the access hole was and there was gayle her teeth locked around the leg of a couch gary remembered how he had felt the push toward the window the same force seemed to have affected gayle but she had been near the hole rather than the window had she slid into the hole she would have taken a fall with the full power of the downward pressure that would have been worse than the fall from the esklater he unbuckled himself and went to her treading slowly and heavily i never thought the force would be so strong he said neither did i gayle said after prying her teeth from the leg she too could handle this reduced level i was lucky to save myself gary looked out the window stars planets and comets were whizzing by we must be traveling very fast he said and going very far she agreed where is hanna she must be seeing to one of the other pairs so were on autopilot now we must be see theres a repetitive quality to those stars out there yes he agreed so maybe we have to talk while she figures well be busy with the extra weight she probably doesnt realize how tough gargoyles are talk i dont think those accidents you have had are coinci dental this is mostly illusion remember how can we fall if we arent really high up so why should that esk later give way under your weight if its just a semblance weight cant crush an illusion i didnt think of that gayle said and the way i slid to the holeyet how could a fall hurt if its illusion but it could hurtif the illusion covers a real pit i saw iris dispatch a monster by using illusion to trick it into running into a chasm since the philter controls these spe cial illusions those problems must have been intentional so there really is a pit she said i reacted when i seemed to be falling but i also realized that it wasnt fully real now im suspicious that it is she moved to the ac piers anthony cess hole in the floor and put a paw in theres a void here all right she considered half a moment but we knew there was a hole here because we used it to enter this chamber what about the way the esklater started to collapse under my weight you had gone right over the same place maybe in the real world theres a pit there covered by light boards they supported my weight but not yours she nodded i believe you are right she wouldnt have led us over that spot just by chance but why would the philter want to get rid of me and not you because it cant get your soul or read your mind you are of no benefit to it and may be a danger to it now that youre looking for it instead of purifying water she nodded again you are very smart gary but i have to say that i dont know anything about the philter that might help you find it or control it i never even saw it in all my time in hinge but its pretty smart you must know something or be able to do something that makes you dangerous to it so even if we dont actually find it here we have learned something important to the quest perhaps she agreed dubiously i shall walk very carefully from now on i hadnt realized how dangerous il lusions could be i have noticed another thing he said this is sup posed to be the future with all manner of wondrous things but we really havent seen a lot just some fancy buildings a plumbing shop and this spaceship which is pretty much like a bedroom chamber surely there must be more than this not if it is limited to the imagination of the philter it must have drawn notions from your mind about what you thought the future would be like and animated them maybe some notions are from the minds of your compan ions so its just a show to divert you for a while a diversion he said thoughtfully yes the philter doesnt want us to find it so it is diverting us i think we wont find it on the centaur world or any of the others but it is concerned about something i might do she said i wish i knew what just keep yourself safe until we find out he said also also but gary was suddenly shy he couldnt say what was on his mind but perhaps she suspected they returned to their original places and relaxed wait ing for the illusion to get off autopilot it was comfortable just being quietly together iris watched gary gargoyle go the poor creature was so eager to be with the female gargoyle it was pitiful but perhaps gayle would help him and they would leam something useful meanwhile iris intended to make a serious search and try to wrap up this mission efficiently because she knew how dangerous it could be to remain in the region of madness any longer than they had to if she could just decide where to look for the demon philter that was the problem she knew that this was all illusion much of it hers and much of it the demons she could abolish her own illusion if she chose but preferred to maintain it until their mission here was done she could recognize the philters illusion and penetrate it by step ping into it but she couldnt abolish it but would the philter cover its location with concealing illusionor have no illusion there to fool her she didnt know conse quently she didnt know where to start about all she was sure of was that the illusion wasnt lying out in plain sight because they had done a fair job of checking through the ruins before any illusion was added and there just hadnt geis of the gargoyle been anything special there she was sure of that because of her ability to recognize illusion whether hers or the de mons there had been no illusion in the ruins of hinge until she started it then she reconsidered the gargoyles poolthey had seen it and drunk from its clean water without being aware of gayle goyle on the island in the center the phil ter must have concealed it but how if not with illusion maybe in the demon manner that mentia had shown forming a screen around the island that would not have been illusion but a thin veil of demon substance masking it so she could have been fooled by that the philter hadnt wanted them to know about the gargoyle though gayle seemed innocent enough where are we going mother iris surprise asked brightly the child had had a good nap which had been a real relief to the rest of them and now was ready for ac tion iris had long since accepted her designation as mother because that was the role assigned in the replay of the past and because she had raised a daughter of her own and remembered the ropes it was halfway pleasant revis iting the role and surprise was a sweet child apart from her wild power that wildness had faded once they real ized the limit of her power surprise was not a phenome nally powerful sorceress but rather a limited temporary sorceress who would in time be less the rules of personal talents had not been broken though they had been stretched somewhat do you happen to know where to find the philter iris inquired no mother the child said can you do some magic that might locate it such as whirling around and pointing your finger in the correct di rection that was the talent old crombie the soldier had sure surprise spun around and extended one hand iris looked in that direction this seems to be toward the pool we have already been there but it surely is a suitable place for such a device geis of the gargoyle piers anthony they walked in that direction they soon came to the edge of the pool but it will be difficult to search under the water iris said can you move the water out of the way for a while sure surprise concentrated and the water humped jiggled and formed into a huge doughnutshaped bubble that floated up out of the pool bed it hovered there flex ing gently is it safe to go below it iris asked oh sure the child said i think iris decided to take that on faith the childs magic was erratic but was certainly powerful she was using it with greater caution and control now which was also good if they found the philter the slight depletion of the childs re maining talents would be justified they walked into the basin of the pool there were peb bles there and chips of stone and rock fragments and pieces of mineral and some rubble also some mundane coins how could they have gotten here they wouldnt have moved themselves and no one would have thrown them in the pool because mundanes were notoriously tightfisted with their money but no philter maybe its on the island iris said they walked onto the island and into the enclosure there was the pedestal on which the gargoyle rested but gayle goyle was gone shes with gary surprise said well at least that means that shes not the philter iris said forcing a laugh she hadnt thought of that until this moment but the realization was a relief she understood that the lady gargoyle was a nice creature it would have been horrible if surprise had pointed her out as the demon it might have made sense because a gargoyle was indeed a variety of filter and gayle had been doing that job here they kept looking but the island was bare there was nothing that looked remotely like a filter then iris remembered the problem with crombies tal ent it didnt show how far they had been wasting time here when the philter was probably well beyond this place they walked on out the other side the water doughnut still hovered you can let the water go now dear iris said okay splat the water sloshed down into its cav ity the splash drenched them both oopsie surprise said ill dry us a barred vent opened in the ground be neath them and hot air wafted up lifting their skirts iris could feel the drying action thats very nice dear iris said hastily pressing down her skirt with her hands unfortunately the jet of air was so strong that this was mostly ineffective it was all she could do to keep her panties from showing it was a good thing there were no men in the vicinity then again maybe that wouldnt be so bad because she was back in her twentythreeyearold body a lot could be accom plished in the way of male motivation by a supposedly ac cidental exposure of the right material but you really should save your talents unless there is pressing need oh yes surprise said chagrined when they were dry they walked on in the direction in dicated they came to the train station there was a train of thought sitting there it bore a sign saying past iris was surprised do you suppose you were pointing to this train she asked i guess the child said i wonder whether the indication is literal or figurative what whether the philter is on this train or whether thinking about the past can tell us where it is oh lets ride the train its fun iris shrugged that seemed to be as good an approach as any they boarded the nearest coach and sat together on one of the seats they looked out the window as the train be gan to move iris knew that this was the work of the phil ter demon because it wasnt hers the train was illusion piers anthony of course they had merely entered a stone enclosure and were now watching screen images beyond it but she didnt want to spoil the effect for surprise who still pos sessed the invaluable asset of childish wonder iris remem bered how that had been eightyseven years before when she had been that age the city of hinge passed behind them and they pro ceeded through attractive countryside this reminded iris of the travels of her youth and the nostalgia pressed in on her bringing a tear to one eye then they passed a lake with an island shrouded in mist that reminded her of the misty isle of illusion where she had resided so long alone she had had everything her own way but it had been so lonely the past was painful this is dull surprise said tiring of the scenery that is perhaps because you have less past than i do iris said with mixed emotions yes ive been in xanth only one year the child agreed youve been here for ever and ever what was it like way way back when you were really as young as you look oh you would not be interested in that well it cant be duller than this point made i will tell you but you dont have to lis ten when you get bored okay maybe ill just fall asleep iris started speaking remembering an episode in her distant past the first time she had been twentythree years old and possessed of a far greater store of innocence than she was ever to enjoy thereafter as she spoke she seemed to live that life again with all its early naive feeling after she settled on the isle of illusion the isolation and loneliness almost drove her off the edge into madness she had been so sure she would like it here with nobody to bother her or object to her constructions of illusion here she had things exactly her own way with a beautiful pal ace and gardens and fountains and everything she had geis of the gargoyle strengthened her power and control by practice going over each aspect repeatedly until she could readily get it exactly right but somehow after the fun of grafting it all in won derful detail she discovered that the thrill was gone in stead of creating an ideal residence she had locked herself into nothingness but iris was a woman of firm resolve so she did some thing about it she gathered herself together with sufficient supplies and went to see the king please your majesty she pleaded after explaining her dissatisfaction give me something to do anything i am a sorceress and can surely be useful somewhere the storm king was gracious his the only way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others i dont understand i never did anything for anyone else when i didnt have to precisely therefore because i am a merciful and not completely dull king i hereby grant your request i am sending you on a sacrificial underground undercover mission iris was not absolutely sure she liked this under cov ers i can handle but there are goblins and things under ground the storm king looked at her as if she were a trifle stupid which seemed to be an accurate assessment there is an immoral illegal dirty despicable revolting and gen erally reprehensible slave trade in xanth he said in fact i dont especially approve of it and want to shut it down so i want you to use your powers of illusion to persuade these human cockroaches that although you are an experi enced intelligent adult woman of a certain age you are nevertheless a peach ripe for the picking a peach iris repeated clothing herself with the body of a huge peach the king frowned perhaps i did not make myself per fectly clear i apologize but he didnt look apologetic in other words you will change your aspect to appear young beautiful naive and fresh from the virgin islands geis of the gargoyle piers anthony oops iris had great powers of illusion but she would never be able to visit those islands not after that episode three years before when she hadnever mind i the operative word is appear he reminded her sternly i think your illusion should be adequate to gener ate such an appearance challenging as it may be he frowned but i must advise you that this mission is risky you might lose your life your love or your very soul sign here he put a parchment before her that seemed like a heavy price to pay for easing lone liness but she knew that her sacrifice could not be as great as the king feared because she had no love to lose so she signed the release form there followed some reasonably dull events it was easy to skim over it was enough to say that in due course her great effort of virginal illusion was successful and she was captured by pirates and sold to the slavers she found her self in the company of young women and children all of whom were stunned by their fate she was marched with the rest of the luckless captives from the ships gangplank through the three sisters dunes to the black heath to the central plaza of a stony city in ruins covered with twisting whispering vines of kudzu the ancient city appeared to have gray silvery stony gargoyles of every known size shape and degree of ugliness squatting everywhere she stared one of the grotesque stone monsters in the snoot and it required every ounce of her feeble and waning cour age not to scream with fear and revulsion those eyes of stone seemed to strip away her veils of illusion did the monsters know her secret identity she saw the dread blacksmith anvil in the center of the black heath she had learned that when a slave was sold he or she was married over the anvil new permanent collars of iron were forged with metal loops for the chains to connect to if she were bound in that manner none of her illusions would free her but she couldnt escape yet and not merely because of the manacle on her left wrist that bound her to the others in her miserable group be cause she had not yet learned the identity of the master slaver if she identified that man and told the king the man would be taken out and the entire slave industry would collapse but if she failed to identify him slavery would continue so her mission was not complete until she had learned what no other agent of the king had she was bound by her mission as much as by me chains they marched past a massive stone block there were dark stains on it the remnant of countless beheadings of slaves who had tried to rebel or who had been too weak or lazy to work as hard as they were supposed to or who had simply been unlucky she fancied she could see dents in the dust where their heads had bounced long live xanth she whispered inaudibly to squeeze a tiny frag ment of a bit of battered courage into her system truly she thought vengeance was the heart of justice she hoped one day to see the master slaver himself stretched across that terrible block they were brought to the steep face of a barren moun tain wall where several dark caves showed they were separated into chains of four or five and pushed unceremo niously inside two chains to a cave ironwood grates were clanged into place shutting them in this was their lodg ing for the night iris found dirty straw on the floor and shaped some of it into a mattress she lay on it sharing it with her chainmates who were three girls below adult conspiracy age and mended their tears as well as she could she gave the straw the illusion of soft warm down and the children relaxed and slept not knowing the source of their comfort none of them knew the fate they faced on the morrow but she was neither beheaded nor sold immediately it seemed that she was part of a group that was being held for a later event she was not even abused probably be cause that would spoil the delicate beauty of her illusion aspect the slavers thought she would fetch an excellent price if properly marketed and so they took their time piers anthony and the master slaver did not make an appearance so life proceeded in a halfway or thirdway manner for the nonce one day she sat with several others at a small cold gray stone table in the dark blue shade of a sweetsmelling eucalyptus tree in front of the kitchen cases facing the black heath plaza iris sat with her chainmate children drinking tsoda popka flavored with the juice of fresh sub lime in reality it was just water but the children had learned not to reveal or question the illusions that made their lives bearable iris never made any obvious illusions and never made any kind when a slavemaster was near or watching and no one ever hinted that their lives were any thing but drudge it was a faint conspiracy of silence the hot sun was just up and the day was showing that golden flash of green that iris enjoyed so much and if she enhanced it with illusion any slave who noticed pretended to ignore it one day at a time she whispered to herself take one day at a time and hope that she got to iden tify the master slaver before any of them were sold for although she seemed to be taking her ease looking around with interest at the red rocks moody blues and golden sands of the slave camp she was far from feeling relaxed or happy after doing only three weeks of under cover work for the king of xanth she knew that if things went wrong it would be undercover work in more than one way she had seen the slaver men eying her hoping that some flaw would turn up to make her unsalable so they could take her for themselves sometimes they left branches or stones in the path seemingly by accident that she might trip on in the dark a fall could mar her face dropping her value actually it had worked once she had fallen and scraped her cheek but she covered it with illu sion so that they never knew now she was careful to make the illusion of a darklight whose radiance could be seen only through the illusion of special contact lenses so that she could see her way in the darkness she was already homesick for the misty isle of illusion and the cool green seas that pounded on her sandy beach geis of the gargoyle she was also footsore from the original forced march to this hidden slave camp and the constant running around she had to do to serve the slavemasters and keep the chil dren out of trouble she had traded the lack of company for the lack of comfort well not entirely she remembered that summer when she had visited fire island and been swarmed by fire ants she had managed to put out the fire with copious wet sand but had suffered seconddegree bums on her feet and firstdegree bums on her legs for weeks she had hobbled along on blistered soles unable to conceal the pain from herself though of course she covered it with three and a half layers of illusion her feet werent in that much trouble here in the slave camp but overall it was about as bad because of the fatigue of the rest of her body and the humiliation of her situation she got up to fetch another small drink of water be cause illusion could not actually quench her thirst the children followed in lockstep because that was the best way to keep the chain from yanking on them they limped across the black square using illusion to make the walk seem natural to others toward the beautiful gothic fountain she didnt know what kind of creature a goth was but it must have been fearsome because the fountain was lovingly endowed with several unlovable hideous frozeninstone gargoyles playing in its golden center surely it had required a powerful spell to lock such crea tures there beside the fountain a scarred bluefaced leatherand chain grungy armored mercenary subhuman male was flirting with a fiery foxhaired feminine feline neohuman creature she seemed amenable as she was talking freely and acting very kittenish iris had seen her around and knew her name was katka like all camp followers katka though scantily clad covered one eye with the black shawl she wore over her hair this was a very strange thing and iris really would have taken note had she ever been in the mood to think about it why should piers anthony a woman cover her head better than her torso the slaver however seemed satisfied with that mode of dress and was inspecting it closely but iris only thought was her wish to jump into that silvery blue cool pool of water and to let the healing streams of liquid spouting from the faucetmouths of the diamondeyed dragonheaded stonefaced creatures pour over her head hands and fiery feet unable to resist she leaned over and splashed water across her face you there the mercenary shouted that is forbid den quickly she and the children filled their cups and hur ried away how she wished the master slaver would make an appearance so she could identify him and make her es cape and get this entire sordid operation forever shut down but whether from canniness or indifference he re mained absent that night hot and miserable iris moaned in her rest less sleep and dreamed a dream by the hot and humid noon in a dale of dragons almost lifeless a golden arrow in my breast i lay smoking mirrors rose all around me and scarlet drops of blood ran over my breast and dripped away i lay upon the golden burning sands alone the sheer precipices of the seven devils made no sound the kettenhund lay panting in the sun and i scorched too near the river of no return on the ground i dreamt i heard an infant crying in the light the demon struck there in the sand my lovers body lay steam rose from hells canyons ohno hot springs the blood ran cold and down and out of it and dripped away geis of the gargoyle she woke wondering what it meant she had never been struck by an arrow especially not a golden one or had a lover suffering like that yet the dream seemed much like a memory surely it had special significance she heard thunder outside the mouth of the cave it was raining with appalling violence and water was coursing down along the floor past her feet and on into the deeper reaches of the mountain no one knew how far the caves extended for not even the slavers dared explore them to their end only the water dared do that it was morning and now there seemed to be a break in the storm the children needed to eat so she led them out but she was mistaken in a moment the rain resumed and to her surprise it was freezing sleet battered them making them hunch low and seek the partial shelter of trees she decided to go back to the cave but it was too late the storm intensified into a hurricane filled with scream ing demons it drove her to her knees obliterating her view of the cave entrance and filling her mind with fear the children cried but could hardly be heard over the roar of the storm she reached out trying to bring them in to her for what scant protection she was able to offer she re alized that fracto the evil cloud must be here trying to destroy her fracto was one of the few things she could not readily befuddle by her illusions fracto had no illusions he was simply destructive blinded and deafened by the terrible storm iris went for the only shelter within range a vulgar thyme tree it was vulgar not in its appearance or attitude but in the sense that it was a common imperfect specimen with little effect on what was near it thus iris and the children were able to huddle by it while suffering only a little distortion of time it made it seem as if the storm had slowed with the hailstones angling down at a lazy rate bouncing slowly on the ground and rolling in leisurely manner the howling wind howled in a lower tone as if tired and blew the trees leaves as if they were reluctant to respond she knew it was still daytime but a great darkness was piers anthony closing in all around them part of it was because of the density of the awful cloud she knew but that couldnt ac count for the rest the children gazed around fearfully even little surprise seemed daunted she didnt blame them the effect was unnerving she knew she should not have gone out into the storm like this such weather was never to be trusted but where was the darkness coming from then sherealized that it was because of the thyme tree it was slowing down the light itself so that not enough could reach this spot and that gave the darkness its chance they would have to get away from the tree if they wanted more light they couldnt stay here anyway be cause the hailstones were piling up around their feet and making their toes deathly cold this refuge was no refuge chchildren iris said her teeth chattering we mmust go on before we frfreeze i will mmake a might to lead us to the mmess hall they nodded their little heads dully even the slavery they faced was better than this bonechilling cold then something halfway good happened the manacle on iris left wrist glazed over wrinkled and cracked partly open the thyme and the cold were stressing it beyond its limit and it was coming apart children she cried the manacles are being un manned maybe we can get them off they drew together in a circle and pulled on the chain that linked them and pried with sticks and banged with stones and bit by bit the manacles came apart one by one they pried them open and off slipping their little hands free they were no longer physically chained to each other but they remained socially and practically linked none of them could survive this storm alone and the children would surely perish if they escaped the storm and ran into the surrounding wilderness iris herself was little better off because her illusion could not make a material change in her situation geis of the gargoyle children we are only half free she said we must get to the mess hall and get warm before we can think about getting away from here i will make illusion mana cles and chains and you must act as if they are real until we see a good chance to escape do you understand they nodded they understood all too well they knew that the chain was only part of what bound them other wise they could have escaped with iris as a group they knew how to play the part they had learned how to sur vive in this awful situation of course iris herself didnt want to escape yet because she had yet to identify the master slaver but maybe he would show up before a good chance to escape with the children turned up iris made a bright illusion lamp and sent it floating ahead she no longer knew exactly which way the mess hall was but anywhere was better than here then as an afterthought she caused the lamp to float down close to the hailstonecovered ground and brightened it until it shone like a little sun the ice closest to it melted giving them a clear path it was a good thing the hailstones did not realize that the light was illusion they followed the light not much caring where it was going the storm still raged around them obscuring every thing but the little ball of light gave them comfort it floated this way and that as the wind buffeted it leading them along a tortuous path it seemed to iris that they should have reached the mess hall by this time even after allowing for the curlicues of the route but she didnt say anything for fear of alarming the children she didnt dare let them be lost then she spied a dim light ahead she diminished her il lusion light so that the slavers would not see it and forged on toward the real light the children in her wake the storm intensified around them as if trying to stop them from getting there for a moment an icy blast of blown snow air swirled into her lungs and made her breath crys tallize within them she fell to her knees gasping piers anthony but she had to set an example she put down her hands and crawled toward the light ahead slowly drawing near to the huge heavy wooden doors of the building the chil dren crawled after her then she hesitated this didnt look like the mess hall it seemed to be a strange building but they couldnt stay out here and her limbs were already too numb to get her to any other place they would have to gamble on this one she repaired her illusion as she struggled to her feet she made herself resemble a beautiful damsel in distress and the children looked like cute wee lasses in worse dis tress actually this was all true enough she merely en hanced their appearances so that anyone answering the door would find them appealing she conjured an illusion mirror and by the light of its reflection adjusted her decolletage to show a bit more bulge of breast and depth of cleavage then she clenched her numb fists and jammed them at the doorbell but couldnt break the ice that froze it so she tried to beat her knuckles on the door but they were too numb to make any sound so she kicked at the door instead and her lady slip per managed to make a faint feminine tap at last the door creaked forward there was an old maid why its you iris the maid said what are you doing out there with your knuckles numb and your cleav age getting iced over magpie iris exclaimed for it seemed to be her old demoness ladyinwaiting maid who had helped raise her before she bloomed somewhat anemically into maiden hood close enough the other said i was just checking to see how you were doing you seem to be locked into an interesting memory she vanished iris tried to figure out exactly what mentia was doing in her memory but her chilled mind could not think effi ciently enough to figure it out so she took advantage of the open door to plod on in with surprise and the other geis of the gargoyle children following for that matter what was surprise doing here she hadnt even been delivered until about seven decades later but it didnt matter as long as the building offered warmth when the children were all in she pushed the door shut locking out the dread storm immediately her extremities began to lose their chill and the children looked better too but what was this building would they be welcome here or was this merely the prelude to worse mischief she decided to make a wild gamble this may be a strange house she whispered to the children where the slavers dont govern im going to abolish our chains and the illusion manacles and chains vanished there was the sound of feet tramping along the floor of the hall to the door iris adjusted her illusory bust line be cause that was her best line of defense a man appeared wearing a great sword he paused gazing at her artful front now thats interesting he remarked well it was meant to be kind sir she said plain tively i am a maiden in distress and these are poor waifs in similar state will you help us she took a deep breath to accent the extent of her maidenly distress might as well he said i am the knight guard here to protect this house from the ravages of dragons do you have anything to do with any dragon not if we can help it bold sir knight iris said meekly then make yourselves useful he said sardonically he turned on heel and toe and went back to his dicey card game board court iris hesitated only twothirds of a moment we can be most useful in the kitchen she told the children be sides there should be food there so they trooped down the hall following the smell of baking bread and curdling whey it led to a large chamber whose entrance bore a sign reading hells kitchen that did not seem encouraging but what else was there to do but go on in they went in there was a huge fat cook in a white uni piers anthony form with a hat that looked like a big popover muffin he turned and saw them get out of here you ragmuffins he said the meal is not ready im shorthanded he lifted one arm to show how short his hand was but we came to help iris said many little hands make short work in that condition he demanded staring at them and iris realized that she had let her illusion slip so that she was no longer a buxom creature with a low dress line and the children were no longer angelic waifs instead they were all somewhat cold grimy stragglers get the bunch of you to that tub and clean up first he gestured to a monstrous kettle in the fireplace i am the demon rum report back to me when youre ready iris looked at the kettle it was big enough to hold them all inside it at once a horrible thought came to her but she suppressed it thank you she said quietly restoring her cleavage he took a look which was not surprising if there hap pened to be a man alive who would not look when she grafted that particular illusion he was surely blind and eat something he said you look famished that was a remarkably perceptive observation thank you she repeated deepening her cleavage and leaning forward but what should we eat eat my hat he said and tossed the popover muffin to her iris caught it and found it solid and fraught with as sorted berries with steamy rich pastry between it was big enough to make a meal for them all iris tore the hat into several delicious pieces and passed them out the children gobbled theirs down and iris her self ate ravenously under the cover of a more ladylike il lusion of course they all got thoroughly gunked up with dough and cooked berries but this was the time for it with a good washing coming up the huge kettle was about half full of warm water it would do iris made an inconspicuous illusion screen be hind which the children stripped then she lifted each up geis of the gargoyle into the kettle and had them start scrubbing themselves and each other after the last one was in she went behind the screen removed her own clothing crafted an illusion bathing suit tossed all their clothing into the pot for scrub bing and climbed in herself the children were gleefully indulging in a splash and clothing fight which was getting everything incidentally clean so she let it be covering it with an illusion of roiling smoke surprise got into a fit of conjuring producing things so awful that the other children made passionate choking and retching sounds fresh vegetables its my curse she said as she tossed cabbages squash broccoli peas beans sweet and sour potatoes turnips tomatoes beets celery and other disgusting produce at the others soon pieces of vegetable were strewn throughout the water iris reflected that this was probably the most enjoyment these children had ever gotten from vegetables in due course they and their clothing were pretty clean and the water was ugly dirty iris hung the clothing up by the fire to dry and clothed herself and the children in illu sory matching olive drab uniforms it was warm enough in the kitchen so that they were comfortable she led them to demon rum we are ready to work she announced you have already done the job he said iris and the children were surprised we have you made the soup they remained baffled we did there in the kettle rum explained vegetable soup they looked back at the kettle whose fire was now blazing up to heat the water to boiling but iris began thinking of the way they had just washed their dirty bodies in it flavoring rum explained as if reading her mind secret ingredient the children nodded catching on they would keep the secret the very notion of tricking unsuspecting folk into eating vegetable soup was hilarious piers anthony their job done they mounted the wooden stairs to the servants quarters on the second floor there was a nice chamber for them there with plenty of cushions for sleep ing on the floor naturally the children got into an enthu siastic pillow fight instead and soon feathers were flying they did not stop until no pillows remained intact iris distracted by concerns about exactly where they were and what might be their fate in this mysterious building did not notice until too late oh she cried in horror you have destroyed all the cushions then they heard the tramping of feet coming up the stairs iris could do nothing except craft a hasty illusion of pillows the way they had been before the door opened there stood the demon rum with all their clothes in his short hands you forgot these he said they are now dry he gazed at the group with mild interest iris realized belatedly that in her concern for the pil lows she had forgotten to maintain their illusions of cloth ing all of them were standing naked thank you she said taking the bundle and holding it before her in the manner of a shield there is one more task for you rum said you must remove the feathers so that the cushions can be washed he blinked as iris let go of her pillow illusion oh i see you have already done it very good he gathered up the empty pillowcases and took them away iris resumed breathing how lucky could they get love what happened then surprise asked iris was jolted out of her reverie oh you wouldnt care to listen to all that she said concerned about infringing the adult conspiracy she no ticed absently that the train was passing through the city of hinge again it must have looped around oh yes i would surprise said eagerly iris realized that she had made a mistake all children were eager to get past the conspiracy and of course that couldnt be allowed lest adults lose their power over chil dren but maybe there wasnt too much forbidden material in the memory and she could slip by whatever there was with an invisible ellipsis this was after all a train of thought traveling to the past so they were bound to explore memories very well she said with only faint resignation because the memory was an interesting one can i be in your memory scene again but that was long before you were delivered iris protested piers anthony geis of the gargoyle sure but you had children so i joined them i promise not to do any messy magic at another rime iris might have been bemused by the anachronism but if she could be with surprise now being physically twentythree why not be with the child when she was mentally twentythree very well she repeated after all memories were best when truly shared iris woke next morning with a feeling of great loss she knew she had dreamed of her lost love once again the one she had never had in anything other than a dream with a lingering trace of unease she whispered into her pillow oh power that be how long must i bear this loneliness but there was as usual no answer she glanced at the melting noneofyourbeeswax candleclock and saw that it was still early she quickly slid out from under her warm downfilled duvet shivering as her bare feet met the slabs of goldenflecked sandstone and skyblue turquoise that made up the royal checker board pattern of the floor she hadnt noticed how elegant this chamber was yesterday of course the floor had been mostly covered by feathers from the pillow fight and then they had had to go downstairs to work on another meal in the kitchen and it had been dark by the time they re turned so this was really her first real chance to examine the chamber in detail she was impressed who could have such a fancy chalet it could not be far from the slave camp because though they had gotten lost in the storm they had blundered only a short time but she was sure she had never seen anything like this in the vicinity the children exhausted by their labors of kettle and pil low were sprawled happily amidst their scattered cush ions still asleep this was a blessing for them too to be suddenly well fed and cared for instead of huddled in a dank dark cave but iris had what some might consider to be a suspicious nature she wondered whether there was some hidden catch in this delight she stepped quietly to the lavatory where there were wonderful conveniences of sanitation when she drew back the pretty cottonlinen curtains shrouding the round bathing chamber she could not suppress a gasp of pleasure there was a steaming bath already prepared but this cant be for me she breathed hoping she was wrong of course it can be dear magpie said appearing be side her i made your favorite lemon verbenascented bath you cant expect to endure with a mere vegetable soup bath now can you so it was you i saw at the door yesterday iris said of course it was until i got overridden by a more re cent memory magpie said helping her into the wonder ful bath sometimes i wonder just what adventures youre getting into in your latter life that seemed to make sense of a sort but what is this place iris asked as she luxuriated in the scented water why are we being treated so well i can give you only a partial answer magpie said the chalet belongs to a young man of noble aspect named arte menia you are being treated well because the cook likes you but the cook doesnt know i am a sorceress iris pro tested and anyway hes a demon so he doesnt care about mortal women now there you are wrong dear magpie said as she scrubbed iris back male demons can become quite in trigued by illusionenhanced mortal women and female demons can delight in seducing mortal men of course this is mostly casual byplay for them as they seldom form lasting attachments but magpie you i happen to like maidens in distress the demoness re plied they can lead interesting lives iris was surprised she had somehow taken magpie for granted before it hadnt seemed unusual to have a de moness maidservant you have served other maidens many magpie agreed did i ever mention rose of roogna piers anthony geis of the gargoyle no you didnt good it wouldnt have been proper when the bath was done iris rose and stood before the fulllength mirror she looked splendid she knew il lusions give or take a few so normally used illusions the way artists used their rainbow of colored big hogments or little pigments to give the viewer sights as beautifully rendered as fine paintings in fact she regarded herself as an artist with illusions but right now she didnt need any illusion for this moment here in the bathing chamber iris saw herself as young healthy slender and with enough nonslendemess to be appealing to whatever man might better not be watching venus rising from the sea magpie murmured appre ciatively it seems too bad to cover it up she neverthe less produced a lovely pair of p nties and br and then an ornate robe one of the children woke you put on what surprise asked undies magpie said quickly now go take your own bath that sobered the child in a hurry but then surprise had an idea can we have another vegetable fight may we magpie said sternly may we the other children were waking now have a fruit fight instead magpie suggested produc ing several soap bars in the shape of lemons grapes ap ples cherries and such one was even in the form of a small explosive pineapple the kind that acted just like a real pineapple but on a harmless scale the children gazed at those a bit suspiciously sus pecting that the fruits might be better at cleaning than at splatting then magpie produced soap in the shape of a gi ant watermelon that would make a horrendous splash and get water all over everything outside the tub and that de cided the children they grabbed the small soaps and rolled the big one last one ins a rotten eggplant i will watch them magpie said you go on to meet arte menia now who the master of the house he returned from his long business trip last night and learned of your presence so you must make his acquaintance now it would not be mannerly to remain in his house otherwise indeed it would not iris had been brought up to be properly behaved and this was integral to such behavior where is he downstairs in the office foyer he has some paperwork to catch up on so iris gathered her elegant borrowed robe around her and tripped daintily down the stairs to the office foyer there was a handsome young man sorting papers excuse me she said i am the sori am iris because some innate caution reminded her to maintain the secret of her identity i have been youri stayed overnight she wasnt certain whether she counted as guest or scullery maid the man stood he had wavy brown hair and a small butt i am glad to meet you iris i am arte master of this house rum told me you were beautiful but he understated the case iris blushed for she was using no illusion at the mo ment so was being complimented for her natural appear ance that was a rarity thank you she said rum has been most kind the children and i were freezing in the storm and he gave us food shelter and work to do yes hes shorthanded arte said his eyes were shades of gray but you will not have to work any more you are obviously a fine lady he took her hand in his lifted itand kissed it his hand and lipswere warm and firm iris felt such a thrill she almost swooned what a noble man he was she opened her mouth to say something re sponsive but all that emerged was an embarrassing titter you must have breakfast with me arte said drawing piers anthony geis of the gargoyle her from the study toward the banquet hall he seated her across from him with a flourish so that they could look into each others eyes rum appeared what will it be this morning master the demon asked the usual for me and something that tries to approach the worthiness of the lady for her very good sir rum vanished but i can fetch my own iris started arte put his firm hand on her trembling one i would not care to be deprived of the exquisite pleasure of your company for even a moment now that i have met you he smiled showing his even white teeth and half a dim ple dazzled she was afraid she was going to melt which would be embarrassing rum reappeared with two steaming platters a fried dragon egg for you master with hedgehog bacon on the side and a nuclear fruit for the lady he set them down and disappeared iris looked at the meal she had never heard of anyone having dragons eggs for breakfast routinely they were not the easiest things to come by certainly a dragons egg was considered to be the most manly breakfast available as for hersit looked good being a cluster of floweriike balls of scintillating circles and ellipses surrounding glowing spheres in the center but she wasnt sure how to eat it merely pop it in your mouth arte recommended di vining her doubt he lifted one of the bacon strips which iris recognized as deriving from the kind of pig that was made from the leaves of a certain type of hedge that often hogged the best soil of xanth dubiously she lifted one of the balls and put it in her mouth and froze awed by the experience because there was an immediate and extremely potent explosion of taste it was the most delightful gustatory sensation she had ever experienced she felt as if she was wafting across a field of roses and being buoyed by the exquisite scents after a brief eternity or a very long instant she settled softly back to a semblance of reality oh she breathed rapturously what is it the fruit of the nuclear plant arte said the plant detonates when taken from the ground and the fruit taste explodes when eaten it is considered a delicacy suitable for a lady though admittedly unworthy of a lady as lovely and gracious as you but its by far the besttasting fruit ive had she pro tested ive encountered nothing remotely like this be fore then you have been eating below your station he took a bite of his egg iris considered the rest of her plate the fruits were of different colors being green blue yellow purple and polka dot she had eaten a red one which had turned out to be roseflavored what experience awaited her with the other colors she tried a yellow one this time the explosion carried her into a realm of buttercups brimming with the sweetest creamiest butter fragrant vanilla plants and tangy lemon drops she would have thought it the finest taste in all xanth had she not just experienced the rose flavor as it was she gave up trying to make comparisons and just let herself drift through the little slice of paradise by the time arte had finished his most manly egg and iris had imbibed the last maidenly fruit she was so pleas antly dizzy that everything seemed clothed in warm fuzz i must show you the premises arte said standing firmly iris tried to stand but now felt so delicate she almost swooned fortunately he caught her in his manly strong arms before she fell but i see you are tired he said let me take you to my room to lie down this made such perfect sense that she was more than satisfied to accept his guidance soon they were in his pri vate room which was even fancier than the one she and geis of the gargoyle piers anthony the children had used it had an emperorsized bed that looked wonderfully inviting then he kissed her this was like nuclear fruit intensi fied her wits exploded into nothingness and she com pleted the swoon she had started downstairs in a moment or perhaps two instants she recovered she found herself lying on the bed with arte neither of them had any clothing on oh she said with a maidenly gasp what hap pened for it occurred to her that something might have she knew that women had a power men lacked to signal a stork while asleep had she been so uncouth as to try that you said something about summoning the stork he said so i removed our clothing but then it occurred to me that you were not wholly rational so i waited you mean youwedidnt i apologize if you wished otherwise he said but i remembered that sometimes folk are not in their normal emotional state after eating nuclear fruit that was the understatement of the hour she had been a third of the way freaked out with the pleasure of the fruit she would have thought that he might take advan tage of that state but it seemed he hadnt her body now that she thought about it indicated that he hadnt she might have been angry if he had but now that she knew he hadnt she had the opposite mood she liked him even better then lets do it now she said i thought youd never ask he said he put his arms around her and she turned into him for another kiss they drew close together the door crashed open several children piled into the room there you are surprise cried jubilantly iris barely had time to plunk an illusion blanket over their bare bodies whatever are you up to she de manded not entirely pleased by the intrusion she sus pected that arte had a similar sentiment we finished our bath and now were hungry surprise said so we came looking for you who is that man in bed with you arte glanced at the illusion blanket his eyes narrowed significantly evidently he was catching on to the nature of her magic but he did not make an issue of that at the mo ment i am arte menia the master of this house who are you they are the children i was traveling with iris said quickly they are innocent waifs who mean no harm then let them get themselves down to the kitchen for their breakfast arte said tersely iris drew the illusion blanket closely about her body as she sat up go down to the kitchen rum will feed you she said okay surprise said the children piled out slamming the door behind them now where were we arte inquired turning to her iris let the blanket dissolve we were about to address a stork i think she said yes i believe you are correct he paused but tell me one thing how did you make that blanket appear sav ing us from a drastic violation of the adult conspiracy she had to tell him its my talent the blanket wasnt real its illusion i your talent makes illusion blankets he said how fortunate for this occasion um yes she agreed that bit of caution still clinging to her what is your talent to persuade others of my sincerity he said persuasion she said dimly alarmed you mean i dont really want to do this but your magic makes me think i do he laughed by no means i wish i had such a talent for it would make roe far more successful than i am no it is merely my sincerity i am persuasive about isnt that the same thing it is not ill make a demonstration he looked at her we can summon ten storks at once piers anthony iris laughed thats impossible true i was unable to persuade you that it was but do you believe that i would sincerely like to do it she considered yes i believe you would like to so you believe in my sincerity not in the impossible that is the distinction she nodded now i understand you can make me be lieve in your feeling but not in the validity of what you may propose yes so i can make you believe that i sincerely desire to summon the stork with you but i cant make you be lieve that you want to summon the stork with me thats a relief she said because i do want to do some summoning with you and id hate to think it wasnt a real desire she lay down again by him and kissed him i think i have looked all over xanth for a woman like you he said dreamily and here you show up by chance at my house i bless the storm that caused you to blunder here his competent hand ran across her back and down to her the door burst open again there was surprise i fin ished breakfast she announced and dashed back here so i could see what you were doing iris barely had time to conjure the illusion blanket to get unbare we arent doing anything she said frustrated but we would like to be arte added let me see surprise said it was evident that she had some faint suspicion that there might be a conspiracy thing going on and like all children she was insatiably curious about it she walked into the room and reached for the blanket i really would prefer that you not do that arte said the child paused oh sorry iris realized that surprise had not distinguished between sincerity and possibility she hadnt separated his desire from hers that was fortunate because if she grabbed for the blanket it would be something else she got hold of geis of the gargoyle but the child wasnt out of incidental mischief whats this she asked heading for artes pile of clothes dont touch that the man cried sincerely alarmed but it seemed that he forgot to use his talent to persuade surprise of that dont touch what she asked this she picked up what looked like a miniature fat barrel on a string it must have fallen out of artes pocket when he dumped his clothing down with flattering haste yes that arte shouted reaching for it the child backed up just far enough to remain out of his reach that was another incidental talent all children had she looked at the trinket why because its mine arte rasped he lurched off the bed so suddenly that iris had to make a hasty illusion of a towel wrapped around his middle lest an awful breach of conspiracy occur he grabbed for the object surprise backed up another step say please she said imitating the obnoxious lessons of adults on manners you little arte said definitely breaching the conspiracy the air wavered in an expanding dirty pattern appalled and the stench of brimstone wafted out give it to me surprise scooted around to the side leaving him lumber ing into the wall she joined iris is it fun on the bed she asked innocently well it was about to be iris said please go back to the kitchen and we will join you there in a while she did not dare express her reason for wanting privacy arte caromed off the wall reoriented and came after surprise again give it to me he repeated mindlessly the child ducked and zipped past him holding her closed fist aloft but this time he was more alert he turned on a dimepede that had the misfortune to wander out from under the bed at that moment and leaped after her his lunge was so strong that something flew up from the floor and landed on the bed but surprise was already gexs of the gargoyle piers anthony going out the door nyaa nyaa she said being definitely ill behaved and slammed the door in his face arte wrenched the door open and plowed after her iris watched them go bemused this had certainly showed her another side of suave arte and not just his hind section which she had forgotten to cover with illusion the thing about an illusion towel was that it didnt have to be com plete to stay in place just the front half would do why did the man care so much about a stupid ugly little trinket that he would use a forbidden word and chase after a child clad only in half an illusion iris wasnt much con cerned about surprise who could be uncommonly evasive when she had a mind to be but about arte whose body she had been about to clasp what could be more compel ling to a man than stork summoning why hadnt he sim ply let the child play with it awhile in another room being distracted until there was a chance to complete their busi ness with the stork she looked at the thing that had landed on the bed it was a sock arte had kicked up one of his socks as he charged after surprise she picked it up and twisted it into a knot reflectively but it smelled so she stuffed it under the pillow well it seemed that her liaison was doomed for now she would speak most firmly to surprise about that at a later time but now there was nothing to do but get up and get dressed because even if arte returned soon the mood had definitely soured she abolished the illusion blanket and stared for there was the trinket under it surprise with truly cunning mischief had left the thing here while allowing arte to chase her all over the castle he would never get it from her that way because she no longer had it and she had done it intentionally because she had held her little closed fist up in an obvious manner iris was now pretty curious about the trinket herself she picked it up it wasnt heavy it was just the tiny rep lica of a barrel that might be filled with some kind of spirit she shook it listening in case it contained fluid then she rubbed it with her thumb to see if there were any catch that would allow it to open there must be some thing valuable inside it the cook appeared before her demon rum reporting master he said formally then he did a double take mistress i mean how did you get the amulet amulet she asked surprised this barrel trinket mistress you have asked and i must answer that is no trinket it is the miniature barrel i have been cursed to occupy when not in active duty for my master er mis tress i must obey whoever holds it iris surprise was giving way to appreciation you work for artebecause he commands you with this amu let true now i am yours to command what is your di rective mistress just like that i just pick it up and rub it and you are my slave even so mistress so you dont enjoy being chief cook i dont mind cooking its being a slave to a harsh mas ter i cant stand then why were you so nice to me and the children we didnt have the amulet you have asked and i must answer i was bored and you had an interesting decolletage not to mention your powers as sorceress of illusion or your mission to capture the master slaver and the children promised much mis chief thats not much of an answer iris said if you rec ognized me why didnt you tell arte he didnt ask it was starting to make sense and you are required to obey not to volunteer so you let us in and treated us well but still you had nothing to gain from this did you oh but i did mistress i hoped that you or a child would be my next mistress piers anthony why isnt one human being as bad as another as far as youre concerned perhaps but some are more interesting than others and some are less bothersome to work for and there is the moral dimension what do you mean demons dont care about morals being soulless demons differ i happen to abhor slavery for an obvi ous reason thats right she said realizing something else you can help me accomplish my mission where is the master slaver he is at this moment chasing the child through the kitchen chasing she paused oh no you mean yes mistress arte menia didnt you wonder why his house is so close to the slave camp but hes such a decent man rum made a peculiar expression it was as if something was burbling up inside him that would not be restrained his chest throat and head bulged in turn inflated from within was he about to be sick mistress he gasped may i laugh laugh if you wish ho ho ho he laughed the syllables boldfaced de cent man ho ho ho but he was being nice to me she protested nettled he didnt know you were either slave or spy he thought you were a lovely lost maiden and he wanted to summon the stork with you before you learned of his busi ness even the meanest man can put on a show for a little while she was rapidly coming to believe hes responsible for all this misery he governs the slavemasters he is the bane of xanth even so mistress after you caught on he would have clapped you in chains and used you to satisfy his lust re gardless of your sentiment undl he tired of the sport then geis of the gargoyle he would have tossed you to his henchmen for similar treatment but he liked the illusion if you will pardon the expression of decency a willing maiden is more fun than an unwilling one ins emotions were mixed she had hated the master slaver by reputation and her mission was to capture him and destroy his operation but she had been really in trigued by the suave handsome attentive arte menia what was she to do she decided that she needed more information i never saw you out in the field or any other demon why didnt he use you to round up slaves t am not a violent demon mistress i am no good at nasty stuff so he finds other uses for me i keep his house and i fetch food and supplies and i move him rap idly from place to place as he goes about his business but i would faint at the sight of spilled blood a fainthearted demon i find this hard to believe would you believe that i managed to make him believe this regardless that it never occurred to him mat when he tried to use his talent of persuasion of sincerity on a de mon it bouncedback and affected him instead because it requires a human object so that i managed to get a rela tively soft hitch working for him instead of being con stantly worked iris nodded i think i can believe that but what am i to do with you i dont care to keep a demon slave wrap up your business here and then turn me over to your storm king who will no doubt hide the amulet away safely so that no one else will know it exists thus i should have a prolonged rest which is what i crave will you believe that i am a lazy demon yes i will believe that she said with a smile is there anything else i should know i thought you would never ask arte menia is return ing to this chamber having failed to catch the child or re cover the amulet his mood is not sanguine iris came to an abrupt decision return to work in the piers anthony kitchen exactly as before so that no one knows that your master has become a mistress i will summon you at need she lay back on the bed mistress if i may make a suggestion rum said looking alarmed yes do not let the amulet leave your person because if he should recover it understood i will keep it on me at all times until this is done thank you he faded out she heard the tramping of angry feet coming down the hall quickly she put the amulet to her head braiding sev eral hanks of her hair over it and through its chain so that it would not fall free then she covered the whole by illu sion hair so that none of the amulet showed covered only by her illusion blanket she awaited arte he burst into the room disheveled that confounded brat he exclaimed he had found a real towel somewhere to wrap around his middle but it was in danger of falling but what do you care about a mere trinket iris in quired innocently we were about to summon the stork indeed she still rather hoped to do so but first she had to know the truth from his own mouth she would give him a fair chance to exonerate himself after all the demon might have been lying to her not being truly bound by the amulet she did not know a great deal about demons but her mother had cautioned her not to trust them because they might have conspiratorial designs on innocent maid ens so her belief in what rum had told her was less than she had indicated mere trinket he exclaimed but then a canny look sneaked across his features and he calmed himself true it is not worth much in any practical sense but it has sen timental value my grandfather gave it to me well then im sure the child will return it to you in due course she just likes to make incidental mischief and loses interest when she can no longer do that geis of the gargoyle i am going to boil that child in he started then re considered forcing a smile that is do you really think so perhaps you should ask her to give up this foolish game and return it to me iris shrugged why not she let her illusion blanket slip down somewhat beyond the decorous level tell me arte what is the nature of your business merchandise he said i handle special merchandise that is why i must travel so much to fetch it and to de liver it to the purchasers really what sort of merchandise he had the dubious grace to look faintly uncomfortable oh just items for which there is a market you wouldnt be interested yes i would iris said letting her blanket slip another notch his eye glimpsed what now showed and evidently sent a message to another part of his body i think we were about to do something interesting when we were so rudely interrupted he said exuding refurbished charm for some reason iris found it less conducive than she had before do you know that there is a slave camp not far from here she inquired intercepting his hand with her own before it reached the region the illusion blanket had re cently covered half a shadow crossed his face there is yes she saw that he was being evasive but that didnt necessarily mean that he was a slaver so she pushed it farther hoping that he would exonerate himself because he remained a handsome man in fact i am one of those slaves you are but you dont wear a slave manacle so he knew about those the children and i got caught in a storm so cold that our manacles cracked off then we came here for shelter what do you think of that his eyes remained fixed on her front and his hand held by hers quivered as if eager to complete its travel i geis of the gargoyle piers anthony think its a good thing you found this house now lets get on with what we were doing still she demurred arent you outraged by the situa tion people being caught and chained and made slaves against their will that too he agreed now lets just lie down close together and think of storks lots of storks in fact she continued relentlessly i am a sorceress on a secret mission to identify the master slaver and de stroy his ill operation that alarmed him visibly a sorceress what is your talent illusion oh yes the blanket but his eyes were calculating now the news of the slave camp had not surprised or alarmed him but the news of her nature and mission did but illusion isnt real so maybe ill just hold you down and get on with the stork refusing to be distracted by spe cial effects what against my will she inquired affecting shock well it isnt as if i can just let you go after what you have told me he said reasonably so you are the master slaver but he was too canny i didnt say that come lets forget about this dialogue and generate some ellipses he pushed her back on the bed getting closer to her torso how could she get a direct confession from him she wanted to be absolutely sure before she took him in he might be merely a henchman or a relative perhaps there was a way though it was risky she de cided to try it she let go of his hand and lay back on the pillow behind her he immediately closed the gap between their bodies she reached under the pillow oh she said in feigned surprise whats this if you had ever summoned the stork before youd know what it is he said as he embraced her more closely he did not seem completely displeased oddly i mean this thing under the pillow she said bringing out an object that looked like a tiny barrel on a chain isnt that the trinket the child took she must have left it here the amulet he exclaimed snatching it from her hand it was here all the time amulet she asked with all the naivete she could muster i thought you said it was just something your grandfather gave you of sentimental value some sentiment he said ill show you he drew back and rubbed the barrel demon rum appeared you summoned me master yes tie up this spy and leave her naked on the bed so i can do what i desire with her without any more delay be fore i throw her away but i thought you were a nice person iris said to arte why should you treat me this way nice person arte repeated derisively what a fool ish girl you are rum approached iris menacingly but i thought you liked me she cried to arte youre no better than a slaver ho ho ho he laughed i am better than a mere slaver i am the master slaver so know foolish sorcer ess that instead of capturing me you have been captured by me and your last act in xanth will be to satisfy my urge to address the stork and then ill have that brat who tried to steal the amulet boiled in beer how can you help him in this she asked the demon you seemed so nice when you let me into the house yes terday sorry about this rum said as he looped cords about her wrists and ankles and tied her securely down on the bed i must obey the one who holds the amulet but how can you mistreat children iris asked arte i am through listening to your mewling you pathetic creature now shut up or ill have the demon put tape across your mouth piers anthony then i have no choice but to capture you and turn you over to the king iris said coming to her final decision she had given him every chance but he had merely con firmed the worst her heart ached because she had really been getting to like him before learning the truth ho ho ho he laughed harder you and who else then to the demon now go round up those brats and keep them in a safe place until i get new manacles for them he advanced on her again the amulet clutched in one hand i think not the demon said arte paused what you heard me pee brain the demon said im not doing a thing to those children i like children how dare you arte exclaimed obey you ludicrous excuse for a foul spirit or ill make you do much worse i doubt it you feculent excuse for a human being your days of mischief are over arte turned his head to look at the demon you cant say that to me you crazy spook im your master oh yes i can simpleton i have a mistress now and i like her better than i ever liked you arte looked at the amulet then at iris whats going on here this isnt in the script as i said iris said im taking you in to the king for justice your fell career as a slaver is through when youre all tied up and about to be cruelly rav ished i dont know whats with the demon but youre about to pay for your arrogance he lunged for her iris bonds puffed into smoke as she leaped clear he landed face first where she had been she landed on the floor facing him havent you caught on yet oaf the demon asked with a sneer you have been caught in a snare of illusion what illusion arte demanded turning over all this witch does is make pretend blankets im illusion man cheeks the demon said and so is that amulet geis of the gargoyle arte looked at what he clutched in his hand it fuzzed out and was revealed as his twisted sock what i have the real amulet iris said she touched her hair rubbing in the right place a second demon appeared you summoned me mis tress then he did a double take how can there be two of me your illusion image has been calling your former mas ter names iris said thats an outrage rum said i demand the right to call him names directly do so as you tie him up iris went to pick up her clothing rum approached arte you cant touch me the man exclaimed scrambling off the bed is that so stink horn breath the demon inquired as he conjured stout ropes and looped them around the man mistress may i dunk him in the boiling soup before haul ing him off to the king iris considered i think not it would spoil the soup all too true rum agreed regretfully what about the lesser slavers what would you do with them iris inquired i would give them their hearts desire which is my very essence this set iris back she wasnt interested in rewarding the slavers she wanted to punish them those lazy bums arte demanded without my harsh discipline theyd just get blind stinking drunk then she understood yes give them your essence de mon rum she said and tell the slaves to come here to the house for warmth food and freedom done mistress rum said and vanished the door opened surprise peeked in oh goodyyou found it yes thank you dear iris said how did you know about the amulet buttlescutt around the house said there was something geis of the gargoyle piers anthony there had to be for him to bind the demon cook so i looked for it in his clothing but there wasnt time for me to figure it out so i left it with you while i stracted him iris hugged her you did exactly right surprise not only does this enable me to save us we are putting the slavers out of business soon the slaves started showing up at the house rum gave them warm clothing and good hot meals they were at first fearful then astonished most of them had given themselves up to their fate and not expected any such re prieve iris assured them that it was legitimate and that they could all go home at any time assisted by the demon she and surprise took a walk outside the storm had passed and it was halfway warm there were the slavers sprawled blissfully across the landscape halfempty bar rels of rum beside them they were unlikely to recover be fore the kings men arrived and so it was done and i had had my adventure and completed my mission iris concluded the master slaver was delivered to the storm king and never heard of again and there was no more slavery in xanth but you shut me out of the good part surprise com plained i wanted to see you summon the stork i know you did dear and you know i wouldnt violate the adult conspiracy like that even if i had summoned the stork with that monster yeah but the demon rum was fun specially when he started insulting the master slaver yes iris agreed somewhat sadly if only arte menia had been as good as he once seemed did you ever find another romance ah the direct questions of children but it was best to address the painful subject honestly not really iris con fessed not until magician trent and that was imper fect it was why again that innocent directness it was a marriage of convenience i wanted power and he needed a wife we didnt love each other i think he never really forgot his mundane wife who died but didnt you summon the stork to get queen irene yes we did dear and i came to love trent he was exactly the kind of man i needed but he never really cared for me not that i blame him why not arent you pretty enough perhaps i am now but when i married trent i was fortyone years old and somewhat dowdy of course i en hanced myself with illusion but he knew the truth in fact he insisted that i use illusion for all public functions but he always knew me for what i was physically and men tally he never said anything unkind but he had no pas sion for me so the double tragedy of my life was that the man i might have loved turned out to be a slaver and the one i did love didnt care for me though i tried to pretend he did but youre young nowand so is he why dont you do it now do what now you knowall that stuff i dont know passion and storks and stuff iris sat amazed she was young and so was trent he was a man who liked beautiful women she had seen it in her fifty years of marriage to him he had never acted on it being a man of scrupulous conscience but she knew he would have liked toin fact now would surely still like to youre right dear when i return to my husband knowing all i do now i shall not let opportunity pass un clasped thank you for reminding me of the obvious youre welcome hey seewere coming into hinge again iris looked it was true they had completed another loop apparently the train didnt really go anywhere anthony tiad been pointless to use it to search for might as well have stayed where they ly she realized that she had after all ac of their mission she had an excellent in lere the philter was hiding dream hiatus walked through the city reasonably confi dent that he wouldnt find the philter but if he could somehow distract the philters attention while one of the other parties ran it down that would be enough so he tried to look purposeful mentia formed beside him where are we going she inquired anywhere he said shortly here comes desi maybe we can ask her he tried to laugh but the joke wasnt funny the illusion approached them she was garbed in an offtheshoulder blouse and a dress with a short tight skirt why dont you give up this pointlessness and let me dis tract you she inquired winningly hiatus grimaced i know you are a mere animation of the philter and you arent going to help me find it so why dont you go away but i could be so nice to you if you just let me she said geis of the gargoyle piers anthony the only one i want to be nice to me is the real desiree not any soulless imitation and if he wanted a fake one he could trust id do it mentia said assuming the form of the dryad hiatus looked from one to the other disquieted he couldnt tell them apart suppose he thought he was with mentia and it was desi i good point mentia said resuming her usual form ill pop over and check on the others now so dont trust her she faded but he protested then he felt the pressure of her invisible hand on his shoulder mentia wasnt leaving him she was merely pre tending to to see what desi would do that was reassur ing but he maintained his worried look so that desi would not realize of course she could read his mind but maybe she wouldnt do that right now i could help you help her desi said mentia doesnt need any help i was speaking of desiree doesnt she have a problem with her tree yes the madness makes its roots square and it needs round roots to prosper and your talent is growing round roots my talent is growing ears eyes mouths and noses but when i try here in the madness it messes up here in the madness your talent is growing round roots she repeated which is exactly what the dryads tree needs hiatus stopped stunned youre right i can help her tree and then you will surely have her love and can re main happily with her ever after in fact maybe you should go back to her right now to get started on your happiness yes hiatus exclaimed then he felt the invisible hand on his shoulder caution ing him no he decided not until garys mission here is done youre such a fool desi said your dryads tree will die without your help and the dryad with it after you have failed here what comfort will you have there when you see the dead tree her words battered his heart because he was afraid she was right but he knew she just wanted to get rid of him and that might mean that the philter feared he was on course to find it so he resumed his walk you may then think to take the demoness up on her of fer to emulate desiree for you desi continued but the moment you leave the region of madness she will revert to form and be quite irresponsible and crazy so she wont honor any such deal youll be stuck he walked on without responding though again her words seemed mercilessly accurate but you can gain some piece of your desire with me desi said at least youll have a notion what it might have been like with the true desiree you arent her he said though he felt the wicked temptation but you dont need her your problem was that you could never find a woman as fair as she is but now you have i am exactly as fair as she is fairer in fact because i emulate your memory of her in her prime she was still right but he knew he couldnt trust her he kept walking we are approaching the train station desi continued seemingly undismayed perhaps you should take a train ive already taken a train of thought he said thats how we came here true but these trains go to special places your friends are traveling to the future and the past and not getting anywhere maybe you can find a better one he was about to reject the notion and turn away from the station but then it occurred to him that she might be trying another ploy she had tried to talk him into leaving piers anthony geis of the gargoyle hinge and it hadnt worked then she had tried to seduce him again verbally now she could be trying to trick him into denying her a third timeand thus after all failing in his quest of the moment because the train might take him to the philter so he kept walking toward the station in fact theres a train coming in now desi said with seeming enthusiasm that was certainly suspicious the sign on the front of the train said dream was that a distraction or could the philter be hiding in the dream realm hiatus had had some limited experience with big zombie gourds and knew how weird they were inside most gourds could be entered only via their peepholes leaving the body behind while the spirit ranged through the dream realm but it was sometimes possible to enter physically though it was dangerous what kind of entry would this be from the madness the dream realm was already so wild that he could hardly conceive of it becom ing moreso for that matter the madness beyond this more or less controlled recreation of the ancient city of hinge was pretty crazy too so this train could be going to the wildest craziest maddest realm of all that daunted him which might be exactly what desi was trying to do to cause him to avoid the dreadful prospect so he ought to go right on into it and maybe find the philter this did seem like a suitable prospect it would naturally hide in the place folks were least likely to want to look so he nerved himself and boarded the dream train of thought he stepped up the steps entered the coach and sat down in a seat by a window and desi came with him sitting beside him did that mean she still hoped to divert him or that she had already succeeded in doing so and wanted to be sure he didnt change his mind he just didnt know to make it worse he hadnt felt mentis reassuring squeeze for a while she might really have popped off to see how the other teams were doing that was fine of course but that left him alone with desi and he was nervous about that yes shes gone for now desi said shall i kiss you first or show you my panties neither you awful illusion he said youd like both she said still accurately and i shall be happy to oblige you she leaned toward him so that her silken hair brushed his shoulder no he cried pushing her away his hand passed right through her image without effect he had forgotten for the moment that she was an illusion despite addressing her as such youre just a manifestation of the philter who wants to stop us from accomplishing our purpose of course but cant we still be friends this struck him as an odd ploy why would you want to be friends it does get dull in the course of thousands of years and i am confined to the region of madness of course that is growing now and in time it will govern all xanth and i will have everything i may decide to want but that will take time and meanwhile it could be entertaining to have a relationship with you demons get bored he asked surprised when they dont have the company of their own kind why dont other demons associate with you he asked hoping to learn something useful the madness does odd things to demons as it does with people she said you may have noticed how mentia changed demons dont really like that so they avoid it and you cant avoid it i am a special demon anchored to my physical compo nent since that is in the madness i can not leave the mad ness i have learned to live with it indeed to prosper with it but i am isolated and that becomes wearing something nagged at the fringe of his attention why are you talking so candidly to me you concealed your na ture before it was not in my interest to reveal my nature when you were trying to locate and enslave me now that you piers anthony have discovered it on your own we are entering the next stage negotiation it may be that we can do each other some good he did not trust this we are people with a mission to help xanth you are an alien thing with no interest in the welfare of others what good can we do each other what do you owe xanth she asked taking the seat opposite him and leaning forward persuasively her some what exposed front was especially persuasive her form was indeed fairer than that of any mortal woman and she clearly lacked the maidenly restraint of the real desiree what has xanth ever done for you other than tantalize you with what you long for but cant have that was difficult to answer he had not been satisfied with his life the fact that desi could read his mind did not change the reality of that blahness that was his life xanth had done little for him still there was a matter of principle and after this mission was done he could join desiree dryad save her tree and perhaps win her love that would make everything worthwhile but you would still be in the region of madness desi reminded him where i remain i could destroy her tree at any time if i chose that electrified him indeed a few small sparks radiated out from his fingers if desirees tree was lost desiree would cease to exist because she was the essence of her tree then we must capture you and harness you into the interface so you cant do that she immediately retreated i didnt say i would just that i could i have no case against the dryad but i could practically guarantee that you could be with her by leav ing her and you alone in contrast if i were limited and the madness retreated her tree would be back in unmad xanth and its roots would revert to normal and she wouldnt need your help do you think she would pay you any attention then there was another telling aspect hiatus thought he could win desirees love if she needed him to maintain her geis of the gargoyle tree but his chances were next to nil otherwise he needed to have the madness remain ironically in order to have his dream but still he didnt trust desi if you remain free and the madness keeps expanding you wont need me either so would have no reason to let me be with desiree she and i can be safe from you only if the madness retreats that depends she said leaning farther forward so that the top of her blouse fell away from her bosom re vealing its nicely curving architecture and it became hard for him to pay full attention to her words every breath she took was breathtaking for him if you and i had a work ing association we might be able to afford to trust each other and do each other considerable good he was amazed you are bargaining with me what could you possibly want of me other than to let you alone as i said it does get dull here and human company is better than none i could entertain you considerably and your entertainment would be my entertainment do you believe that i dont think i do he hoped that was the right answer his brain wasnt working very well as long as his eyeballs were glued to her gently heaving bosom but he knew that what entertained demons was not necessarily what enter tained the mortal folk they associated with then try this there is a service you could perform for me that i would greatly value i would do a lot for you in exchange for that service hiatus grew canny he hoped you mean like the ser vice i could do for desirees tree so that she would need me and like me yes if i needed you i could do an emulation of liking you that you would find persuasive and certainly enjoy able she took another breath more than making her point i am a practical entity what service he asked flatly he was learning how piers anthony to think a little though his eyeballs seemed to be heat sealing themselves in their sockets moving me hiatus drew a blank doing what moving my physical component from one place to an other so that i could travel then i would no longer be confined to the region of madness and could extend my influence into normal xanth immediately but to do that i would have to find you he protested for he remembered that however compelling her twin hemispheres might be she was not the philter she was just a projection projected to blind him by cooking his eyeballs yes so you can appreciate that i will never allow you to find me unless we have a deal that guarantees your trustworthiness at present we can not trust each other but if that changed we might enable each other to possess our respective dreams hiatus was amazed again you can read my mind you know i dont much like you however tempting you make your illusion form and im sure you have no feeling at all for me except irritation at the inconvenience of having to deal with me how could we ever trust each other if you knew that only i could guarantee your happiness with desiree and i knew that only you could enable me to travel without danger we would be bound to each other by realistic selfinterest it could be an extremely mutually profitable arrangement but i would be betraying the interest of xanth he protested there was no doubt about it his eyes had fused in his head staring at her earnest breast that depends on how you look at it she said glanc ing down as if to make sure her mock hypnogourds were still functioning since in time the madness will expand to cover all xanth and my power with it you would be merely accelerating the speed of the change not its nature and you would reap extraordinary benefit yourself in fact if you wished to have nominal power in xanth such as be geis of the gargoyle coming king it could be arranged i dont care about that sort of thing my power is expressed in other ways king hiatus had never thought of such a thing no my talent is not magician level and anyway im sort of a nothing person as my name shows my sister lacuna was the same until she married retroactively im not cut out for greatness i just want to find happiness with desiree and thats all to quote a memory in your mind some are born to greatness desi said earnestly her breathing deepening some achieve it some have it thrust hello mentia said appearing i hope im inter rupting something she eyed desis decolletage which promptly misted over then the illusion woman faded out where were you hiatus asked trying to crack his eyeballs out of their locked positions she was seducing me with wonderful promises and with hot meat too the demoness remarked she peered into his face sure enough your eyes corroded dont you know enough to blink at least once a minute heres some lubricating oil she produced an oilcan and squirted a drop on each eyeball then massaged his eyelids to spread it around his eyes finally ground out of their grooves it hurt to move them around but he wanted to get them back to full working order sheshe offered me a deal he said what can she offer that i cant offer i speak theoret ically of course having no more inherent interest in you than she does he considered that actually probably nothing but it seemed persuasive at the time well thats because you mortal men are constitution ally unable to look and reason simultaneously oh i wouldnt say that she assumed desirees form with desis open blouse she leaned forward and breathed now reason with me i uh duh he said staring piers anthony her blouse closed itself up his eyes broke free just be fore they corroded again point made he said the other teams are proceeding she said but not finding anything so i took time to look around myself but i couldnt locate the philter it is certainly well hid den but it must be afraid that we can find it he said be cause its taking a lot of trouble to interfere with our search yes and the ones i think it fears most are gayle goyle and you because it has taken the most trouble to eliminate or subvert you it ignored iris and surprise so you must have the key to its location if i do i dont know what it is he said it may be something you are destined to do or see maybe you will just happen to blunder on its hiding place and it knows that so its desperate to divert you or subvert you before that happens hiatus shrugged i suppose but she scared me she said she could destroy desirees tree she lied how can an illusion hurt a tree but its a demon really and demons can set your foolish mind at ease im a demon i could hurt a tree but why would i bother it would be a lot of work to no purpose the philter is a demon but of a dif ferent species apparently most of its bulk is bound into its physical aspect and it has very little left over so it uses a variant of illusion stretched very thinly with just a bit of substance to provide the feel of it when necessary so when she kisses you only her lips are solid and when her hand touches you only the skin of her fingers is tan gible no way could she damage a tree protected by its dryad thats right he said appreciating her reasoning that lady dog lied to me thats why i told you not to trust her she looked out the window say i think were getting where were go ing geis of the gargoyle he followed her gaze that looks like a giant gourd the entry into the dream realm she agreed this is going to be interesting interesting why because demons dont dream i dont know what to anticipate in a dream a dream in madness is frightening he said you de mons havent been missing anything youd want well well see she stood as the train creaked to a halt lets get on with it he followed her off the train a path led directly to the monster gourd the thing was so big that the train itself could have steamed on into it but perhaps the train knew better a sign over its entry said abandon hope all ye who enter here is this wise he asked nervously if the philter doesnt want us to go here its probably where we should go mentia said besides im curious you have never had a bad dream delivered by a night mare he told her right im sure its intriguing lets head on into stone hunch he realized that she would have to leam the hard way she had never dreamed so had no fear in just the way small dragons who had never encountered ogres lacked fear any human child knew better than to tempt a night mare but a demon didnt they entered the enormous peephole with a normal gourd the peephole caught the eye of the looker and would not let it go much as desis exposed bosom had locked hiatus own eyes in place but with a big gourd this effect was minimal because the whole body was caught in it suddenly they were in a strange room there was a pic ture hanging on the wall showing a portrait of a man hi atus didnt recognize he glanced away then back at itand the portrait had changed realizing that he must be geis of the gargoyle piers anthony mistaken he looked away and to it a third time it had changed again there was a window through which he could see rain pouring down incessantly he looked away and to it again but the rain did not change but he knew that it had not been raining outside the gourd more strangeness there was a peculiar machine directly in front of him with a board filled with letters of the alphabet and a screen right above it oh no he breathed a shiver of dread running through him i recognize that device by reputation its corn pewter the evil machine who changes reality in his vicinity so that no one can escape what a weird place mentia remarked i think we had better get out of here before pewter wakes and starts messing with our realities hiatus said oh pooh she said a stupid machine cant affect a demon im not sure of that im leaving he turned and started back out of the gourdbefore realizing that there was a solid wall of the room behind him the scene had shut him in uh that is maybe you can leave he said sure but she remained standing beside him go he said nervously fade out pop off you can warn the others not to enter the gourd i cant she said visibly disturbed im trying to fade but its not working i was afraid of that youre trapped too we cant get out of this until we figure out howand it may not be easy the dream realm doesnt follow ordinary rules you mean this is a dream stuck in a stupid room and i cant act like the demoness i am this isnt fun bad dreams arent fun i tried to warn you well then ill just bash my way out she walked to the wall formed a triplesized fist and punched hard her big fist bounced off the wall harmlessly owww she cried jamming the fist into her mouth which she ex panded hugely for the purpose mmmph owmmmmph yowmmmph what was that she pulled the fist out with a slurpy pop that stupid wall hurt me but demons dont hurt he reminded her she looked at her big hand which was now turning red and pulsing in bad dreams they do it seems i guess you are now subject to human limitations maybe theres another way out he turned back to face the picture window and evil machine pewter remained asleep fortunately he took a careful step to the left avoiding the machine a word appeared before him floor hiatus stared at the word i know its the floor he said why should i need a word to tell me that mentias hand had shrunk back to normal size though it still looked sore maybe the floor doesnt think much of your intelligence irritated hiatus took another step his foot landed on a rug another word appeared rug he experimented whatever he touched evoked a word picture window desk wall door it was really weird he tried to open the door but it wouldnt budge they discovered that mentias motions didnt bring forth the magic words in fact she wasnt able to have any effect on this set it ignored her completely while keeping her trapped within it to her increasing frustration there was an envelope on the desk on which pewter sat but he couldnt get it open to leam what writing might be in it there was also a small piece of paper with some cryptic names and numbers there was a sound of ringing from the side hiatus looked in that direction and saw that the sound came from beyond the door to another room the one he couldnt open look at the ceiling mentia said he looked there were more words one of them was open so he reached up and touched that word it came away in his hand geis of the gargoyle piers anthony he was getting a glimmer of a notion he carried the glowing white word to the door sure enough when he touched the door with it the word faded and the door opened it showed a small chamber with a new door that seemed to lead outside and another to another chamber but by this time the ringing had stopped time passed they explored three rooms of this odd house including the kitchen where there was a big white food box that was cold inside and had a sandwich he ate the sandwich and returned to the second room the ringing resumed and he saw that it was coming from some kind of device set on the wall i know what that is mentia said its a mundane phone ive heard of them they talk they talk you use the loose dingus she explained so he took the loose dingus which dangled a cord which connected to the box he put it to his ear hi dug the dingus said im not dug im hiatus he said oh sorry must be a wrong number dug mentia said wasnt that the name of that mundane youth who visited xanth my better half was forced to be a prospective companion but wasnt chosen but she never saw the mundane side of it hiatus had heard of the game he realized this could be a source of information that might help him get out maybe not he said maybe this is the right number but the wrong person i think i dont belong here yeah the voice said who are you im hiatus who are you im edsel dugs best friend you say dugs not there edsel mentia said thats one of the names on that note so this must be dugs house not now hiatus said to the dingus but maybe hell be back soon okay edsel said tell him i called there was a click and then a buzzing silence hiatus put the dingus back on the device on the wall at least he had learned something in the course of further experiment he learned that dugs girlfriend pia had just dumped him so he made a deal with edsel pia in exchange for eds motorcycle hi atus had no idea what a motorcycle was but the deal gave him the chance to try the game of companions of xanth and he thought the game was a better place to be than this weird mundane dream setting a flat object arrived at his door and mentia figured out how to put it in the computer because she had had a bit of experience with the real game the screen formed a picture and they stepped into that scene and found themselves in a cave but grundy golem was also there he did a double take hiatus what are you doing here im looking for the philter what are you talking about dont you know this is the entry for the companions of xanth computer game its not for natives then the golem saw mentia and what are you doing metria you havent been selected as a companion yet im not metria the demoness said shortly well you look exactly like her have you heard me stumble on a stupid word no but im her worser half mentia she did something dis gusting so i split im a little bit crazy you dont seem crazy either thats because this setting is crazy i get perversely sane when my surroundings get crazy well if youre hiatus companion get him off this set before a real player comes mentia became canny just tell us where the philter is and well be gone geis of the gargoyle piers anthony grundy shook his little head i dont know anything about a filter whats it for purifying water hiatus said then it must be out beyond the pail look for it there wheres this pail out along the enchanted trail the golem gestured to ward a door in the cave which was now open they went out and followed the trail to isthmus vil lage in whose bay an evil censor ship was anchored the folk there were grumpy their dialogue peppered with bleeps so they headed out into the countryand there was the pail but when hiatus went to pick it up it sailed into the air and flew away toward the horizon whats going on here he demanded feeling as irrita ble as the villagers oh i remember mentia said you cant accomplish anything until you get beyond the pail and you have to figure out how to do that its one of the challenges of the game so how do i get beyond it im not supposed to tell you that you have to figure it out for yourself but im not playing this stupid game hiatus said im just trying to find the philter thats right i forgot she looked thoughtful maybe i can ask the pail you can talk to the pail yes but its an arrogant thing and wont help then why ask it anything because i can be obnoxious when i really try hiatus didnt understand her logic but didnt protest they walked on along the path until they caught up to the pail again then hiatus waited while mentia floated up to it listen pailface she said im a crazy demoness and the only thing i have better to do than bug you is find the philter since we dont know where the philter is i think ill just bug you forever you cant bug me you nuisance the pail said you cant pick me up and your stupidlooking friend there doesnt know how to get beyond me so hahaha in your face its not my face youll be meeting mentia said you cant move away because of me because im not the player so you have to remain there for it she adjusted her dress for what the pail asked derisively you going to kiss my pot demoness not exactly she lifted her hem as she stood beside the bucket you going to show me your panties you cant freak me out demoness because im not a man we shall see she hoisted up her skirt and squatted over the pail hiatus clapped his hands to his face just barely in time to avoid seeing her panties hey the pail cried alarmed you cant do that i cant im going to make a good effort though there was the sound of panties coming down aeeeee the pail screamed all right stop this as inine display ill tell you how to find the philter i dont know she said i think id rather see what it takes to fill you to overflowing enough of this crap the pail cried desperately youre a demoness the philter is a demon you know how to fetch a demon she paused why so i do she agreed demons can be conjured very well ill spare you my effort reluc tantly she straightened up and let her clothing reform around her hiatus walked up to herand immediately the pail sailed up and away that didnt matter we can conjure the philter he asked yes any demon can be conjured you just have to know its true name so whats the philters true name she shrugged i never knew the philter personally the geis of the gargoyle piers anthony true name is a demons most private thing maybe one of the other parties will have learned it hiatus nodded i think we have accomplished some thing lets get out of here and rejoin the others she looked around ill be glad to how do you get out of a dream he remembered that demons didnt dream so she wouldnt know actually he wasnt too sure himself usu ally his dreams ended when he woke but how could he wake from this one sometimes a dream gets scary and the fright wakes the dreamer he said since im the mortal here i must be the dreamer if i wake we should both be out of it shall i make a face like this to frighten you she asked taking her hands and stretching her face into a gro tesque shape no i know who you are so im not frightened maybe if i show you my panties she reached for the hem of her skirt no dont do that it might freak me out but maybe not wake me how about jumping off a high cliff no that would kill me in a dream he reconsidered thats rightfalling in a dream scares you awake without killing you very well lets go jump off a cliff they walked on until they found a cliff beside the path it dropped off into a crevice of a valley does that scare you mentia asked it sure does he backed away from the brink i dont think i have the nerve to jump no problem she wrapped her arms around him lifted him and flung him over the brink aeeeee he screamed as he plummeted interesting the demoness remarked appearing beside him thats exactly what the pail said when it viewed my pale posterior but the pail wasnt about to die of fright he gasped trying to grab on to her to slow his fall she eluded him no it was about to die of disgust i told you i could be obnoxious when i tried agreed he grabbed for her again but his clutching hands passed right through her image without contact the rocky ground was rushing up at him hiatus sa vored one more instant of utter terror then landed and found himself sitting on the ground near the palace of the city of hinge he was awake unharmed it worked mentia said pleased we must do that again sometimes dreams are fun geis of the gargoyle harness gary and gayle rode the train of thought back to thestation at hinge when they got off they found hiatus and mentia waiting for them a train was ar riving from the other direction and soon iris and surprise joined them they all walked slowly back to the palace comparing notes it seemed that one couple had gone to the past but this had been merely a matter of reminiscing an other had gone into the dream realm gary and gayle had of course visited the future none had found the philter but the philter seemed determined to kill gayle gary said we finally turned our ship around and came back because it was too dangerous and we werent learning any thing the demoness mentia nodded it is clear that gayle knows something we need i dont know what that would be gayle protested i have been nowhere for three thousand years and desi tried to seduce me from the mission hiatus said physically and emotionally she offered me every thingdesiree the kingship of xanth whatever i might desire she even showed me her he stopped overcome by delicacy actually gary had a fair suspicion what desi might have shown him based on what hanna had done the philter seemed to be getting desperate so you too must know something important iris said or have been about to find it out mentia said as i believe we did we too may have learned something iris said but not enough they entered the palace lets discuss this mentia said i think we may have learned more than we thought desi appeared oh you must be very tired after your long journeys she said solicitously and hungry we have beds and banquet waiting now im sure of it mentia said with satisfaction ig nore her and proceed with the discussion what do you know iris i think i have figured out where the philter is iris said that wont do you any good desi said it is only an object physically and wont do a thing for you where is it gary asked in the center of the magic iris said the very center thats why the trains of thought all circle around they cant go beyond the philters range and i think it needs the very strongest magic to craft its powerful illusions and effects its not inherently strong it is buoyed by that in tense field making it a super demon it must be in the cen ter of the focus circle but thats where i was gayle protested surely you dont think that i no dear iris said you are no demon mentia would have known if you were and you are no illusion i would have known and you are a gargoyle gary knows as a group we are uniquely qualified to assess your nature per haps by no coincidence you are beautifully innocent but geis of the gargoyle piers anthony your location is also that of the philter i strongly suspect it has been hiding in the tiles beneath you for three thou sand years beneath me gayle cried amazed i suppose it could be true for i talked with its illusions often but i never suspected it could be that close this is ludicrous desi said even if you found the philter you wouldnt be able to affect it you dont have the the what mentia asked alertly nothing what did you find out mentia gary asked that we can conjure the philter the demoness said evenly its a demon you cant summon the philter desi said the philter cant move i said conjure not summon mentia said that is to exert power over it we can conjure it into the interface we merely need to be close enough to it for our conjura tion to have full effectand we need to know its real name why i know that gayle said its there was a deafening blast of sound drowning her out then mentia assumed the shape of a great golden blob and the noise faded what did you do gary asked surprised she became a blob of golden silence iris said shes neutralizing desi who had become an obstructive noise gayle you were saying its name is fil gayle said fil philter i remember that from when they were first working on the interface i didnt realize that was important but the philter knew it was important gary said thats why it was trying to kill you when you started as sociating with me so now we have the whole of it iris said we know how to right the wrong of three thousand years ago and reverse the spread of madness and free the gargoyles we have simply to go to the center of the magic circle and conjure fil into the interface and our quest will be done then lets do it gary said mentia reappeared in her usual form that may not be easy she said desi is gone for the moment and so is her noise but the philter as it is presently enhanced by the madness magic is one powerful demon much stronger than i am and it is determined not to let us conjure it into the interface it tried to distract us from learning its se crets and now it will distract us from acting but now that we know where it is and what to do it wont be able to stop us gary said iris shook her head the philter has powerful illusions those will be difficult to get past but well know they are illusions gary said so well just have to feel our way forward and not fall in any holes illusions supported by demon powers mentia said so berly i agree thats a potent combination we had better organize carefully now i can recognize and perhaps counter some of the illusions iris said surprise may be able to lend me sup port when i need it but the demonic aspects i will be able to identify mentia said and to counter to a degree if i dont face the full brunt hiatus can help me that means that the gargoyles will have to be our guides when we get preoccupied with illusions and de monies we can do that gayle agreed i know the way but gary said still not seeing what all the fuss was about lets go iris said grimly before the philter has any more time to organize its defense and theres still something missing mentia added something we need desis not the smartest of illusions and she almost let it slip but we dont know what it is maybe we can find it iris said by traveling in a geis of the gargoyle piers anthony zigzag pattern and keeping alert for anything out of the or dinary everythings out of the ordinary here in the madness hiatus protested true mentia said but there may be something dif ferent even so if we can catch it it may give us the final key to victory this seemed nonsensical to gary but he realized that there was no point in arguing either they would find that mysterious thing or they wouldnt so they left the palace gayle led the way with gary close beside her and suddenly he realized why they were taking it so seriously the city of hinge had completely changed it was now a plain covered by a ripple on the ground it was pretty in its way but he knew that if the philter could change the semblance of the city into that of a plain it could do other visions too and that could be real mischief surprise screamed then gary saw a terrible bug stalk ing her it was a nickelpedethe insect whose pincers gouged out coinsized chunks of flesh there was another nickelpede behind it and others coming toward the rest of them in fact the entire ground was covered with them that was what made the ripple effect gary realized that though his natural form was immune to them his human form was vulnerable it was impossible to cross this re gion illusion iris said tersely ignore them nuhuh mentia said some may be real hidden among the illusions iris winced youre right what a devious ploy ill bum them devious indeed suppose they had nerved themselves and waded through the illusion swarm only to be chomped by the few real ones they hadnt recognized you cant just wipe out the illusions he asked iris with faint hope no i cant i can abolish only my own illusions not someone elses that has never been a problem before be cause all illusions were mine this is a new and difficult situation then her fire started an illusion lightning bolt came down casting off several fiery washers and a nut and flames spread out from the scorched region the illusion nickelpedes squeaked and chittered as they caught fire they fled the blaze and in the process spread it much faster than it spread itself so illusion fire burns illusion insects hiatus mur mured impressed yes iris said i cant abolish the enemy effects but the philter cant abolish mine either and where they meet nature takes its course a clear path was opening where the fire had cleared the nickelpedes they started to walk along it but then gary saw a nickelpede that hadnt been scorched that was one of the few real ones the creature scooted toward them but gayle bounded forward and stepped on it with her massive stone foot the thing was flattened into the ground and stirred no more but already a new menace was forming there was a mountain in the distance and down that mountain flowed a large river and the river was spreading out and flooding the plain that was depriving the fire of its base and it was hissing and flickering out they moved on cautiously knowing that illusion could cover a pit in the ground gary banged into something and realized it was one of the huge hinged stones covered by the illusion of nothingness he and gayle tapped the ground ahead with their toes making sure it was solid but the water kept rising it came up around their an kles so that their feet could not be seen under its brown swirl there could be more nickelpedes concealed under that ready to chomp them it wasnt safe to proceed then iris made an illusion causeway it seemed to rise up just above the level of the water so that they could see their feet again the river couldnt made the water rise geis of the gargoyle piers anthony faster than the causeway crossed it because it required a lot more illusion water to fill the plain than illusion sand to make the causeway until the storm started that looks like fracto iris muttered so it did there was a huge fuzzy face on the surface of the cloud with bulging cheeks and angry moist eyes the mouth opened and lightning shot out followed by a freez ing gust of wind whats fracto doing in an illusion surprise asked wherever there is ill to be winded fracto is there mentia explained he doesnt care where it is he has a nose for mischief like none other the wind struck the surface of the water and stirred up waves the waves became huge and reared up to pound against the causeway in a moment they had breached it knocking big holes in it the water surged through eating at the remaining edges carrying the sand away i can fix that mentia said she dissolved and re formed into two towers girt by many thin cords sup porting a planking it was a suspension bridge across the first big gap in the causeway gary set foot on it and it was solid because the demon ess did not use illusion she used her own substance which could become as hard as she wished it to be for a while so he crossed and the others after him gayle walked beside it because her weight would be a special burden and she had no fear of nickelpedes anyway there was a pained squeak gayle lifted a forefoot from the surging water there was a nickelpede attached to a toe it evidently had suffered a broken tooth it fell limply into the water without a splash gary almost but not quite felt a bit of sympathy for it but while they were on the middle of the bridge span something huge appeared in the water it looked like the fabled mundane creature a whale so big nobody could believe it it forged onward ever onward toward the bridge threatening to bash it down it was illusion of course yet it looked so real that gary spooked he ran on to the solid section of causeway ahead while cursing him self for his foolishness the whale crashed into the nearer bridge towerand the tower began to tip over the whale was real surprise screamed gary reversed course and ran back onto the tipping bridge to save her he caught her just as she slid off into the water but then he fell into the water himself there was no help for it he just had to run through it as well as he could it was only waist deep and illusion so he really was running though it looked like deep wading there was pain in one foot a nickelpede no in half an instant he realized that it was just an ordinary bruise he had kicked a hidden rock he made it to the island section of the causeway carrying surprise the moment they were safe he set her down and turned back to see what else was happening the bridge was down and dissolving but part of it was forming into a gi ant rubber band whose end was around iris the band con tracted almost catapulting iris to the island mentia had saved her but hiatus was floundering in the water oh i want to use my magic to help him surprise said dont you dare iris told the child you need to save your magic for the conjuration so that was why surprise had been so meek magically it made sense she still had powerful and varied magic but she might need all of it when they came to the final reckoning with the demon philter so she was exercising painful restraint and in the process learning the way of control she would surely be a much better child when she returned to her family then hiatus rose in the water looking startled its got me he cried the rubber band opened a mouth you fool thats gayle goyle it called piers anthony hiatus looked down at the sleek stone shoulder beneath him oh thanks he looked somewhat sheepish now the sun came out huger and hotter than it ever was in regular xanth gary realized that it too was probably illusion it blasted down on the water making it so hot it boiled and evaporated in a hurry the intense radiation didnt bother gary but of course he wasnt illusion they watched as their island grew because of the receding wa ter soon the plain was bare again if there were any nickelpedes remaining they were probably seasick by this time now gary thought of something how did an illusion whale knock over a real bridge mentia reappeared in her usual form the philter is a demon remember it has demonly powers not a lot of physical strength because its real body is elsewhere but it can become solid in some instances so it made just the top of the whale solid and it pushed against the top of the tower and the magic of leverage made it fall gary was now satisfied the philter was a formidable opponent with its combination of illusion and substance a lot of one and a little of the other but they did the job but as the plain reappeared so did another threat it looked as if a rug were sliding slowly across it but the rug grew as it got closer and gary saw that it was actually an enormous herd of animals they were stampeding di rectly toward the erstwhile island buff low mentia said looking at the oncoming mass if they run over us well all be buffed low no theyre illusion iris said then her counterillusion formed another fire it swept across the plain toward the buffs looking very hot the animals saw it and spooked in a moment they were mill ing around trying to reverse course but the ones behind were still surging forward not yet aware of the danger it didnt matter the rampaging herd had been halted and it was possible to make some progress toward the magic circle geis of the gargoyle but now a new class of illusions formed the surround ings became pleasant with trees and a castle ahead why thats castle roogna iris remarked surprised the philter can read our minds hiatus reminded her anything that any of us remembers it can make appear and all of it is dangerous mentia said because of the real threats it covers i am well aware of that iris said somewhat sharply im just trying to figure out the nature of this ploy why should the philter present us with something unthreatening we were countering the threats gary said so now its trying another approach or merely trying to guide us in the direction it wants mentia said and away from what it doesnt want us to find remember there may be something we are looking for besides the philter itself a figure appeared before the castle it walked toward them it seemed to be a young woman carrying something heavy and thats electra my grandsons wife iris said a wonderful girl whats she carrying surprise asked i am not clear on that iris said its all illusion any way they waited while the woman approached gary saw that she was not especially imposing or beautiful but she seemed like a nice person her hair was bound in a prac tical braid and she wore blue jeans she doesnt look like a princess surprise said iris smiled she never acted like one either she was always rather scrawny had i been in charge of things i would have had prince dolph marry princess nada naga an outstanding creature but electras doing the job and now i know i was mistaken her magic talent of electricity is far from sorceress level but she makes up for it by be ing very nice and reliable she gave me twin grandchil dren dawn and eve the stork brought them noremember two i wouldnt change her for any other geisqf the gargoyle piers anthony electra came to stand before them bearing her object it was black with red and white knobs on the top can someone help me carry my battery she asked i have charged it up but its very heavy why sure princess hiatus said starting to step for ward nuhuh mentia said extending an arm to restrain him theres demon substance in that battery you wont take my battery electra asked looking extremely innocent youre an enemy illusion iris said grimly we dont trust you then you must accept the other thing i have for you electra said setting down the battery assault and she sprouted fangs and pounced on surprise but gayle moved more swiftly leaping to intercept her the gargoyle knocked the woman to the side so that the child was never touched the image of electra dissolved into an irritated cloud gee thanks surprise said curiously unconcerned maybe she thought the attack had been another harmless illusion she stepped forward to investigate the battery mentia formed into a bright metal shield and jumped between the child and the battery and the battery ex ploded shards of metal flew out some bouncing off the shield one struck gary but it didnt hurt him being illu sion but it was clear that there was substance in the ones that struck the shield because it clanged loudly with their impact iris kneeled down before surprise are you all right dear she asked sure but now the child looked shaken why did that nice lady try to hurt me because you are evidently now the leading threat to the freedom of the philter mentia said reforming from the shield the rest of us were threats when we were fig uring out how to locate and control it but now we know how to do that so we no longer matter to it we will need your magic for the actual conjuration so it seeks to de stroy you first how do you know that gary asked surprised because the philter is a cold logical demon without a lot of direct physical substance or energy to waste it wouldnt attack her physically unless it feared her the others nodded the demoness had proved to be the most sensible of them all again we shall have to be specially protective toward her iris said i will carry her gayle said she lay down before the child and surprise climbed up onto the stone back and grabbed on to the stone fur this is fun she announced a gargle ride a gargle ride gary agreed though he winced inter nally they had to keep the child safe and happy as well if they could manage it already something new was developing a group of creatures was advancing from the castle centaurs iris said beware their expert archery but if the arrows are illusion gary began whatever flies at surprise wont be mentia said any more than the fragments of the battery that flew at her were then we had better take evasive action gary said appreciating the point but its hard to flee when we cant see the real terrain i cant abolish the philters illusion but i can recognize it iris said theres an avenue through the city that way she pointed to the thickest section of the orchard surrounding the castle we can run along that with fair safety and it looks completely impassable mentia said suggesting that thats the way the philter least wants us to go they were still searching for they knew not what gary remained doubtful but had no better alternative to suggest geis of the gargoyle piers anthony so he kept his mouth shut in this region of madness maybe the maddest notions were appropriate so gary ran trusting her perception and the others fol lowed him it looked as if he were heading directly into a thicket of needle cacti but there was nothing there it reminded him of desirees magic path invisible to those not on it but this one remained invisible while they were on it however the centaurs changed course to pursue sev eral nocked arrows to their bows as they galloped within range mentia formed into another shield this one with legs and ran directly behind gayle and surprise protect ing them but at the rate the centaurs were overhauling them theyd soon get around that we cant outrun those illusions hiatus said puffing theres a real hinged stone column here iris gasped pointing to the left hide behind that gary swerved into what looked like a mud puddle and glanced off the side of the stone column ouch but he found the comer of it and gestured to the others they whipped around it and clustered behind its protection the illusioninvisible stone at their backs mentia formed into a metallic tube with wheels whats that gary asked a cannon a mouth on the tube said when the cen taurs appear touch this flame to my rear a thin torch ap peared gary took the torch when the centaurs slued around the corner he touched the flame to the back of the cannon there was a muffled boom and smoke flew out of the mouth a big ball plowed through the centaurs knocking them down so thats what a cannon is hiatus said impressed the remaining centaurs took positions behind other stone hinges the stones looked like trees but iris identi fied them for what they were the cannon would not reach the centaurs beyond those columns but neither can their arrows reach us gary said with some satisfaction then an arrow sailed around the comer just missing him it struck a projection of stone and fell with a death rattle one of those centaurs can shoot around comers hia tus said awed these special effects in madness are stretching my imagination mentia said resuming her usual shape and squeezing her ballooning head back together but stretch marks remained on her forehead more arrows squealed around the comer striking all around them only one was real and that one struck gayles shoulder and was shattered but it remained ner vous business because the arrows appeared so swiftly that they could not tell which ones were real until after they struck one of them passed right through iris noseand though that one was illusory it did have some effect oh im losing my wits iris cried as a shower of whitish glowing blips sprayed out from her head im just not used to taking my own medicine she grabbed inef fectively for the blips ill help surprise said eagerly she crossed her eyes the wits expanded to building block size and lay tumbled about their glow now suffusing the area oopsthat worked wrong waitwe can use those as they are mentia said stack them up before us to make a safe mental haven she grabbed a big wit and set it on the ground before sur prise gary picked up another wit and set it beside the first and hiatus joined in soon they had formed a wall as high as they were and the arrows could no longer get through but why are some of these brighter than others hi atus asked pointing to the uneven glowing of the wall gary shrugged some are dim wits thank you so much iris said caustically i have a more serious question mentia said why geis of the gargoyle piers anthony did surprises talent misfire she was trying to collect the wits and instead she made them large shes a child gary said she doesnt have perfect control yet yes i do surprise said except when we first got into the madness but now i allow for that something messed me up are you sure dear iris asked she had recovered her wits they werent in her head but they were right before her and well organized into the wall so she seemed to be all right now couldnt you have gotten confused in the excitement no the child said with certainty something inter fered the philter mentia asked if it can change your magic we have more of a challenge than we thought no it can read my mind but it cant change itor my talent surprise said we dont need to hassle the child about something un important hiatus said shes doing her best you dont believe me surprise said accusingly its not that hiatus said taken aback its just that you think im too young to know whats what please dear dont get fussed up iris said alarmed and you do too you all think im confused well you are young gary said but thats no dispar agement well ill show you surprise flared ill make my self old no dont waste your magic mentia cried but her voice of reason was too late surprise crossed her eyes suddenly she was a grown woman fortunately her clothing had grown along with her she was now an attractive lady of perhaps thirty though she looked unfinished in some undefined way i am now adult she said i apologize for my erstwhile childishness but i assure you that some force outside my self or the philter distorted my prior effort of magic i had intended to draw the wits magnetically into my hands and instead they expanded and solidified oh you are lovely but you need a finishing touch iris said she reached into a pocket and brought something out what is that surprise asked makeup its a secret illusion girls use that boys dont know about it makes girls who are too young look older and women who are too old look younger she touched surprises mature face with powder and sticks of color and sure enough soon the woman came into better focus the others exchanged most of a glance surprise did seem to be a credible witness what do you suppose caused that distortion mentia inquired i have no idea but i can orient on it if you wish perhaps you should as it may be important for us to know what is influencing us then gary realized what mentia was after that myste rious thing they might need to complete their job that the philter was trying to hide from them they might be near it but the demoness was being cautious lest this be merely a false lead made by the philter surprise crossed her eyes exactly as she had in child hood why its a cache of reverse wood in powder form she said surprised someone long ago mixed a potion consisting of equal parts magic dust and ground reverse wood and sealed it in a jar after three thousand years or so the seal is beginning to leak so it affected the exercise of my talent it did not reverse it merely distorted it be cause the potion has odd magical properties why would someone make such a potion mentia asked a demonly light of excitement showing in her eyes i conjecture that it is for some specialized purpose surprise replied a new barrage of arrows came these ones glowed one stuck in the end of the wits wall setting fire to it incen diaries iris said alarmed at my wits end piers anthony gayle went out beyond the wall came at it from the other side caught the shaft of me arrow in her stone teeth and jerked it out the burning stopped flares went off the sky beyond the wall lit up with fancy silent explosions of light there were beautiful red blue green and yellow streaks across the sky can you lead us to that jar mentia asked or tell me exactly where it is so i can fetch it i can take you there surprise said but you shouldnt waste your magic on some stupid potion hiatus protested i think this may be important mentia said look at how the philter is trying to distract us from it hiatus nodded point made it doesnt want us to have that jar well hold the fort here gary said you two fetch that jar the flares became so bright and dense that the entire landscape and sky were intolerably bright now there was noise a kind of roaring moaning as of a fierce north wind with its toe stuck in a grinder the philter was certainly alarmedor wanted them to think it was mentia formed herself into an impervious transparent sheet she wrapped herself around surprise surprise walked around the stone hinge and disappeared into the seeming forest lets distract the philter if we can hiatus said he patted the ground with his hand feeling for things to throw he evidently found something though it was invis ible because of the overlay of illusion gary and iris did the same and gayle sniffed the ground soon they found a number of throwable stones they heaved these out toward the source of the fireworks gary doubted that this would have much effect but in one and a half moments there was a crash and a section of the sky went blank apparently they had scored on a source of illusion geis of the gargoyle then the color faded there was a clucking sound and a squat bird walked toward the wall whats that hiatus asked it looks like a hen iris said do hens have scales gayle asked there was something familiar about it gary focused his memory trying to place the creature then he had it thats a draghen he exclaimed stay away from it why hiatus asked then the hen opened her beak a jet of flame shot out and splashed against the wall now i know why hiatus said fortunately the wall was solid and most of the henfire was illusory so not much got through mentia and surprise returned surprise was holding a glassy jar about a quarter full of a gray powder the lid was loose she said i screwed it tight so theres no more leakage but i thought wed never get through to it the illusions were horrendous so the philter really didnt want us getting that jar gary said it really didnt mentia agreed but all it had was il lusion and a smattering of substance and those werent enough to stop us but we still dont know why it fears the jar i can divine that surprise said i think you should mentia said then you should re turn to your natural age we wouldnt want you to get stuck in this age that would be horrible surprise agreed she crossed her eyes then looked surprised they used this for the original conjuration of the interface its the main ingredi ent it allows the conjuration to change the nature of exist ing magic you mean mentia asked her eyes growing so large she looked like an insect yes it will enable us to bind the philter into the inter face without otherwise disturbing it it should all have geis of the gargoyle piers anthony been used up before so they threw the jar away they didnt realize that it wasnt empty that some was left over which should have been used to harness the philter but why because the philter made an illusion that the jar was empty to conceal the fact that it had avoided incorpora tion in the interface they thought they had done the job properly when they let go of the jar the philter covered it with illusion so that it could not be found again so the error could not be corrected and it got itself a three thousandyear restat xanths expense and now we shall end that rest gary said surprise crossed her eyes suddenly she was small again but the makeup remaining on her face made her look uncannily mature you did well dear iris said the child clouded up but i used up more of my magic i wont ever be able to do those things again a tear fell from her eye in a good cause iris said soothingly now if you can transform my wits back so i can have them again oh yes i can do that now that the jars sealed the child crossed her eyes and the witblocks dissolved into whitish specs that zipped back into iris head that feels so much better iris said gratefully i shall try not to lose them again they plowed on through the massed illusions counter ing them one by one and two by two and three by three when an army of ogres tromped toward them iris made an army of giants to oppose them the result was a battle so horrible to watch that they quickly fled its carnage when flying dragons appeared iris made land dragons to counter them with more awful battle when foul harpies flew in dropping their explosive eggs foul goblins with slingshots came to strike those eggs with stones and ex plode them before they were dropped all manner of mon sters were met by all manner of other monsters and annihilation was continuous they followed a hiway the low road and a byeway saying hello to the first cheer up to the second and fare well to the third when a giant appeared with a bb gun that fired slinging bs from a bhave at them they coun tered with an aa gun that aced out the bs they came at last to the null magic circle here the ef fects diminished but they knew that the worst was to come for they would have to brave the philter in the very heart of the strongest maddest magic of all gary was surprised to see that it was now night the rock stars were out bright stones in the sky rocking with the music of the spheres and cubes they waded and swam through the pool and reached the central island there there was light as the great central cone of intense magic fed down to bathe what they now knew was the philters hiding place in some of xanths most powerful magic it shimmered with seeming malig nancy it was mentally and physically daunting but i can help you handle it gayle said im used to its intensity just grab hold of my fur they did so and it did help they moved as a group in side the enclosure to the pedestal where the gargoyle had squatted for three thousand years it was empty of course but now shimmered with the hint of an illusion in a moment the illusion became more than a hint the copy of the warrior maiden hannah appeared so you think you have won she spat at them the spit made weird contortions in the air before landing in the channel around the pedestal but you dont have the nerve to har ness me mentia turned to surprise we can support you but you are the one who must actually take and hold the phil ter can you handle it the child looked stricken i can do the magic i need but nerve isnt magic is it no dear iris said it is a quality of character im too young to have such character surprise said a tear forming at one eye or the other geis of the gargoyle piers anthony i have learned to use my messedup magic in a new way hiatus said maybe you can use yours in a new way too to get what you need gee i can how well can you orient on what you need as you did to find the jar of potion no i cant do any magic twice but you can do similar magic suppose you could make things become visible so sure surprise crossed her eyes suddenly the chamber was littered with things gary looked around trying to figure out what they were it looked like so much garbage talents mentia said those are individual talents made visible she has the talent of seeing the talent of others iris said in fact shes given that talent to all of us sorry surprise said the magic is so strong here that it turned out a whole lot stronger than i expected and of seeing talents as individual entities hiatus said seeyou look like an illusion iris and you look like a cluster of twisted roots iris re torted but you do have a point gary looks like a horren dous stone gargoyle surrounded by pure water youre beautiful gay ie told gary but we must not be diverted from our need mentia said sensibly i would love to collect all these talents and figure out what each one is this one for example she picked up a little ball of whirling whateversand puffed into psychedelic smoke gary felt seasick watching it and he saw surprise getting wild even gayle seemed quite nervous hiatus was waving his arms in some insane pat tern dont do that iris snapped youre driving us crazy the ball dropped to the ground mentias usual shape reformed that was the talent that of driving people crazy what are all these loose talents doing here hiatus asked bewildered mentia got sensible again this is just about the most powerful magic in xanth because of the focus she said when people fade out of the scene it may be that their talents are left without hosts so they must drift toward the strong magic magic surely attracts magic so they collect here that does make sense iris said but it doesnt solve our problem we need nerve for surprise maybe a variant gary said make qualities of char acter visible sure surprise said crossing her eyes the talents faded new things appeared just about as oddly scattered there were chunks of stone splotches of mud puddles of goo portions of anatomy chips of wood and things that might have resembled squished insects if examined sickeningly close these were qualities of char acter some folk have strong backbone mentia remarked gazing at a fragment of human spine some dont she looked at some goo but wheres some nerve let me see the child said she looked around ah theres what i need gary looked he saw a bit of string at the edge of the channel he picked it up this its just lying around thats nothing hanna said derisively pay it no at tention but look what it says surprise said he looked the side of the string was printed with the word nerve that was what hanna had said the child lacked it seemed that it resembled a talent so he took it to the child she laid it on her little arm and it sank in now i have plenty of nerve she said con fidently curses foiled again hanna muttered i think she is giving up too easily gayle murmured geis of the gargoyle piers anthony gary had to agree the philter was as slippery and decep tive as any demon so now at last we are ready to harness the philter iris said as i understand it from our vision of the original conjuration of the interface surprise must use her magic to pick up the demon and the rest of us must speak the words of the conjuration then we add the potion in the jar i dont remember the words hiatus said and any way the philters vision couldnt be trusted to show that part right how do we know the real words hes right mentia said when you conjure a demon you must have the ritual down perfectly or it will turn on you and destroy you thats why hanna is being so sub missive shes expecting us to blunder ahead thinking we are ready when were not there must be a spellbook or something that tells how to do it this is going on forever iris exclaimed it has been three thousand years gayle pointed out it will be another three thousand years if we dont do it right point made mentia said surprise can you do magic that will make whatever we need to do the conjuration ap pear so we wont miss anything important sure the eyes crossed nothing changed um iris began i did it really i did surprise said but the philter is covering it over with illusion mentia said catching on iris if you can penetrate the illusion yes iriss eyes assumed a faraway look she turned around in a circle yes she repeated they are glow ing under heaped layers of illusion a little book and aa tangle of straps straps mentia asked what do straps have to do with harnessing the philter then she did a double take a harness we need a harness of course most demons are conjured for spot purposes but this one we mean to bind into the interface a magic harness will hold it there where are the book and harness gary asked not far away iris said the original folk must have dropped them after they thought the job was done and theyve never been touched since she walked to the edge of the chamber plunged her hand into the seeming wall and came up with a book bound by a strap then she went to the other side and reached up toward the ceiling bring ing down that tangle of straps from some masked alcove now we have it all we can do the job hiatus took the book and opened it he read the instruc tions aloud they were surprisingly simple they had merely to take the philter put the harness on it pour the potion over it and speak the words fil enter interface recompile then put the philter in a safe place and depart gary must speak the words mentia said its his mission why anyone could do this hiatus said looking up why did the good magician send us not anyone could do it mentia said we needed you to find our way hiatus you asked desiree who directed us to jethro giant who directed us here we needed iris to counter the formidable illusions we needed gary to read the story in the old stones and gayle to give us the phil ters true name and me to counter the demonly aspects and surprise to do all the kinds of magic we needed along the wayand will need now to pick up an unwilling de mon we are the only ones who can do this suddenly it was all making sense then lets do it gary said if the philter is in this formation i can find it he touched the stone reading it theres a crevice here and its artificial he felt around the stone pedestal and found a loose panel he opened it and there in a deep cubby was a flat disk a ring with mesh across it they peered in at it thats it hiatus asked that tea strainer hanna appeared of course not she said severely piers anthony the philter is a huge mass of unfathomable complica tions buried way too deep in the stone for you to ever reach this is just a decoy obviously thats it gary said with a smile and it is a demon mentia said it will bum anyone who touches it unprotected surprise make your hands in vulnerable and take it out the child crossed her eyes her hands glowed the phil ter assumed the form of a nickelpede daunting her then she exerted her nerve and reached into the cubby and brought out the little object it seemed like such a non entity after the phenomenal displays they had braved to reach it hiatus took the harness and brought it to the philter there was a hiss and he snatched his fingers away it had burned him so surprise took it with her free hand and set it over the philter and the straps enclosed it and drew themselves tight ooh hanna said looking pained then gary stood before the harnessed philter he took the jar of potion and unscrewed the top hanna glared at him if you pour that potion ill de stroy you she said fiercely gleams of dangerous light ra diated from her eyes gary was daunted but he reminded himself that this had to be a bluff he continued to unscrew the lid hanna became a basilisk she leaped for him forcing him to meet her gaze gary was terrified not sure whether that baleful glance would turn him to stone in human form ruining his future with gayle but he forced his shaking arm to pour the powder over the harnessed philter hanna reappeared in her usual human female guise then see this she cried hoisting up her skirt but gary had steeled himself against that freak out fil he said no hanna cried in evident anguish enter gary said you are destroying me hanna said looking dis traught geis of the gargoyle interface gary said feeling guilty despite his knowl edge that she was a mere illusion grafted to appeal to him i beg of you she said anything you want riches power fair women he was about to retort that he was a gargoyle who needed nothing of those things but he realized that this was another trap he couldnt say anything except the words of the conjuration or it would be spoiled and might not be repeatable the philter was still full of tricks recompile he said hanna faded into smoke with a heartrendingly despair ing wail the scene dissolved into a blinding flare of light then there was an image of darkness pierced by pinpoints of light one of these expanded until it became a big bright ball and near it was a small dark ball and on the dark ball was a map of xanth with a crown set on it this was the mineral kingdom gary realized from that map sprouted a tree and the tree wore a crown and from it trees like it spread covering all xanth this was the plant kingdom then an animal appeared a seeming composite of all animals and it wore a crown and from it many types of other animals spread out filling niches between the trees this was the animal kingdom finally the human folk came on the scene and made their villages and from them spread out all the crossbreeds and then the stone city of hinge appeared and from it came two invisible cur tains the interface outside and the limit of madness in side and it was done the scenes faded the six people were left amidst the ruins of hinge standing on a weathered island in the mid dle of a tired pool with barrenness all around their vision of madness was done yet somehow gary did not feel ex hilarated the philter had been a rogue demon selfish and sometimes dangerous but it had put up a considerable bat tle and almost defeated them it had shown them a signif icant aspect of the phenomenal history of xanth hanna and desihad they really been no more than mindless fig piers anthony ments now all the philters illusions were gone he wished it could have been otherwise put it back in the cubby and lets go home mentia said we are finished here gayle sniffed the water its pure she said the geis of the gargoyle has been lifted that means that we are free to do whatever we want gary said exchanging a significant glance with her he was starting to feel better when i regain my true form yes she said demurely return they returned the way they had come wending their way through the barrens of hinge to the forest gary kept looking around hoping to glimpse one more glimpse of the magnificence that was the bygone folding city but that wonderful image was gone the philter may have been a selfish demon iris said but it did craft a lovely vision im almost sorry we had to harness it hiatus said it had a lot of personality for a simple object it was a demon among demons mentia said i can admire it now that im not fighting it the others nodded agreement they had done what they had to do but the fruit of their victory seemed dull gary was relieved to know that he was not the only one to feel some respect for their vanquished and harnessed opponent they followed jethros footprints until they reached the fallen giant he was now sitting up i think you must have accomplished something he said the madness feels different geis of the gargoyle piers anthony it is being confined mentia explained it will retreat slowly to its former boundary and remain there that is good news the giant said any day now i shall heave myself the rest of the way up and try to blun der back to xanth proper they wished him well and went on next they came to desiree dryad and her tree the two were still in sad state but she looked more cheerful than before hiatus approached her i can help your tree he said i know you know i had this weird dream of you being in the middle of a strange ancient city she said and in my dream i called myself desi and i she paused looking modestly pained i think you are a nicer person than i thought be fore steadfast and true and if you would like to remain here first let me mend your tree he said he bent to its base and concentrated and round roots sprouted displac ing the square ones almost immediately the tree bright ened its leaves uncurling and turning green the roots were performing as the tree recovered so did desiree she went rapidly from haggard to plain to radiant by the time hiatus straightened up from his exertion of magic she was the very loveliest of ladies and as he turned to face her she stepped into his embrace and kissed him little red hearts flew out and dissolved making the scene around them rosecolored hiatus has his reward mentia said and i think he likes it as well as anything the philter offered him the others agreed they walked on knowing that they would not be missed they found richard and janet and explained that the madness would be retreating but it would take time the two were reassured and i think hiatus and desiree will marry ins said wisely i am sure they will want you to visit they passed castle zombie and informed millie the ghost of her sons success millie was duly gratified in due course they reached the golem household sur prise immediately reverted to golem size and leaped into the embrace of her mother but is she grundy inquired cautiously iris looked sober i know this will come as a regret to you but surprise discovered that she can perform each magic talent only once she is determined not to waste any more magic so she will be very restrained in fact she is apt to become a distressingly normal child except in emer gencies grundy considered no more wild magic no more outofcontrol effects that is a regret but somehow he did not seem unhappy rapunzel grew to normal human size and brought the child to them in turn surprise gave them each a tiny hug thanks for the great adventure she told gary we must do it again sometime then she dissolved into a naughty titter she was definitely normal that reminds me iris said surprise will tell you a fantastic tale that you will find almost impossible to be lieve but you must make the effort for it is true they made their way to the brain corals pool promis ing the figgle nothing but giving it a fig at the end as they approached the pool magician trent came out to meet them when i was twentythree the first time my romance was bad iris said she looked very determined and fem inine and appealing which was odd because she was using no illusion at all she had evidently come to a significant decision this time im going to make it good and she put her arms around trent and shoved him into the pool they sank together without a splash kissing as they disap peared ah the follies of youth mentia remarked its a geis of the gargoyle piers anthony good thing that we who are many centuries old arent like that but she looked somewhat wistful are you really that dissatisfied with the situation of your better half gary inquired after seeing how much you living folk enjoy romance im beginning to wonder the demoness confessed why not go back and try it then gayle asked mentia shrugged her shoulders passing along the length of her body in her old slightly crazy way maybe i will but look you illustrious animalsif you ever go out on another mad adventure well be sure to invite you along gary said thank you the demoness vanished magician trent emerged from the pool his hair was di sheveled and there were kisses all over his face i dont think i properly appreciated my wife before he remarked youth is intriguing i discover a new horizon of emotion and experience ahead and am most interested in exploring its avenues but there is something i have to do first he gestured and suddenly gary had his natural body back he was a gargoyle again oh at last gayle cried now we can do it now we can do it gary agreed there was no need to discuss what it was some things were inherent thank you magician trent have a nice time the magician said as a female hand emerged from the water to haul him back under im sure will gary and gayle made their way to castle roogna a place neither of them had seen before on the way they encountered a militant woman you gargoyle the woman cried i have a score to settle with you it was hannah barbarian was it possible that i had the weirdest wildest dream surely brought by a night mare with the croup hannah said you were in manform and iugh it was possible im sure you could never be a seduc tive handmaiden gary said you had better believe it nothing like that could ever happen she marched off then she paused as if thinking of something but gary and gayle were already bounding on their way in due course they reached castle roogna there was princess electra coming out to meet them gary knew it was her because she wore blue jeans and braids and looked innocently unprincessly youll never believe what i dreamed she said we believe gary and gayle said together but i would never do that in real life i dont even have a battery to charge of course not and according to the magic tapestry xanth has been saved from madness and the geis of the gargoyle has been abated yes gary agreed and wira sent a message from the good magician electra continued we have your places ready she paused but do you reallyi mean it seems like such in adequate repayment for such heroic service its what we want gary reassured her and so gary gar and gayle goyle took their places and settled blissfully in for the next century on parallel comers of the roof of castle roogna spouting pure rain water to the ground the position of ultimate honor for gargoyles
