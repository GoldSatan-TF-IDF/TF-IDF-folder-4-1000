chapter one during the winter the pace accelerated tremendously for mr henry warren in spite of the depression the banking house of warren sons and mortimer had never had so much to do as his marriage slid away to nothing the work piled heavily upon him the last fortnight was a bad one monday began with two conferences in the morning on the moresley corporation development loan followed by lunch at the savoy with plumberg to discuss the silver conservation pact from mr plumberg he went to call on mr heinroth in copthall avenue to enlist his aid in the matter of the finnish equalization account he found mr heinroth difficnlt and it was not until after six oclock that some measure of agreement was attained he reached his office at about sixthirty and telephoned his house in grosvenor square about dinner his butler told him that mrs warren would be dining out he worked till halfpast eight and dined alone and rather extravagantly at his club tuesday continued the business of the moresley corporation and the finnish equalization account the latter robbed him of his lunch from twelve till four he was speaking on the telephone or waiting irritably for calls calls from helsingfors from stockholm from berlin at four oclock he spoke to heinroth on the telephone aud then settled down to earnest work with all his staff to clear himself of business for the next two days he left his office at ten minutes to nine by ten oclock he was at croydon boarding the night plane for stockholm he slept fitfully in the plane during the long crossing to amsterdam in spite of the rainy squally night in the early hours he was awake from amsterdam to malmo but in the cold grey dawn he got a littlee sleep between malmo and barkaby the airport of stockholm by halfpast nine he had had a cup of coffee and a shave and was in conference in a banking house in stockholm by one oclock he was in the air again and on his way to helsingfors he was in conference in helsingfors from five oclock till midnight all the negotiations took place in german he spoke the language competently but not fluently and by midnight he was very tired he rested for a few hours then but by eight oclock he was in the air again on the short sea crossing to tallin on his way down to berlin he met his agent on the aerodrome at tallin and made him travel with him on the next stage they talked in german for an hour down to riga then he went on alone through kaunas and konigsberg on to berlin he managed to sleep a little on the latter stage and got out of the machine at templehof dazed and unwell an hour later spruce and neat he was in conference again with his associates in berlin by nine oclock he was back at the templehof to catch the night mail plane for england he dozed fitfully to amsterdam where he drank a cup of coffee with a cognac in the middle of the night then he slept soundly if uneasily to croydon he reached his house in grosvenor square before the milk before his servants were awake slept for an hour had a bath and dressed and went down to his office in the city he did not see elise she did not normally appear before he left the house that day friday was an easy day he had a talk with heinroth in the morning the finnish business moved another step upon its way his secretary told him the result of the council meeting of the moresley corporation not so good the secretary had made an appointment for him to meet them that afternoon at four oclock moody and depressed he lunched alone if they didnt want the money they neednt have it corporations had to cut their coat according to their cloth like other people they came to him in the afternoon a deputation of three he knew them well these members of the finance committee sir thomas lambe the chairman whose grocers shops extended all around the city mr tom bullock who had been a petty officer in the navy and now drove a tram and the other one whose name he never managed to remember mr bung the brewer he greeted them courteously and settled them with cigarettes before his massive desk the meeting was on a quarter of an hour later they had reached a deadlock taking it your way mr warren said the chairman pinkcheeked and ruddy itd mean another fourpence on the rates after allowing for the park receipts the council wont like that ratepayers wont like it neither said mr bullock not next november warren said quietly im sorry gentlemen there was a silence mr bung the brewer said wheezily but theres the bottle factory waiting to come to moresley soon as we get these sites opened up with the western road theres seventy employed right from the start thats our point mr warren said the chairman the development of these roads opening up these sites will make this productive money we shall be paying less in outdoor relief we shall be getting an iacome from the factory sites i cannot see that there will be any need for the special fund you have in mind warren said i appreciate all that sir thomas but if in fact this scheme can pay its way i see no objection to making the interest chargeable upon the general rate we dont get nowhere way you look at it said mr bullock to develop the factory sites weve got to put up the rates and if we put up the rates nobody wont come to take up factory sites and moneys gone for nowt that is a risk of course said warren but thats your speculation aye said mr bullock i noticed that you get your money any road even if whole of moresleys on the dole warren bent forward leaning both his elbows on the desk this is a bank he said i diink i may say a bank of good repute mr bullock a wintry smile moved across his face otherwise i am sure you gentlemen would not be here this afternoon we take in money on deposit and it is my business to keep hat money safe we lend it out again at small interest on good security it is no part of our business to take risks or to make speculations with the money deposited with us that is not our understanding with our depositors and that is not our policy mr bullock drew himself up with a certain dignity thats right mr warren he said youre a bank and you dont take no risk weve come to you rather than to one of them flybynight financial houses because were prudent business folk in moresley and we knew you did the loan in staventon but i want you to see it as we see it in the council chamber he paused for a moment and considered three years ago we hadnt more than fifteen hundred unemployed in all moresley he said last year we had seven thousand this year nine thousand five hundred thats over twelve per cent of the people of moresley on the dole mr warren and still going up he stared at him earnestly moresleys a working town always has been weve never been what they call a depressed area or anything of that and moresleys not going to become a depressed area neither were out to fight that on the council we wont let that happen but we want some help from the bank to tide us over help us get these sites attractive for new factories in moresley we dont call that speculation normal development thats what we call it in moresley we reckon its the job of everyone to do what he can to get the lads back to work banks and all there was a pause warren leaned back in his armchair and said im sorry sir thomas said um i am afraid the council will have difficulty in proceeding on these lines let me be quite clear upon the matter you require that provision should be made for the interest to be guaranteed from the general rate in preference to all other payments and that a resolution should be passed by the council to that effect before the matter can proceed further warren inclined his head that is so sir thomas given that resolution we can at once proceed to the details of the finance you will require mr tom bullock got up from his chair and stood erect my bloody oath he said quietly but firmly and then they write this stuff about the banks helping industry all the bloody banks do is to help themselves the chairman was distressed and fluttered councillor bullock please he said the deputation rose to take their leave mr warren showed them courteously to the door you may be right he said to the tram driver but i think the business of helping the distressed areas lies more with the government than with the banks he turned back into his room alone tired and stale he wondered what would happen at their council meeting he did not greatly care he would proceed with the matter if they wished old mortimer moribund in his house at godalming liked corporation loans and would be pleased warren himself had no objection to them provided that the money were very safe that was the main thing in these times but he could use the money better on the continent his mind dwelt with pleasure on the visgrad waterworks in laevatia better than all the corporation loans put together the buzzer on his desk sounded a low note he pressed a switch and the voice of his secretary spoke from the instrument mrs warren was on the telephone sir i told her you were in conference shall i get her now please he was desperately tired while he was waiting for his call he felt for a cigarette in the silver box upon his desk fumbled a little and dropped one upon the floor he left it there too tired to pick it up took and lit another and sank into his chair the telephone bell rang his wifes voice spoke to him oh henry is that you it would be nicer if you answered me when i rang up dear i rang you up over half an hour ago he said patiently im sorry but i was in conference didnt miss stephens tell you she may have done im afraid i dont pay much attention to miss stephens dear henry wherever have you been all this time i havent seen you for eight days he thought for a moment so long as that well you were in scotland last week werent you i was at home monday and tuesday nights then i had to go to the continent ill be dining in tonight to the continent was it amusing he said not very i had to go to helsingfors and to berlin oh such a tiresome place helsingfors all trees and water and all those finnish people so dull i didnt bother to go on shore they told me it simply wasnt worth it i remember weplayed contract all afternoon tommy samson won fifteen pounds off violet she was furious he said patiently ill be dining in tonight dear ill tell you all about it at dinner she said oh yes ive asked one or two people in to dinner so you can tell us all about your trip his face fellwhos coming only violet and mary and sir john and lady cohen and pamela allnut and jerry shaw and lord cheriton his brows contracted in a frown what do you want young cheriton for i didnt know you knew him oh dont be silly violet says hes terribly funmaking and besides sir john wants to meet him it had been in warrens mind to tell his wife that he was dropping with fatigue that he would dine quietly at his club perhaps sleep there he changed his mind if cohen had chickens to pluck let him pluck them in his own house all right he said ill be home about halfpast six whos the other man what other man dear his face hardened youve told me four women and three men youre not having an odd number why no dear theres lord cheriton sir john prince ali and jerry shaw prince ali said is coming yes dear i asked him his face was very hard all right ill be home at halfpast six he laid down the receiver and pressed the button for his confidential secretary mr thomas morgan ive got to go over and see heinroth morgan he said i shant be back today he went walking down throgmorton street towards heinroths office tired and depressed two young jobbers on the steps of the exchange stopped tossing for halfcrowns to watch him as he made his way through the crowd whos that said one thats henry warren warren sons and mortimer one of the soundest little houses in the city he runs the business now dont you know him the other shook his head looks as if hed swallowed a bad oyster he remarked the other spun a coin into the air and smiled so would you he said if your wife was sleeping with a black man every other night his dinner party passed before warren in a blur of fatigue with lady cohen on the one hand and pamela allnut on the other he talked mechanically alternately and competently about hunting and glass furniture about schools and skiing at the far end of the table his wife sat facing him fair slender and vivacious between the subaltern callowness of young lord cheriton and the grave dignity of the arab in tails and white waistcoat both of them he reflected worth half a million more perhaps lord cheriton he could tolerate but he disliked the arab very much indeed he roused himself a little with the brandy when the lathes had left the room cohen had moved up to cheriton and was talking about industry wonderful opportunities just now he was saying in almost every line every day one cant take all of them thats very interesting said cheriton tfou think this is the time to buy i do most certainly with discretion of course warren set his glass down carefully you may be right he said carefully but it seems to me that you want the discretion of a nun and the vision of an archangel to buy these days i dont agree at all said cohen look at gold no good looking at gold now said warren tell me what to look at now not what i might have looked at six months ago a shadow passed quickly across cohens face warren thought that got him hes got those bulongo mines on his hands i wonder if he wanted to shove those off on cheriton he might be able to that boy is fool enough for anything prince ali said coughed delicately for myself he said i do not understand the stock exchange i prefer to play with horses i find that i can make money more certainly in that manner warren nodded he could respect competence in all forms that is because you act upon your own knowledge its when you start taking tips that the trouble starts cheriton laughed either on horses or the stock exchange he said fatuously warren nodded im a banker of course i dont take tips and i dont make any great killings but in my quiet way i get along all right even in these times but i wouldnt say this was the time to buy what would you do asked cohen sullenly warren smiled id get a very big safe and put it all in that in gold and sit on it he said but real gold i mean none of this paper stuff in the dim light beyond the shaded candles at the back of the room evans his butler laid silver noiselessly upon a tray covered it with green baize and moved silently unnoticed from the room he took the tray down to his pantry transferred it to the silver cupboard locked it up and pocketed the key then he went to the housekeepers room elsie the housemaid was sewing by the fire wheres mrs higgins he asked gone out to the pictures did you want her he took down his pipe from the mantelpiece i want a box of matches ive got some mr evans she watched him while he lit his pipe get any titbits theyre trying to swindle that young cheriton again not mr warren no cohen she dropped her sewing on her lap what did they want him to do buy some dud mining shares i think warren was trying to stall them off id believe anything you told me of that cohen she said i think hes horrible he nodded slowly theyre a useless crowd he said ive been in service nearly forty years ever since i was a little nipper in the stables but ive never been in such a place as this there was a little silence that black man she said presently he was up there again this afternoon with the door open too i do think its beastly it wont last for long said the butler i reckon i know when a place is cracking up he finished his pipe in silence glanced at his watch and went upstairs again to carry a tray of glasses siphons and decanters in to the big white drawingroom two tables of bridge were in progress but cohen and cheriton were both dummy and were talking earnestly aside before the fire the evening passed for warren in a blur of fatigue he played efficiently and lost a little money to his guests by courtesy one had to do that with pamela allnut in the game presently the rubbers came to an end the final drinks and then his guests were ready to depart he helped cheriton into his coat its been pleasant meeting you again he said a most delightful evening said the young man formally a thin smile curled round warrens lips youve enjoyed yourself why certainly tm sorry to hear it there was a momentary pause well i dont quite know what to say to that said cheriton tm sorry you came here tonight said warren its been my pleasure i hope it wont be your loss the young man stared at him reflectively you mean cohen he said at last thanks for the tip im afraid my guests arent quite your sort said warren pleasantly i wouldnt come again if i were you he saw the young man to the door and turned back into the house his wife was talking quietly to their last guest the arab in the hall they broke the talk off as he turned towards them its been a great pleasure to have had you here this evening prince ali he said formally i hope youll come again he stared reflectively at the aquiline features the fine olive texture of the skin but there i know you will the olive darkened into brown i have never enjoyed myself so much said the prince it was so kind of you he took his leave warren turned to his wife did you enjoy your party he enquired she yawned a little sullenly not a bit i think that young cheritons a crashing bore i wouldnt have had him but for violet cohen said the old man wanted to meet him or something why people cant manage for themselves warren glanced at the petulant features of his wife he smiled a little if thats the sort of entertainment they want he said i suppose thats what youve got to give them they went upstairs together did you meet anyone interesting in berlin she asked idly i was only there four or five hours i met heinroths cousin with a couple of finns oh that must have been terribly funmaking for you warren went to his own room the firelight flickered on the walls and ceiling on a chair before the glow his pyjamas were laid out to warm he sat down to unlace his shoes desperately tired as he leaned forward the stiff collar of his evening shirt cut deep into his throat his vision blurred and a pressure grew upon his temples he leaned back in his chair the pressure eased and he began to feel more normal but now there came a persistent drumming in his ears that would not stop christ he said half aloud a ruddy nigger in that he was unjust and he knew it among the six or seven strains that went to make prince ali there was no negro blood he got up and loosed the collar at his throat and undressed slowly his business worries and responsibilities surged in his mind to the surging of the blood that thun dered in his ears heinroth and plumberg the moresley corporation and the finnish equalization account and ali said leering at him down the dinner table in his own house he must sleep he crossed to his dressingtable and took up a small white box opened it and took out the little vial it was empty he threw it in the grate and took a fresh packet from a drawer shook out three tablets of allonal and swallowed them sleep he said half aloud he got into his bed already he could feel his mind at ease his worries were no longer the sharp torments they had been but had become mere incidents of the day even prince ali was an incident he thought drowsily as he settled in his bed that cuckold was the word it seemed to be the right word he was not quite sure what a cuckold was but it seemed probable that he was one even that had now no power to worry him it was an incident merely an incident of the day he did not see his wife before he went down to the office in the morning went in the car with donaghue his chauffeur as was his habit it was a saturday but in the years of depression that meant little to him he had been absent from his office for two days during the week and might have to go away again he settled down to clear up his arrears of work with morgan his girl secretary his chief accountant and three clerks in the middle of the afternoon he ate a sandwich drank a whisky and soda and went on hours later he stopped suddenly irrationally in the middle of a sentence as it were thats enough he said to morgan well go home now as you like sir said his secretary there are only the czech payments to transfer we can do those on monday when do they f all due not till the fourteenth let me have them on wednesday morning i shant be here on monday im going tp hull tomorrow night with collins the east yorkshire thing ring me tenthirty monday morning at the paragon and give me the post very good sir warren glanced at his watch the winter dusk had fallen long ago it was halfpast seven i had no idea it was so late he said on his way out he passed through the outer office his three clerks and the girl were putting on their coats he stopped and spoke to them tm sorry ive been so long he said with formal courtesy and on a saturday thank you for staying he passed on out through the swing doors into the deserted city street thats all right far as it goes said one of the clerks but look what time it is seventhirty more hours more money said another he was a married man and warren paid his office overtime the girl pulled on her little hat i mink hes looking terribly tired she said do you think all this they say about his wife is true warren went home and dined alone his wife he learned was dining out the butler did not know with whom he left for hull after lunch next day sunday as the train swept northwards warren dozed uneasily in his empty compartment twitching in his sleep from time to time and becoming suddenly awake he reached hull in the evening and dined alone in the hotel because he wished to form his own impression of the city he had not told his business associates of his arrival he wished to be alone that night it was part of his routine he liked to be alone for his first night in a new town especially a town where he was to do business he walked out in the windswept empty streets after dinner savouring the place the broad streets thin alleys the gaunt factories and the mudfilled docks he was not pleased with what he found after an hours walk he returned to the hotel having followed no conscious train of reasoning but entirely resolved that he must bc careful this was no place in which to take a chance he felt the dominant psychology to be that of the town at the end of the road stagnant and insular the through traffic of the shipping he felt had not enlivened the place he went to his bed and lay restlessly awake till the small hours then he got up and took an allonal all the next day he was in conference in hull a difficult unsatisfactory day spent upon a difficult and unsatisfactory business towards evening he delivered an ultimatum which he knew would stay the wheels of progress for six months and left on the night train for london tired and depressed his car met him at kings cross in the winter dawn and he went home to bathe and change and drink a cup of coffee then he went down teethe office in india a few hours previously a small brown man had stood in congress for two hours and said his piece that morning the silver conservation pact lay in ruins by eleven oclock warren had plumberg in his office a plumber g who talked eloquently about adjustments of a minor nature to the scheme and whose thin hands twitched nervously as he was talking warren spent the day in a welter of indian politics broken by distracting snatches of his other work in the afternoon he went with plumberg to the india office and sat in conference for two hours in the evening he got rid of plumberg and dined with the secretary of state for india quietly at a club they talked far on into the night wednesday was an easy day he spent it largely with heinroth the finnish business was going smoothly to a sound conclusion he felt that he had done a good job of work in that quarter his visit of the previous week had facilitated matters very much in the afternoon he rang his house meaning to speak to elise to ask her to dine with him that night and do a theatre his buder told him she had gone to paris with lady cohen warren dined alone that night plumberg was with him most of the next day upon his indomexican agreement schemed to save something from the silver wreckage that lay strewn about their feet the moresley corporation met and turned down his proposals in the evening heinroth rang him up his cousin was in paris with the finns and would appreciate a further talkwarren decided to go there next day he crossed by the earliest air service and motored into paris from le bourget before ten oclock he sat in conference for an hour with the finns then left to lunch with heinroths cousin and to walk for an hour in the bois by four oclock he was in conference again in the hotel splendide by eight their business was concluded for the day kom said the leading finn genially we will now eat dinner after our great labours they washed and went downstairs to the public rooms the lounge was thronged with people in the great diningroom the tables clustered thickly round a small bald patch of dancingfloor they were in morning clodjes but the head waiter met them obsequiously and bowed them to a table reserved for them in an alcove a quiet table where they could talk undisturbed they settled to their meal commenting now and then upon the dancers or the cabaret presently warren called the head waiter to him the gentleman of colour at the table over on the other side he said prince ali said but certainly said the man he is a friend of monsieur an acquaintance said warren carelessly he stays in the hotel but yes monsieur and the lady the man smiled gently monsieur i think i have met her in england said warren quietly if you could ascertain her name for me but certainly he moved away among the crowd in a few minutes he was back again monsieur he said her name is miss naughton she is registered as british ah yes said warren carelessly she stays in the same suite but certainly i am infinitely obliged the man bowed himself away and warren turned again to his companions one meets so many people he said apologetically he stayed with them through a long dinner to the coffee and cigars at the end he made his apologies i must catch the morning aeroplane for london he said and t must get some sleep we shall meet again in london on the aoth i shall look forward to that with great pleasure he bade them goodbye and went out to the lounge prince ali said he said he is in his suite the man lifted a telephone warren waited idly studying airline and steamship posters this was the end he thought the name monsieur ask if he will receive mr henry warren the man spoke he says if you will go up monsieur he mounted swiftly in the lift in the sittingroom of the suite the prince received him swarthy and immaculate in black and white this is indeed a pleasure my dear warren he said courteously you are staying in this hotel no longer than i can help said warren he glanced around the room the deep carpets and the garish furniture i came to have a few words with my wife the arab frowned in bewilderment surely you are making some mistake he said you will not find your wife here that may be said warren evenly because if i find her here she will no longer be my wife he stared at the other reflectively i suppose if i were half a man id be knocking the stuffing out of you he said or trying to if you had been the first but as it is i think im through im not going to make a lot of trouble over this im going to get out and leave you to it he smiled perhaps if my wife is not here you would present me to miss naughton he said i am afraid you are completely misinformed mr warren said the arab as you can see for yourself i am staying here alone it is true that miss naughton dined with me this evening but she has now returned to her hotel in that case said warren we can take a look at the next room without disturbing her he moved mediodically from room to room opening cupboards and examining curtains the arab watched him with a grave smile a pleasant suite is it not he said i find this a very good hotel and a complaisant one said warren he moved towards the door i see dial my wife is not here now he said a little wearily i suppose i ought to offer you apologies but im not going to he left the arab standing in the middle of his suite and went down to the writingroom upon the mezzanine he wrote a note and took it to the porters desk for miss naughton he said and gave it to the man with twenty francs see that she gets it tonight he went up slowly to his room threw open the window of his balcony and stood for a time in the cold air looking out over the roofs of paris behind him in the street the traffic ran shadowy and remote a flake or two of snow slipped past him in the night his marriage had not been real to him for many years but now that it was drawing to a close he knew that a great gap was opening in his life how great he could not say he only knew that he was coming to great changes and that itself was difficult for him he grew cold at last and turned back into the room he unpacked his bag slowly undressed and went to bed he took three tablets of his allonal to make him sleep he rose at eight next morning had a bath and dressed and ordered coffee in his room he was seated at his breakfast when he heard a light knock on the outer door he went to open it his wife was there come in he said have some coffee she shook her head and fumbled with a cigarette he lit it for her you dont mind if i finish mine she sat down in a chair and watched him while he ate well henry she said at last where do we go from here he set downhis cup and turned to her thats up to you my dear he considered for a moment i dont know what youre doing here at all and im not sure that i want to know i didnt come here trailing you or anything like that i came on business yesterday and saw you in tha diningroom with ali said she said i might have known you came on business you wouldnt take a day from that for me would you he said youre probably right in all these sort of things there are faults on both sides i know ive worked long hours for the last two years but things arent easy with this slump he always felt helpless in his dealings with elise in most marriages he thought the economic tie must make things easier the wife had her job for which she drew her pay she could not lightly give it up both husband and wife then had to work he in the office and she in the home with elise it was different she had her own money plenty of it a dissolution of their marriage would mean no material loss to her no unavoidable discomfort she was not dependent on her job for her security therefore she took it lighdy to hold her he would have to live a great deal of her life an idle life to be spent with idle people following the fashion it would be possible for him to do so he had money in plenty to give up his work and retire but he was only fortythree years old his work was dear to him surely there was some compromise for them he said i want you to pack your things and come back home with me today when we get home im going to make some changes she blew a long cloud of cigarette smoke what are they im going to sell the house were going to live in the country are we indeed what part of the country somewhere not far from london beaconsfield dorking that sort of distance on my part i shall spend less time in london and more at home we might get some hunting in the winter anything else he met her eyes mocking him yes he said savagely a total exclusion of prince ali from your list of friends and cathcart and the cohens ill have no more of them she laughed a little i suppose ive brought that on myself i suppose you have he said its a pretty joyous sort of life that youve sketched out for me she observed you evidently dont trust me in london so im to live in the suburbs if im good youll take me out with the suburban drag on saturday mornings im to give up all my friends and sit in the country alone and grow pansies thats it exactly said warren those are my terms if were going on together i wont go on as we are and on my part ill do everything i can to make you happy on those lines and if i dont accept your terms i hope you will if you dont i shall divorce you there was a little silence well she said youd better go ahead and do it you wouldnt like to have another try at carrying on together she shook her head you dont want me and you know it all you want is your work thats all you ever think about your work and your business friends its not as if you had to work as you do in order to live you do it because thats what you like youre never at home because youre away on business you never take a holiday what sort of life do you think i lead married to you and now you want to shove me away down in the suburbs away from all my friends and everyone i know im certainly not going to agree to that if thats the way you feel the sooner we bring it to an end the better you mean that i most certainly do she paused i shall be staying here till monday then i shall be going down to cannes to nita menzies you can send the papers there he stood and stared out of the window at the leaden roofs beneath a leaden sky the running traffic in the street below as you like he said at last im sorry that we had to come to this chapter two he crossed to london by the midday air service and went straight to his office he got there about four oclock in the afternoon and plunged into his work he had a long conversation on the telephone with heinroth and another with his banking associates in stockholm he cleared two days of correspondence in half an hours dictation his typist left him with a sense of grievance and a batch of work that would keep her back an hour and spoil her evening halfpast five she said to her companion in their room and all these letters to be done its too bad but my dear have you seen him hes looking simply awful wonder whats been happening in his own room warren sat with morgan his confidential secretary thats the finnish business then he said were practically home on that get the agreements drawn in draft and well get heinroth to look over them then you can circulate them to the board youve got it on the agenda i have arranged that sir he passed a hand wearily across his eyes we shant hear much of plumberg for a time the moresley corporation thing is dead i think im not going to do anything with that chap cantello theres the laevatian oil development let it sweat i may be irregular at the office for trie next week or so ive got some personal matters to clear up the secretary hesitated if i may say so why dont you take a holiday youre looking very tired im sure the board would wish you not to overdo things sir thats all right said warren irritably i may be away for a day or two tell miss sale to let me have those letters as soon as theyre ready im going home then morgan left him and he sat alone ift his empty office his fingers drumming nervously upon the leather of the empty desk in front of him he had said that he was going home to what sort of home was he going he pressed a key and spoke into the desk telephone they were to ring his house and say that he would be in to dinner he must sell that house he thought he must discharge the servants he would live in a flat perhaps in pall mall or the albany he must write to elise to remove her things he must see his lawyer he must go through the tedious intolerable formalities of a divorce to win a freedom that he did not want he must start in middle age to build up another life new interests its going to be lots of fun he said bitterly he got up from his desk and paced up and down the office in a minute or two he rang irritably for his letters one or two appeared which he signed the remainder were unfinished he spoke to morgan on the internal telephone im going now youd better sign those letters for me he put on his hat and coat and left the office he dined alone that night in his deserted house sombre in dinner jacket in the empty diningroom with shadows flickering in the corners from the canthes on the table his butler served him silently efficiently warren ate very little he took his coffee in the library before the fire when he had served it evans waited for a moment by his side warren looked up what is it evans could i have a word with you sir certainly go ahead the man coughed i am afraid i must give you my notice sir i am sorry to inconvenience you but i would like to leave hi a months time warren was silent for a minute sipping his coffee then he said im sorry to hear that evans why do you want to go the man hesitated and then said awkwardly no particular reason sir just that i cant feel settled here is the money all right oh quite all right sir but i feel that i should be better for a change warren glanced up at the man standing deferentially before him i see as a matter of fact evans i was going to speak to all of you tomorrow mrs warren will not be coming back to live here im closing down this house and going to live in chambers i am very sorry to hear that sir warren nodded i was going to give you all a months notice with three months wages so you neednt feel youre inconveniencing me that is very generous treatment sir i am sure the staff will appreciate your kindness in the circumstances he hesitated with things the way they are sir i am sorry that i gave you notice but i wasnt to know thats all right as a matter of interest why did you want to leave the butler hesitated again i dont know that i can quite answer that sir but it hasnt been the sort of house that one would care to spend ones life in if you understand what i mean warren said i understand me nodded to the man all right evans thatll do ill see you all in the morning the man left him and he sat for a long time before the fire quiet and motionless full of reflection so that was it his house his mode of life had become so notorious that decent servants wouldnt stay with him they had their own lives to consider he did not blame them but if that was what his servants thought about it all what would london and the city think prince ali said already he could frame the limericks and the conundrums in his mind he knew the stock exchange he sat on in the library quiet without reading as the fire died the shadows closed in upon him he had worked hard all his life he had been in the gunners in the war and had risen to command a battery he could still remember the sequence of his firing orders the colours of the different grades of shell and that you concentrated when the aiming point was in the rear he had gone into his fathers bank at the armistice and had worked hard in the city for the last fifteen years his life he thought was more than half over he had worked hard since he was a boy what had he got to show for it his wife had left him had preferred a coloured man his house was one that decent people would not stay in even if they were servants he had few friends he worked too hard for that his health was still good but he had grown nervous and irritable that was the work again tie difficulty that he had in sleeping due to lack of exercise perhaps due also to the drugs he took to make him sleep in the morning he would take the necessary steps to close the house and put it up for sale then he supppsed he would go and live in a service flat and try to build up a new life for what for more work he had worked hard for fifteen years and had got nothing it seemed to him that was worth having presently he left the library and went up to his room he stood for a time looking at his face in the mirror he saw it to be lined and haggard the face of a man older than his years he turned away and went mechanically to the drawer of his dressingtable he would not sleep that night without the assistance of his allonal he took the little vial in his hand he saw an old face twitching at him from the mirror the battery major straightened up a gust of passion swept over him my god he said aloud tm looking like a corpse impulsively he threw the vial in the fire and turned towards his bed he hardly slept at all mat night he set about his business early next morning the keen mind dulled and impeded with fatigue he saw the servants after breakfast and gave them in hard businesslike fashion the gist of what he had already told the butler a months notice with three months pay then he sat down and wrote a letter to elise hard and efficient to ask her to remove her things from the house within the month before he put the furniture in store he paid a visit to a house agent and then he went to his solicitor and sat in conference with him for an hour he lunched at a solitary table in his club reserved and aloof in the smokingroom over his coffee he fell into an uneasy sleep and woke after twenty minutes of twitching insensibility dazed and unwell he went down to his office in the house that he had left the servants gathered round to talk about their notice dispersed to make pretence of work and gathered round again i wont say but what three months pay will be a comfort and a nest egg to put by said the cook but what a thing to happen in the house i never did like black gentlemen said elsie that prince ali he gave me the shudders the first time i saw him what she could see in him donaghue the chauffeur winked at evans the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice as you might say not in my kitchen if you please mr donaghue said the cook with dignity sorry said the chauffeur its a pity that it had to happen now said evans id hoped to get away before the bubble bust it doesnt do one any good in getting a new place this sort of thing thats what i say mr evans said the cook it makes things very difficult im sure mistresses dont like it say what you will well said the chauffeur shes got a nice new place and no mistake i wouldnt be too sure shell keep it said evans ah said the cook darkly the evil stoop and pick up luck they moved away about their work again donaghue followed elsie out into the hall its a rotten breakup this he said just as we were beginning to get to know each other too he had only been there for about two months he was cursing himself boyishly and miserably that he had not made more headway with the girl in that two months he hadnt wanted to rush things and now this bustup had come im sorry too she said but thats life all over that is just as you think youve got nicely settled down something happens thats right he said enthusiastically ive often thought it was like that they stood in silent intimate communion for a moment he mustered his courage were you doing anything tomorrow afternoon your half day isnt it she said i always go and see my aunt millie at streatham shes been ever so good to me since i came to london i was wondering if youd like to see a picture he said awkwardly theres some good ones on she smiled radiantly on him thats ever so nice of you mr donaghue she said i could see aunt millie on sunday i could get ready by halfpast two thats a date he said and went to polish a clean car in an exultant dream warren worked steadily for some hours in his office he cleared up the arrears of his work with some halfformed idea that he might go away he was tired and stale he had no particular desire to take a holiday ut he could not go on in grosvenor square alone he felt that he must have a break in his routine looking like death again this afternoon remarked his typist to her friend i bet theres something wrong he knocked a pencil from his desk in the late afternoon and stooped to pick it up a sudden cramp shot through his abdomen and for a minute he was wrung with pain then it relaxed and he was sitting motionless in his chair a little white and breathing very carefully for fear it would come on again presently he began to move cautiously at first then with increasing confidence exercise he thought i ought to get more exercise ill the at fifty if i dont look out he left the office at about seven oclock and walked part of the way home through the wet lamplit streets in pursuit of his new resolution he went down cheapside over hoiborn viaduct past gamages and kingsway nearly to tottenham court road there he was tired and a little faint and took a taxi to his house in grosvenor square i cant go letting myself get run down like this he thought id better get away and get some exercise he had a whisky and a bath when he got home and felt refreshed he put on a dinner jacket and went down to dine alone with the first mouthful his appetite left him he ate very little and went through into the library for coffee he drank two cups of coffee and a little brandy and felt better he sat in his deep chair before the fire and faced the problem of his sleep he knew he would not sleep he had hardly slept at all the previous night he knew that it would be the same again he would not sleep without his allonal and he had done with that you need to be physically tired to sleep it was imperative to him that he should get more exercise at once and quickly he must get away somewhere and walk if he walked twenty miles a day for the next week sleep would return to him he knew walking was what his body clamoured for it would rid him of this sick feeling would clean his mind and body as they needed to be cleaned twenty miles a day and for a week on end that was what he would do tomorrow but for this night ahead of him in some way he must get through that queer this matter of his sleep if he were travelling in car or train or aeroplane he would be able to compose his mind to rest and doze and fall into a sleep of sorts in bed he could not sleep without his allonal but he could sleep in a motorcar and that would get him right away and he could walk twenty miles a day till he was well he rose and pressed the bell he glanced at his watch it was ten oclock when evans came he said is donaghue about in the housekeepers room sir tell him i want the car in half an hour very good sir tell him to get the tank filled up and put some warm clothes on i may be going a long way he went up to his room and changed into an old business suit that he had bought in the united states he put on a heavy ulster and a scarf and gave evans a flask to fill with brandy these completed his preparations for the road he looked at the contents of his notecase he had about eighteen pounds that he thought would see him through in the housekeepers room donaghue was making similar preparations swearing a little to himself he had no fancy for a drive of unknown length on a cold night in february elsie came to him with a little packet in her hands i cut you some sandwiches mr donaghue she said a little shyly and theres a bit of seed cake i do hope he wont keep you out too late he took them gratefully and mumbled his thanks see you halfpast two tomorrow anyway he said even if it makes me miss my breakfast she smiled at him you wouldnt rather we put it off not much ill be back he had already brought the car to the door he went out to it now and evans went into the library the car is quite ready sir warren rose slowly from his chair in ulster and scarf he was feeling unwell and the prospect of a long night drive seemed less attractive to him now but he might as well go he would probably sleep alittle anyway all right evans he said i may be away for a few days the butler hesitated in surprise shall i pack a bag sh no thanks i shant want that he went out to the car although the night outside was cold he was glad to be leaving that house donaghue smart in chauffeurs cap and long blue coat with silver buttons held the door open for him warren got in and evans handed in a couple of rugs they stood for a moment then holding open the door of the limousine where to sir asked donaghue get on the great north road said warren absently go on till i tell you to stop evans and donaghue exchanged glances of incomprehension then the chauffeur said very good sir and got in to his seat in turn he wrappeda rug around him and the car moved off warren leaned forward and switched off the interior lighty and settled down in the back seat the car moved forward through mayfair up orchard street and baker street past lords and the swiss cottage on to finchley a light rain was falling and the streets were wet and empty donaghue settled to his wheel and wondered what the night would bring for him he liked warren and was sorry for him he thought that he had suffered a raw deal apart from that he trusted him implicitly at the same time there was no denying that his master was looking mighty queer cook had been worried that he ate so little dinner maybe he would like a cup of coffee later on he drove out on the bypass shifted and relaxed into the driving seat and set himself to the nights work in the rear seat of the limousine warren lay crossways in one corner quiet and at rest he was in darkness for a time he watched the lights and street signs as drey passed the windows opposite him presently rain blurred the windows and the lights grew more infrequent soon they were driving through the darkness on a broad wet ribbon of road lit by the headlights for five hundred yards the purring of the engine the wet swish of the tyres the gentle easy motion lulled him to a doze the doze merged into something deeper and he slept through the wet night the limousine swept on running at quarterpower at a steady fortyfive untired and effordess donaghue had produced a bottle of boiled sweets and sucked them as he drove occasionally he smoked a cigarette the rain stopped and began again it went on intermittendy all through the night at welwyn they came out on the old road and drove on north through baldock and biggleswade past st neots and huntingdon by norman cross over the bridge at wansford and to stamford there donaghue slowed down and peered into the rear seat warren appeared to be asleep he shrugged his shoulders and drpve on forty minutes later he ran down the hill into grantham slowed down and finally stopped at a garage to fill up the allnight hand came sleepily to the pump donaghue got down from his seat and busied himself about the car through the rainspotted window glass he looked at warren saw he was awake he opened the door stopped here for some petrol sir he said just about ready to go on got enough money asked warren without moving quite all right sir warren turned his head what place is this grantham the chauffeur hesitated would you like a cup of coffee or tea sir theres a place open up the road no thanks get one yourself if you like tm all right for the present thank you sir still straight on north straight on said warren get up into the hills northwest of newcastle between newcastle and carlisle very good sir said the chauffeur he closed the door and turned to pay for petrol going far enquired the garage hand two hundred bloody miles or so said donaghue i wish i was a dog with a good home he drove out on to the deserted roads in the dark night from time to time he passed a lorry or an allnight coach roaring along at sixty in a blaze of headlights there was nothing else on the road at newark he screwed round and peered through the screen behind his back warren appeared to be asleep again he glanced at his watch it was a quarter to two donaghue drove on he passed through tuxford and retford near bawtry he got out the sandwiches that elsie had put up for him and ate them as he drove it was rotten about the picture he was taking her to looked as though hed have to send a telegram he thought shed understand he ate her seed cake he passed through doncaster another of these bloody towns he said wonder how many more mere are he was a young man of a good physique he was growing tired but he was not sleepy he left ferrybridge behind him and wetherby in boroughbridge it was pitch dark but there were one or two people in the streets to his surprise they get up early in these parts he thought it was about halfpast four and still raining a little the limousine went flying up the long stretch of roman road to catterick twenty miles away past middleton and leeming bar at scotch corner he kept north and did not bear away through piercebridge and skirting darlington he was driving slower now by map through wittonlewear and dans castle where he began to see the shadow of the hedges in the dawn it had stopped raining he bore away towards the northwest leaving newcastle on the right by ten or fifteen miles at rowley it was light enough for him to drive without his lights presently he dropped down into broomhaugh and drove on a little up the valley of the tyne he screwed round stiffly and looked over his shoulder warren was awake this is the newcastle to carlisle road sir he said stop here said warren let me see your map the chauffeur drew up by the roadside and handed his map through the glass partition it was about seven oclock quite light enough to see the countryside a raw windy morning with a wrack of low scudding cloud down on the hills warren asked where are we now thats corbridge sir just over there the river is the tyne ive got it said warren he stuthed the map for some minutes then gave it back to donaghue go on towards carlisle he said stop when you get to that place greenhead at the top of the pass donaghue stuthed the map for a minute and said very good sir he slipped round to his wheel again and drove on in half an hour he drew up by the side of the road thif is the place you said sir warren kid aside his rugs stretched a little and got out of the car the morning air was crisp and bracing to him he had slept most of the night through and he was feeling well he looked around to see what sort of place this was he saw black heathercovered hills a junction of two roads a railway and a wayside station one or two houses the grey clouds went racing past only a few hundred feet above his head to wreathe about the hills it was infinitely desolate this will do he said aloud he turned back to the car you can leave me here he said to donaghue pm going to walk a bit go down into carlisle and put up there i shant want you any longer get some sleep and then get along back to london very good sir the chauffeur hesitated can i get you anything before i go some breakfast sir thats all right thanks wait leave me your map donaghue offered a selection warren picked out a couple of the ordnance survey and stuffed them in the pocket of his ulster that will do he said now off you go tell evans ill be back in london in about a week the chauffeur was uneasy he would have liked to have stayed to have seen his master left in better circumstances but he had little option in the matter he said goodbye sir and let in his clutch and went running down the hill towards carlisle he was a young and vigorous man not unduly tired by having driven a good car all night he was three hundred miles from london where a girl was waiting for him as he ate his breakfast an idea was forming in his mind he could make a quick run down the north road in the limousine average fortyfive easy fortyfive into three hundred miles that made six and twothird hours allow a bit for going into london call it seven hours he looked at his watch be on the road again by halfpast eight that meant home by halfpast three an hour late but still with most of her half day to go and it wasnt as if he was really tired a girl would like a chap to put himself about like that for her he paid his bill and started on the london road in the middle of the morning running at a high speed three miles short of retford a small car turned out suddenly across his path at eighty miles an hour you cannot swerve and dodge the limousine hit the nearfront wheel to offfront wheel and threw the small car to the hedge itself it was deflected to the right side of the road to hit a fiveton lorry coming from the town when finally they got the wreckage off him donaghue was dead elsie sat waiting for him all that afternoon i believe she is waiting for him still chapter three warren was hungry he watched the car depart then he walked down to the station to enquire where he could get some food a solitary porter cleaning lamps directed him to a cottage half a mile away that in the season sold meals to summer visitors warren set out up the road as he went his hand strayed to his unshaven chin he had no razor and to get one in this district would be practically impossible he must give up that he would have to do something about his teeth though washing could wait an opportunity savages cleaned their teeth on bits of stick he could not see himself performing with a bit of heather it was altogether in a lighter mood that he arrived at the cottage a woman not very old but bent with rheumatism opened the door to him warren asked for breakfast i could do a pair of eggs an a cup o tea she said doubtfully i havent any bakers bread this time o year yell have to have just what we have ourselves he sat at her kitchen table while she busied herself to get him breakfast as he waited he stuthed the map he found that he was very near the wall nordveast seemed to be the best direction if he wanted exercise a track led up across the moor in the direction of bellingham and the cheviots from the contours it appeared that that would give him all the exercise he wanted for a week or two she brought him two fried eggs a flat homemade loaf of brownish bread butter and jam and a pot of strong tea he ate ravenously at first but with a quickly fading appetite it was all that he could do to get through the second egg he had several cups of tea however and felt satisfied and well ahhough he had not eaten very much he lit a pipe paid her the shilling that she asked him for the meal and as an afterthought bought one of her flat and dirtylooking loaves for twopence from the look of the map it seemed unlikely that he would find a restaurant for lunch it would be better to take what food he could with him he broke the loaf into two halves and put one in each pocket of his ulster then he set out along the track up on to the moor he walked all day striding along over the black sodden moors his ulster pulled about his ears it rained most of the day a thin persistent misty drizzle that cleared in the evening as he dropped down into bellingham all day he kept to a rough track that wound among the heathercovered hills always in seeming danger of obliteration never entirely disappearing he was not hungry rather curiously he ate a few mouthfuls of his bread in the middle of the day me remainder crumbled in the pockets of his ulster he got to bellingham at about five oclock after walking for eight hours or so he covered the last mile in semidarkness he was very weary physically and that same weariness gave him an easy mind he knew that if he got a decent bed he would sleep naturally that night moreover he was far too tired to think and that to him was relaxation and relief he found an inn in the village where they looked at him askance wet and unshaven dirty and with no luggage aye said the landlord weve got beds maybe youll find the house a bit expensive we charge ten shillings deposit for them as comes without bag or baggage seems reasonable enough said warren he produced his notecase and put down the money the mans manner altered for the better we has to be careful he explained apologetically or youd be getting some queer company i never see so many on the roads as there are this year out of a job asked warren aye walking the roads they say theres more work in the south these days but i dunno this is your room ill bring up some hot water in a minute he washed and went downstairs to a high tea of ham and eggs and marmalade and cherry cake in the coffee room there was nothing to read but a few copies of the motoring journals of the previous summer and a queer paper about cattle breeding that he could not understand he was tired and disinclined to sit and gossip inthe bar with the landlord and his cronies he went to bed at about halfpast seven leaving his ulster and suit to be dried before the kitchen fire he slept in his underclothes a thing he had not done since the war it had the pleasure of novelty for him brought back old times and made him feel a subaltern again he slept soundly for about five hours got up and had a drink of water and then slept again till dawn his clothes were stacked outside his door when he got up the suit had shrunk a little and the ulster was no longer the fine fleecy garment it had been warren smiled quietly at his reflection in the glass he did not mind in fact he rather welcomed the change it made him look a little less conspicuous he went down to his breakfast with a lighter heart than he had had for some months again he was not hungry and ate very little it was a better morning cold and raw but fine he paid his bill and set out on the road again again he kept to moorland tracks all day trending northeast now and again he passed through tiny hamlets in the folds of the black hills or crossed a road it was better going from time to time a watery sun lit up the barren country and was lost again in racing cloud warren walked steadily all through the day he was not feeling fit a stale tired feeling dulled his pleasure in the exercise again he had no lunch except a mouthful of bread from his pocket and did not feel the need of any towards sunset he came out on a hilltop the sky had cleared and over to the east some ten or fifteen miles away he saw a grey line of the sea he left the hill and dropped down to the valley where the smoke of houses rose among the trees getting over a gate into the main road he dropped down heavily and in an instant he was wrung with the same stabbing muscular pain that he had had two days before in the office he sank down on the grass verge of the road and lay there gasping for a moment white and shaken slowly the sharpness of the pain eased and left only a dull ache behind god but im soft he muttered to himself ill never let myself get down like this again after a time he got up from the grass and walked slowly for the half mile to the village again he put up at the inn he felt rested and refreshed after his tea and went out to the village cinema that night he stripped and examined his abdomen with care thinking of rupture he found nothing wrong and came to the conclusion that his pain was muscular alone he sat for a time in bed studying his maps by the light of a flickering candle it might well be that he was taking things too hard bearing in mind that he had taken little exercise for years tomorrow he would not go on the hills the coast was not so far he would go gently down to the sea and strike northwards up the coast then on the following day he could turn northwestwards to the hills again moreover there were towns down there he could buy a razor or perhaps get shaved he turned to sleep already london and his house seemed infinitely distant to him his troubles had sunk deep into the background of his mind things that had happened to him very long ago that could not touch him now if anything were needed to expunge them from his mind the little pain that he had had done it he rested for the first time in some months with an easy mind only concerned about the physical circumstances of his present life he slept the morning dawned wet and chilly again he paid his bill and turned towards the east tramping in a windy drizzling rain the road ran downhill into farming land a change from the rough moors that he had traversed for the last few days although he kept to the road and it was easy walking he was curiously tired he went slowly with an ache and heaviness where he had had the muscular pain the night before he began to have his doubts about that muscular pain by the middle of the day his doubts were doubts no longer he was perhaps five miles from the coast tired he sat down for a few minutes at a crossroads to smoke a cigarette when suddenly the pain flared up and pierced him through he clutched himself and bent up double on the grass the cigarette fell from his mouth and lay there smouldering beside him god he whispered white to the lips itll pass off in a minute but it did not pass off it continued and grew worse with a throbbing deep down in his abdomen that could not be merely muscular he lay there for a quarter of an hour in great pain one or two cars passed by without stopping better get going somewhere he muttered to himself at last its no good stopping here he struggled to his feet and set himself to walk a quarter of a mile back to a house that he had passed he covered about a hundred yards and then he fell by me edge of the road he heard a rumbling behind him and struggled to a sitting posture raising one hand the lorry drew up to a standstill the driver remained sitting at his wheel looking down upon him curiously whats up with you chum he enquired warren said something unintelligible the driver climbed down and took him by the shoulder turning him to look into his face hey whats the matter chum he said you got it bad hell of a pain gasped warren in my guts be a good sort get me to a doctor the driver paused irresolute dont know about a doctor im a stranger in these parts and then he said buck up chum ill see you right two cars following each other close had drawn up at the lorry blocking the road one of them was full of men in a minute there was a little crowd around bloke taken sick said the lorry driver give us a hand with him an put him up in the back ill take him somewhere the lorry was half full of sacks of cattle food with a strange sweet smell there was a bustling about letting down the tail board and adjusting sacks somebody bent over warren and removed his collar which was cutting deep into his neck then mere were many hands about him and he was lifted shoulderhigh in a wild blur of pain passed into the hands of other men standing in the lorry and deposited on the sacks the lorry driver made him as comfortable as possible wont be long now he said ill see you right that all comfy now thats all right said warren feebly ill be all right here get me to a doctor wont be two jiffys now chum said the driver he got down from the lorry and put up the tailboard men with a jerk the vehicle moved on warren lay wedged between the sacks dazed and in great pain he had lost his collar and his shirt was open at the neck for which he felt relief presendy an emptiness about his clothes made him feel his breast pocket to discover dial his wallet was gone the fact impressed itself upon his consciousness but did not worry him he was in too much pain for that presently the lorry came to a standstill and he heard the driver speaking from the cab got a bloke in the back whats taken bad picked him up on the road three four miles back sick in the stomach i reckon says he wants to be taken to a doctor whatll i do sick in the stomach lets ave a look at him the tail board was let down and a constable climbed in on to the sacks he knelt beside warren whats all this he asked wheres the pain in my guts said warren its serious is there a doctor here no doctor here said the constable did it come on suddenlike ave you eyer had it before i had spasm of it about three days ago said warren and then i had another yesterday just short ones they were nothing like this and then he said suddenly tm going to be sick which he was they watched with interest well said the constable at last we cant do nothing for him here where you heading for burnton said the driver i got to dump this load an get back to newcastle tonight going by sharples thats right better drop him off at the hospital you know where that is round the back of palmer street aint it aye said the constable thats right you drop him off there and ill telephone to say hes coming he produced his notebook and walked round to the back of the lorry he took the number carefully took a few particulars and the lorry drove on warren lay jolting on the sacks in a stupor of pain for many miles presently he knew that they were entering a town they drove on for a time seemingly on cobbled streets then the lorry drew up to a standstill and he heard the driver get down and presently he heard the drivers voice again youll want to get a stretcher to him mate sick in the stomach he is a porter got into the lorry come lad he said lets get ye oot o this warren found himself assisted from the lorry and handled competently into the hospital they took him down an echoing corridor and put him in the casualty room and laid him on an examination couch he wanted to see the lorry driver to thank him but the man had disappeared he had no time to lose a very young house surgeon came with a sister together they examined him and asked a few questions his abdomen was rigid as a board peritonitis said the young man to the sister and yet i dont know not quite like that to me he straightened up all right get him along to the ward and get him ready ill ring up dr miller the sister said id better get the theatre ready i suppose hell want to do it at once i should think so youd better give him a shot quarter grain of the hydrochloride he turned to warren youve got to have an operation he said youve never had one before have you well its nothing to worry about but well have to do it at once all right said warren he had known for the last hour that this was coming the sister came with a hypodermic wiped his arm deftly and gave him the injection then he was wheeled in a chair down a long corridor and into a ward and to a bed surrounded by a screen there he was undressed and washed and put to bed in a clean shirt the morphia began to take firm hold of him the pain was eased and he became at rest a nurse came with a notebook name she asked henry warren married yes i dont know she left me went off with another chap a black man do ye know her address warren shook his head i dont think shes in england she wouldnt care anyway next of kin have ye got a father or a mother any brothers or sisters warren smiled theres nobody like that if i peg out let mr morgan know hundred and fortythree lisle court london ec is he a relation no chap i know in an office nobody else no said warren wearily the nurse went away and he lay quietly for some minutes in a doze at the foot of the bed the sister and a maid were sorting out his discarded clothes and turning out his pockets he listened quietly to their low commentary thats funny wheres his cards there ought to be some cards funny whats in the coat pockets oh thats bread throw it away he wont want that heres his money in the trousers eleven and fourpence no more is there all right write it down and ill sign for it theres his cigarettes and his matches hell want those presently but i cant make out about his cards shall i ask him no let him be now what is he do you think a clerk the sister turned over the clothes aye thatll be it a clerk walking down south they say theres work in the south but i dont know im sure many thats on the road will be glad to be home again if you ask me she was examining the coat theyve been good clothes hes come down from a good position in his time she examined the tailors tab new york he didnt speak like he was american i know what he is hell have been over in america and been shipped over here when he fell out of work to glasgow like as not and then be walking south they do that i was reading thats why there wouldnt be any cards said the maid aye thats it they folded the clothes together and put them in a locker by his bed warren lay listening to them in drugged indifference their ready acceptance of him as an outofwork clerk amused him faintly but he had no intention of refuting their idea at the moment that would need too much energy for the next few days his best course was to take the line of least resistance he did not wonder at the mistake with three days of stubble on his chin his soiled and dirty clothes pockets full of bread and no wallet he was a very different man from the henry warren of lisle court off cornhill it did not matter in a few hours he might be dead for all he knew the doctor came back with the sister bringing with him an older man greyhaired and thin and competent warren gathered that this was dr miller the surgeon he made a careful examination asked a few questions prodded the rigid abdomen with searching fingers acute obstruction he said to the young man look at it for yourself i dont think theres any doubt about it whats that asked warren interested they disregarded his question altogether and he subsided again into his role of patient the older man got up ill do it right away he said to the sister you can get him in there soon as you like he turned to warren soon have you right he said confidently i dont suppose youll be sorry to get rid of the pain either i could do without it said warren the surgeon and the doctor went away and shortly after that two porters came with a stretcher and took warren to the theatre in godalming at the same time morgan the confidential secretary was sitting with old mortimer seventyeight years old and growing feeble in his pleasant house so thats all i know sir he was saying hes been away for three days now i thought you ought to know the old man considered for a moment you say he told you he might be away for a few days yes sir but its quite unlike hirrt not to have let me know when he would be going or where i could get hold of him none of the servants knew where he was going to except the chauffeur no sir and he died hm there was a silence for a time then morgan said hes almost certainly somewhere in this country probably in the north of england or scotland if you thought it wise sir i could broadcast for him on the bbc certainly not said the old man sharply there was another pause and then he said never do anything to destroy confidence always remember confidence is your chief trading asset dont squander it he paused again i dont see any reason for extreme measures he said leave him alone and hell come home like the sheep and bring his tail behind him you know morgan smiled politely you say theres nothing very urgent if there is bring the papers down to me tell everyone hes gone off on a holiday tell them the truth that that damned woman of his has run away with a black man and hes too busy sorting out the mess to attend to business for a week or two and keep in touch with me upon the telephone yes sir the old man stared into the distance hell come back all right he said but i am afraid he may be very different it makes a great change in a mans life a thing like this chapter four for three days after his operation warren took little notice of his surroundings in those three days without conscious process of thought he decided upon a policy in regard to his identity he was in a ward of workingclass people labourers and artisans in some northern town he was not quite sure which he would have to stay there for some weeks perhaps he had no desire to be different from the rest and an object of curiosity they had assumed a little curiously he thought that he was an outofwork clerk and the sister had provided of her own accord a credible story he was content to accept that story and tp maintain it it was good enough for him he had no desire to be a merchant banker in a ward of labourers on the morning of the third day he asked the sister as she washed him what place is this she looked at him blankly i mean whats the name of this town sharples she said didnt you know no i was taken ill on the road a good way from here i think aye a lorry brought you in where did you come from glasgow he said readily i wanted to get to hull i used to work in hull i thought maybe they could fix me up with a job she made no comment upon that and warren lay digesting what he had heard presendy he said they build ships here dont they used to you mean barlows shut down five years ago and the plate mills and the joineries theres been no ship built here since then warren nodded slowly he knew now where he was the barlow proposition had been before him a few years before not once but many times it had been hawked round the city in its later stages like a vacuum cleaner he said used to build a lot of ships here didnt they oh aye one time the heather line boats and the myers boats they all came from barlows and then there was a great many foreigners and floating docks and that there was the admiralty work too there were seven barlow destroyers at the battle of jutland did you know that she paused and then she said its different here now to what it was in them days she left him and warren lay considering what he had learned the ward he lay in was a light and airy room lit with windows down each side each bed was neat and tidy with a red blanket folded mediodicalry at the foot and a standard locker by the side two of the beds had screens around them for a time warren lay and stuthed his surroundings the ward was neat and clean and yet there was something wrong about it that he could not place it was half an hour before it struck him what was wrong the ward was overcrowded there were six windows down each side and one at the end it was clear that the architect had designed for six beds to a side one between each window but now the ward held nineteen beds nine down each side and one across the bottom of the ward where no bed should have been and all the beds were full he stuthed the occupants of the beds for a time they lay inert a gaunt and listless crew one or two were reading newspapers and tattered books most of them were lying still staring at the ceiling as though they were already dead for all his weakness and his discomfort warren felt himself to be the only virile man in the whole ward he turned his head and met the eyes of the man in the next bed a tall gaunt man of fifty years or so with a grey face he lay quite motionless warren saw that he was watched morning he said there was silence for a moment and then the man said whats your name warren whats yours petersen jock petersen they call me yere no from theseparts im from america said warren i had a job in philadelphia the grey face showed a flicker of animation is things good in america would a man as was a chargehand riveter get work oot there i dont think so its pretty bad not even holding up i shouldnt say so theres over ten million out of a job already over there the animation died from the thin face listlessly the next question came what brought ye back to england i was in a bank said warren i got laid off with fifteen others last september then i bummed around and spent my money looking for a job and then they picked me up and put me on a boat for glasgow thats what they do unless youve taken out your papers ye came by glasgie said petersen eh id like fine to be in glasgie again there was a pause and presently the riveter said what ails ye a twisted gut said warren they cut out a bit and joined it up again they say ill be as good as ever when its healed but i wouldnt trust to that aye i wouldna say thats no a fact yeve made a fine recovery whats the matter with you i had the colic awfu bad they took me in for obsairvation as they say have you had it long twa three months it took me sair after eating or drinking i couldna sleep nights for the colicky pain of it i come to outpatients and the wee doctor ladthe he said to me to drink three pints o milk each day the domned fool did ye ever hear o sich daft talk with milk threepence a pint and that wasnt the end to it there was babys food and all sorts i was to take oot o thirtyone an six a week for the four of us an nine an three gaeing for rent i got nae better so they took me in for obsairvation youll be getting the milk now said warren aye an weary stuff it is on the other side of warren was a younger man a dock labourer by the name of thompson making a slow recovery from appendicitis he was largely inarticulate and apparently had little interest beyond the football pools he did however give one sound piece of advice see here chum he said hoarsely you want to watch that miss macmahon shell try an make you pay for what they done to you but dont you do it if you got any o the dibs dont let on see you got a right to be here same as anyone warren gathered that miss macmahon must be the almoner the bed beyond thompson was the corner bed there was a screen around it and an intermittent babble of incoherent talk from the screen the delirium and the movements of the nurses warren gathered that the case was serious he asked the ward nurse when she came to him with a drink hes a young man called tinsley she said i think hes a carpenter when hes in work he ruptured himself lifting some weight or other and came in for the operation the wound healed nicely and we thought he was all right but then it broke out septic hes very ill warren wrinkled his brows in perplexity what made it go like that i dont know im sure he had terribly neglected teem doctor miller thinks it might have been from that she went away and warren lay puzzling what she had said until he fell asleep it didnt make sense to him bad teeth could not infect a healed wound unless you turned and bit it there must be something else wrong with the man he could not have had an ordinary constitution but then were any of these listless people ordinary he did not think they were that night the young man died the screen was taken from around the bed the bed made up and by lunch time the next day it was occupied again by a man with a crushed foot that afternoon the almoner came to him he had seen her once or twice before a slim dark woman about thirty years of age distributing books and papers in the ward she came and drew a chair up to his bed she had a notebook and a pencil in her hand how are you feeling now mr warren she enquired better thanks id feel better still if i could get some real food i dont suppose youll get that for some time now mr warren ive come to talk to you about paying for the treatment that youve had youve had a very big operation that would have cost a great deal of money if a surgeon had done it for you privately and on top of that theres your expense of living here for at least three weeks boiled water said warren yes said miss macmahon firmly later on youll get expensive foods when you are able to take something patent milk foods out of tins white fish chicken all that sort of thing until you are able to get on to a normal thet it all costs a great deal of money at least thirtyfive shillings a week im afraid i havent got that much said warren you see im out of a job at the moment she looked at him critically what is your job im a bank clerk he said i was over in america in philadelphia then i fell out of work and the federal authorities shipped me back here because i was an englishman i was walking down to hull i might be able to pick up something there otherwise i was going on down to london have you got any relations who could help you with this expense he shook his head i dont think so you must make good money when youre in a job he said i was making five pounds ten in england seven years ago and over in america i was drawing two hundred a month i dont want you to think im trying to dodge this expense ill be able to pay it off when i get work again but i havent got it now im afraid she looked at him searchingly how much money have you got less than a pound he said she smiled we wont take arty of that if youve got to walk to hull and london but you must give me an address before you go and i shall tell you what the treatment has cost the hospital we shall want you to sign a note acknowledging that you owe the hospital that money and then you must pay it off in instalments when you get a job thats right said warren ill do that her pencil poised above the pad how much a week will you be able to pay if i get a job at five pounds a week or more i could manage ten bob she calculated for a moment that would do she smiled at him all right mr warren well leave it at that for the time being i shall want you to sign that note before you go and of course ill tell you how much we have to charge you and then youll pay it off at the rate of ten shillings a week when you get in work again warren nodded his conscience more painful than his abdomen i might be able to pay it off quicker than that he said if i can i will she smiled again thats very nice of you its not that we want to press you when youre out of a job but the hospital does need every penny it can get the poorer a town gets the more it needs its hospital and of course the harder it is to make ends meet he was interested having had to do with hospitals from time to time generally when they were in extremis whats the subscription list like terrible when i came here first barlows were going twopence a week per man and three thousand men that mad twelve hundred pounds a year from barlows alone and then there were the rollingmills and the little firms they all had weekly contributions to the hospital but all thats gone now and of course the patients cant pay much either she smiled thats why we have to get it back out of them when they get into work again but in the meantime you sec the hospital has to do without the money i see that said warren are there endowments very few he wrinkled his brows what are you using for money then we get along lady swarland is our sheet anchor she helps us out each year with a subscription to put us on our feet again im afraid its a great drain on her but she keeps oh year after year lady swarland said warren isnt her son lord cheriton yes hes in the army i think but he lives down in london we never see him up here she left him and went down to the little office that she occupied beside the secretary she went into the secretarys office mr williams was checking invoices at his desk ive seen that man warren in the surgical she said can he pay not a halfpenny hes a derk out of a job and walking south the little man clicked his tongue in consternation hasnt he got any money if he had id have got it i asked the sister what he had when he came in hes only got a little silver what sort of a man is he a very good type hes a payer all right when he gets in work but theres no saying when that will be aye said the secretary he stood staring out of the window into the yard short and rubicund i suppose the men will get in work again some day i wouldnt bank on that said miss macmahon next day a consultation was held upon the riveter in the next bed to warren a screen was put around the bed while it was in progress presently the screen was removed and the doctors and nurses went away the riveter leaned over towards warren eh mon he said they say im to have an operation the morn im sorry to hear that said warren tis the lords will and we must say naething against it whats the operation f or tor the colic i was telling you about a something ulcer they was calling it just now but i dont know he lay back upon his pillows inert and listless duodenal ulcer said the nurse in response to warrens enquiry when she brought him his milk food for lunch doctor millers doing it tomorrow that afternoon the riveters wife came to sit with him a woman as tall and gaunt as petersen himself dressed in a faded black costume with straggling grey hair and with appalling shoes she brought with her a present of a sixpenny packet of cigarettes the man in thebed smoked one gravely and in perfect silence the woman stayed with him for about an hour until they told her it was time to go so far as warren could detect they exchanged no words at all after the preliminary brief greetings she came and sat with him and went away perhaps thought warren there was nothing to be said next morning there was the bustle of preparation about the riveter in the next bed they took him to the theatre about halfpast ten an hour later he was back again with the screen drawn close around the bed warren did not see him again that the case was critical was evident from the attention of the doctors and the nurses in the middle of the night warren was roused by what was evidently a consultation of some sort from behind the screen he heard a laboured breathing that was new to him all the next day the sound of breathing grew in loudness with a rasping quality as if the man were gasping for his breath pneumonia said the nurse hes very ill that night the riveter died what did he the of warren asked his nurse how did he come to get pneumonia from an ulcerated stomach she shook her head it just happens when youre weak enough you can get anything you know she brought around the packet of cigarettes from which only one was taken his wife said i was to give these away would you like one warren lay and smoked in meditative silence he found that he had a great deal to think about three days later two more patients died on the same day one was a man of fortyfive or so with peritonitis the other a boy of seventeen who had had an operation on his neck and jaw for some strange bone disease to warren totally unused to hospital routine there was no apparent reason for the deaths the men went for operation and then just died the almoner came down the ward next day distributing her papers and books he stopped her by his bed have you got time to stop a minute i want to know a bit more about this hospital why yes for a very few minutes she sat down by his bed he fixed her with his eyes cold and purposeful he was becoming very much himself again i dont want to ask anything that you cant answer or that you ought not to tell me but theres something wrong here and id like to know what it is something wrong all these deaths she was silent he went on ive been here ten days now in that time four people have died in this ward out of the nineteen beds all after operations i suppose there may have been eight or nine operations in that time counting my own the way i see it thats about fifty per cent of deaths surely thats not right i think your figures are a little high i should have said forty per cent myself you mean that when one has an operation here its little better than an even chance if one gets through she hesitated i suppose thats what it comes to he was silent for a minute then he smiled at her i dont want you to think im prying into what isnt my business after all i seem to be getting over mine all right and i suppose thats all that matters to me but id like to understand the reason for these casualties he paused so far as i can see the nursing here is good very good indeed ive nothing to complain about i cant judge of the surgery of course but he seems to have done a good job on me and ive seen no bloomers on that side and yet theres this high percentage of deaths its unusual isnt it yes but you know why it happens as well as i do i promise you i dont in turn she gave him a coldly appraising look how long have you been out of work mr warren he met her eyes about six months he said steadily you must remember that i only know conditions in america and american hospitals ive only been in this country for a fortnight she softened i forgot she glanced at him queerly youve come from the new world and you dont know anything about your own country funny what do you mean she answered his question with another what did you think of your country when you came back to it again what did you think of sharples ive never seen sharples but how did you get here i got picked up on the road when i was ill and brought along here on a motorlorry she got up from the bed youve got a lot to learn about this country mr warren she said coldly youd have done better to have stayed in america in this country a man on public assistance gets about five shillings a week for his food not much unless hes economical after five years of that you cant expect him to stand operations very well i should have thought that was obvious even in america she swept away and left warren to his own reflections five shillings a week for food it didnt seem very much the riveter had told him that his weekly income from the public assistance committee was thirtyone and six out of which nine and threepence went for rent that left twentytwo and threepence for everything else for four people if you deducted something for fuel he did not know how much and for clothing it looked as if five shillings was an overstatement how much food could you get for five shillings like most men warren was lamentably ignorant of the price of food eggs he thought were twopence each if you lived exclusively on eggs that would be four and a half eggs a day for five shillings a week you wouldnt get fat on that there were probably cheaper foods than eggs bread and stuff however there was not much nourishment in those and there was no contingency at all to cater for bad management or ignorance the reason for the listlessness of the patients became clear to him this was the result of unemployment for five years of living at a gradually decreasing standard of nourishment gradually decreasing because all families would have some capital something that could be sold from time to time throughout the early period to add to the family income there would be things to be picked up too at first firewood from the deserted shipyard loose coal from me idle slag heaps trifles unconsidered in the time of general prosperity gradually as time went on the town would become swept bare till at last there would be nothing to supplement the weekly dole and mat it seemed meant undernourishment you did not the when you were drawing public assistance money but you certainly did not remain alive unlike most hospitals warren thought there was no wireless laid on to the beds that evening after tea however miss macmahon appeared with an electric portable set it on a table at the end of the ward and plugged it to a concert of old favourites the effect upon the ward was magical men who had lain inert all day turned their heads and raised themselves on one elbow the ward woke up the almoner strolled over to warrens bed good thing that he said gives them an interest she nodded i wish we could have it laid on properly with headphones at the beds having it like this means you can only have it when theres nobody very ill in the ward she smiled at him wryly and as youve pointed out that isnt very often he said im sorry if i spoke out of turn this morning i was unnecessarily rude she said forget it the ward was thoroughly awake the men were humming the familiar tunes singing in low discordant tones beating rhythmically with one hand on the counterpane warren lay and watched them for a time how much does it cost to put in wireless to the beds he asked i should have thought it would have paid it would pay in results she said but there just isnt the money in this town for things like that we ought to have done it five years ago when things were good it costs about five hundred pounds or a bit more we got a quotation once the concert was drawing to a close before the news and now said the announcer before we finish up weve just got time for one old favourite that we all know and the orchestra struck up the opening bars of land of hope and glory warren smiled a little cynically the girl saw it and was angry with him the music rose and swelled through the ward lifting the spirits of the men with its derided appeal warren watching smiling had the smile wiped off his face there was nothing here to laugh about the music rose and swelled through the ward and now the men were singing from their beds singing and meaning every word of it land of hope and glory mother of the free how shall we extol thee who were born of thee five shillings a week thought warren my god the music rose lifted the spirits of the men held them for a time and died into silence before the first news for a moment there was stillness in the ward then someone moved and the spell was broken warren turned to the girl land of hope and glory he said bitterly i suppose thats sharples on the dole she eyed him for a moment youre poking fun at us mr warren she said coldly that isnt very nice weve done our best for you he shook his head i wasnt poking any fun what did you mean then i was wondering what made them sing that thing like that he said i suppose they understand the words she flushed angrily and was about to speak but he stopped her land of hope and glory he said quietly the land that gives them five bob a week to live on and forgets theres no glory for them in this land and very little hope and yet they sing that thing like that she stood there looking down at him curious isnt it she said i suppose youd call it mass hysteria i might i might say that its because theyve been born and bred in this country and they still like it a bit he smiled and you might just as well be right as me behind her back a steady stream of news in dulcet tones flowed from the wireless you mustnt take the unemployment too much to heart mr warren she said seriously things will come right youre out of a job and going through a bad patch things are bad all over the country and here in sharples theyre just terrible but it is only a bad patch the ships in service are all getting worn out they say a lot more ships will be needed before long it cant be more than a year or two before were all busy again he was silent things are terribly bad here now and theyre getting worse each year but theres a limit to it we havent got to stick it out much longer then well all have jobs again he raised his head and met her eyes and his heart sank you believe that really he said absolutely from his own knowledge deep within himself he said im terribly sorry but he said no word aloud and presently the fat stock prices came upon the air she went to the wireless turned it off and took it to another ward dunking she had reassured him for the future warren lay awake for half the night with mingled feelings predominating curiously he was deeply ashamed he did not know of what next day the surgeon on his morning round stopped at his bed asked a few questions of the house physician and examined the wound better start getting him up a bit he said to the physician an hour or two each day he turned to warren not a sharples man are you no said warren i was on the road out of a job yes where are you going to i was walking down to hull then if i couldnt get anything there i was going on to london the surgeon eyed him keenly youre an educated man whats your job im a bank clerk the surgeon got up from the bed well he said you wont be fit to walk to hull for a couple of weeks yet he moved on to the next bed at the end of his round he walked down to the secretarys office and through it to the almoners little room he found miss macmahon at her desk that bank clerk in the surgical he said hell be ready for discharge in three or four days say at the end of me week but i understand hes walking the roads thats right sir he told me he was walking to hull the surgeon considered for a minute he wont be fit to walk to hull for a fortnight youd better go down to the labour exchange and see if he can draw a fortnights benefit here before he leaves me town tell them hes convalescing the almoner made a little grimace ill try it on doctor but i dont know that well get away with it you remember that man halliday the surgeon did he hesitated well try it on they cant expect us to support a man when hes fit for discharge besides i want the bed the almoner nodded ill go down right away behind their backs the secretary spoke if hes a bank clerk i could use him for a fortnight here they turned to him with vernon off sick im that behind with my books i just dont know how well get through theres the auditors coming in the middle of next month could he check the ledgers do you think i dont know said the almoner i suppose he could let him come down and let me have a word with him said the secretary ill know if he can help us then it might suit both wed have to fit him in somewhere else to sleep for that fortnight said the almoner i could see the matron about that the surgeon turned away fix it up that way if you like he said we cant afford to keep him after hes fit to walk though and get him out of the ward by the end of the week by the end of the week warren was sitting in the secretarys office totting up ledgers it was a great many years since he had served his apprenticeship in his fathers bank and he had some difficulty with the work there are few things so difficult to the amateur as simple addition on the scale required for an audit miss macmahon asked the secretary after the first day hows your new clerk doing he smiled dourly im not surprised hes out of a job she was interested isnt he any good hes slow very slow a good lad of sixteen would do it quicker i suppose its not the sort of work hes used to if hes no good to you well have to think of something else the secretary rubbed his chin leave him a while id no say that hes no use only he isnt handy with the books he was telling me the way they make up the charges in the bank which is a thing i never rightly understood no more than anyone else he was showing me the way we could save half of one per cent on the overdraft thats over a hundred a year saved if hes right the girl smiled if hes saved us a hundred a year already we can afford to keep him for the next fortnight she said whether he can tot up books or not its no saved yet said the secretary cautiously i must think on it the next afternoon warren had his first walk in sharples he went first to the post office nearby and sent a postcard to morgan giving his address and strict instructions that he was not to be written to except on the most urgent necessity having thus satisfied his business conscience he set off to inspect sharples walking slowly with a stick the town was dreary with the sad northern uniformity of long rows of grey houses on a minor scale dreary he thought but not so bad as some the houses were better and larger than those which he remembered on his visits to other similar places on the northeast coast gateshead jarrow and sunderland he judged the town to have been built more recently than those it seemed to be a place of about forty thousand inhabitants later he found that this guess of his was very nearly right it stood on the edge of the river haws a mile or so up from the sea behind the town the hill rose gently to the north crowned with sparse fields and the gaunt slag heaps of an idle mine he found the one main street palmer street near the hospital like all the streets in the town this one was laid out with granite setts there were rusted tram tracks down the middle of the street but no trams ran the shops were mostly small and unpretentious a great number of them were unoccupied with windows boarded up he passed by two closed banks on a fine corner site an extensive store was shuttered and deserted on the faзcade above the windows he traced the outline letters of the sign that had been taken down and he realized that he was standing in a town that could no longer support woolworths he walked the length of palmer street there were very few people to be seen although the afternoon was warm and sunny he passed a few knots of men standing idle at the corners but he saw few women and fewer children very few vehicles passed him for a time he was puzzled to identify an aspect of the town that was familiar and that yet eluded him at last he realized it was the cleanness of the streets there was no mud upon the granite setts no rubbish in the gutters of the road no smoke in the pale sky the town was clean as a washed corpse its like russia he muttered to himself the empty streets the shuttered shops the lean despondent people put him irresistibly in mind of leningrad where he had been some years before he very soon grew tired and was glad to cut his outing short and get back to the hospital he went through to the secretarys room to take up his heavy burden of simple addition he was ruefully conscious that he was not shining as a ledger clerk williams was out but the almoner was sitting at her desk she glanced round as he came in been out for your first walk he sank down in his chair ive been looking at sharples he replied its the first time ive seen it she made no reply he drummed with his fingers on the table for a minute whats the unemployment here he said at last she raised her head about seven thousand five hundred drawing from the pac she said i suppose its about nine thousand more or less thats most of the wage earners i suppose she nodded without speaking he eyed her for a moment what happened here he asked gently she turned to him i dont know none of us really know this is a shipping town barlows you know barlows really were sharples everyone seemed to work in barlows or in the plate mills or the mine and those were all mixed up with barlows the yard employed about three thousand people all the time before the war and in the war and after the war it went up to about four thousand so they say she paused and then about five no six years ago they started to lay off men there didnt seem to be any more orders for ships coming in i know he said that happened all over the world it was awful she said soberly ive lived here all my life my father was solicitor to barlows it didnt really matter much to us because he was thinking of retiring anyway but first of all they had to lay off the men and then some of the staff and then the mine shut down without any warning at all and that threw over a thousand out of work at once and there didnt seem to be any reason for it she said it wasnt bad management or anything like that so far as we could see it just happened that was in he asked about that time and then one day everybody got their notice they pasted up a placard on the shipyard gates to say that the yard would be suspending work for a time during reorganization everybody thought it would be quite a short time and it was only a matter of getting a new company going or something but it went on and of course the plate mills closed at the same time and then about six months after that the men started to run out of benefit and had to go on to the transitional scheme and then on outdoor relief and now weve got the pac and the means test he said has nothing happened to the shipyard since then she shook her head nothing they say now that it may never open again he was silent we cant believe that here in sharples she said quietly things always do come right somehow or other dont they he did not try to answer that has there been any attempt to start up other industrieshe asked she smiled a little wryly basket making and fancy leather work she said the council of social service are doing their best and i suppose its a good thing to try and get the men to do something with their hands but i dont know there were seven barlow destroyers at the battle of jutland did you know that mr warren id have thought they might have found something better for our men to do than fancy leather work nobodys tried to start up a light industry plywood or wireless sets or anything like that she shook her head i havent heard of anything like that he nodded thoughtfully a year before a man had come to him with quite a good proposition to manufacture a german type of carpet sweeper under licence he had proposed to set up a factory in a depressed area of south wales ruefully warren remembered his own words you must cut out the philanthropy he had said nobodys going to give you money for that youll have your work cut out to get this thing established anyway without planting it in an atmosphere of failure a little factory had been put up at slough and it was doing well she said its a wicked thing to spread a rumour like the one thats going round now that the yard will never open again it takes all the heart out of the people it makes them feel theres nothing to look forward to ever and besides it isnt true why not he asked ships always have been built in sharples all the ships are getting worn out as soon as this depression lifts a lot of new ships will be wanted and things will come right again that may be he said slowly but youve got to face the what do you mean it seems to me that barlows is out of the business no ships have been built here for a long time whos going to place the first order she hesitated i suppose somebody will want a ship some day i know but put yourself in his shoes if you were spending fifty thousand pounds of your money on a ship where would you go to order it most probably it wouldnt be your own money youd not have that much loose capital youd go and borrow most of it from your bank would you order the ship from one of the big firms in belfast or in wallsend or the clyde theyd build you the ship in six months and guarantee delivery to the day or would you come and place your order here she was silent the bank wouldnt let you place your order here he said theyd be afraid that something would go wrong that it would be a bad ship and no security for their loan i know she said quietly i know that is the difficulty one must be practical it seems to me that its the first few orders are the difficulty he said the goodwill must be absolutely dead but that means that the yard never can get started up again she said he had nothing to say to that she rose and faced him and he rose in turn i know that what youve said is true she said and yet i dont believe it this is a decent world and things like that dont happen sharples is going through a bad patch now but somehow were going to get over it something we dont see will turn up or somebody will come and help us get things like they used to be he faced her and his eyes were very soft that is what you believe i believe that some day we shall get things right again she said he smiled if there are many people like you in sharples you probably will he turned to his accounts he worked on steadily all evening at his books making up in length of hours what he was well aware was lacking in dexterity in the middle of the next morning the almoner passed through the office he stopped her as she went im going for a walk this afternoon he said is it possible to get into the shipyard id like to see it the gates are usually open she replied old robbins is the watchman he comes up here to outpatients if you mention me hell let you in thank you so much she considered for a minute ive got visits in baker lane and round that way this afternoon if you like ill meet you at the yard say four oclock dont trouble if its out of your way she turned aside i wouldnt mind seeing it myself its over two years since i went there id like to see how tall the grass has grown the yard stood at a bend in the river a mile or so up from the sea it covered warren judged about fifty acres of land there were three large berths for building and two smaller ones with quays wharves and a small graving dock the yard had been placed cleverly upon the bend of the river so that the three large slipways pointed down the stream enabling quite large vessels to be launched in a small river all this and other features of the yard were pointed out by the old watchman as he hobbled round with warren and the almoner admiralty vessels we built here too oh a many of them he quavered seven barlow destroyers there was at the battle of judand warren walked slowly after him leaning upon his stick and asking keen incisive questions he judged the place to be in pretty good shape the derricks and gantries exposed to the weather had not suffered gready from corrosion so far as possible all gear had been removed and put in store carefully greased and covered with tarpaulins the woodworking machinery had all been sold there had been no market for the heavier presses and the platemanipulating rolls and these remained in place the buildings of the yard were fair the offices and stores were still quite good he lingered there till dusk at the yard gate he turned towards the girl thirty thousand pounds for capital reequipment he said and then the money to finance the order she stared at him what are you talking about he smiled im sorry i was thinking aloud but thats what it would cost to get it going again how on earth do you know that he turned towards the hospital i used to do a good bit of that sort of estimating he said over in america of course she eyed him doubtfully but said nothing during the next week warren wandered widely through the town on his afternoon walks he went twice more to the shipyard and talked for a long time with the ancient at the gate he paid a visit to the rolling mills he went down to the fish quay at the harbour mouth and listened to the gossip of the boats tb find if there was any silting of the river in one swift hour of concentration in the hospital he learned the mystery of football pools which led him to an hours talk with a small newsagent that threw a great light on the failure of the yard he carried many parcels of washing to the homes of the patients and for each parcel he was paid in some stray piece of information of the town he gained strength rapidly unlike the people that he lived among before many days had passed he could walk long distances without his stick and knew by that same token that his time in sharples was drawing to a close there was one place more to visit before he left the town he said to the almoner working at her desk i want to see the mine miss macmahon before i go do you think that could be managed she raised her head you cant go down it i dont want to do that id like to look around about the pithead see the stores and offices she glanced at him queerly youve seen everything else in sharples and now you want to see the mine he smiled ive seen most things he admitted is it possible to see the mine she stared at him puzzled i know one of the clerks who used to work there she said he could show you all there is to see but what do you want to see it for he smiled to satisfy my curiosity he said blandly it would be so kind of you if youd give me his name she raised her eyebrows ill come with you this afternoon the man lived in a little house in a row on the top of the hill some way outside the town not far from the pithead he looked white and ill and very frail he made no objection to taking them to the offices and for an hour warren pored over dirty dogeared plans and talked production costs he walked through the stores and engine shops asking questions that the little clerk found joy in answering so long it was since he had talked his business with a stranger at last they left the mine and went back to the house the almoner went in with the pale clerk warren waited for ten minutes in the road outside then she rejoined him and they strolled towards the town thats fellows looking very ill he said is he a patient not yet she said briefly his wife has been attending for a long time whats the matter with him he isnt getting enough to eat by the look of hirn ive just spoken to him about it warren frowned surely the public assistance rates arent so bad as that theyre revised from time to time arent they you dont just have to starve she shook her head no you dont have to starve the rates are all right in theory mr warren you can keep alive and fit on pac relief if you happen to have been born an archangel what do you mean she stopped and faced him its like this theres really nothing wrong with the rates of relief if you are careful and wise and prudent you can live on that amount of money fairly well and youve got to be intelligent and well educated too and rather selfish if you were like that youd get along all right but you wouldnt have a penny to spare she paused but if you were human well youd be for it if you got bored stiff with doing nothing so that you went and blued fourpence on going to the pictures you just wouldnt have enough to eat that week or if you couldnt cook very well and spoiled the food a bit youd go hungry youd go hungry if your wife had a birthday and you wanted to give her a little present costing a bob youd only get eighty per cent of your food that week and of course if your wife gets ill and you want to buy her little fancy bits of things she shrugged her shoulders youve seen it up there he was silent for a minute she stood there looking at him mute there was no sound but the sighing of the wind over the hill at last he said thats terrible because its so difficult to change you cant expect people in work to pay for people who are idle going to the pictures or giving presents to their wives we havent reached that stage of socialism yet and that means there must always be starvation in a small degree because people are human and a little foolish sometimes she faced him bitterly theres only one cure for starvation work if only we could get some work back here thats the only thing that allows you to be human and foolish as youve got to be my god if wc could get some work back here again he moved over to a gate and stood there leaning his arms upon it looking out over the town she came and stood beside him he saw the river running down from the grey moors the bend by the shipyard the distant litter of the slips the graving dock the grey untidy huddle of the town all crystalclear unsmirched by any smoke of industry at last he straightened up and laid his hand upon her own what would you say he said slowly if i were to tell you that within a year there would be work back here again that there would be ships building in the yard the rollingmills working and jobs for everybody in the town she caught her breath there was nothing real to her then but the pressure of his hand his clear grey eyes the firm lines of his chin i dont know what you are or what youve been she said unsteadily but if you told rne that i id believe you in silence they walked down into the town chapter five on the next day warren left the town he visited the ward and said goodbye to the sister in charge yeve a long walk ahead of you she said but its a nice day yeve got for it take things easy now and remember that yere not long out of bed and dont go on if you feel tired especially about the wound he met the matron in the corridor and said goodbye to her she told him to call at the porters lodge for a packet of bread and cheese and finally he went down to the secretarys office mr williams and the almoner were there tm going now he said i just looked in to say goodbye and to thank you for letting me work on here williams held out his hand goodbye he said and good weather for your walk let us know how you get on miss macmahon picked up a pen and her pad well want to know how you get on she said practically ten bob a week as soon as you get into a job we said didnt we warren smiled im sure ill be able to manage that he saidhow much do i owe four weeks at thirtyfive shillings a week she said thats seven pounds i made a note out for you here acknowledging the debt would you mind signing it he took her pen and signed it henry warren one more thing she said you said youd leave an address where we could get in touch with you at any time he hesitated for a moment he would be closing down the house in grosvenor square and he shrank from the explanations that would be involved if he were to give his club address in pall mall if you write to me at a hundredandfortythree lisle court london ec it will get to me he said tm afraid i havent got a very permanent address just now what is that a private house he told the truth simply and boldly having found in the course of much business that the truth was sometimes the best lie its an office where i used to work they forward letters for me still she wrote it down and then held out her hand well goodbye and good luck dont forget us here in sharples when you get to london he shook hands with her and then stood for a moment everybody has been very kind to me in sharples he said at last and at a time when i most needed it i promise you i wont forget he smiled at them and went out of the door the secretary turned to the almoner yens a queer customer he said the almoner sighed and shuffled with some papers on her desk hes probably an impostor she said wearily if he isnt he must be a great man anyway he owes us seven pounds what was that address he was giving you asked the secretary a hundredandfortyhree lisle court the secretary reached under his desk and dragged out an old post office guide lets see what that is lisle court a hundredandfortythree he ran his finger along the line hey come and look at this his finger showed her warren sons and mortimer merchant bankers they stared at it in silence its probably a coincidence said the girl anyway hes out of the town by now but warren was not out of the town instead of taking the road south he went to the post office and collected a letter that was waiting for him on his instructions he signed for it slit it open pocketed the twenty pounds and the cheque forms that it contained and threw away the envelope ten minutes later he was calling at the house of dr miller the surgeon who had done his operation the smart maid looked at him askance the surgery is at six oclock she said i dont know as hell see you now ask him if i can see him on business connected with the hospital said warren she withdrew into the house doubtfully and left him standing at the door presently she returned the doctor will see you if youll step inside she said he was shown into a consulting room the surgeon was standing by the fire greyhaired erect and very confident well warren he said a little sharply what can i do for you youve got your discharge from the hospital warren nodded im on my way back to london now ive had a good long holiday its time i got back to my office youre in employment yes they took me for an outofwork when i was admitted and i thought it would be more comfortable if i went on like that i see well what can i do for you now in the first place i want to thank you for the care and attention that ive had in the second place i want to pay for it the surgeon smiled a little grimly well he said we dont turn away money in sharples these days have you seen miss macmahon i have she tells me that i owe them seven pounds he hesitated for a moment staring out of the window they were very kind to me he said at last thinking i was out of a job and short of money so kind that explanations would have been a little difficult i understand that you are chairman of the house committee would you mind if i gave you a cheque the surgeon looked at him incredulously why certainly warren smiled faintly i see your difficulty he said clothes make the man i know he drew a chair up and sat down taking the cheque forms from his pocket may i have a pen the surgeon passed a fountain pen to him warren paused pen in hand i think i ought to pay what this operation would normally have cost me he said if i had been taken ill in london i should hardly have got the operation done at less than a hundred guineas and then the nursing home for four weeks about twelve guineas a week if i make it out for a hundred and fifty guineas payable to the hospital would that be satisfactory dr miller moistened his lips perfectly he watched in silence while warren wrote the cheque and blotted it and examined it curiously when it was handed to him its a great many years since fees like this were paid in sharples he remarked if ever this is your own bank warren sons and mortimer warren nodded and you are mr henry warren of that house thats right the surgeon laid the cheque upon his desk this is exceptionally generous mr warren thank you the banker shook his head that isnt generosity he said its business ive only paid you what i should expect to pay for a successful operation he paused i have been very kindly treated here he said i should like to do something for the hospital apart from paying for my operation if you would allow me our hospital is in need of money said the surgeon all hospitals are but this one more than most i know are you in trouble with the current running expenses not at the moment lady swarland gives us a cheque each year even in these difficult times warren nodded from my own experience he said i would have said that the installation of wireless to the beds was one of your greatest needs for psychological reasons but i know nothing of your technical requirements is there anything in the way of equipment that you need more than that the surgeon thought for a long time at lasthe said i think youre right morbidity is our great trouble here depression the men get listless and let go we need the wireless very badly certainly as much as anything i took the liberty of looking through your files said warren while i was working with the secretary he took the pen and wrote another cheque you got your last quotation two years ago i think that ought to cover it he passed the slip of paper to the surgeon i dont want you to make any parade of this he said i should prefer this gift to remain anonymous for a number of reasons thats why i took the liberty of calling upon you do you think that can be arranged the surgeon nodded i can arrange that if you would prefer it in that case i can only thank you myself for your very generous gift but even if you remain anonymous i hope you will come down and stay a night with me to see the installation when it is complete warren smiled i shall look forward to that they talked about the hospital for a few minutes then the surgeon said i understand mr warren that you are the head of a banking house what exactly does that mean are you concerned with industry warren nodded my family started the business in about we ran as a private bank in exeter till then we moved the headquarters of the business to london and finally the exeter business was absorbed by one of the joint stock banks we do very little business now with private accounts we mosdy handle loans for the various corporations and the smaller governments placing them on the london market we do a lot of continental business do you touch shipping not directly are you thinking of shipbuilding and of your yard here the surgeon nodded i was wondering if you had seen any sign yet of the revival in shipbuilding industry warren shook his head im not a shipping man he said but i know of nothing that would benefit you here there was a pause i was afraid that would be the answer its better to be frank about these things said warren ive been in this town now for a month and walking about it for ten days ive seen your shipyard your plate mills and your mine and ive been in most of the smaller workshops too or heard about them ive done my level best to think of work that could be profitably carried on here i can think of nothing he said nothing that would make any difference to the town you mean weve got to wait for a general revival of prosperity in the country warren was silent the surgeon turned and faced him or do you mean that we shall never work again warren met his eyes thats what i mean he said gently i think you know it yourself and anyway its better to face up to the facts he considered for a minute and then said if prosperity comes back to the country as i think it will im afraid sharples will be left behind its five years now since your shipyard closed down since your mine stopped and the rolling mills your executives have gone to other jobs and your workmen have grown weak and flabby on outdoor relief if you got a ship to build now at a bumper price you couldnt built it profitably or complete it to time and its the same in the plate mills and the mine you dont think any work will come back here when shipbuilding revives it depends on the extent of the revival another war might do it nothing less well said the surgeon at last a little heavily as you say its better to have the truth he glanced again at warren i have always understood that you people in the city controlled industry he said that you moved companies and businesses about like chessmen ive seen a great deal in the papers about the banks assisting industry dont they assist places like sharples this place built fine ships once and not so long ago he said there were seven barlow destroyers at the battle of jutland seven no less i have heard that said warren gravely its very creditable what you say about the city is only partly true he said people deposit money in the banks or lend it out to companies and our job is to see that that money is kept reasonably safe that is what we call legitimate business in this case to give ships out to be built in sharples would entail a risk of noncompletion or bad work that nobody would dare to take i quite understand said the surgeon warren rose to take his leave i am afraid that i see nothing whatsoever to be done for sharples he said evenly legitimately that is to say he turned to the other it has been so kind of you he said formally they walked together to the door ill let you know when our wireless installation is complete said dr miller they said goodbye and he closed his door again and turned back to the consulting room there he stood for a long time fingering two cheques he wore the expression of a man who at the age of fiftysix no longer believes in fairies and has received indisputable proof of their existence warren sat in the train till evening as it roared the length of england down to london he was alone in his compartment most of the time he lay in one corner motionless staring out of the window it seemed to him that he had come to one of the turning points in his life in his career he knew what he was going back to he was returning to the work that he had been doing for the last fifteen years with the distinction that now he would have to live in chambers quite alone he was already a wealthy man he would go on working making more money because that was the only interest he knew he felt that before long that interest would desert him it would be difficult to keep an interest in the work if he were working only for himself of course he might marry again after his divorce thatmight be but next time he would marry somebody who knew the discipline of work darlington swept past him and northallerton he passed through york with every mile that took him south he grew a little more depressed it seemed to him that he was leaving a place where people had been kind to him to go back to an empty life of nothing but his work he felt that the people he had known in sharples needed him and that he was running away back to his own life he had given them several hundred pounds surely that was enough to quiet the conscience of anyone but a fool but it wasnt he passed through doncaster there were fifty acres of the shipyard more or less one wouldnt give a bean more than five thousand pounds for the whole thing lock stock and barrel it wasnt worth that it wasnt worth a halfpenny because it wasnt earning anything he could do that himself but one would have to get the public in on it to pay the losses no one man could support the loss that that shipyard would make if it built ships again he pulled himself up with a jerk this was sheer madness he was thinking hatry stuff he passed through newark if that yard ever was to start again the difficulty would lie with the first order the order would be obtained for such a place with difficulty that probably would mean at a cut price therefore it would probably be done at a colossal loss and the ship would be late in delivery you would have to find a pretty complacent shipowner to order from a yard like barlows somebody that you had some sort of hold upon perhaps there was always a quid pro quo one of the latin countries or perhaps the balkans now one might be able to do something there they were always pressing him to advance a little farmer than he cared to go perhaps however if they placed an order for a ship he thought of his old father dead for many years he closed his eyes and he could see the old man sitting at his desk that stuff wont do he muttered to himself that isnt how our business was built up grantham swept past him and away into the dusk behind the yard employed three thousand men when it was working at full bore a wage bill of perhaps seven thousand pounds a week three hundred and fifty thousand pounds a year that meant perhaps that they would build ships to the value of seven hundred thousand pounds a year allowing for materials and overheads that meant at least six ships of ten thousand tons or smaller vessels in proportion it was impossible nobody in this time of depression could find an order for one single ship of such a size let alone a flock of them there was the staff that might not be so difficult most of the chief executives of the old team were working in the industry at lower salaries and many of them not so far away at wallsend and in sunderland he could probably get them together again at a twenty per cent rise in salary if they were any good but how was he to judge of that the whole thing was impossible sheer madness to attempt he must be sensible and put it from his mind he passed through peterborough it would be damn good fun chapter six three weeks later barlows yard became the property of mr henry warren he bought it through a solicitor it was a long time before the news leaked out of the new ownership he did not use his firms solicitors which might have led the rumour straight to him but used a firm called matheson and donkin who had done some work for him before he summoned matheson on the morning after he reached london and gave him his directions two days later matheson reported back to warren in his office the shipyard is the property of mrs hector barlow he said shes in le touquet at the moment or else in the south of france jacobson and priestly are acting for her theres a son too hes something in the cinema industry but i dont think he comes into the picture warren nodded how much did they take out of the business the solicitor glanced at a pencilled note its a little difficult to say between and not less than four hundred thousand pounds probably rather more not very pretty i beg your pardon sir i said said warren grimly that it wasnt very pretty if i understand you right they took all the cash out of the business in the good years when the bad years came they let it bust and left the town to starve thats broadly what happened said the solicitor they cashed in of course it was their own business still put in that way its not a very pretty story what do they want for it now the solicitor picked up another paper i had an hour with jacobson he wants fifty thousand for the goodwill and another twenty thousand for the property as it stands the freehold site buildings plant machinery fixtures and fittings as a going concern does he expect to get that i dont think so its an asking price youd better tell him to go to sharples and have a look at it and then come back and talk sense youve seen it have you warren nodded its very bad its awful the worst you ever saw they havent built a ship there for five years theres no goodwill i wont pay a sausage for that theres fifty acres of land encumbered with useless junk ill give him three thousand for that fifty acres and anything he wants to take away before he sells he can he got up from his desk tell him that tell him to go and have a look at what hes selling and tell him to remember that theres somebody fool enough to offer him three thousand pounds for what hes looking at he paid five thousand five hundred in the end matheson bought it for him in his own name transferring it next day to lisle court securities ltd the company which represented warrens personal fortune robbins the watchman continued to receive his weekly wage from jacobson as formerly the deal concluded warren placed it in the background of his mind and plunged into the arrears of his work he left the house in grosvenor square and went to live in chambers in pall mall opposite his club his divorce proceeded on its way he treated it as a matter of minor business to the distress of his solicitor it seemed to warren that his divorce was an affair of little consequence he had started it off and it would happen let the lawyers get on with it his entire waking thoughts were centred in his work but with an added interest he was looking for ships in the next few weeks he learned a good deal about ships with ships laid up in every creek and every river in the country orders for new ships were a rarity he heard of empty shipyards everywhere of a few scattered orders bitterly competed for and taken at prices that meant certain loss but less loss than an empty yard he heard of governmentassisted german and italian yards competing in the slender markets that remained content to make a loss on every ship to take the opportunity of world depression to build up their industry he heard of queer ships for queer trades and of rum runners in the office one day morgan said the laevatian oil development sir you remember you said it could wait over colonel mavrogadato was on the telephone about a week ago he wanted to talk it over with you elias mavrogadato the one who was minister for home affairs no sir this is demetrios mavrogadato i think hes a cousin a cousin or a nephew hes over here with the commission warren nodded i remember how long was the pipe line going to be about fortyeight miles from the wells to the coast at pitlonas warren raised his head what were they going to do with the oil then ship it i suppose they can place the greater part of the output in italy theyd want tankers i couldnt say sir later that day warren rang up colonel demetrios mavrogadato and invited him to lunch at the savoy colonel mavrogadato was pleased to detach himself from the commission and to accept the invitation it pleased him to lunch at the savoy he prided himself on his capacity as un homme daffaires he considered the language of his country to be uncouth and endeavoured to avoid the use of it he had travelled widely he had been to belgrade twice and several times to sofia his brother had been to berlin with this wealth of experience behind him he knew exactly what was implied by the invitation he would be expected to eat in one meal the value of his salary for a month and it would cost him nothing at all it would cost him less than nothing in fact since by common consent the laevatian commission had resolved that private hospitality could not affect expense accounts he was pleased too at the prospect of lunching alone with mr henry warren it must be that the banker required his help on his side colonel mavrogadato was willing nay even anxious to assist mr warren in the nature of things he could hardly expect to serve upon another commission for some years and he must make sufficient out of this one to augment his salary till fortunes wheel came round again they met in the entrance hall my dear colonel said warren in french this is indeed a pleasure the swardiy features broke into a smile enchantй cher monsieur said the colonel and bowed stiffly from the waist they went down into the diningroom talking amiable politenesses in bad french and having some little difficulty in understanding each other warren who had had some experience of the balkan peoples was nevertheless surprised at what the colonel put away he began reasonably enough with a plate of iced melon followed by hors doeuvres and caviar at warrens suggestion he followed this up with a couple of dozen oysters and half a bottle of chablis he then expressed a preference for turtle soup and sole meuniere and was so delighted with pheasant that warren had little difficulty in inducing him to consume a second portion with the tournedos they broached a second bottle of champagne the sweet demanded serious concentration the colonel took the card and studied it quest celuila he enquired jam roly poly cest un plat du pays said warren avec confiture cest bien delicieux mais solide bien said the colonel jai encore un peu de faim coffee and kummel with the blue smoke wreathing up from their cigars warren approached the subject of their business it has been a great sorrow to me he said in french that i have been unable to see more of your beautiful country two visits only i have made there for the business of the visgrad waterworks the visgrad waterworks said the colonel a little thickly that was a very good business i think for everybody that was very good business he leaned a little towards warren but our oil development that will be a good business too i think i understand said warren that it is the intention of your government to raise the finance for the oil development from external sources it is for this reasonthat i ventured to ask if you could spare the time to talk the matter over with me as between two friends or business associates the dark eyes watching him narrowed a little as i understand the matter it is not the intention of your government to seek a loan theyd never have the nerve to ask for a loan thought warren to himself not after what happened to the last one the laevatian leaned a little closer to him not a loan he said there will be a company an incorporated company of the highest integrity supported by our government there will be two classes of shares the first class will be held entirely by the laevatian government the second class will be issued to the public in london perhaps also in paris and in new york but london alone i think is better they know its the only place where they could raise money for a thing like this thought warren id like to see them try it on in paris aloud he said the laevatian government will they subscribe in cash for any portion of their shares he knew the answer before he asked the question it is not necessary declared the colonel the laevatian government is the owner of all the oil that is in the land it is not necessary that they should give money also to the company besides the oil that is for the public to subscribe warren nodded slowly he sat there smoking meditatively for a few minutes in the course of his working life he had examined many such proposals for governmentcontrolled companies and he thought little of them his experience warned him at the outset that this was probably a wrong un it might not be consciously fraudulent in its inception though he would not rule that out but in the end the investors would probably lose their money he turned to the colonel it may be that it would be possible to float such a company he said but as a first step i think it would be necessary to offer some collateral security to the investors the other nodded that might be arranged he said for example the profit from the railways warren nodded this thing had been carefully prepared his sense of the unsoundness of it grew stronger he had successfully avoided the railways as a security when he was dealing with the waterworks in his view they were no security at all but they would do to dress up a prospectus with god he couldnt touch this thing he must be crazy to be thinking of it as i understand it he said the proposal is that a pipe line should be laid from the wells to pitlonas on the coast to get the oil to the coast for shipment i take it that you have had suitable consultants on that portion of the project everything said the colonel has been examined with a care that is incredible everything is in order for the work to begin now the reports of the engineers are at your disposal warren nodded that part of the thing was probably all right it was not there that the swindle would lie he thought for a minute and then said after the oil reaches the coast how is it transported in whose ships the colonel shrugged his shoulders and spread his hands you understand that is a concern of detail for the management of the company warren considered for a moment he decided that there was no objection to indicating this line even at this early stage this would be a long business and must be shortened as much as possible my dear colonel he said you must understand the position of our finance in this country in this time of depression our business in the financial world is so to direct the facilities that we offer that they produce the greatest assistance to the trade of this country in which also we have great interests parfaitement said the colonel he helped himself to a little more of the hotels excellent brandy the construction of the pipe line said warren it would be necessary of course for that contract to be placed in this country that could perhaps be arranged warren thought this is a damn sight too easy they must have tried paris i wonder if theyve tried new york aloud he said what would be the cost of the contract about three hundred thousand of your english pounds in sterling and the working capital that would be required about another three hundred thousand of your sterling there was a long pause in the end warren said you understand i speak only of my own group but in my view that prospect would not be very attractive the contracts are too small in relation to the risk the colonel was about to say something impetuous but thought better of it on the other hand said warren if it were possible for the company to reconsider its plan of operation so that it would operate its own fleet of oil tankers and if the order for the tankers were to be placed through my group in this country then i think the position might be greatly eased the laevatian was silent for a minute his swarthy features a mask and then i cannot say he said it will be difficult it will be necessary to satisfy the minister of marine m theopoulos satisfy is right thought warren grimly ill have to satisfy the whole bloody cabinet before im through with this you understand said the laevatian there is the trade agreement with germany that would require to be considered warren nodded slowly he had not thought of that the laevatians some years before had bartered the whole of their output of pseudoturkish tobacco to germany in exchange for manufactured goods in normal markets the stuff was practically unsaleable but in totalitarian countries people smoked what they were told to smoke the laevatians had not taken from germany the value of the stuff they sent there were large credits tied up in that country if any ships were to be bought they would be german ships he must stand firm on that however no ships no money one didnt finance a muckheap of a country like laevatia for fun he smiled at the laevatian we will turn it over in our minds he said on my part i feel that it would make the scheme complete if the company were to operate its own ships it would assist a flotation it would make a flotation very much easier if part of the issue were to be expended in orders for ships in this country he paused on your part you will consult with your colleagues and obtain their views then perhaps we may meet again to take the matter a stage further with pleasure said the colonel and paused expectantly warren chose his words carefully i am sure that we can bring about this business if we work together my dear colonel he said smoothly as business associates we shall do everything within our power to satisfy any reasonable request that you may make their eyes met i will see what i can do said the colonel warren turned and motioned to the waiter for his bill the colonel surreptitiously pocketed a couple of cigars from the box upon the table they left the diningroom and parted with mutual expressions of esteem two days later warren received a letter from dr miller in sharples his wireless installation in the hospital was complete would he care to come down to see it staying a couple of nights with the doctor he thought it over for a minute and decided to go down at the weekend he arrived in sharples late on friday night had a whisky and soda with the doctor and went to bed next morning they drove down to the hospital i feel a bit of an impostor said warren uneasily does anybody know that i gave the damn thing not a soul said the surgeon cheerfully i gave out that it was an anonymous donor and thats all they know he smiled i dont suppose anyone will recognize you i hope youre right said warren he was not in the corridor on their way down to the installation in the basement they met miss macmahon she nodded to the surgeon glanced at warren stopped and stared hard at him warren smiled im afraid so he said she said you are warren arent you yes im warren she smiled have you come back to pay me your seven pounds the surgeon smiled youll have to strike that off your books mr warren has already paid that to me i dealt with it at the last committee oh is he the patient who paid a hundred and fifty guineas the surgeon nodded she thought for a minute and then turned to warren i suppose you put in the wireless too or was that some other tramp im afraid that was me but it was supposed to be anonymous thats all very well said miss macmahon but weve got the books to keep straight mr williams and i somebodys got to know who gives anonymous gifts or you couldnt cash any cheques as it is i dont know what i shall say to mr williams about dial seven pounds you see its entered in the ledger i suppose i shall have to tell him that i cant collect it from you and hes got to write it off as a bad debt ill probably get the sack over it id better pay up that wouldnt be fair youd better let me tell mr williams you see its not so easy to hide your light under a bushel he smiled i ought to have stayed in london that wouldnt have done you any good i was going to get after you for it next week you remember you left an address she paused i suppose i should have found that you were head of the firm or something i suppose you would why did you say you were out of a job i didnt say it first somebody told me that was what i was one of the nurses i thought it was easier to carry on that way she sighed a little i suppose it was a natural mistake we dont get many of the other sort here these days he nodded slowly i suppose things are still very bad theres been no improvement she shook her head the surgeon said things are getting terrible mr warren in the last few months the place seems to have changed its as if the disease had become chronic the almoner broke in ive noticed that too dr miller last spring things seemed to pick up a bit people seemed more cheerful and the outpatients went down quite a lot i could show you in the records but this year its just flat the same all the time the people arent so so buoyant as they were last year warren said nothing they went down to inspect the apparatus and then walked through the hospital in practically every bed the patient was wearing headphones there was a better atmosphere about the place than warren had remembered its made a difference said the surgeon theres no doubt about it and the beauty of it is its always new hardly any of them have it in their homes so when they come in here it gives them something fresh to think about warren said nothing they went back to the entrance hall warren turned to the almoner im staying here tonight he said with dr miller there are one or two things id like to see this afternoon before i go back would you take me down to the shipyard again why certainly mr warren im free he smiled thats terribly good of you ill call round for you here at about halfpast two he met her at the hospital and they walked down through the town together it was a bright sunny afternoon with a fresh wind the wind blew through the bare grey streets with all the freshness of the moors behind the town untainted by the smoke of industry a few men stood about at street corners and eyed them curiously as they passed one or two women sat on doorsteps in the sun in sheltered corners it surprised warren that in spite of the fine day there were so few people to be seen about and he said so the winds quite sharp said the almoner and theyve got very little resistance to cold they mostly stay indoors on days like this warrens heart sank he might perhaps get orders for a ship or two but could these people ever build them they passed the old watchman with a word and went into the yard to all appearances it was as it had been before the buildings and the wharves deserted and a little fresh grass growing on the slips the wind sighed through the derricks and the gantries overhead ivgain warren got the impression that there was not much wrong with the place so far as he could see nothing had been removed before the sale well here we are said the girl what did you want to see warren laughed just that it was all still here he said i dont see much altered since i was here before she smiled a little bitterly you neednt be afraid of that youll see it just the same if you come here next year or the year after that only some of the derricks may have fallen down by then he eyed her for a moment youve lived in sharples all your life have you most of it i went away to school of course and then i went to durham university but my home was always here she turned to him you see i knew it all as it used to be when you couldnt hear yourself speak standing here because of the riveters and then there was a launch every couple of months or so with the flags and cheering and champagne and everything and we always used to look at the shipping news in the times to see where our ships had got to it makes one feel bad to see it all just rotting away like this he asked what did you read at durham law she said unexpectedly but i never practised he rested one foot upon a baulk of timber and leaned forward on the knee you ought to get away from here he said its not good for you or anyone to spend their life in a dead place like this she nodded thats one way of looking at it i know what is the other she raised her head and looked him in the eyes i had a fine time here when i was young she said simply from the earliest i can remember up to the time when i was twentyfive when the depression came all those years i was terribly happy i knew everybody here and they were kind and decent and it was all so interesting its different now of course but youve got to take the rough with the smooth i dont say that im going to stay here all my life she said but i wouldnt want to go away from here till things get right again they moved slowly through the yard between the heaps of rusty scrap and stingingnettles under the towering gantries a few whitefaced children were playing listlessly upon a heap of rotting plate not a very good place for them to play he said theyd get a nasty cut if they fell down on that stuff they do from time to time then we get them up as outpatients after its had time to get nicely septic cant the watchman keep them out she shook her head there are holes all along the fence where they get in she pointed there he nodded ill have that seen to she turned and stared at him what do you mean youll have it seen to i own this yard he said i bought it three weeks ago there was a long silence the gantries overhead raided and groaned a little somewhere a sheet of corrugated iron was flapping in the wind thats a change anyway she said at last i sometimes thought that nothing would ever happen here again she stared at him curiously who are you mr warren what do you do im a banker if you wanted to be rude you might say that were an issuing house she wrinkled her brows does that mean that you start companies he hesitated sometimes we do that are you going to start one here he eyed her for a minute if you were in my shoes would you go and tell a lot of shareholders that you could make money by building ships here she hesitated i i dont know nor do i he said grimly i see its difficult she said but what are you going to do with it now that youve bought it he shook his head i dont know that i really know myself i bought it because i was afraid that the national shipbuilders security would get hold of it and close it down for ever but he stared around i dont know what to do with it im just hoping something may turn up it would put fresh life into the town if they knew there was some chance of work again she said may it be talked about he shook his head id rather not if you dont mind it may be that i shant be able to do anything at all in that case i should sell it again if i could and that would be a disappointment to them she nodded all right i wont say anything they turned and walked towards the gate if there is anything that i can do to help this thing she said i hope youll let me know she smiled a little ruefully not that id be much help to you in starting companies he said you might let me know from time to time how things go on down here old robbins at the gate he ought to be getting his money regularly every week in the same way that he always has let me know if there should be any hitch there she nodded theres another thing you used to know all the heads of the departments in this yard she nodded daddy knew everyone and they all used to come to our house and wed go to theirs some day he said we may want a general manager it ought to be someone who knows the place and the men and he must be young not more than forty and he must be working in shipbuilding now hed have to be cheerful and tactful because hed have the hell of a job ahead of him if we got this thing started up again but wed pay him well she said id like to think that over mr warren i know the sort of man you mean ill write to you if i can think of anyone they walked up to the hospital at the gates she turned tpwards him as they said goodbye mr warren she said youre serious about this youre really trying to start something here again after all these years he met her eyes im serious enough he said if i could get this yard cracking again id be a very happy man but whether i can do it thats another matter its good to hear that much she said quietly the only thing that i can do is wish you all the luck in the world he changed his plans and went back to london on a sleeper train next day was sunday he spent it going through the papers relating to the laevatian oil development that morgan had prepared for him at the end of five hours work he had developed and increased his first suspicion that the thing was basically unsound it was however the one thing he had in sight that held out any prospect of orders for ships chapter seven a month later warren arrived in visgrad from berlin by air and went to the hotel des nations the hall porter with encyclopaedic memory greeted him as an old friend he had met the laevatian commission in london in conferencenot once but four times he had stated his terms courteously but firmly from the first three oil tankers of ten thousand tons each were to be built in england by a concern that he would nominate at a later stage on that basis he would proceed to use his best endeavours to promote their issue on the london market they were grieved and went away they came back in a few days and went away again warren sat quiet and watched them go from house to house with their proposal in that time of depression he had little fear that anyone would entertain it for a moment without some powerful outside motive after the third meeting he lunched again with colonel mavrogadato i think it is very difficult this business said the colonel it is m theopoulos they are all afraid of what m theopoulos may say m theopoulos will say that the ships must be built in germany he paused m theopoulos has had great kindness from many german firms on many occasions he said confidentially he was a poor man as i am myself when first he came to office now he is very wealthy but you understand he does not make a display of his wealth it is natural that he would not wish to disappoint his friends in germany warren nodded slowly he knew the balkans m theopoulos will not be disappointed with our business he said you understand one would not wish to talk of money with a man so highly placed has he no friend on the commission with whom we could discuss the matter and who could put it to him in the proper light there was generally an agent in the background somewhere to negotiate the bribe the colonel slammed his hands down on the table it is three times no four times unfortunate he exclaimed m hassanein it was arranged should be of the commission he is married to the divorced wife of the brother of the wife to mr theopoulos but he fell ill and was unable to accompany the commission that is indeed unfortunate said warren gravely three days later he met the commission again it appears to me he said that a matter of such importance to your country can hardly be negotiated except in visgrad where it will be possible for you to consult with your government at every stage if the proposals of my group are such as to justify your further consideration i would suggest that you invite me to wait upon you in visgrad to take the matter farther they glanced at each other mr potiscu the chairman said that we had intended to suggest it will perhaps be better that you should meet with m theopoulos and with m deleben the prime minister inthat event the commission would return to visgrad via paris on friday of the week after next i would not ask the commission to wait so long on my account said warren a little tactlessly i am completely at your disposal mr potiscu looked a little pained there is a race of horses he explained your grand national warren smiled i should have thought of that he said it would give me infinite pleasure if the commission would regard themselves as my guests for that day he was forced to submit to the delay he was able however to ensure that they did not tarry in paris on the way home by presenting them with through tickets to visgrad at fifty per cent discount sending each member home happy with a few pounds extra gleaned from the expense account a few days later he followed them to visgrad he knew the city well it lay in a bowl of the hills snowcapped to the south the river ran beside it it sprawled in eastern fashion indeterminately a litter of mud houses set upon bare earth whitewashed and dazzling in the sun flatroofed olives clothed the surrounding hills with a grey sheen in the city itself palm trees and oleanders lined the principal roads all this could be seen before you landed at the aerodrome you stepped from the machine and the interminable formalities of entrance to laevatia began dirty unshaven soldiery in buttonless uniforms laid loaded rifles on the table with alarming insouciance while they pawed your passport in a pretence at reading illiterate clerks asked interminable questions about the religion and habits of your grandparents it was better to provide an answer right or wrong fingerprints were taken for the greater security of laevatia against its enemies and finally a grudging permit was given to depart on the dusty seven mile drive into the city the road wound from the aerodrome through olive woods and an occasional village oxcarts impeded the way yoked picturesquely to low highwheeled carts in the villages the veiled women and the mosques added to the eastern atmosphere usually a very new church stood unused on the outskirts in the country districts laevatia was principally mohammedan on the morning following his arrival warren visited the british embassy he left cards on the minister and had a short talk with the counsellor then he found himself in the office of the commercial secretary a high sunny room with a window wide open on a garden full of lilac in bloom mr pennington received him cordially and gave him a cigarette weve heard a lot about you mr warren he said from the foreign office of course but also here yes when the commission came back last week and old potiscu reported they had something like a free fight in the cabinet over your visit the prime minister was noncommittal he really prefers to do business with us but theopoulos went straight up in the air of course he made a speech in the assembly about you ill let you have a copy translated this afternoon the gist of it was that your proposals were an insult to a friendly nation meaning germany of course he paused two representatives of the hamburger metallgeschellschaft arrived here the day before yesterday herren braum and linersoppe theyre staying at your hotel warren asked what sort of a following has theopoulos inthe assembly not so strong perhaps twenty per cent but if things got too difficult it might create a split in that case theopoulos would leave the present government the peoples party and go to the social reform party theyll very likely be the next government when will that be mr pennington shrugged his shoulders we havent had a change of government for some time perhaps next month perhaps not for three years he considered for a moment of course your business might cause enough stir to change the government in itself it seems to me said warren that first of all ive got to make a contact with theopoulos unless i can get him sweet i dont think it looks so good i should say youre right said the commercial secretary gravely but im afraid youve taken on something the germans have got him in their pocket properly how would you set about it if you were me mr pennington considered for a minute id get hold of the prime minister first he said old deleben and make him sweet we might be able to help you there a bit the ministers pretty thick with the old boy if you could get him on your side at any rate youd have a good representation in the cabinet he took warren across the road made him a member of the english club introduced him to the military and air attaches and gave him a pink gin warren went back to his hotel lunched thoughtfully and spent a quiet hour in meditation afterwards then he wrote a short letter to the prime minister asking for an interview he spent the remainder of the day in taking stock of his surroundings little seemed to have changed about the town since his last visit three years previously in the squares people sat in front of cafйs with queer drinks of alcoholic aniseed all serious business negotiation was still done in the long bar of his hotel between the hours of seven and nine he met the military attachй there and had a drink with him dined alone and went early to his bed next morning he waited on the prime minister in the house of assembly he had not previously met m deleben and found him amiable enough a rotund blackvisaged little man when out of office he was a lawyer in a small country town they talked in french for some time warren was told that the commission headed by m potiscu would continue to function and to deal with the oil development they were of course primarily answerable to m theopoulos who would bring their decisions to the cabinet i had the honour of meeting mr potiscu several times in london said warren who thought nothing of him i feel that a more able man for the position could hardly have been chosen m theopoulos i have not yet met that we must arrange said the prime minister it will be indeed a pleasure said warren he thought for a moment it has occurred to me he continued that a matter of such importance to your country will naturally take a little time to negotiate such matters can hardly be hurried that is very true said the prime minister it may be necessary that i should travel to england or to paris before the matter is finally concluded possibly more than once in order to assist the business from our side such absences on my part may be very inconvenient to you and that i wish to avoid it is in my mind to employ an agent here in visgrad a confidential agent you understand a man of complete discretion in whom you would have confidence the little beady eyes were watching him intently such agents are not very easy to find mr warren warren smiled if this were an easy matter he said smoothly i should not have troubled the prime minister of this country with it on my side i should be prepared to pay the highest fee for the services of the right man on the assumption that the business should develop to our satisfaction i realize that to employ the wrong man would be a disaster it is because of this and because of the importance of this matter to the state of laevatia that i have come to you he met the little black eyes fixed on him in all innocence could you recommend to me the services of a good agent for this very delicate purpose there was a silence in the room at last the laevatian arose and warren got up with him such a matter would take much consideration mr warren he said something may perhaps be arranged i will think about it and communicate with you at your hotel i shall be infinitely obliged said warren he left the assembly and went over to the english club the air attachй introduced him to the consul the consul stood him a drink ive read about you in the local papers he remarked will you be here for long six months said the air attachй itll take him that long to appreciate the er atmosphere they do business in out here warren raised his glass you forget he said gravely that i know a little bit about the atmosphere ive been out here before the air attachй grinned ill come to you for a course of lectures if you can tell me how to get our aircraft in though why we want to get our aircraft into a dud place like this beats me member of the league said the consul gravely horse foot guns and aeroplanes all march to our assistance when we get attacked like hell they will said the attachй warren returned to his hotel for lunch in the middle of the afternoon the porter brought a note to him in the lounge for msieur he said delivered by a messenger thank you said warren and dismissed the man he went up to his bedroom sat down on his bed and opened it inside there was a single sentence written in precise clerkly characters upon a single sheet of blank paper unsigned it read i think m petre vislan amontadeo will make for you a suitable agent he sat for a time waving it to and fro between his fingers deep in thought then he copied the name and address into his diary put a match to the paper and destroyed it he rang up the commercial secretary from his bedroom can i come round and have a cup o tea he enquired never touch it said mr pennington it doesnt taste right out here but come round by all means in the lilacscented office warren asked who is mr petre vislan who lives at amontadeo search me said mr pennington but ill find out for you how long would that take the secretary looked at his watch couple of hours perhaps let you know all we can find out about him by then he hesitated i could ring up the chief of the civic guard of course and probably tell you at once but perhaps youd rather not do that it might be better not to worry them said warren considerately all right is he an official i know literally nothing about him mr pennington nodded til do what i can youre in the hotel des nations ill look in there at cocktail time about seven and tell you what i can at sevenfifteen they were seated in an alcove with cigarettes and glasses of hulse which is the same as the greek ouzo warren poured the water into the clear liquid and watched the white precipitate heres luck said pennington he drank i got a little on your man through the embassy servants hes a nephew of deleben the son of a brother of delebens wife warren nodded slowly hes quite a young man twentytwo or twentythree hes supposed to be an artist he spent a year in paris about three years ago does nothing in particular rather a pansy from what i can gather keeps a mistress on the other side of the river but i dont suppose that interests you yes hes unmarried lives alone in a flat unless you count the girl thats all thats all i can easily find out we dont keep any sort of secret service or anything of that sort you know it wouldnt do at the same time we aim to please warren smiled thats given me enough to be going on with mr pennington cocked an experienced eye at him i must say you dont waste a lot of time this is going to be a pleasure to watch warren spent the evening in infinite boredom the first of several he dined alone and sat for a little time alone in the lounge then the night being fine he strolled out into the main streets of the city at eleven oclock the city was just beginning to wake up theatre and cinema crowds were going to their seats the shops were all open and ablaze with lights he paused for a moment outside a wide portal all chromium and glass from within came a sound of a dance band it was a night club of some sort over his head a neon sign blazoned the one word gonea he said its half greek this language woman not bad for a title says what it means a trifle crude he went back to his hotel to bed next day he made contact on the telephone with m petre vislan and went to see him at his flat m vislan came swaying to meet him a willowy darkhaired young man with a pale fleshy face heavily scented he was refreshingly direct my uncle has told me he said in french that you must pay twenty thousand dinars net you understand without deduction for any other parties warren made a rapid mental calculation if the entire business is completed he said that would be possible but it would be necessary that the order for the ships should be placed with my group apart from that nothing the business would not then be interesting to me the other waved a languid handkerchief flooding the air with scent it is a difficulty so my uncle says m theopoulos is very angry and he will not wish to disappoint his friends in germany it is a difficulty which we must get over said warren i shall expect your uncle to assist in persuading m theopoulos to place the order with my group the other sighed i will tell my uncle but it is a great difficulty are you able to arrange a meeting for me with m theopoulos i do not know i will try if i can arrange a meeting i will talk with my uncle it isa great difficulty when will you know if you can arrange a meeting i do not know perhaps i can talk with my uncle today he may telephone to m theopoulos i do not know perhaps this evening we meet again in the bar of the hotel des nations that will be a great pleasure said warren formally he spent the remainder of the day walking round visgrad infinitely bored in the evening he sat for half an hour in the bar before m vislan put in an appearance m theopoulos he is a very busy man he said two days three days perhaps then you will have an interview with him my uncle has spoken to him by telephone but it is a great difficulty warren wrinkled his brows i will write formally to ask him for an interview he said your uncle will then be able to remind him that you may do said m vislan mournfully but m theopoulos is very busy warren dined alone wrote his formal letter and went for another walk nothing whatever happened on the following day he got no answer to his letter in the afternoon he took a car to the summit of monte turcu and sat for an hour over a glass of bulse looking out over the city he returned to the hotel read a novel in his bedroom for a couple of hours and dined alone all day he had not spoken to a soul except the hotel servants and the driver of his taxicab he was most paralytically bored he went out to the gonea the tables rose in tiers and little boxes separated by waisthigh partitions above the oval dancing floor the place was only scantily filled it was early over by the floor the band were twanging at their instruments moving restlessly about and shuffling their music warren settled into a small box at the back of the hall ordered a coffee and a cognac and waited upon events he had not long to wait within ten minutes a slim dark girl was leaning over the back of his box you look so sad she said in french with a mocking tone it is a great pity but no doubt you would prefer to be alone he smiled it would be very kind of you to join me i have spoken to nobody all day she slipped into a seat beside him it is the business she said all of you americans are the same the business makes you grow so sad that may be but im english she rippled into laughter the english they are the worst of all spangles covered the black stuff of her corsage and her dress her lips and fingernails were very red her eyebrows pencilled black and you he said thoughtfully must be sicilian she pouted i declare it is an insult a thousand pardons mademoiselle she threw him a swift brilliant smile i am entirely deceived from what country do you come from corsica there is my home in sulina you have perhaps travelled in corsica he shook his head mademoiselle he said it would be a great pleasure to me if you would drink a glass of wine of a certainty what wine would you prefer she fingered the list he smiled mademoiselle i would prefer that wine which carries the most generous commission with the cork for this first meeting later on future evenings we drink lemonade she threw her head back and laughed merrily you are droll monsieur she said the most droll englishman that i have ever met it would amuse me to drink lemonade with you but for this first evening we will drink french champagne a waiter appeared behind them swiftly with a bottle and the glasses she stopped him as he was retiring give me the cork she said he left it on the table with a smile presently it was joined by another she told warren that her name was pepita in a little while they went and danced talked for a little and then danced again once in the course of the evening she left him for a quarter of an hour to do her turn in cabaret a spanish song and dance with castanets then she came back to him and they danced again at midnight he went back to his hotel she pouted as he left her it is too early she said i declare the english are so sleepy this place is not yet alive what time do you get home he asked five oclock usually and then you get up in the middle of the afternoon but no at twelve oclock that is sufficient sleep for anybody but an englishman she smiled at him and he went back to his hotel to bed he saw m vislan again next morning i do not think it is possible to do anything he said waving a scented handkerchief in languid manner m theopoulos is very busy i think he will see you before long i trust so said warren equably but i have other business to attend to it will not be possible for me to wait in visgrad unless it is possible for the business to progress tell your uncle that the other sighed it is very difficult i will talk with my uncle and i will tell you what he has said warren went and had a cocktail in the english club not so good today he said in answer to a question from the consul im trying to get in to see theopoulos without any very great success the air attachй smiled i thought you knew this town he said this is heartbreak house i guessed as much said warren he spent the afternoon asleep upon his bed in common with the remainder of visgrad that night he went again to the gonea and danced with pepita she told him as the evening progressed something about her life she rarely spent more than six weeks in one cabaret she had come to visgrad a fortnight previously from athens before that she had been in belgrade she knew istanbul and cairo bucharest and tripoli she spent her life in fact in journeying from cabaret to cabaret around the mediterranean he asked do you ever take a holiday she said i go to sulina once a year to be with my little one i stay one week two weeks but you understand it is necessary to work he nodded is your little one a boy or a girl she smiled a girl of five years i go in the spring or early in the summer then i can take her out on to the hillside where the flowers are we make little crowns of the flowers she broke off msieur no doubt would like to dance again later in the evening he said you are perhaps engaged tomorrow afternoon mademoiselle i find he explained that one does not do business in visgrad in the afternoon i have the intention to take an automobile into the mountains for two or three hours beyond monte turcu it would give me great pleasure if you would accompany me she smiled to the high mountains msieur i would be enchanted but it will be necessary that i return to visgrad by six oclock precisely for my meal and for my rest you understand one must think of ones profession she came to the hotel next day dressed a little extravagantly in black and white he took her in and gave her lunch he found that she was known to many of the people lunching in the diningroom from time to time somebody would catch her eye and she would smile you know more people than i do mademoiselle he said she shrugged her shoulders it is the same everywhere in visgrad all me world visits the gonea the men mat is to say it is so in athens also in sofia in aleppo everywhere she turned to him msieur i have said that i must return by six oclock but now i have things that i must buy in the shops would it be possible that we should return by halfpast five but certainly he said she threw him one of her swift brilliant smiles msieur you are too kind they left the hotel after coffee and went out to the car he had engaged from visgrad the road ran for ten kilometres across the plain then rose swiftly into the mountains first through the grey olive woods and then through pine forest warrensat chatting with the girl in the warm sun content and at rest the chauffeur drove them at an easy pace in the middle of the afternoon they came to a small lake bordered by a meadow of white flowers the pine trees dark behind the girl caught at his arm msieur she said the flowers they are marvellous i msieur stop the car and let me walk here for a little he stopped the car and they got out the chauffeur said something rapidly in laevatian that warren could not understand he says that one kilometre farther on there is a cafй by the lake she said i will tell him to wait for us there they strolled down to the lake side the girl picked a handful of the celandines and put one in his buttonhole it is so beautiful she said twice before i have been in visgrad but i have never seen this place do you know the name he shook his head i will ask the chauffeur when we reach the cafй he smiled your little one would like to be here mademoiselle she nodded quickly msieur it is to places such as this that i take my little one when i am in sulina so that when i am away she may remember me with the flowers and things that are beautiful and good i have to be away so much it is only for one week or for two weeks in each year mat i can see her that is a very little time he said she nodded again it is true it is not right that a mother should not see her little one more than two weeks in the year and it is for that msieur that i spend no money that i can help and she flashed a smile at him we do not drink lemonade msieur but champagne in five years more perhaps i shall have saved enough to return to live in sulina how much is necessary for that she shrugged her shoulders it would not be prudent that i should give up my career as artiste till i had saved a hundred and fifty thousand francs that is a very large sum mademoiselle she nodded terrifying five years ago when my little one was born and i became responsible you understand msieur at that time i determined on that sum i declare i was terrified it seemed so long to make it and to leave my little one alone for all these years insupportable but now it is already five years and i have saved nearly the half and now i demand more money twenty dinars a night i will not dance for less i have told them in the gonea i am artiste and known to the clientele they walked down the shore of the lake among the flowers the air was cool and refreshing after the heat of visgrad at the cafй they sat for a while and drank turkish coffee served to them by a veiled girl they are not civilized these people said pepita they drove back to visgrad and entered the city a few minutes before halfpast five warren turned to the girl where shall i put you down mademoiselle you wish to do some shopping she thought for a moment there is a large shop in the litescu she spoke rapidly to the driver through the screen he nodded his head i have asked him if he will stop in the litescu it is on the way to your hotel the car ran swiftly through the streets and slowed down in the shopping quarter msieur she said i have enjoyed this afternoon i diank you infinitely we will dance again tiiis evening but certainly he said the car drew up to a standstill by the broken pavement warren looked at the shop it was a toy shop he smiled you go to buy toys mademoiselle msieur she said i declare i am ashamed all of the afternoon i have talked to you of my little one it was not gentil that but in ten days will arrive her day of birth and it is necessary that i should post her present now or it will be too late you would prefer to be alone perhaps but no msieur but for you it is not interesting to buy a doll mademoiselle he said i should enjoy it infinitely she threw back her head and laughed come msieur and we will choose a doll together in the shop she hesitated for a long time over the choice there were dolls in greek peasant costume in laevatian peasant costume in albanian peasant costume baby dolls little girl dolls soldier dolls black dolls after endless discussion in broken laevatian with the old lady of the shop she chose a large baby doll with long draperies mademoiselle said warren i have never been a father but i understand that a young child like that requires a perambulator is it permitted that i should send a perambulator for the doll that your little one may wheel her about the old lady dragged forward a selection of dolls perambulators msieur said the girl a little huskily you are too kind my little one will be enchanted they chose a perambulator and gave instructions for the packing and the carriage to sulina in corsica then he went back to his hotel in the evening he danced a little with the girl and was in bed by midnight he went down next day to the embassy and had a talk with pennington i seem to be at a dead end he said unless i can get on the right side of theopoulos i may as well go home i havent yet been able even to have a word withhim the secretary rubbed his chin that often happens here you know im glad you got on well with deleben but if he cant get you in to see theopoulos it certainly is difficult i think ill go direct to his office said warren send in a card and see what happens you may get a rebuff said pennington i dont know that i greatly care if theres nothing to be done here the sooner i know about it the better he left the embassy and went down to the ministry of marine the doorway was guarded by a sailor unshaven and dirty and armed with rifle and bayonet he barred the entrance warren produced his card a noncommissioned officer of the army strolled up from behind the sailor took the card and scrutinized it for m theopoulos said warren take the card to him he will wish to see me the man looked at him insolendy you are the englishman from london he said in broken french m theopoulos is too busy to see you nevertheless said warren you will take the card to him for answer the man tore the card in two and threw it on the ground then he spat ostensibly towards the gutter the saliva hit the leg of warrens trouser and trickled down the man turned back into the hall m theopoulos is busy he said indifferently you must come another day warren turned back into the street black with anger he stopped a few paces from the door and wiped his trouser with his handkerchief behind him a taxi drew up at the door of the ministry he turned and saw the two germans get out herr braum and herr linersoppe they were immethately admitted warren walked back to his hotel and rang up vislan you must tell m deleben he said that i can wait no longer i shall be at the hotel for the remainder of the day but tomorrow i return to london if the business should move at all today i will put off my return otherwise i leave on the first plane he heard the other sigh it is so difficult he complained but i will see my uncle and i will tell him in the late afternoon he went down to the embassy again he told pennington what had happened then he walked over to the window and stood there for a minute looking out upon the garden sweetly scented by the lilac trees i think im through he said ive made a mistake i was too eager to get the business i should not have come here till the deal was much farther advanced we get a lot of this out here you know said pennington theyre not very good people to deal with warren turned back into the room i know he took up his hat and stick im leaving for london on the morning plane tomorrow he said its been terribly good of you to give me all the help you have he went back to his hotel and booked a seat upon the berlin plane he would have to go by berlin to get to london then he rang up vislan and told him again that he was leaving my uncle is very much upset that you are going said the laevatian he says that it is a great pity he has said to me to tell you that he is sure that m theopoulos will be able to see you in a day or two warren laughed he will have to come to london if he wishes to see me in a day or two he said tell m deleben that i am desolated that i have not had the opportunity to do business in your country it would have been the greatest pleasure to me i will tell him so warren dined alone and went out to the gonea pepita rose and came to meet him they danced once or twice mademoiselle he said presently this evening is the last that i come here i leave for london in the morning she stared at him msieur you are leaving visgrad tomorrow he smiled i have to go she pouted i declare msieur i am not at all content you have told me that you would be here perhaps for several weeks and i have looked forward to dancing with you and now you say that you must go back to london no msieur i declare i have been badly used this business that takes you back to london can it not wait for a few days he smiled it is not business that takes me back to london he said but i can do no business here and so i must go back to my own country she leaned her elbows on the table msieur i have read about your business in the journal i do not understand why you must go away they say here that you are very close to m deleben no i do not understand at all you understand a great deal of visgrad politics mademoiselle i did not know you understood so much bah everybody comes here and in the early morning late you understand one hears much talk of politics he nodded slowly you may know perhaps mademoiselle that in my business nothing can be done without the goodwill of m theopoulos i have not that goodwill and i find that i am unable to get it i cannot even get to see theopoulos he finds himself too busy to give me an appointment my business which is finance can only flourish with goodwill on either side therefore i must return to london she stretched her hands out on the table before her msieur has been unable to meet m theopoulos that is so a smile wreathed about her lips and for that reason you return to london certainly she threw her head back and burst into a peal of laughter oh msieur it is droll that she laughed again continuously warren smiled mademoiselle he said i am glad that i am able to amuse she turned to him choking with laughter wiping the tears from her eyes msieur i ask your pardon it is not gentil that i should laugh but msieur you must understand m theopoulos comes here every night all the ministers of the cabinet come here every night if msieur wishes to meet m theopoulos nothing is more easy you could arrange that she burst again into a peal of helpless laughter msieur it could have been arranged on that first night you were here always m theopoulos will arrive at halfpast one or two in the morning but msieur the english they go to bed too soon he calmed her with kind words and french champagne msieur she said wiping her eyes ten thousand pardons it is wrong that i should laugh but as for m theopoulos wc will arrange a meeting for tonight it is of all things the most easy if msieur will arrange a little party with a few of the demoiselles of the house especially hйlиne and with plenty of champagne m theopoulos will join us of his own accord it will not be necessary for msieur to go to m theopoulos he will come to msieur it would be most kind if you would arrange such a meeting mademoiselle she leaned back in her chair and beckoned to a waiter hйlиne and rita and virginio she said ask them to come to meet msieur we make a party for tonight you may bring for a commencement said warren another halfdozen bottles his guests arrived in a few minutes a couple of magnificentlybuilt young women and a saturnine young man who partnered one of the young women rita in an acrobatic dance pepita did the honours hйlиne she said permit that i present you to msieur ouarren he bowed also mademoiselle rita and msieur virginio i am enchanted said warren hйlиne turned to him msieur she said i have longed to meet you he could hardly follow her rumanian french the patron who has bought the perambulator for the doll there was laughter she turned upon them no no no it is not to laugh it was bien aimable that it is true said pepita m potiscu has said the same warren wrinkled his brows m potiscu he enquired does he know about it but certainly said pepita you understand m potiscu is of the department of the treasury which controls the customs in the ordinary way a parcel such as that there would be much delay there would be declarations and forms and camels and attestations and very very many dinars to be paid it would be insupportable that but last night i have seen and danced with m potiscu and i have told him that the parcel is a gift for my little one so all is arranged it is good to give presents to little children said the saturnine virginio i myself very much enjoy doing that pepita turned to hйlиne it is necessary that msieur here should become acquainted with m theopoulos she said perhaps we can assist msieur yes of a certainty said hйlиne she added something in a language that warren could not understand which left the table convulsed with laughter pepita explained in french to warren she has said if you would take him away from her and put him in the closet you understand she made a motion as of one who pulls a chain warren laughed mademoiselle he said to hйlиne i will do my utmost to engage his entire attention that she said will be a very considerable relief virginio interposed m theopoulos also plays cards he said he bowed slightly to hйlиne it is his other amusement msieur is acquainted with the game of polski bank perhaps warren shook his head it would perhaps assist msieur said virginio if he were to play cards with m theopoulos to win a little money forty fifty dinars no more makes m theopoulos very happy it will be easy for you then that is true said hйlиne i have seen it many times virginio said if msieur wishes i will show him how the cards should be played irresolute warren glanced at pepita she nodded slightly that would be a great pleasure he said virginio departed to get cards pepita leaned across to warren he is safe for you to trust she said he is very clever with the cards i knew him before in beirut he has been croupier in a casino he is also conjuror a little for the cards to go as he wishes but he will not cheat you because you are my friend you should make an arrangement with him to give him perhaps ten per cent of what you wish to win or lose warren considered for a moment he had nothing to lose before he had come into the place he had thrown up the sponge booked his ticket for london acknowledging defeat if now he could reverse the position by these means why not but to play cards with a conjuror abruptly there returned to him the memory of his conversation about sharples nothing whatever can be done he had said legitimately virginio returned with the cards warren retired with him to an adjoining table see msieur he said the game of polski bank is so i am the bank i deal the three cards so face down in five minutes warren had mastered the intricacies of the game it seemed to him to be suitable for very young children or for the feebleminded but with an added tang of viciousness about it he found it not unlike the three card trick at the conclusion of the lesson he eyed virginio for a moment it would be well that i should lose this evening forty or fifty dinars to m theopoulos he said but in a game where chance must play so great a part that may not perhaps be very easy that can be arranged msieur i should be infinitely obliged should we say ten per cent of the winnings of m theopoulos up to fifty dinars virginio bowed slightly msieur is too kind now if msieur will note carefully when i have the bank and perhaps also at some other times if a court card should be the highest then in the next hand the highest card will find itself on the right if the highest card should be from ace to seven then in the next hand the highest card will find itself on the left so eight nine or ten then in the next hand the highest card will find itself in the centre that will be easy to remember is it not so but certainly that will be of great assistance they rejoined the lathes it was at a quarter to two that m theopoulos appeared he came in a waft of scent a tall broad man with curly negroid hair and a goodnatured oily face with him came herr braum he hesitated for a moment and approached their table hйlиne rose to meet him stretched out a hand and dragged him down into the seat beside her dear elias she said i had thought that you were not coming tonight and i was sad permit that i introduce msieur ouarren who has been entertaining us so well the ministers eyes flickered to the bottles critically and then away i am enchanted he said diickly it is a pleasure to meet msieur ouarren on the contrary said warren and beyond doubt the pleasure is entirely mine msieur will do me the honour to drink a glass of wine herr braum sank down into a seat by virginio ill at ease hйlиne poured a glass of champagne for the minister kissed the lip of the glass and handed it to him to drink warren caught the waiters eye cigars he said havanas of the best the minister settled into his chair one arm around hйlиne you have visited in visgrad before he asked warren twice before in connexion with the visgrad waterworks i had some part in that business ah the waterworks m potiscu has told me the minister ruminated for a moment that was a very good business he said at last reflectively if all my business could be of equal benefit to the laevatian people said warren i should indeed be pleased the band beat to a heavy rhythm the dancers moved upon the floor the cigar smoke curled about them thickening the air twice theopoulos took hйlиne down to dance upon the floor but returned each time to the cigars and french champagne from time to time one or other of the party left to do a turn of cabaret and returned the evening was drawing on the air grew thicker heavier small beads of perspiration appeared upon the heavy countenance warren turned to the minister it grows warm he said too warm to dance msieur would perhaps prefer the cards the heavy face lit up assuredly you know our game of cards warren smiled and shook his head i have been here for so short a time one game perhaps when i was here before you put down three cards so ja ja ja said the minister and then one other so that is in order that game we call polski bank warren nodded i remember the name now we could play that game if you wish with all my heart he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and produced a wad of greasy notes they cut the cards round and herr braum took the first bank half an hour later they paused the minister had won sixtythree dinars about six pounds warren had lost seventytwo the german and virginio were about all square in high goodhumour theophoulos took hйlиne down to dance again herr braum smiled at warren matters have not gone well for you tonight for a financial expert to lose so much money he made a little clicking noise with his teeth in finance said warren one does not always win from the first deal one must have courage and see the game through that is to say said the german if one has the financial strength to see the game through to the end warren eyed him steadily in england we do not engage in games unless we can pay if we lose he said he picked up the cards and shuffled them let us play a game until the minister returns he said we two will play alone virginio here can bank for us unless perhaps he added your country has not the financial resources of my own the german smiled a war of international finance msieur let us begin the minister returned after the second hand and took another glass of the champagne msieur said warren i ask your pardon but this game is between us two herr braum has doubted my financial standing and in our english idiom i go to trim the pants off him rita translated quickly and in rabelaisian manner the minister laughed and took another cigar this will be good to watch he said germany against england to the death proceed messieurs virginio dealt the cards again a hundred dinars said the german insolently and threw a note down on the lefthand card that is if that is not too high a stake warren beckoned to the waiter bring counters he said he turned to the german laying down his note upon the centre card msieur i suggest that one yellow counter counts a hundred dinars a blue one five hundred dinars and a red one a thousand dinars the german moistened his lips that will be convenient the minister leaned across the table and filled another glass for himself this is indeed a game they played on for an hour slowly the place was emptying and the band beat more slowly the thick air grew less oppressive virginio sat dealing impassive hardly moving theopoulos sat with one arm around hйlиne and lounging in his seat smoking innumerable cigars pepita leaned both elbows on the table watching the game intently a glass beneath her hands at warrens side the pile of coloured chips grew steadily at last he paused msieur he said i am desolated but the fortune does not seem to be with you tonight would you prefer that we should stop by no means said the german we will go on for the honour of germany said warren softly it is as you wish msieur he turned to the minister i fear this must be infinitely boring msieur by no means said the laevatian thickly warren bowed for me he said looking at his watch i do not agree it is late it is not good to be awake beyond five oclock soon we must make an end if msieur will agree from now onwards we play only with the red counters the german nodded shortly pepita laughed tense and a little shrill i declare the english think of nothing but their beds in half an hour the pale light was visible around the edges of the curtains at the windows the band was silent the german got up suddenly from the table i will not go further warren nodded gravely as you wish msieur i am desolated that your fortune has been so unfavourable he turned to virginio and the count the croupier figured with a paper and pencil eighteen thousand and seven hundred dinars he passed the pad to theopoulos msieur le ministre perhaps would verify the account theopoulos yawned and leaned erect it is in order he said heavily eighteen thousand and seven hundred dinars from herr braum to msieur ouarren over nineteen hundred of your english sterling it makes a record for the gonea i will send a draft during the day said the german shortly he left them with a formal bow and went towards the entrance oudined in grey light the others followed him and dispersed in the chilly morning streets warren went back to his hotel and slept till midday then he got up and had a bath dressed carefully and went downstairs to lunch as he passed through the hall the porter handed him an envelope it contained herr braums cheque upon a berlin bank he slept again after lunch then walked by the river for an hour he dined alone and went to the gonea about ten oclock pepita came to him msieur is now satisfied but certainly it was well arranged that for tonight also i desire to make the party to play cards with m theopoulos i declare msieur it will be necessary to have care it will not be wise that you should win from m theopoulos he smiled mademoiselle you must be still one half asleep it is not my intention to win she pouted msieur i do not think you are an honest man i have sympathy for the poor herr braum he smiled again tonight then you may have sympathy for the poor m warren he stopped a waiter ask m virginio if he will visit us to take a glass of wine he went to meet the saturnine young man as he approached it was well arranged last night he said he passed an envelope to the other that i think will find itself in order eighteen hundred and seventysix dinars thirty cents the other bowed msieur is punctilious to keep a bargain it would not be possible to do business otherwise tonight also we will make the party yes this time again i wish to play with m theopoulos and to lose money assuredly i do not think that herr braum will accompany him tonight so for what reason one has said that herr braum today was received coldly today by the minister one has also said that this evening the minister has received m potiscu and mat for an hour they have discussed your business msieur warren nodded slowly that may be he went back to pepita presently they were joined again by hйlиne rita and virginio presently theopoulos arrived he came sauntering to their table warren rose to meet him this is indeed a pleasure msieur permit that i pour for you a glass of wine herr braum he is not with you tonight the minister shrugged his shoulders i do not know what has become of him perhaps he has returned to germany i was desolated at his bad fortune last night i wished to offer him the return game the minister chuckled i do not think msieur j that he would wish to play warren looked concerned then you should play for him msieur i won a large amount of money it is right that there should be the return game the game of pokki bank is governed much by chance it is impossible that chance should run in one way all the time the minister eyed him narrowly one would imagine so msieur but certainly we will play again this time perhaps i trim the pants from you is it not so i hope not msieur his hopes were unfulfilled when in the cold dawn the party finally broke up he owed the minister two thousand and seventyfive pounds sterling he rose from the table it is true msieur he said a little ruefully the luck does not run in the same way for two evenings running he produced a cheque book i can write you now my draft msieur or perhaps it would be more convenient if i obtain notes in dinars during the day the minister grasped him affectionately by the arm that will be the more convenient dear msieur ouarren he said silkily we are here in visgrad and an english cheque will not be so good but do not derange yourself in the afternoon at about five oclock we meet at the ministry to discuss the tank ships for the oil development warren nodded that will be a suitable occasion msieur i will obtain the notes by then he walked for a little in the town before returning to his hotel a few early oxcarts went creaking through the streets in the houses there was a faint stir of awakening life he stood for a few moments by the bridge over the river drawing long deep breaths the air was fresh after the staleness of the cabaret it was faintly aromatic perfumed with the dust the wood smoke pines and garlic of the town far to the north he thought of sharples grey and desolate in the same dawn bitterly idle well he said half to himself were on the way chapter eight the consul tapped his pincenez nervously upon the desk it was good of you to come down mr warren he began the ambassador wanted me to have a word with you oh yes the consul coughed the ambassador feels very strongly that it is the duty of the english community in visgrad to set an example of probity and correct behaviour in these balkan states he coughed again after all you will understand better than most of us that it is on those principles that our commercial prosperity is founded hadnt you better tell me what youre driving at its about those parties of yours at this night club the gonea mr warren the ambassador was not at all pleased when he heard about them warren nodded slowly im exceedingly sorry if they dont fit in with his ideas he said but i really dont see what its got to do with him the consulraised his eyebrows is it correct that on successive evenings you have won and lost sums up to two thousand pounds a night that is so well mr warren as of course you know the ambassador is the head of the british community in this country when a man as well recommended as you are arrives in visgrad and begins to gamble on that scale and if i may say so in the most dubious company it naturally engages the attention of the embassy and i may tell you frankly mr warren that the embassy dont like it there was a silence in the room you mean said warren that unless i mend my ways i shall no longer be persona grata at the embassy you put it very bluntly but well that is the gist of it that means the british government would withdraw their support theyd tell the laevatian government that theyd be wiser not to deal with me i cannot recall such a case but in the extreme the ambassador might decide to take that action warren smiled well he said you can tell the ambassador that im going to mend my ways i dont think it will be necessary for me to gamble on that scale again thats served its turn but i tell you im not going home without my order and you know how business is done out here as well as i do the consul sighed i know and thats what makes it difficult however ill tell the ambassador what you have said and i am sure he will be satisfied for three days warren worked for eighteen hours a day he engaged a sittingroom as an office and obtained the services of a stenographer he spent the business hours in conferences principally at the treasury the afternoons and evenings were spent in getting out new drafts for the next day before going to bed he dropped in for an hour at the gonea with pepita that was his sole diversion at the end of that time he had reached the point where he could go no further without consultation with the market in london he explained this to m potiscu at the treasury it is necessary that i return to london for a short time to explore the underwriting he said in french also i will arrange for the preparation of the plans of the tank ships for the ministry of marine in fifteen days i will return again in the meantime the cabinet will no doubt consider these the heads of our agreement he indicated the papers in his hand m potiscu small and rotund and very eastern said may you go in peace with the protection of allah warren bowed i thank you infinitely without the work which you have done msieur and the assistance which you have given our business could not have progressed so far you are most kind warren continued i wish you to know how deeply the group that i represent appreciate your assistance msieur it has occurred to me that perhaps there is some little thing that is not easily obtained in visgrad some present that i could bring back with me from london that would serve to indicate our gratitude m potiscu thought for a few moments always he said i have desired an umbrella with the handle all in jewels jewels of all colours blue and red and white and green and blue again of a green silk and with the stick all silver such umbrellas cannot be obtained in visgrad and i have desired one very greatly warren swallowed hard i am disappointed msieur that you have chosen so small a gift he said but you may rest assured the umbrella shall be of the best that london can produce if it is possible then to add one more thing said m potiscu rather rapidly you would bring from london a dozen bottles of your worcestershire sauce in the summer you understand the meat is sometimes not good warren left for london the next day travelling via berlin he landed at croydon at about nine oclock at night and drove up to his flat he went down to his office early in the morning and spent the forenoon clearing the arrears of his routine work for the afternoon he made an appointment with a firm of naval architects who came to see him he outlined to them the business of the oil tankers they discussed the proposition for an hour within limits he said we can sell them what we like but weve got to have a preliminary specification and a lot of drawings out within a fortnight and then one of you will have to come out with me to visgrad theres no difficulty in that he eyed them for a moment in the event of this business going through i take it that your firm would be prepared to make the whole of the detail drawings and take entire responsibility for the design i have in mind to build these vessels in a yard that has been closed down for a time i dont want to have to set up a design department of my own you need have no fears on that score mr warren we are very well accustomed to that class of work he nodded i know you are thats why i asked you to come along he got up from his desk all right ill write to you tonight confirming all this and you will get right on with the job they left him and he turned back to the consideration of a letter on his desk it read st marys hospital sharples northumberland de ar mr warren you asked me if i could let you know if i thought of anybody who could manage the yard ive been reluctant to make a suggestion because of course its not easy for a a oman to really appreciate how good a man is at his work but i thinly you might investigate mr grierson who is now an assistant manager with the clydeside ship and foundry company i have not seen him for about jour years he was an apprentice in our yard and after that he became an assistant manager i remember daddy telling me how well they all thought of him and that hed end up as a director he must be about thirtyeight years old nowv he got married seven or eight years ago not very long before we closed down i remember him chiefty because he was so tremendously energetic nobody could keep up with him he was very popular when he was here i am coming down to london for a few days on the ijth and shall be staying with my aunt at chichester avenue ealing i could see you then and tell you more about him if you are interested yours sincerely alice macmahon he reached out for the telephone and put in a call to the hospital in sharples it came in a few minutes he asked for the almoner he heard her voice miss macmahon speaking this is henry warren miss macmahon oh where are you speaking from are you in sharples no im speaking from london i got your letter im sorry i havent answered it before ive been abroad on business yes ive been in laevatia miss macmahon about your man grierson id like to meet him to have a talk with him he lives up on the clyde somewhere i suppose i think so do you know his address where i could get hold of him i cant tell you offhand i could find out and let you have it in tonights post that would do fine send it to the office you know my office address lisle court thats the one ive got isnt it where you used to work and they forward letters for you still thats right they didnt forward mine all right mr warren ill let you have that in tonights post does this mean that things are getting warm he laughed theyre getting so damned hot im pretty sure to burn my fingers you said in your letter youll be down in london next week will you come and lunch with me tdlove to mr warren what about tuesday that would do all right good tuesday at one oclock at the savoy ill meet you at the entrance to the grill room ill be there she laid down the receiver mr williams looked at her enquiringly was yon mr henry warren she nodded our own outofwork clerk im going to have lunch with him at the savoy he said mm and when youve filled him with intoxicating liquor ye can wheedle out of him the way we can save another half of one per cent upon the overdraft he mused a little i should have kenned he was a banker all the time nobody else would know them tricks in the morning warren went down to talk to mr heinroth he proposed to him the flotation of an issue of preference shares in the laevatian oil development a company in which the whole of the ordinary shares would be held by the laevatian government mr heinroth gave him a cigar and heard him attentively to the end youd never put it over with a name like that he said wants to be something short and snappy something that the country clergymen can remember i should call it laevol limited or something like that warren eyed him for a moment i dont look at it like that he said i dont put it forward in the trustee class but its better than that ive been out there for the last fortnight and in my opinion its sound in any case im making myself responsible for twentyfive per cent of the underwriting there was a silence mr heinroth looked at him attentively you are warren nodded there was another silence it might be possible to get the market round to it said mr heinroth at last the first reaction is bound to be unfavourable of course when we had that loan fiasco the year before last i thought that everything laevatian was dead for the next ten years theyre bound to bring that up you know warren nodded at the same time its potentially a rich country mr heinroth nodded slowly provided that the propositions good business i dont see why that loan should interfere with it there would have to be collateral security for the dividend of course and absolutely unimpeachable naturally ive got the profits on the state railway for that for the last ten years its been well in excess of the sum required to guarantee this dividend that sounds all right but i dont know they discussed it together for another hour at last warren got up to take his leave think it over he said and give me a ring in a couple of days id like to have your support in this because i think it may be the means of opening up development in general down there mr heinroth nodded wisely thats probably due well ill go round my corner of the market and see what the reaction is and you go round yours and then well have another talk mr heinroth slept on it and then put it to mr todd and mr castroni over the luncheon table if it was anybody else but warren he said frankly id have nothing to do with it after that loan was reputhated i swore i would never touch laevatia again but with warren behind it well it makes a difference mr castroni sipped his coffee in the last ten years ive been in most of warrens things he said when ive used my judgement and stayed out ive been sorry i know said mr heinroth i feel rather like that too the countrys just about due to be opened up said mr todd youve got to remember he did a good job with the waterworks out mere he knows what hes up to all right speaking for myself id go with him maslin said much the same said mr heinroth but i thought id like to know what you two thought about it that evening warren dined alone at his club in the smokingroom after dinner he saw lord cheriton sitting by himself he strolled over and dropped into a chair beside him evening said the young man i havent seen you here for some time been away warren nodded he selected a cigar carefully and poured out his coffee i got laid up soon after you had dinner at my place that night he said had to have an operation since then ive been abroad are things getting any better do you think warren shrugged his shoulders the reactions from this gold business have done a bit of good he said you cant say how long its going to last i dont see any sign of a general improvement yet pity warren glanced at himwhy i want a job youre not the only one they smoked in silence for a little then warren said chucking up the army the young man nodded what are you doing that for i want to do a spot of work before i get too old i dont mean selling motorcars or flying aeroplanes a real job that one could get ones teeth into theres nothing like that for me in the army no i suppose not after a time warren spoke again i was in northumberland a little time ago in sharples they told me at the local hospital about your mother what a lot she does for them the young man nodded thats not far from my home of course we own a lot of land around there that place sharples is in a terrible mess warren nodded the young man turned a little in his chair mind you it hasnt been like that always i remember it when i was a boy in the war when it was the devil of a place full ot work and the river full of ships they built a lot of destroyers there for the admiralty foreign governments too there were seven barlow destroyers at the battle of jutland so i heard said warren cheriton glanced at him curiously what took you to sharples warren did not answer for a minute then he said i was looking at the shipyard were you by jove are you going to do anything with it i dont know if anyone wants a packet of grief he can start building ships in a yard thats been empty for five years the other thought about it for a minute i suppose youre right at the same time thats the sort of job id like to be in on you would well of course that was always our family business you know warren nodded slowly remembering not sharples of course sunderland my father sold out from the sunderland yard in and after that he never touched shipbuilding again but that was where my grandfather made his money they smoked in silence for a little time i dont know if anything will come of this thing in sharples or not said warren in any case dont talk about it but if it should get along ill remember what youve said that is if youre really going to chuck the army i sent in my papers last month the young man turned to him id like nothing better than to get dug in to that if id be any good to you warren eyed him for a moment ill let you know within a month if theres anything developing up there or not he said a week later he was waiting in the lounge of the savoy grill room for miss macmahon she came to him punctually dressed quietly in grey he guided her to a table did you come up from ealing he enquired she nodded by the district railway ive been shopping all the morning he ordered lunch you said youd been in laevatia she reminded him was that on business he nodded i was in visgrad for a fortnight ive never been in the balkans are the people nice out there he shrugged his shoulders a man like me going on business never meets the real people if i had to judge the visgrad people by the ones ive met id say they were a lot of sewer rats but that may not be fair did you go out on shipping business not primarily that may arise out of it she eyed him steadily do you think theres any chance for us up there i honestly dont know but i promise you this im doing my best her eyes softened i knew youd be doing that lunch came to them i saw your man grierson on monday he said presently she laid her fork down where did you see him in glasgow did you go up there specially for that yes what did you think of him i liked him very well hell come to us when we want him you mean to barlows he nodded but isnt he in a good job now hell be in a better one if we start up again he wouldnt be so secure im not so sure of that he smiled thinking of the finances of the clydeside ship and foundry company but anyway hell take the risk of that upon the terms i offered him i believe he really wants to get back to sharples they all do that mr warren youll have no difficulty to get them back again once the yard starts up sharples was a jolly little town before before this happened to us everybody liked sharples he glanced at her curiously smiling a little i suppose it was always full of smoke and steam and raining all the time it wasnt she said defensively and anyway the towns up there are all like that but sharples was a nice size and people were happy there he said i know they continued with their lunch chatting of other things with the coffee she said ive been thinking a lot since last we met about what you told me of the difficulty of getting anyone to order the first ship he was silent do you see your way to get over that now he smiled i suppose i must mustnt i otherwise i wouldnt have gone to see grierson she coloured im so sorry she said a little stiffly i suppose thats confidential he smiled discreditable things are usually confidential he said i thought everybody knew that she stared at thim what do you mean he met her eyes do you think im an honest man of course i do well im not nor is anybody else who gets business out of laevatia he turned and called the waiter for the bill if youve got time this afternoon id like you to come with me ive got to do some shopping he paid the bill and they went out into the clamour of the strand he hailed a taxi where are we going to she asked he smiled old bond street he said to the driver conollys the jewellers you know on the righthand side they got into the cab the girl turned to him what are we going there for to buy an umbrella he said shortly she looked at him curiously but did not ask him any more questions he took her into the shop the manager came forward to meet them bowing a little everything is quite in order now mr warren he said quietly i think you will be satisfied this time warren nodded may i see it the manager spoke quickly to an assistant who vanished into the back regions the girl turned to warren this isnt an umbrella shop she said what is this all about the assistant returned bearing with him a red leather case some three feet long he handed it to the manager who laid it on a table in a shaft of sunlight he opened it the sun threw dazzling reflections from the jewels on the handle the silver stick the pale green silk lay there translucent shimmering the girl caught her breath but what a wonderful thing she exclaimed it is an umbrella isnt it certainly madam said the manager gravely he lifted it from the case undid the silk retaining band with delicate care and opened it warren took it from him and examined it critically thats all right now he said ill take it away with me you cleared the cheque the manager bowed everything is quite in order mr warren he took it from him and began to fold it it is a beautiful piece of work in its own style the maharajah of bitapore was visiting our workrooms yesterday and admired it very greatly he wished to buy it but i had to tell him that it was already sold it is for an oriental gentleman i suppose warren nodded that is so the umbrella was laid back on its bed of creamcoloured kid and the lid closed down the assistant hailed a taxi and the case was carried out and installed ceremoniously with them in the cab warren gave the address of his flat is that where you live asked the girl he nodded if you dont mind coming along ill take this thing up there in the flat he laid it on the table of his sittingroom the girl fingered the case may i see it again of course she lifted it from the case and opened it again the jewels gleamed brightly in the sunlight it really is a beautiful thing she said at last who is it for its for the treasurer of laevatia we should call him the chancellor of the exchequer opposite number to mr neville chamberlain she stood for a moment do you mean youre giving it to him as a present thats right quite a nice one isnt it it must have cost an awful lot of money about three hundred pounds is it because hes helping you to get an order for the ships yes its a bribe she looked uncomfortable ive heard about this sort of thing of course do you have to do a lot of it in your business ive never done it before she stared at him in wonder are you having to bribe anyone else he smiled one or two but we dont use the word bribe much we say satisfy them what else have you had to give lets see so far its about four thousand pounds in cash this umbrella and a case of worcester sauce she laid the umbrella down and turned towards the window you dont like doing this business mr warren do you no he said simply i dont it doesnt fit in with your reputation either what do you know about that she smiled we asked the auditors mr williams and i and they found out from london and told us who you were he stared at her you mean you got a confidential report on me she nodded it didnt say anything about bribing the chancellor of the exchequer i should hope it didnt she eyed him for a moment why are you doing all this mr warren because i want to see sharples get cracking again there was a silence i asked you to come and see this thing this afternoon he said because i wanted you to understand its not going to be very easy to get sharples going id go so far as to say it cant be done by ordinary business i told you that from the first i know she said quietly it cant be done in kid gloves nobodys going to get that yard working again and keep his hands clean there was a long silence after he said that the girl moved over to the window and stood looking out upon the traffic of the street below the sunlit pavements warren remained standing by the table he picked up the umbrella and rolled it and put it carefully in its case thats not very nice she said at last no but its true she turned towards the door i must be going on its been terribly good of you to give me lunch and tell me what you have mr warren thats nothing he said gravely but be discreet for a bit longer ill tell you when you may begin to talk about it in sharples she nodded i understand she turned to him and held out her hand goodbye and all the luck in the world he took her hand goodbye he said and stood for a few moments after she had gone then he went down to the office heinroth rang him up on the next day ive been going round about he said that laevatian government thing of yours its not an easy proposition as of course you know but theres a certain amount of interest after all if you like ill come along to you and we can have a talk how much can your lot write asked warren directly well thats what i wanted to talk about i should think another twentyfive per cent warren nodded come right along with what ive got were practically home upon the underwriting then he rang off and sat for a time in thought morgan his secretary slipped in the solicitors rang up while you were away he said they rang again this morning yes page and mayne they wanted to serve some papers i said that you would get in touch with them lord yes said warren ill do that at once he had forgotten all about his divorce chapter nine three days later his underwriting tentatively arranged warren left for visgrad via berlin by air in that three days he had registered the hawside ship and engineering company ltd with a nominal capital of one hundred pounds and seven clerks as its subscribers his own name did not appear he reached visgrad late one evening dined at his hotel and went out to the gonea pepita greeted him effusively msieur you are returned i declare i am very content it has been dull here in the evenings since msieur went back to london only a fat austrian who made a proposal so rude you understand msieur quite intolerable i have hit him on the face and broken his spectacles that must have been amusing mademoiselle she gave him one of her brilliant smiles he was so angry he has made complaint to the management but i have told them she leaned forward volubly i have told them i am artiste i do not sleep with the clientele it is not in my contract that he nodded quite right it would not be dignified for an artiste to be like a common girl she smiled again msieur you understand so well i declare i am very content that you have returned and msieur i have received a letter from sulina from the sister of the annunciation she has said that my little one has been enchanted with her presents and with the perambulator all day she has promenaded in the garden of the convent msieur to play that she was nurse you understand and msieur the sister has said that it has been necessary that the perambulator should be at the side of her bed so that she would sleep content it was well thought of that msieur warren said i am glad that i have been able to give so much happiness mademoiselle she nodded it was well thought of andvery kind msieur we have worked to remind m theopoulos and m potiscu of your business hйlиne virginio and myself it has not been allowed to rest because you have been in london msieur will be satisfied with the progress she hailed a waiter virginio ask him if he will come to msieur virginio came to them and bowed from the waist enchantй he said warren bowed a great pleasure permit me to offer you a glass of wine the dancer slipped into a seat pepita will have told you that our business has progressed msieur he said the good hйlиne has arranged with m theopoulos that the heads of your agreement were presented to the cabinet eight days ago and m potiscu has spoken for the treasury warren asked the cabinet has approved i declare msieur said pepita it would have made a situation quite insupportable if they had not approved i have said to all the world here you understand msieur in the gonea i have said to rita and to maria and to bertha the friend of m lutonski and to lorissa and to jeanne i have said to all the artistes who are accustomed to the company of a minister you understand msieur i have said that it is necessary that the cabinet should approve the business you will understand i have told them of your great kindness to my little one and all the world has agreed quite of one mind msieur it has been necessary that the cabinet should approve virginio said the ministers have agreed the heads of the agreement as presented by the commission msieur all is now in order for the final documents to be prepared granting to msieur the right to make the issue on those terms for three months it will be necessary however for the constitution of the board to be further discussed warren eyed him curiously you have good information of the business the other bowed slightly msieur need have no fear it is quite accurate warren stayed with them for an hour then left before the ministers arrived and went to his hotel next morning he went down to the treasury a long parcel tucked beneath his arm he laid it on the table in the office of the treasurer i have consulted with my colleagues he said to m potiscu after the preliminary courtesies they were quite desolated that you had asked so small a present to them and also to myself it has not seemed fitting that a man of such influence should receive a present only of an umbrella m potiscu smiled and made a deprecating gesture his eyes fixed upon the case in childlike eagerness warren continued but since that was your wish msieur we have resolved that the umbrella should be of the very best that london could produce never in the world msieur has there been such an umbrella before he opened the case the chancellor of the exchequer beamed with delight and reached for the handle no indian rajah said warren embarking on a flight of fancy has ever had an umbrella such as this one it is the finest that has ever been produced it cost he said instinctively doubling up no less than six hundred pounds the effect was all that he had hoped for the minister exclaimed with delight at the price opened the umbrella examined it held it above his head glancing furtively at the mirrror it is too kind he said and the worcestershire sauce also but certainly said warren i have had that sent direct to the residence of msieur from my hotel it was some time before he could get him down to business he left the treasury an hour later m potiscu was accommodating but inattentive and warren judged it better to leave him to the enjoyment of his present he went over to the english club and up into the smokingroom for a pink gin he found the air attachй there with the consul and an undersecretary they greeted him affably and stood him a drink hows london raining said warren heres luck the consul leaned towards him i understand your matter went before the cabinet the other night he said i hope it is progressing well warren nodded i was very pleased to see how well it had been going in my absence i had expected that it would have been at a standstill i think mr warren said the consul weightily you may have to thank his excellency for that i believe that he has expressed to m deleben that your proposals were viewed favourably by his majestys government warren nodded i am sure that must have had a great influence on the matter he said gravely the open window of the firstfloor smokingroom led on to a balcony overlooking the litescu the air attachй lounging by the window looking down into the street stiffened to attention good god he said come and take a load of this the others got up and looked out down the rotten pavement oq the other side of the street strutted m potiscu the umbrella held above his head as a sunshade the sun shone brilliantly upon the pale green silk the silver stick and shot bright coloured beams in all directions from the handle a small admiring crowd was following him its old potiscu said the air attachй whatever is that thing hes got asked the under secretary its an umbrella with a silver stick and just look at the handle they looked in silence as the treasurer passed by a very happy man where do you think he got that from blowed if i know looks as if it cost somebody a packet you mean somebodys slipped it him i wouldnt be surprised whos trying to get something out of him these days warren moved hastily towards the door i must be getting on see you in the bar tonight he left the club the air attachй looked after him and laughed did he slip that across the consul looked up startled oh i hope not very much his excellency would be very much upset if that were so never mind said the under secretary diplomatically perhaps it isnt the next fortnight passed in a welter of business warren was joined at his hotel by two members of the firm of naval architects they turnfcd a sittingroom into a drawing office to cater for the modifications to the oil tankers required by m theopoulos in addition to that side of the business there was the legal side after long consultation with the commercial secretary warren picked a small armenian jew to be his legal adviser mr pennington was careful to point out that he was not an honest man but opined that he was probably more honest than the rest warren reinforced him with a solicitor from london most evenings he went into the gonea and spent an hour with pepita he played polski bank with m theopoulos on two or three occasions losing about forty pounds each time the laevatian was unable to repeat his first epic coup he took pepita out again one sunday into the high mountains driven by a greek they drove all day among the pinewoods and the flowers relaxed and content once warren said you have saved one half of the hundred and fifty thousand francs which is your aim mademoiselle is it not so she nodded energetically it is now a little more than one half it is now possible for me to save more quickly you understand msieur one becomes known to the clientele when you have reached a hundred and fifty thousand francs you will retire from dancing mademoiselle but certainly it is not pleasant this life of moving always to a new place msieur that makes itself plain what will you do i shall go back to corsica to sulina it is my own place that is sulina a big town she shook her head no msieur not a big town it is in the south a town you understand where the houses are not separate compact standing as a block upon the hillside two kilos from the sea in the olive woods will you find much there to occupy you mademoiselle she shrugged her shoulders i declare msieur i do not care to be occupied all day my little one is there and there will be an occupation for me is it not so the sisters of the annunciation take care of my little one and that is good you understand msieur but it will be better that i shall take care of her for myself warren nodded perhaps she went on i shall teach the young girls how to dance she laughed suddenly perhaps she said i shall marry and then i shall grow fat she made an expressive morion with her hands to indicate an ample bust perhaps said warren i shall come one day to sulina to see how fat you have become and to see your little one and to drink champagne with you again she laughed but msieur we have no champagne in sulina not even greek champagne we have only our own wine which is pink in colour and very sour you would not like it msieur i assure you he smiled that we will see her face fell and she grew serious it will be necessary for us to wait for some years first she said it is insupportable that msieur to have to wait so long he patted her hand one must have courage mademoiselle he said she smiled that is necessary and it is necessary also to take exercise that one may not grow fat too soon let us stop the car msieur and walk a little in the woods he took her back to visgrad in the afternoon in time for her repose before the opening of the cabaret the business was drawing towards its climax the agreement was in draft form in two languages giving to warren the right to form the company upon certain terms defined in the agreement for a period of three months the order for the ships was incorporated in an appendix to the agreement as one of the terms agreed this document went into draft in seven successive stages banthed from lawyers to government and back again to lawyers it progressed however as well as could be expected glad im not that fellow warren said the air attachй works from nine in the morning till ten at night and then goes out to roister with theopoulos and potiscu a great life for them as likes that sort of thing quite suddenly it was finished warren sat back in his chair one evening and stared at the little jew ill take that amendment he said it doesnt mean anything anyway he stared at the little man thats the end then he said wonderingly you can go ahead and get that engrossed for signature now okay boss said the armenian warren went down next morning to see m potiscu the agreement is now being engrossed he said if it is suitable to you and to m theopoulos we could meet tomorrow afternoon at the british consulate to sign the documents the little rotund man before him bowed i will speak with m theopoulos i should be infinitely obliged a look of cunning crept into the stolid little face before him god thought warren whats coming now you will return at once to london after the signing asked the laevatian but certainly is it that i can do you any service mere the treasurer bowed i am infinitely obliged msieur it is the umbrella that your group were so kind as to send for me i have considered the matter and i find it is not quite what i require warren gazed at him dumbly perhaps msieur you would be so good as to return it to the shop and give me the six hundred pounds instead warren pulled himself together this was the culmination of the business he knew it and the laevatian knew it a false move now would dirow the business back for many months he bowed msieur he said it would give me the greatest pleasure i will arrange with the bank and tomorrow evening meet you with the notes in the gonea the little man beamed oilily you are so kind and the umbrella perhaps you would bc so good as to have it sent to my hotel msieur he never saw it again m potiscu said that somebody in the hotel must have stolen it it was a pity next day with some ceremony the documents received their signatures in the office of the consul being signed on british territory in theory his excellency will be very pleased that this is satisfactorily arranged remarked the consul after it was over and the ministers had gone we like to do everything we can to help on british trade perhaps you would tell his excellency said warren gravely that without his help i could not have concluded the deal i am very deeply grateful for all his assistance he may have been but he went back to his hotel and booked a passage on the morning service to berlin and then did his packing he tore up a great amount of paper drafts of various agreements and burned the pieces in the grate then he went down and dined alone and went out to the gonea that evening he played polski bank again for the last time with theopoulos and assisted by virginio lost twenty pounds to keep him sweet for the future in a dark corner he gave six hundred pounds in dinars to potiscu in another dark corner he gave two pounds to virginio commission on theopoulos quite openly he gave a bracelet to hйlиne worth about twenty pounds the grey dawn was showing round the edges of the curtains before he had an opportunity to speak to pepita alone mademoiselle he said this is the end i go back to my own country in an hour or two and i do not expect to return for many months perhaps if all goes well for years she nodded for me also there will be a change today i have received from smyrna the offer of an appointment a good offer msieur that one must not refuse you understand i have been twice in smyrna before and now i am artiste known to the clientele one can demand a good engagement so do you like smyrna mademoiselle she shrugged her shoulders it is as good as visgrad it is not gay like athens or even istanbul but the engagement is a good one and one will save money he eyed her for a moment mademoiselle he said without your aid i could not have succeeded in my business i should have departed for england if you had not introduced me to theopoulos she laughed merrily the english they get sleepy too soon it is droll that she laid her hand upon his own msieur i am glad that you have been successful in your business i declare i am happy that i have been able to keep you from your bed that night and to help the meeting with the minister msieur you were kind to my little one and that sort of kindness one does not forget he smiled mademoiselle i know mat you seek no reward for what you did nevertheless without your aid the business could not have been done he produced an envelope from his breast pocket mademoiselle in a big business such as the one mat i have now concluded here it is possible to pay commission for the help that is received one more drop to the bucket will not greatly matter when the scale of the business is considered he handed her the envelope you should take this to the credit lyonnais in the litescu he said they will arrange for the money to be paid in corsica without difficulty of the exchange she dropped her eyes msieur you are too kind it was not for this that i have tried to help you i know that mademoiselle he said she tucked the envelope unopened into her bag we will dance once more msieur she said that afternoon she left the little hotel where she lived and went walking through the town in a blaze of passion she was a shade too elegantly dressed as ever she tripped along on her high patentleather heels her face aflame she turned into the french bank in the litescu she stormed up to the counter and flung a slip of paper at the clerk this draft it is not good she enquired scornfully one makes a mock of me ah i declare it is insupportable that nonchalantly the clerk picked up the slip of paper and unfolded it impassively he studied it one moment mademoiselle he said and retired to the back regions she was a little damped by his indifference i declare i will not wait to be insulted once again she exclaimed it is not right that one should treat me so in the bank nobody paid the slightest attention to her outburst she remained by the counter tapping one foot irritably upon the floor the clerk returned you deceive yourself mademoiselle he said courteously this is a cheque of the english financier msieur ouarren value seventyfive thousand francs french we have special instructions to receive this cheque it is in order perfectly she gripped the counter and stood staring at the cheque fascinated ten thousand pardons she said at last in a low tone i thought that one had mocked himself of me slowly she raised her head and stood there staring down the marble hall towards the door wide open in the sun outside across the dusty street there was a gap between the houses she could see the hill behind the town rising in folds to the high mountains bluegrey with olive woods there would be little farms up there with cobbled paths and small walled pastures there would be terraced gardens for the vines and for the flowers the roses the carnations and mimosa it would be like that in sulina chapter ten a fortnight later mr donald grierson came to sharples he had spent the previous day in london with warren he was a redhaired burly man of good northcountry stock about forty years of age energetic and outspoken oh aye he said they let me go all right the clydeside arent that full of work mind they wanted to know what i was going to but i didnt let on warren asked have you been in sharples recently grierson shook his head i was there four years back not since they tell me things is very bad in sharples warren nodded now let me show you what ive done so far grierson laid his hand upon a heavy roll these are the plans they worked on steadily all through the day at the end of it grierson faced him across the table well mr warren he said thoughtfully id like you to know how it all strikes me before i go up north on to the job the way well understand each other from the start he drew through a dead pipe between his teeth the architects are good and the designs are good youve been well advised there and the price youve got well in the clydeside today wed reckon that a fair price that youd not lose much on any road youve done a good job getting those ships at that price mr warren he smiled broadly td like to know how it was done he continued and your progress payments scheme is none so bad though id rather have seen a bit more on the materials you need have no fear about the ships themselves theyll be good sound ships before ever they leave the yard but whether well build them at a profit that i very much doubt warren nodded slowly in my opinion mr warren said the manager evenly youd better budget for a fiftythousand loss on the three ships so much as that i think so mr warren mind you dont think im setting up an alibi right from the start but look at it fair four hundred and twenty thousand pounds of work at what in normal times wed reckon a cut price although its none so bad these days and starting from a yard thats dead stone dead and derelict its not reasonable to expect a profit mr warren were going to lose money at the start and id say that it would be the thick end of that sum before were cracking as a proper yard again warren smiled slowly well go to it he replied make it as little as you can the manager got to his feet you can depend upon it that well do that he said and now with your leave ill go and get a bite of something to eat and men ill get along to kings cross time i was on the job he got to sharples early the next day and walked down from the station to the bulls head carrying his bag once or twice he saw a man he recognized and gave a friendly nod his heart sank at me aspect of the town there was no life no spirit in the place it was with a serious face that he rang the bell of the hotel a slatternly girl came and unbolted the door mr hancock home he asked aye she said hes within will ye step inside the landlord came lumbering into the hall eh mr hancock you remember me i want a room for a few nights till i can get fixed up im working here from now on the landlord greeted him warmly sit ye down an let me draw ye a can o bitter an tell me what brings ye back to sharples he exclaimed sit ye right down id rather have a mug of tea if its the same to you in half an hour he had learned a great deal about sharples and it was with a more thoughtful face than ever that he walked down to the yard he routed out the watchman robbins from his hut you remember me he said grierson my name i remember you when i was working here in the stores werent you i mind your face im the new manager youve had a letter oh aye the old man quavered a letter come yesterday i told the missus i said i couldnt make head nor tail of it i said grierson eyed him critically and his heart sank again even the watchman was too old to be of any real service he was starting from absolutely nothing well he said quietly im manager here from now on robbins get the offices opened up this afternoon and get a room cleaned up for me ill go in mr drews old room for the time being he took the old mans keys and started on a tour of inspection of the yard notebook in hand it took him two hours and a half at the end of that time he had been in every store and shed and had filled three pages of his book then he went down to the labour exchange within a quarter of an hour the town was in a ferment the news spread from the door carried on running feet that mr grierson was within him as was under mr drew and they were taking on a ganger and ten men for labouring down at the yard by the time it had run through the town as far as pilgrim street it was to the effect that barlows had got a good order for ships mr drew and mr grierson were in the town and fifty men were needed at the labour exchange at once by the time it got to the top of the town it seemed that two hundred skilled men were required specially platers the town became revitalized that afternoon awoke to running life men struggled into jackets crammed their caps upon their heads and went swarming down the hill to the exchange wives routed out the stayathomes the pessimists and sent them packing off to join the throng outside the doors of the exchange the crowd swelled to over a thousand men filling the street and waiting patiently for news grierson coming out of the side door after an hours conference with the manager of the exchange was surrounded and besieged by questions he hesitated for a moment then fought his way to the main steps of the exchange on the steps he stood above them visible to everyone now see here lads he said ive come back here as manager of barlows yard only its not barlows any longer its been taken over as a new company dont ask me what were going to build because i dont rightly know myself and if i did i wouldnt be able to tell you a voice cried out anxiously will ye be needing platers mister the speaker was jostled into silence by his mates the manager laughed and some of the men laughed with him go easy lad he said we got to get an order for a ship before we start and plate her im hopeful we may get an order but we havent got one yet soon as we do well be needing platers fitters riveters joiners all sorts at present ive taken on ten men for cleaning up the yard and getting straight and therell be no more needed for a while itll be no good anyone coming to the gate or writing letters to the company because im taking on through the exchange thats fair to everyone now get along back home to your teas and dont come pestering me cos i know nothing more than what ive told you he came down from the steps pushed his way through them and went back to the yard the men stood about in little groups for an hour or more slowly dispersing to their homes the news got to the hospital as soon as anywhere it came no doubt from the outpatients it went flowing through the cold stone corridors into the wards in the childrens ward it came from a nurse to sister who passed it on to miss macmahon nurse says theres something happening in the town said sister something about barlows starting up again at the words something seemed to turn over inside the almoner she straightened up above the cot and stared at the sister that thats splendid news she said uncertainly to the sisters astonishment she was blushing do you know any more the nurse said they were saying down in outpatients something about a mr grierson being in charge some name like that would that be billy grierson that was enquired the sister thoughtfully i wonder if theres any truth in it miss macmahon left the childrens ward and went down to the office she found mr williams there alone theyre saying in the ward mat the yards starting up again she exclaimedis it true he laid down his pen aye he said cautiously i did hear something about it theyre saying mr griersons back and taken on ten men down at the yard she said its wonderful he eyed her dourly thisll be something of your mr warren and his wurrk nae doubt he noted her flushed face and bright eyes it might be but he never told me it would be so soon ah weel said the secretary maybe yell get him better trained one day next day the work of cleaning up the yard began grierson deep in work of every sort found time to keep an eye on his ten labourers and what he saw displeased him very much in the late afternoon he called the ganger to him yell have to get your men working better than this or yere no ganger for me he said brusquely but not unkindly lord love you man theres not a days work done among the lot of them the man agreed its no a good days work im feared theyre terrible soft but theyre wanting to please you go easy with them for a week mr grierson and yell see a big difference ill be needing to said grierson grimly the man hesitated i was wondering mr grierson if yed consider paying by the day the first week oy two and not wait till the weekend the way theyd get a better dinner this first week the manager thought quickly precedent was everything in a shipyard he could let himself in for endless trouble if he made a false move at the start but the request was reasonable the man could not do heavy work on a starvation thet ill no do that he said this first week ill give each man two bob a day out of my own pocket as a gift not wages and ill look to you to see its spent on food not beer his eye strayed across the yard now get along and jerk em up a bit look at that big chap there wheeling that barrowload of stuff whats his name mccoy sir god love us man he might be going to his own funeral he turned back to his office disheartened he had not reckoned in his costs that he would have to feed his men up before setting them to work two days later he wrote his views to warren in london as regards the labour here the position is very bad and we should realize it i have ten men clearing up the yard and putting the slips in order as stated in my last letter but not one of these is fit for a proper days work they are very soft and there is no strength in them i have laid off two and replaced them but the new ones are as bad these are labourers of course but i think we shall find the tradesmen will be just the same i do not think there is a man in the town that is fit for a real days work l am now getting very worried about the fifty thousand pound loss that i told you when i was in london unless we can get some decent labour to work with that figure will be very much increased i would like to talk this over with you before you definitely decide to put the order with this yard as i do not want you to feel that i have been leading you astray warren received this letter in his office the next day he read it twice with a grim face then put it in a drawer of his desk one didnt want to have that sort of letter floating round the office before a public issue he reached out to the telephone and put in a call to the yard five minutes later he was speaking to grierson ill get down to newcasde on friday night late can you arrange to pick me up at the hotel on saturday morning and drive me out to sharples ill call for you myself in my own car mr warren ill be right glad to have a crack with you about the yard warren laid down the receiver and sat for a few minutes in deep thought then he reached out for a sheet ot private notepaper and wrote dear miss macmahon i shall be in sharples on saturday morning at the yard would you care to lunch with me i dont know where one does lunch in sharples or if you would be free to lunch in newcastle but if you would give me a ring at the yard we might be able to fix something up yours sincerely henry warren he posted this and turned again to the set up of laevol ltd the sticking point in that lay in the collateral security for dividend without such a security the company would be purely speculative and quite unlikely to secure support even the most hardened speculator would fight shy of a gamble in laevatia preferring to do his gambling against unloaded dice the collateral security that he had got upon the profits of the state railway removed the issue from the speculative class and put it if not in among the trustee stock at any rate into the realms of serious business he had negotiated an agreement signed and sealed in visgrad between laevol ltd and the laevatian government pledging the profit of the railway to support the laevol dividend but this agreement between a governmentcontrolled company and the government had not of course been signed on british territory and was subject to the laws of laevatia and as warren very well knew the laws of laevatia were laws unto themselves it would look all right in the prospectus of course he was not worried about that the dangers that he knew existed lay concealed too deep in the legal system of laevatia for any solicitor connected with the issue in london to be likely to unearth them it probably would be allright in fact so long as all went according to plan anyway there was nothing to be done about it now the whole thing was a pretty rocky deal that would bc carried on in his name alone and he would have to see it through he turned again to the wording of the prospectus he worked on that all day with the solicitors had it printed overnight and circulated to the underwriters and spent the next day deep in conference with them plumberg came back to talk to him again of silver and heinroths cousin over from paris with a finn demanded his attention for three days he did not leave the office before nine at night he freed himself on friday afternoon and caught the train to newcastle he slept at the hotel indifferently and greeted his manager after an early breakfast together they drove out upon the sharples road tm right glad youve been able to get down said grierson its proper that you should see for yourself the way things stand they reached the yard and went into the office for some time grierson outlined the work that he was doing in the yard in preparation for the order then he came to bis main point its the men im worried about mr warren i can see my way in everything but that warren nodded i know he said i got your letter tell me what the trouble is exactly theyve got no stamina mr warren i never saw such its on account of sharples being a small town i think most places on the clyde or that a man would maybe get a spell of work now and again in one yard or the other he wouldnt be out of work continuous if you take my meaning but here theres been no other yard to go to all these men here have been out of work five and a half years and theyve not got the strength i tell you mr warren were going to have a job to get the work from them that youve a right to expect warren got up and went to the window the manager came and stood beside him look at that chap there now handling that baulk of stuff did you ever see aught like it they stood for a few minutes looking out into the yard then warren turned back to the room ive known of this he said before you told me he looked the other in the eyes at the same time i mean to get things started here again he dropped into a chair by the table tell me this suppose we go ahead now and build these ships and more ships after them maybe well lose a lot of money you will that in two years from the start how will we be then the men will have had two years of steady work regular food and beer will we still be working at a disadvantage then compared with other yards the manager thought for a long time before answering no he said at last id not say that we will two years is long enough for a man to get back his skill and strength if hes ever going to mind theres some fortyfive and fifty years old thatll never come back to work again after five years idleness but in two years time i think we could compete in price mr warren after all its a handy size this yard and itd not take a great deal of work to meet our overhead but itll be two years of bloody grief he said warren nodded still i think well go ahead you should have your order by the end of the month and be able to get started ordering materials well want sufficient capital to see us through but ill look after that the manager smiled its as you say mind youll have a bonny little business if you can carry it through sharples folk were aye good folk to work before the slump came and this yard showed a profit every year soon as we get on to our feet he said we want to try and get back on to admiralty work again thats where the yard used to make its profit there was seven barlow destroyers at the battle of jutland mr warren did ye ever hear that they went out and spent some time in going round the yard warren noticed a considerable difference since he had last seen it the piles of scrap were cleared away the fence had been repaired the berths were orderly youre getting it in shape all right he said aye said the manager but theres a lot to do yet before we can start an build he glanced across the yard critically beside the hydraulic guillotine he saw a woman coming towards them picking her way delicately through the yard yons miss macmahon he said her thats working at the hospital her father was solicitor to barlows warren nodded i think shes come for me they walked to meet her she greeted them both equally to grierson she said that man harringtons got a poisoned hand itll be some time before he works again the manager turned aside he was only on for three days he said resentfully theyre ower delicate these folks give them a chance she said theyre bursting with anxiety to get to work aye an then when you set them to work they go off sick i know theyre willing miss macmahon but you cant build ships with nothing but good wishes theyll harden up aye he said we must do the best we can with the material weve got she turned to warren ive got lunch for you in my room up at the hospital she said is that all right theres really nowhere else that you could go except the bulls head and thats not much he smiled thats very kind of you he said he turned again to grierson and had a final word or two with him then left the yard with the girl and went walking up towards the hospital you cant imagine what this little bit of work thats going on here now has meant she told him its psychological everybodys talking now about the yard and what the chances are of work again its helped the place enormously he wrinkled his brows just by giving them something to look forward to she nodded its been terrible this year she said gravely you know how it is when someones desperately ill for days they may keep cheerful hanging on and then one day they let go just dont care any more and you know theyre sinking then that theyll never get back she turned to him thats what its been like in sharples all this year mr warren theyve been sinking i honestly believe she said that if youd come along this time next year you wouldnt have been able to do anything at all in sharples weve got a bad enough job now he said grimly they went into the hospital in the front hall they passed the matron round and rubicund she smiled at them and warren stopped and spoke to her she beamed your lunch is ready she said to them ive just been along and its quite ready for you when you want it thats very kind of you he said i didnt mean to give you the trouble hoots mr warren dials no trouble youre welcome to it any time that youre in sharples ive been thinking the hotel accommodations none so good in sharples just now i can always fit you up with a bed here if at any time you want to stay the night youll have to pay for that said the almoner thats my end of the business any time you like said the matron just let us have a card she left them and they went on down the passage to the almoners room where lunch was spread upon the table by the fire a ward maid waited on them how long have you been back from visgrad asked the girl getting on for a month i was out there for about a fortnight after we had lunch together she smiled did you take out the umbrella with you he nodded and it worked i got what i wanted the right to float the business on the london market she wrinkled her brows does that mean orders for ships broadly speaking it does if that issue goes all right and i have no doubt that it will it means that the company laevol ltd will have to order tankers will they be ordered from us here ive arranged for that she stared into the fire its wonderful she said quietly the change that it will mean to everything i cant get used to the idea he smiled that isnt quite the end of the story the next thing is weve got to get some capital for the yard to work with to finance the order and for new equipment and machinery that means another issue she wrinkled her brows again you mean because of the order from laevol youll be able to get in more money to capitalize the yard thats it broadly they went on with their lunch talking of sharples of the yard and of the hospital and presently she said about this new company laevol ltd mr warren id like to take up some shares in it if i may i had a legacy the other day so ive got a little money to invest now he did not answer for a minute then he said how much did you think of putting into it about five hundred pounds she hesitated and then said could you arrange that for me he shook his head smiling no i couldnt but why not he eyed her for a moment i wouldnt play about with foreign industrials if i were you he said leave that to the people who make a study of that sort of thing the big corporations and insurance companies she met his eyes but youre offering the shares to people like me arent you thats a matter of form he said easily theres only one way to make a public issue and thats to offer it to the public but the bulk of this issue will be taken up by the investment corporations she said i see i think you might split your five hundred into two lots he remarked if youll let me look into it when i get back to town i can let you have details of a couple of sound investments that will give you a safe dividend and a slow capital appreciation then you could tell your bank to buy the shares or if you like ill handle it for you she turned and faced him you mustnt take that trouble mr warren she said evenly i havent got any money to invest really i only asked you that because i wanted to know what you really thought of laevol ltd there was a little silence well he said heavily you know that now lets have our coffee by the fire she said gently the maid can clear the table then she made him sit in the armchair and poured out coffee for him im sorry i did that she said at last and smiled at him it was mean but since we had that talk in london in your rooms ive known that things werent right i felt then that you hated the whole thing you do dont you he sat there in the chair before the fire and sipped his coffee its autumn now he said at last i told you in the spring that i would get this place going again that day we went to see the mine and im doing it you dont imagine i hate doing that do you no she said wonderingly i dont he went on half to himself in my sort of business its not very easy to see clearly what ones working for a young man works to make money or to get married he raised his headyou know that im divorcing my wife yes she said quietly i know that well one gets to a stage later on in life when the things one used to work for dont quite fit ive got all the money i could ever want to use and its when you get tb my age that you begin to wonder what in hell you go on working for what you expect to get out of it there was a silence she did not interrupt and presently he went on one cant just give up working and do nothing and so ones got to find a motive an excuse for going on doing the job one knows i had time to think about all this when i was here in hospital i was right away from it then able to see my job from the outside and it seemed to me then as it does nowthat theres only one thing really worth working for in the city thats to create work i dont know if youve ever thought about machines he said every machine mats put into a factory displaces labour thats a very old story of course the man whos put to work the machine isnt any better off than he was before the three men that are thrown out of a job are very much worse off but the cure isnt socialism or if it is im too much of a capitalist myself to see it the cure is for somebody to buckle to and make a job for the three men i believe that mats the thing most worth doing in this modern world he said quietly to create jobs that men can work at and bc proud of and make money by their work theres no dignity no decency or health today for men that havent got a job all other things depend on work today without work men are utterly undone he had been speaking so softly that she had to strain to hear what he was saying now he was silent for a very long time at last he raised his head you asked me about laevol laevols a rotten company but you know that already she stirred in her chair how is it rotten its like an apple with a worm in it it looks all right outside if the worms got into the core you may be able to eat the whole apple and never know its there alternatively you may find half of him after the first bite she smiled faintly i see you mean its not a very reliable company that is so but nobody knows just whats wrong with it but me and you cant put it right he shook his head its all set now ive got all the underwriting contracts in youll see the prospectus advertised next friday in the papers it goes to the public on tuesday following the issues going to be a great success what happens after that he lit a cigarette after that the first thing laevol does is to place its order for the ships three oil tankers the hawside ship and engineering company takes that order and glad to get it she exclaimed hawside did you call the company after our little river here the haws he nodded as good a name as any other i never put much weight on names myself she wrinkled her brows is that the company thats going to work here then he nodded blowing out a cloud of smoke the hawside company was registered some weeks ago i sold the yard to them the other day on paper you might say that the hawside company is here already she stared at him wonderingly but but what does the company consist of he smiled seven clerks with a one pound share each my own accountant is the secretary the shareholders havent elected a board yet its got a capital of one hundred pounds but thats not all paid up of course is that the company thats going to build the ships he nodded thats right its going to suffer a sea change next week into something rich and strange as you might say its going to print itself a lot more shares and its going to acquire a board im going to be chairman and what happens then then its ready to take the laevol order for the oil tankers four hundred and fifty thousand pounds worth of work it wont have any money to build them with of course so it goes to the public with its new shares and makes an issue for five hundred thousand pounds then it gets down to work and builds the ships she eyed him steadily is a company of that sort going to be all right he passed his hand across his eyes a little wearily its going to be as right as i can make it i cant say more than that it will have money and an order to work at good premises a good secretary and mr grierson im going to be chairman myself to stand by the company for the first year or two if i bring that to sharples ill have done the best i can to get things started here again she laid her hand impulsively upon his arm dont think im criticizing what youve done youd have a right to he replied its not a very bright setup and im not proud of it but to get anything at all to start up in the middle of a slump like this is difficult ive done the best i can youll get some work in sharples for a time at any rate the hawside company hasnt got a worm he smiled and shook his head you neednt worry about that when that gets going it depends upon itself alone it may lose money at the start i think it will but therell be no trickery in it that you need fear no conjuring with cards or umbrellas she turned and faced him and this is really going to happen were going to have a company established here with four hundred and fifty thousand pounds worth of work and a capital of five hundred thousand he nodded you can count on that within two months from now after that weve got to tackle the rolling mills and see if we can get them started up again she eyed him steadily youve done a very splendid thing she said i knew that somebody would come to help us it must give you a great feeling of satisfaction to have done all this he smiled i suppose it ought to he said quietly ive been too tired to think about it much chapter eleven the laevol issue on the whole was well received the financial argus described is as an interesting issue designed to develop the great natural resources of the balkans launched under the most favourable auspices the daily toiler referred to it as financial chicanery sponsored by the government in a futile attempt to bolster up an outworn capitalist regime in laevatia in warrens view the quite unfounded reference to the government in the latter excerpt was as great an asset to the issue as the restrained benediction of the argus in any event the issue was oversubscribed three times get going on this right away said warren to morgan i want an analysis of the applications by friday ive fixed the allotment committee for monday morning see if you can think of some formula to squeeze out the little chaps his secretary glanced at him curiously ill do my best to get out something sir you would like to eliminate the small investor so far as possible warren nodded get them right out of it they were got out of it by more or less questionable devices and to their own exceeding discontent a number of letters reached the company voicing their grievance amongst them six pages from canon wardstephenson of the nook shorehamonsea it appeared that the canon had applied for six hundred one pound shares and had been allotted sixty he threatened legal action the threat being accepted he approached mr castroni with whom he had a slight acquaintance for his intervention in the matter mr castroni rang up mr warren of course said warren easily i felt myself that the allotment committee were perhaps a little hard on the smaller subscribers if hes really very anxious i daresay i could get him five hundred privately at par thats very good of you said mr castroni hes a cantankerous old man and we dont want any bother warren rang off and sat for a minute marvelling at the simple cupidity of the religious orders then he turned to the consideration of the hawside ship and engineering company ltd the increase of the capital was in the hands of his solicitors within the next few days he had to form his board he reached out for the telephone and asked lord cheriton to lunch with him over the cheese he said ive got a job for you and told him of the hawside ship and engineering company im going to take the chair id like it if youd come upon the board the young man flushed with pleasure id like nothing better as you know but id want to work at any business i go into not just attend a meeting once a month warren nodded thats what i want you for i cant be up in sharples all the time myself ive got to keep things spinning round down here i want you to be vicechairman and work in the business the other frowned i dont want to be a passenger and theres one small point you seem to have forgotten i dont know anything about building ships i know but ive got to have someone there that i can trust who can make a team out of the staff im going to take on and with your position in the county the company will have prestige that it will need in the difficult years at first the other grinned pull my weight as a figurehead until ive learned to talk sense about the business all right im on i never thought id earn my living as a guineapig he paused but who is going to build the ships wed better get in somebody one man at any rate who knows something about the job just for the sake of appearances what i mean the public will expect it warren laughed and told him about grierson then ive got a really good man jenkins for a secretary he said grierson has his staff pretty well planned its all further advanced than you think he considered for a minute im going to put grierson on the board he said as managing director as soon as im sure of him in six months time perhaps its a pity we cant do it now but i wouldnt take the chance until we know him better that means going to the public without much technical strength on the board make the underwriting difficult well have to meet that point cheriton said i could put it up to old sir david hogan warren mused hes a very good name the public would like that but he was a shipowner wasnt he not a builder i believe hed jump at it all the same i daresay how old is he seventythree but hes still hale and hearty hed like it from the point of view of getting something done for sharples its a good idea that said warren let me think about it for a day two days later his board complete warren set about his underwriting contracts heinroth wagged his head i cant tell what to make of you warren he said its second sight or something i thought that last laevatian thing of yours would leave us all stuck in the soup and it was taken up three times but still old boy a shipyard in these days i wouldnt pick that for a winner on my own do as you like said warren equably im in it up to the neck myself and not for a squashed sausage either mr heinroth eyed him narrowly you think were on the turn i suppose stick to the business in hand said warren do you want any of this thing til take a walk around said mr heinroth give you a tinklelater on this afternoon he took his walk around to mr castroni and to mr todd ive given up using my own judgement said mr todd resignedly ill take twentyfive thousand if thats what youre doing i believe that laevol thing went off on warrens name alone you know this onell do the same said mr castroni i never mind much what the issue is so long as its handled right and that mans never made a bloomer yet mr heinroth gave his tinkle satisfactorily other people did the same in three days the underwriting was satisfactorily arranged warren rang up grierson in sharples were all set now he said youd better come up here tomorrow and stay while we make the contract with laevol they laboured for a week upon the various contracts necessary before the hawside ship and engineering company went to the public for subscription then grierson went back to the yard with jenkins the new secretary he called his nucleus of foremen together in his office well lads he said weve got three ships to build oil tankers of ten thousand tons you know what that means to sharples and you can thank mr warren for it and nobody else just you remember that and another thing theres work for eighteen months in these three ships but if they are not built at a profit theres an end of it because the yardll be bust again just keep that in your nappers if we want more work after this lots over weve got to get these ships out cheap the foreman riveter said thats a bloody fact the others grunted inarticulately one said will we be able to tell this in the town now mr grierson he nodded aye the cats out of the bag now materials are all on order and plates due here next week theres a plan of the ships that you can see on mr sanders board up in the drawing office now get along with you and start to reckon what youll want be back here for a meeting at three oclock well dae our best mr gricrson said one awkwardly eh but its a grand oppaortoonity for the toon they filed out of the office that week appendicitis removed miss sale warrens personal stenographer from his business in the final drafting of the prospectus of the hawside ship and engineering company he was compelled to use a new exotic acquisition of the firm miss ffolliotjohnson he did not know where miss ffolliotjohnson had come from within a couple of hours he was past caring where she went he rang the buzzer for morgan youd better fire that girl he said sharply i dont want to see her here again shes no damn good to us she cant write english she cant spell she cant type and she stinks like a drain get her out of the place at once it was of course unfortunate that the door was open and every word he said could be heard in the main office with that contretempts the prospectus was drafted to his satisfaction and the satisfaction of the underwriters knowing the moods of the investing public he paid special attention to the paragraph about prospective profits he wrote the orders which are now in hand are taken at a price which should be profitable after allowing an ample margin for contingencies these orders will not be completed in the first financial year it is anticipated that the profit on the work completed in the second year will be sufficient to permit a dividend appropriate to the two years of working morgan read this with an impassive face a little definite sir is it not warren shrugged his shoulders we shant get underwriting for it otherwise i dont think theres anything wrong with that youve got to commit yourself these days if an industrial issue is to be put over at all the secretary said no more cheriton passed it without comment sir david hogan passed it with the observation in writing as regards the profits one can only trust to the technical staff i understand that you have checked their estimates in detail and as no one can do more i am content to let the prospectus go forward in its present form indeed i think it is a very good one and i see no reason why we should not make this company a great success warren sat for a long time motionless this letter in his hand before him on his desk lay the acceptance notes of underwriting neat in a file he now had only to send the prospectus to the printers and set in hand the distribution to the banks and stockbrokers he buzzed for morgan im going out he said til be back after lunch he felt the need of exercise to clear his mind he took a taxi to the house guards parade dismissed it and began to walk along beside the lake half consciously he was looking for a sign it was a raw november day upon the bridge that spans the lake a few children with their nursemaids were feeding the ducks with bread children of means warmly attired in new clean overcoats and little scarves flushed with excitement such children as he might have had himself he passed them and went on across the mall and on through the green park towards hyde park corner walking with nervous haste uneasy and irresolute he crossed the corner and went through tie gates into hyde park and walked for a time westwards towards the serpentine and presently a little tired and footsore in his city shoes he dropped down on to a park seat facing the lake at the other end of the seat there was a man shabby and motionless without an overcoat warren sat for a time staring out over the lake half consciously he took out his cigarette case and lit a cigarette with his lighter he exhaled a long blue cloud soothing his worried nerves he became aware that the man at the far end of the seat was watching him hungrily he offered his case cigarette dont mind if i do said the man awkwardly warren leaned across and lit it for him as he did so for a moment he stuthed the lean sensitive face the capable sinewy hands the rotten boots they smoked in silence for a time out of a job asked warren the other nodded without speaking long eleven months whats your job cabinet maker i was in the furniture trade bad luck the man said very quietly all very well to say bad luck but youve got a home and that its seven months now since i saw my wife i wish that i was dead he got up and walked away warren sat for a time and watched him till he disappeared then he flung his cigarette into the lake walked down towards the albert hall and took a taxi to the city you can get these printed right away he said to morgan the issue is on tuesday week this time the issue was more doubtfully received the argus said whether the present can be regarded as a fit time for a shipyard issue must remain a matter for debate as must the prospects of the company in spite of the prospectus statements the names upon the board are good however and with the initial orders in hand the company may well be carried to success the daily toiler struck a different note while we cannot but deplore the system of finance which governs industry in the country we welcome the establishment of more employment on the northeast coast this issue will bring much relief to sharples and for that reason we recommend it to our readers which as mr heinroth ruefully observed was not a great relief to him mr grierson received a copy of the prospectus in his office in the yard the day before the issue and read it with attention before he had finished jennings had come into his room youre reading our prospectus the manager sucked at his pipe aye he said slowly i was just reading the bit about the profits that were going to make they stared at it in silence for a time its not right said the manager at last ive told him different all along that we should make a loss the secretary sighed yes of course he wouldnt get his money if he told the public that i dont like it said grierson i dont like it at all the secretary shrugged his shoulders its too late now to make a song about it better to let it go he may have something in his mind that we dont know about aye said the manager it may be so but i wish i could know what it was itd save me a good few sleepless nights canon wardstephenson received a copy mr castroni saw to that and applied again for his six hundred shares he had some faith in that particular multiple founded upon a tangle of beliefs about the trinity and the known luck of the figure three miss macmahon got hold of the prospectus with some difficulty and put in for a hundred pounds miss ffolliotjohnson also got hold of a copy but did not apply for any shares instead she took it to a bedroom in the boarding house in kensington that she lived in and read it with some care then she got up and took from her handkerchief drawer a letter written by grierson that she had removed from a drawer in the desk of her late employer she compared the two documents carefully with tightened lips then she put them away together the issues of shares in the hawside ship and engineering company was about twenty per cent oversubscribed chapter twelve in the next month sharples stirred and woke to life it was difficult to tell the moment of awakening more labourers were taken on each day a few riggers were started and a couple of crane hands the boiler and the power house squads were taken on and reported gloomily about their augean stable one day a ganger and a platelaying squad appeared upon the railway siding leading to the yard tapping the rails and grumbling at the lack of wedges in the chairs taken for firewood long before a few days later a tank engine puffed along the line with five bogie waggons laden with steel plate and three days after that the rattling clamour of a pneumatic riveter burst from the yards the women crowded to their doors and stood listening entranced to that sweet symphony thats a riveter that is they said just fancy the man driving the rivets in the keel plate dropped the tool thankfully when the whistle blew for dinner and surveyed the burst and bleeding blisters on his palms christ he said to his holderup this is a bloody caper no mistake grierson critically examining the work heard the remark and saw the hands get along to the first aid and get that dressed before you go to dinner he said resignedly then go and draw a pair of gloves before you start again he went quickly to the storekeeper nip up into the town and get a dozen pairs of hedgers gloves he said i want them for the riveters until their hands get hard working to build a ship in kid gloves he thought bitterly but what else could one do under his tireless drive however the work progressed by the end of the month he had a hundred men employed still largely on preparatory work in addition he had made a good start with his organization buying progress and ratefixing were all established as a nucleus and his stores were falling into line its only that everyones so willing makes it possible at all he said to cheriton one evening when i go round and see those men in gloves it makes me want to cry its only for a time said cheriton theyre getting hardened up already aye that first chaps left his off im glad to see on christmas eve when the yard closed for the holiday the numbers of employed had gone up to a hundred and seventynine weekly wage earners the small returning ripple of prosperity had not passed unnoticed in the district a shop long closed reopened to sell meat pies cooked meats black puddings and other delicacies it did a good trade over christmas small articles began to be sold at the door for the first time for many years a man who gleaned a sack of holly in the country lanes disposed of it within an hour a penny for a spray a hot roast chestnut barrow came upon the streets and did good trade a dairyman apologizing for a shortage at the hospital about this time observed that he was selling three times what he had six months before he didnt know where to turn for milk really and truly mr williams reprimanded him severely and sent him away its quite true what he said you know observed the almoner theres more milk being bought now in the town than ever before mr williams grunted aye he said soon as they get a little money they go and spend it on their children aye but they spend it instead of saving for the next time i wouldnt quibble about what they spend on milk said miss macmahon i suppose you can tell how prosperous a town is by the amount it spends on milk mr warren ought to know about that he deals with commodities she told him about it next time he came to lunch with her he came to sharples once a week arriving upon friday afternoon staying the night with cheriton lunching with her on saturday at the hospital and going back to london on an evening train he missed one saturday when next he came she thought him looking worn and ill he told her he had had a touch of influenza youre looking rotten she remarked come up to the fire and get warm how long have you been out of bed about two days he said she eyed him for a minute you ought to take a holiday didnt your doctor tell you that i didnt have one all i had was a sort of feverish cold youre going to have one now she lifted the telephone receiver and spoke into it would you ask dr davies if he would be good enough to come along to my room when hes done his lunch she laid the receiver down he frowned that isnt necessary in the least she laid her hand upon his arm dont be cross id like it if youd let him look you over hes house physician here quite good at his job hell make you up a tonic to take back with you he laughed serves me right for putting my nose inside a hospital davies a seriousminded sandyhaired young man took him to an adjoining room and stethoscoped him thoroughly you had this operation here last march didnt you he enquired and youve had no rest since then you went straight out of here and went to work at once warren pulled on his coat very silly of me i suppose the young doctor smiled faintly not altogether the best thing you could have done he laid his stethoscope upon the table i should take a good long holiday now if i were you go somewhere where its warm the south of france perhaps and dont take things too energetically in a month youll be a different man warren shook his head i cant do that ive got to keep things going they discussed the matter for a little well said davies at last ill make you up a tonic but really you should take it easier you know the financier smiled you might as well tell a chap whos out of work to drink three pints of milk a day the young man flushed im here to tell people what they out to do i cant see that they do it either with you or anybody else warren nodded thats right im sorry i said that about the milk but i cant get a holiday just yet he went back to london on the evening train carrying with him in his bag a large bottle of medicine like any outpatient miss macmahon walked with him to the station and saw him off mind you take that tonic she reminded him it cost a lot of money and we didnt give it you for fun he smiled its good of you to look after me like this he said quietly why no she said its good of you to look after us the train carried him away towards newcastle and she turned back to the hospital in the corridor outside the common room she stopped davies what did you think of mr warren the sandyhaired young man considered seriously for a minute theres nothing organically wrong you understand hes very much run down a certain amount of nervous indigestion and that sort of thing i got the impression that he was working far harder than he ought to probably worrying about his work but i imagine thats his normal life the almoner bit her lip thats half the trouble during the early months of the new year employment in the yard increased enormously by the end of january about four hundred and eighty men were working on the tankers in the next month the figure rose to over seven hundred and to a thousand by the end of march with this increase in employment in the town shops of all sorts began to come to life again exteriors were repainted giving palmer street a less desolate appearance windows became filled with the new stock a new shop opened to sell bicycles and motor bicycles the increase of the traffic in the streets became most noticeable in april the yard got another order for a cargo steamer of three thousand tons it came through sir david hogan who induced an impecunious shipowner associate to speculate on the future to the extent of ordering a replacement to his fleet the deal was placed with the yard through warren sons and mortimer the price was cut to bedrock for the sake of the order lord love us said grierson well have to call this one the misery at that price shell be nothing but grief to us jennings turned over the pages of the contract it says here shes to be called the argosy twelveinch lettering bow and stern argosy nothing shell be the misery to us shell give us continuity of work said warren time enough to worry about prices when weve got our reputation back as builders of good ships till then weve got to take what we can get and like it he took his tale to miss macmahon and told her all about itits wonderful she exclaimed you must be terribly proud to have done this because this is a real order isnt it i mean there isnt a worm in this apple warren smiled no this one is comparatively sound she considered for a minute theres one point that i dont quite see she said why did your firm have to come into it at all why wasnt the order placed straight with the yard he smiled a little cynically shipbuilding finance he said it sounds better put that way ordinary people call it hire purchase oh in times like these he explained the shipowner has all his money locked up in his ships he may want another ship but he hasnt got the cash to pay for it the shipbuilder on the other hand hasnt got the money to build it but thats absurd she said you cant get anywhere if thats the way of it he smiled oh yes you can they both come running to the bank to borrow money there was a momentary silence i see she said so sharples cant quite get along without you even yet not quite he said but every order that we get brings the yard nearer to standing on its own feet thats why im so pleased weve got this little ship to build it means that owners will consider us again she eyed him steadily so far as i can see it means that one bank is considering us all the time that may be but i couldnt have gone against the owner if hed had no confidence that sharples could turn out a decent ship she turned towards the window sharples is getting like it used to be she said she stared out into the street last year on a saturday night about this time there wouldnt have been a soul about just desolate and now look at them he came and stood beside her the street was thronged with women shopping with their men laden with baskets and with paper bags shabby and ragged but alive and vital in the light of the streetlamps a few cars tradesmens vans stood in the road there were many bicycles its different isnt it she said theyre talking about getting the trams running its certainly a change he smiled another sign of progress i didnt know you had an evening paper here she nodded did you see the boy down there coming towards us she peered down the street its only on saturdays that we get that because of the football news it comes from newcastle they stood and watched the crowd as the boy came towards them for a minute he was hidden from their sight then the crowd parted and he was quite near to them his placard was displayed before their eyes it said revolution in laevatia oh look said the girl does that mean anything she glanced up quickly at warren bis face was very hard its a bad one that he said quiedy let me go and get a paper he came back in a minute with the paper in his hand and spread it out upon her table togetherthey read down the short account in silence well he said it couldnt have been worse she laid her hand upon his arm im terribly sorry did you know any of these people who were shot deleben the prime minister did you know him he nodded he wasnt a bad chap he paused the other one theopoulos the one who was shot in the cabaret he was the one i did the business with there was a long silence the girl looked up at him at last powerless to help this is a very bad one he repeated i dont know what this is going to mean she turned again to the paper i dont understand about these parties the peoples party were in power were they he nodded they were the conservatives the government were pretty stable under them but this other lot the social reform party theyre just the mob and look whos leading them she stared at it uncomprehending potiscu did you know him he laughed shortly hes the one who got the umbrella he stared at the account again looting and burning murdering in cabarets soldiers shooting down their officers in cafes god knows what this will mean to us up here she stared up at him openeyed i hadnt thought of that he smiled dont worry itll all pan out all right but i must get along to london right away he caught the night train down from newcastle and was ir london in the early hours of sunday morning he went straight to his flat and read the morning papers carefully the situation was as bad as it could be he spent an hour at the laevatian embassy but got little comfort there in the afternoon he attended an emergency conference at the london offices of laevol ltd he came away from that with little new information but with one certainty the preference dividend due in may and secured upon the profits of the state railway would not be paid there cant be any profit on the railway after this remarked the secretary look at the decree free transport of all food materials and free travelling for all manual workers there cannot possibly be any profit after that to pay our dividend and anyway theyll probably rescind the agreement now its subject to laevatian law that one warrens lips narrowed to a line its bad he said its bad all right remarked the secretary a little hostile this should have been foreseen in the city the next morning the laevatian news was treated with concerned derision as a joke in rather poor taste during the day the laevol shares fell catastrophically from twentytwo shillings to fourteen and six next day they were marked down to about nine shillings where they hovered for a week or two a feeling of hostility was evident the argus relating the news took the occasion to comment acidly upon the flotation of a certain company which would now seem to be a subject for investigation mr todd who held few of the laevol shares took the matter philosophically write em off the books he said theyll never be worth anything now mr castroni was not amused my godfathers he said to hear you talk i put the best clients that ive got into this thing and look at it now thirty thousand pounds of my clients money gone already and the rest not worth a sausage look at that i moral use your own judgement and not other peoples said mr todd mr castroni ground his cigarette out in the tray this things a bloody racket he said bitterly and ive let warren suck me in ive been a fool and now ive got to pay for it i felt that there was something crooked in it when he gave the laevol order to his other company that hawside thing that papers right theres something here wants digging into and im going to do it mr todd gazed at him in wonder you wont find anything that you can lay a finger on he said look at the issues that theyve been behind that may be said mr castroni if theres nothing in it but a run of bad luck i shall be glad but with the letters ive been getting from my clients he broke off theres a retired canon down at shoreham he said bitterly one of the best ive got and now he rings me up to tell me that ive swindled him me ive come to the conclusion that he has been swindled but its not by me his researches led him in the end to warrens office warren received him courteously i agree he said after the first discussion that the company has had a setback i am concerned about it because in some degree i feel it as a reflection on my house our issues do not usually have setbacks of this sort but then a revolution is itself unusual mr castroni eyed him for a minute you had a bit of bad luck there now ive been studying the agreement with the then government of laevatia it was rather an unusual proviso that the contract for the ships be placed through your house rather than at public tender warren shrugged his shoulders that was a part of the deal it was disclosed in the prospectus that you underwrote are you objecting to it now mr castroni swallowed something i was merely remarking on the matter apart from that the security for the dividend has fallen down i didnt understand that that was subject to laevatian law you should read the prospectus but in any case an agreement between a foreign company and its own government isnt usually ruled by british law he got up from his desk i see that you are feeling badly about laevol he said quietly and i am sorry for that but as i say we didnt cater for a revolution in the country mr castroni rose to go im not only feeling badly he said evenly im feeling that ive been had for a mug but i cant prove it yet in spite of her inability to write english to spell and to type and in spite of a certain physical disability miss ffolliotjohnson had quite enough intelligence to follow the affairs of laevol with interest she was accustomed to spend occasional weekends with her uncle down at shoreham but it was sheer coincidence that brought the canon to her uncles house to tea one saturday canon wardstephenson was still full of his great trouble i am not a habitual dealer on the stock exchange he informed his host far from it we clergy have little money to indulge such tastes but quite recently i was persuaded by my broker persuaded i may say against my better judgement to invest a very considerable sum a very considerable sum indeed in a new issue laevol ltd miss ffolliotjohnson stiffened to attention and what is the result it appears to me i may of course be in error that all decency and honest dealing all proper rectitude have vanished from the city since the war no i do not think i am in error i do not think that is an overstatement the issue has hardly been upon the market for three mondis and look at the shares now i see that they are quoted at eight shillings and threepence for the onepound shares and are quite unlikely to declare the dividend which was supposed to have been guaranteed to put the matter plainly i have been swindled out of a great many hundreds of pounds his host made sympathetic noises these bucket shops he said i dont know why they allow them to continue but this was not a bucket shop exclaimed the canon the company was launched by a firm of bankers warren sons and mortimer who were supposed to be above reproach i satisfied myself upon that point most particularly no the fact of the matter is that there is an infection of dishonest dealing which has crept into the city since the war even into concerns that seem to be of good repute miss ffolliotjohnson laughed shortly you wouldnt call warren sons and mortimer a firm of good repute she said shortly i mean one has to be careful what company one gets into even if one is only a secretary dont you think she gazed appealingly at the canon i left as soon as i found out what sort of people they were running it her uncle explained my niece was employed by warren sons and mortimer for a short time they seem to be a very bad crowd the girl nodded i never was in such a horrid office she said mincingly i mean it was just horrid its not very nice to be where people are being swindled all day long is it the stories i could tell without a great deal of difficulty she was induced to tell them and then there was the hawside ship and engineering company she said that was just awful that was robbing the public thats what i call it the canons heart turned over he had about five hundred pounds invested in that company he frowned what was the trouble therehe asked the girl laughed shortly all of it was trouble if you ask me mr warren had this shipyard that hed bought by mistake or something and he had it on his hands and it was just a dead loss to him if you see what r mean so he faked up this order from the laevol company taking it out of one pocket and putting it into the other thats what i call it and then he was able to make a big issue to the public because of that and then he sold the shipyard which wasnt worth anything at all to the hawside company and got it off his hands you wouldnt hardly credit what fools people are with their money the canon winced i dont see that theres much harm in that said her uncle mildly the shipyard may do very well if its got orders thats what it said in the prospectus said the girl but thats all lies just to take people in and make them put up their money canon wardstephenson eyed her steadily why do you say that i know its all lies she said defiantly his manager wrote to him to say that they were going to make a loss of over fifty thousand pounds and mr warren put it in the prospectus that they were going to make a profit her uncle looked at her incredulously but mats not right he said you can go to prison for that she tossed her head thats where he ought to be that mr warren are you sure that you arent making a mistake enquired the canon miss ffolliotjohnson was offended if you dont believe me i could show you the letter what letter asked the canon she was a little confused such a funny thing she said when i left i found some letters in my attachй case because i did work for the firm out of hours sometimes and there was that one from the manager that said about the loss she glanced at the canon sideways i should be very interested to see it he remarked she tossed her head i dont mind showing it to you three days later mr heinroth sat in quiet thought in his office for ten minutes undisturbed at the end of it he lifted the telephone upon his desk and rang up warren morning old boy he said give me a quarter of an hour if i come round at once whats it about tell you when i see you that all right all right old boy ill come right over warren laid down the receiver there was too much old boy about that conversation to be altogether healthy he had worked with heinroth ever since the war and knew his moods mr heinroth came into his office and accepted a cigarette first about this laevol order for the ships he said is it true that theyve stopped progress payments to the hawside company warren passed a hand over his eyes not quite as you know the government has placed restrictions upon the export of credits from the country the usual thing there must be reciprocity heinroth smiled youll have to take your progress payments in olive oil and dates broadly speaking that is how it stands at the moment its a breach of contract with the hawside company of course that wont help you pay your wages unless of course you can pay those in olive oil and dates its not so bad as that the company could finish off these tankers on its capital if no more payments were forthcoming of any sort its not so good old boy i quite agree but revolutions never are so good mr heinroth got up from his chair and crossed over to the window he stood there with his back to the room looking down upon the little city court that gave on to cornhill a few square yards of meagre grass and stunted laurel theres going to be a row about the hawside company warren he said without turning round whos making it castroni he turned back into the room theres real trouble there he said weve worked together now for fifteen years and i thought id come along and let you know i had castroni in my office half an hour ago hes got a letter that a man called grierson your manager i think wrote to you before the issue about a fifty thousand loss warren bent down opened a drawer of his desk and searched carefully through some papers yes he said quietly hes probably got that whats he going to do with it the jew hesitated hes gone down to the city police with it he said gently its not castroni really its some client of his thats pushed him into this but i thought id come along and let you know there was a silence for a minute then warren said its good of you to have come round heinroth he smiled with a sardonic humour perhaps one day ill be able to do as much for you the other laughed not me old boy ive got my fingers crossed i keep them that way all the time he went away and warren sat back in his chair for a few minutes considering the matter then he buzzed for morgan im going up to sharples at once he said on the noon train ring up lord cheriton at me yard and tell him mat im coming up and that id like to dine with him tonight say ive got something urgent to discuss ring plumberg and say that i cant see him this afternoon put off delaney if anybody calls while im away you can say where i am and ill be back on thursday morning that night he dined with young lord cheriton alone with his wife at their country house at carton ten miles west of sharples when lady cheriton had left them with the coffee and cigars he broached the subject mat he had come north about theres trouble about the company down in the city cheritonhe said his host did not seem very much put out have another glass of port he said he shoved the decanter across the table is it over the prospectus warren raised his eyebrows how did you know the young man laughed it was a pretty hot document jennings took me through it sentence by sentence especially the bit about the profit we were going to make thats the bit thats making all the trouble i suppose you know by now that well be making a colossal loss on these three ships the young man shrugged his shoulders i told jennings that that seems to me to be beside the point the real thing is can we get the company through and make it into a success we decided we were going to start this thing and get some work back here again having decided to do that weve got to see it through as i told them all up here youd never have got the money if youd told the public what the real position was were a precious pair said warren very quiedy couple of bloody sharepushers if you ask me thats right said cheriton i dont want you to think that i came into this thing with my eyes shut i took a good deal of advice as a matter of fact it seemed to me to be a good thing to do im sorry if were going to burn our fingers now thats just too bad but im not sorry that we started up this thing in sharples he turned to warren what is this trouble all about warren told him omitting the city police they smoked in silence for a time are all of us in this asked cheriton we all signed the prospectus warren shook his head we havent got to be you and hogan have got to keep out of it leave the dirt to me ive been in the city all my life and i know how to handle it cheriton frowned i dont much like the sound of that warren smiled i dont give a damn whether you like it or not he said im chairman of this company and im telling you what i want done he paused you two have got to keep out of it theres a bad row coming up but if were all mixed up in it the company will bust and thats not what we set out to achieve now its quite possible that i may have to resign from the board over this if that happens youve got to take the chair yourself the young man stirred uneasily i cant do that i havent got enough experience youve got old hogan behind you hes too old to put into the chair but hell back you for all hes worth next youve got to make grierson managing director he didnt have anything to do with the prospectus and that will please the shareholders the other nodded thats a good move ive been meaning to suggest that for some time if theres a row and i retire youll have to call an extraordinary general meeting of the company to make these changes have that in the yard the registered offices of the company its three hundred miles from london and you wont get many shareholders will come that far to make a row ill see that you get proxies enough to carry any motion that you want fix things so that the shareholders who do turn up have a look round the yard before the meeting and theyll come in all enthusiastic and then away you go with a new lease of life the young man looked troubled i see it can be managed he replied at the same time i hope very much that you arent going to retire i hope so too i started this thing and i want to see it through at the same time weve got to think first of the company if the hunt is really up and im afraid it is you may be better off without me but well have to see how it goes on theres one good thing said cheriton i think we can get all the work we want to keep the yard alive old hogans found another shipowner wants two small colliers warren grunted youd better stick out for a better price from now on next day he went down to the yard with cheriton the three large berths were occupied by frames and steelwork growing into oil tankers on the first of these the framework was completed and the plating well ahead in one of the two smaller berths the keel plate of the little tramp had been laid down and frames were laid out on the ground beside its coming on said warren to grierson beginning to see something now oh aye and the men are working better too how many have you got employed something over fourteen hundred ill find out for you and let you know but well be needing a lot more now were coming on to the plating that releases a lot of work you understand how many will you have employed by august the inside of two thousand five hundred said the manager after a minutes thought two three to two five and launch the first one at the end of october aye well not be far off that warren stared up at the framing towering high above his head its so immense he said slowly ive never watched ships being built before id not know how to start about a job like this grierson chuckled start where you started this one mr warren he remarked down in an office in the city warren smiled i meant the building of them oh aye its not that difficult you keep on adding bit to bit you understand and they get done before you know warren spent the morning wandering around the yard he was amazed again at what he had created he watched the growing ships the working men it was incredible to him that he had started all this industry he could not make himself believe that he was part of the organization he saw himself as a spectator to a great work being done by someone else he left that yard at lunch time with regret and went up to the hospital to lunch with the almoner she was waiting for him in her little room the table laid for lunch the room alight with daffodils it seems all wrong for you to be up here in the middle of the week she said it makes me feel tomorrow will be sunday she paused it doesnt mean trouble does it he smiled at her not more than i can manage how did the laevol thing go off oh thats all right she said no more but busied herself in giving him his lunch she talked to him of sharples of the yard and of the hospital she told him there was talk of a new cinema another thing she said there arent so many patients coming to the hospital i was going over the returns with mr williams and comparing them with last year outpatients are down a lot inpatients as well but not so much youll be losing your job if this goes on i dont know that id mind so much about that now he nodded slowly it makes a difference now the place is getting on its feet i feel the same she looked up startled you do he did not answer her question but began to talk about the council and the administration of the town but with the coffee he turned again to her im going back on the fourthirty he said before i go im going to take a walk up on to the hill towards the mine would you care to come up there this afternoon what for he smiled i want to see the place as a whole before i go back she thought about it for a moment id like to in the warm afternoon they walked together up the hill out of the town at the top they paused beside a gate this is the place i wanted to come to he said we came here once before she nodded you told me you were going to put the town to work again and now youve done it are you satisfied he stared out over the town a wreath of smoke hung over it dimming the outlines of the river its not finished yet he said weve only made a start id like to see the rollingmills get started up even if we have to leave the mine but i think it will come now if the yard gets a decent run of work the rest will come back he turned to her i may be retiring from the board he said she was amazed but you cant do that she said i mean you are the company you started it for us he nodded thats so but there are two sorts of people in the company world the starters and the runners the people who can start things up arent usually the best at running them you want a different sort of mind for that ive been a starter all my life i never was a runner but all my board are runners cheriton hogan and grierson theyre all good runners your company would be quite safe with them but why should you retire ive done my job he said simply and im tired i want to have a rest she laid her hand upon his arm you ought to take a holiday i may be going to retire from business altogether he said i dont know that i shall ever work again there was a momentary silence and then he said when my wife left me i had to look around for something big to get stuck into in the way of work i found this sharples thing to work at its been the hardest thing ive ever had to tackle and the best worth doing but now my job is coming to an end sharples is going now therell be difficulties ahead of course but not more than the yard can overcome theres not the need for me here now i might look out for something else to start but i dont think i shall you must take a long rest she said travel for a time forget about your work he smiled its not much fun doing that alone would you come with me there was a pause the wind sighed in the hedges over the blackened town if you wanted me to she said quietly he shook his head theres a couple of months to go before my decree gets made absolute he said well wait and see what happens in the meantime she raised her eyes to his i know that youre expecting trouble of some sort she said i dont know what it is and you dont want to tell me but i want you to know this im here if you want me and ill always be here if you want me that thats what i wanted you to know he smiled down at her ive known that long enough if it hadnt been for that i should have chucked this sharples business long ago she dropped her eyes tm not sure that i quite know what you mean i mean just this he said you had faith in the town that it could pull itself up out of the mess if once it got a chance and i had faith in you he stared out over the river and the yard thats what brought work back here again he said he turned to her and took her hand in his well be able to do great things together he said quietly i might put off retiring after all she stood there looking up at him her hand held m his own youve got your own romantic style she said softly i like it henry because its you the real you i wouldnt feel it was the real you if you were making love to me in all your trouble id feel that you were acting but when we get in smoother water ill expect a bit more than talk about your companies he stroked the hand that he still held in his own a house in oxfordshire he said in the country somewhere by a river where one could do some fishing of the quieter sort would that be what youd want she nodded without speaking and presently she stirred its nearly four she said i know you want to catch that train and i wont keep you maundering with me but henry remember this im always here i know my dear he said its that that makes this bloody thing worth while he went back with her to the town and caught his train to london he took a taxi to his flat and slept uneasily in the morning he went down to his office morgan came in to him shortly after he arrived a superintendent bullen of the city police was here late yesterday afternoon he said i told him that you would be in in the morning there was a momentary silence all right said warren evenly ill give him a ring the secretary retired warren got up from his desk walked to the window and stood for a few minutes looking down on the familiar little court then he turned back to the telephone superintendent bullen he enquired this is henry warren speaking warren sons and mortimer he listened for a moment youd better come along here right away in a few minutes two quietly dressed city gentlemen were with him in the room i shall have to ask you to come down the street with me to my office mr warren said the superintendent i have a warrant here for your arrest and charges in connexion with the hawside ship and engineering company ltd chapter thirteen allardyce his solicitor was distressed and shocked he came hurrying to the guildhall to the visiting room where warren was waiting for him a policeman was seated in the room warren rose from behind the long table that divided the room sorry to have brought you to a place like this he said the solicitor sank into a chair on the other side of the table i cannot tell you how sorry i was to get your message still i understand that our time is limited i have found out that you appear before the magistrates tomorrow morning yes of course you know that the police will ask for a remand i shall apply for bail of course you wont get itsaid warren i diink we may i shall plead that in a case of this sort the defence cannot be handled adequately except in your own office the complexity of the matter the mass of documents that have to be examined warren smiled there isnt going to be a defence he said allardyce eyed him seriously do you mean you want to plead guilty thats right the solicitor was silent i find that very difficult to believe he said at last if facts are as stated in the charge there must be some good reason for those facts your business isnt a bucket shop you had no reason to want to make money in that way and in point of fact i understand that you made practically nothing out of the issue warren nodded all the same he said there will be no defence why not for several reasons firstly because i did it the solicitor raised his hand and shot a quick glance at the policeman i very much appreciate your wish to get me out of this said warren but frankly allardyce that isnt practical theres a confidential letter of mine that theyve got hold of which blows the gaff properly im sorry but there it is its a waste of my money and the crowns money to contest a case like this i think said the solicitor that you should make an effort i dont said warren after a pause he said youd better understand my point of view we couldnt win this case but even if we did im finished in the city after this thats the first point whether we plead guilty or not guilty im retiring from the city i see that said allardyce thoughtfully the next thing is im very much concerned about the hawside company i took all of this risk upon myself to get that shipyard started up and if it comes to grief i shall have done it all for nothing my arrest wont have done them any good still theyll get over that i think so long as it doesnt drag on for too long but the quicker its over and the less dirty linen washed in public the better chance that company will have is your interest in the company so valuable as that warren shook his head i havent got much in it about three thousand pounds or so but i should be very sorry to see it go under now given a decent chance i think it can get through the solicitor gazed at him curiously it seems to mean a great deal to you but surely a company that has no soul to be damned nor backside to be kicked hardly deserves so much consideration our time is getting short said warren that is my line and that is what im going to do how long do you think ill get the solicitor laughed nervously i really dont know eighteen months warren shook his head i think a good bit more than that he appeared next morning in the police court neatly dressed and listening to the proceedings with detached gravity the charges were read over in the court for that he henry warren on the twelfth day of november being a director of a public company called the hawside ship and engineering company did circulate a certain written statement which was false in certain material particulars to wit in that it was therein falsely stated that certain orders undertaken by the company should prove to be profitable he the said henry warren well knowing the said statement to be false with intent to induce divers persons unknown to become shareholders in the said public company contrary to section of the larceny act for good measure he was also charged with fraudulently converting moneys belonging to the company for his own use the police asked for a remand which was granted allardyce asked for bail which was refused warren went to brixton in the black maria after formalities in court which had lasted barely for ten minutes let them get on with it he said to allardyce that afternoon you can plead not guilty to that second charge of fraudulent conversion but theres nothing in that theyll cut it out before the trial youre still sure that you want to plead guilty on the first charge absolutely all youve got to do is to get it through as quickly and as quietly as possible the solicitor sighed if thats really the line you want to take ill do my best for you theres one thing more tell morgan to come down and see me here tomorrow theres a good bit of business to be cleared up before i go into retirement i suppose so what are you going to do with warren sons and mortimer thats what i am wondering myself he settled down in brixton not uncomfortably his room was bare but that worried him very little nor did the close restraint distress him he discovered that the first and most important element of comfort is an easy mind freedom from worry and responsibility he found formed a considerable palliative to his imprisonment he had no regrets about the issue of his false prospectus no great sense of guilt instead he had a feeling of achievement and of work well done within a very few days of his incarceration he found that he could lie contented on his bed for a great part of the day quietly contemplating what he had done what lay before him youd hardly believe it said morgan to his wife one night but i believe hes happier in prison than he was when he was out that may well be with the sort of wife he had that may be something to do with it but he hasnt seen her for a year or so the decree will be made absolute next month is he quite right in his head i think so but you know how irritable he used to be well youd think it would be worse than ever now not a bit of it ive never known him so goodhumoured his wife smiled maybe hes got another girl she said if thats it she may have to wait some time said morgan in sharples the news was greeted with dismay warren had never taken any public part in the affairs of the town had never made a speech or attended any sort of public function only a few people in the town knew him by sight in spite of this perhaps because of this he had become a legend in the place a myth a fairy tale for the last six months every child in the town had known the story of the stranger the poor tramp who had been operated on up in the hospital and who turning to fairy banker in gratitude had started up the shipyard for them once again and set them working on three oil tankers with money coming in regular every mother told that story to her children in the secretive dumb hearts of the adolescents it burned like a flame in the pubs towards closing time the men alcoholically sentimental would lift their cans to mister bloody warren and turn again to their darts and now their mr warren was in clink it was a shocking thing incredible the solid earth beneath their feet seemed to tremble and slip away before them loomed the abyss of unemployment once again the almoner heard it first from mr williams he was working at his ledgers as she came into the office he stopped and raised his head did ye hear the news he asked uncertainly she shook her head whats that he hesitated theyre saying your mr warrens in a bit of trouble he said diffidently she saidwhere im hoping maybe that its wrong he said gently but theyre saying that hes been arrested in london for fraudulent conversion and a charge of falsifying a prospectus she did not speak i think it must be all of a mistake he said after a moment she shook her head i dont think so i think it may be true she turned to him where did you get this from i was on the telephone down to the yard speaking to jennings he told me that the news had just come through he knew that this was coming she said in a low tone all the time when he was up here last he must have known of this she raised her head let me know anything else you hear she left him and went up to her room she sat for half an hour upon her bed staring before her motionless then she got up took out a writing pad and settled down to put her thoughts into a letter i dont know what the trouble is exactly yet probably if i did i shouldnt understand it because i suppose its all company and business stuff all i know is what everybody else in sharples knows that over two thousand families are now in work and happy who last year were singing down and out and utterly wretched i know that that is what you set out to do and whatever else may happen now i think you must be very proud and happy to have done so much for us and at for me im very proud that ive had the experience of seeing such a wonderful thing done even at such a cost you told me from the first that nothing could be done for us by honest means i cant be sorry for the decision that you took and i dont suppose you are but i am most deeply sorry that you didnt have the luck to get away with it l suppose that you are going to be tried upon these charges i cant believe it will go wrong for you i shall be praying all the luck in the world for you on that day and everyone up here will be doing the same but if things should go badly then i want you to know that im with you one hundred per cent ive lost the sense of difference between the right thing and the wrong thing long ago where sharples was concerned i only know one thing for certain that what you did for us up here was right my dear im terribly proud of you warren received this letter in brixton prison he answered it a couple of days later my dear i want to thank you for your letter and i want to tell you myself rather than you should see it in the papers that im going to prison in business there isnt a shadow of excuse for what i did i am certainly guilty on the first charge and i should only waste the time and money of the court by pleading otherwise and so i am afraid that it may be some time before we meet again my main concern now is to see that the company gets through i thinly it will do so given reasonable luck in trade revival in the country and that now xems to be well on the way i have seen cheriton and hogan in the last few days and told them what i think they ought to do and now it is largely out of my hands this time in brixton on remand is valuable to me because i can write letters relatively freely and i am making what arrangements are in my power so to arrange my own business that it can be called upon to support your company in sharples with financial help if needs be while i am in prison later on the letter position will get more difficult one in three months seems to be the ration and so i must do all my business now and lastly about ourselves in a few weeks time my decree will be made absolute if i had got away with it in this affair i should have asked you to marry me as soon as that happened i believe you know that because im now in quod im not going to insult your intelligence by pretending that im just a very good friend im not when i get out of this i shall probably ask you to marry me because i think we could be wonderfully happy together and youll probably refuse me for my prison record thats all im going to say about that but now you know whats coming to you be tranquil it isnt coming for some time warren was tried at the old bailey about a month after his arrest because of his plea of guilty to the first charge the proceedings were short almost a formality no evidence was offered by the crown upon the second charge and acquittal on this charge was ordered by the judge the first charge was proved upon the plea of guilty the judge magnificent in scarlet and ermine said you have pleaded guilty to the charge of issuing a prospectus statement of the hawside ship and engineering company well knowing that statement to be false in its material particulars with the intention of defrauding the public that charge has now been proved against you it has been suggested upon your behalf that i should treat this as a first offence i cannot take that course a heartless and wicked fraud has been practised upon the public which must bring a great deal of distress to many people in my view that offence is aggravated by the position which you have held hitherto i find that the charge has been proved against you i find that fraud was committed deliberately for your own ends and i sentence you to three years penal servitude warren was ushered from the dock and the judge turned to the next case he served his sentence in parkhurst prison in the isle of wight he was taken there by two prison officers three days after the trial admitted to the prison and put in a cell he was uncomfortable at first with all the strangeness of a new boy at school he found parkhurst to be not unlike his public school in many ways and very similar indeed to the new boy there was the same awkward search for information about times of work and exercise and meals about rights and privileges another similarity that made him feel at home in the first days was to the army he had served for the first six months of the war as a private soldier a gunner in the royal field artillery rough food and clothing were no novelty to him he did not like them but they held no terrors for him they were not strange unknown things and in another way they brought with them an association that was not unwelcome to him this association was a memory of a very restful time looking back upon his life since he had left his public school the five years before the war the war itself and the time subsequent one period stood out in memory as utterly different from the rest during the time when he had been a private soldier he had held no responsibility for anything at all that made that six months totally different from the rest of his working life it had been a pleasant time a very restful time when nothing had been expected of him but that he should keep his body and his equipment clean and in good condition beyond that he was not responsible for anything at all not even for securing his own food or his own bed all that was done for him he held that six months in his memory as time of great mental rest a peace that he had never known before or since in parkhurst prison he found these circumstances to be largely reproduced but modified in ways that made them appropriate to his age the immensely strenuous physical labour of the army was replaced by a working day of five hours in the shoe shop learning to build army boots and by an hours parade a day in the prison exercise yard the rest of the twentyfour hours were spent in his cell with no responsibilities at all it lies in the nature of a man to make himself a home and warren grew very fond of his cell it was a small room but big enough for him with walls half painted half whitewashed and kept at a comfortable temperature by a hotwater radiator the heavily barred window looked to the east over the cowes newport road and the valley of the medina to the higher land by wootton being upon the top floor of his hall he could see most of the east end of the island he soon found that prison discipline wisely connives at the possession of small innocent articles and in the eighth month of his sentence he obtained possession of a small telescope constructed out of cardboard tubes from that time on the scrutiny of the wide varied countryside became an abiding interest to him for the first time in his life he had leisure to enjoy and savour to the full the simple pleasure of watching other people go about their work he was allowed two books a week from the prison library in the first week of his sentence he read both books through in one day devouring them with the swift efficiency that he gave to all his business matters he finished that day with the restless nervous fatigue that he had come to regard as part of a normal life and was out of literature for the rest of the week on the third day he read half of one of the books through again and was surprised to notice that there was something to be gained by doing so by the third month he was taking his books slowly as a connoisseur thinking about them and extracting the last ounce from each never before had be had leisure to do that with any book and he found a new pleasure in reading in this way for the first time in his life too he had long hours for reflection he soon found that it was possible to sleep more than twelve hours a day and he did so for months on end in spite of that there were many hours in each day when he had no occupation but to reflect his reflections were not troublesome to him he would have to serve two years and three months if he obtained full remission of sentence for good conduct he had arranged a calendar among the studs on the door of his cell on which he could cross off the days in pencil he was fortyfour years old it was a pity to lose two years and three months of your life at that age but it was not an impossibly long time and he was not distressed by the idea his sentence had not involved the loss of any money to him personally and he would still have ample for his needs when he came out of prison he would never be able to go back to the city he did not particularly want to do so but he would have to find some other occupation for his still abundant energy and it was on that problem that his reflections principally concentrated with his restless vivid imagination that had started so many enterprises in the past this soon developed into an absorbing occupation with a pencil on a sheet of paper he planned for himself a course of contemplation a comprehensive mental survey which would cover the entire field of possible occupations for his later years he planned his survey in main sections of industries and occupations with subsections geograpical thus on a morning turning to his page he would discover that his programme was to consider the timber industry on the west coast of canada that day the active brain was dragging out of pigeonholes in that dim filing room we call the memory all that he had ever heard about that industry the economics processes personalities geography scenery potentialities all day he lay upon his bed sifting and sorting his material occupied and amused he was in fact engaged in living a life of pure contemplation in conditions that were comfortable and yet sufficiently ascetic his position was entirely comparable to that of a novice in a monastery the same detachment from the turmoil of the outside world the same ascetic life the same long hours of contemplation rule the novice and the prisoner and warren found in prison a great part of the peace that a more devout man might find within a monastery and with this peace cause or effect came sleep the nervous strain of twenty years came soaking out of him in month after month of quiet dreamless sleep he slept and slept and slept a convict in prison is allowed a visit from a friend or relative after the first four months of his sentence thereafter every three months in long sentences the visits grow more frequent as the years go on the visit lasts for half an hour warrens first visit after four months was by lord cheriton they met in one of the visitingrooms down by the gate weve not got very long said cheriton i came down because i knew that youd like to hear how things are going on in sharples and because i want your advice before our next board meeting how did your extraordinary general meeting go off never a hitch only about seven turned up and those principally because they wanted to see the yard at work we elected grierson to the board you know warren nodded that was the right thing to do i think so now for the orders in hand the laevol orders are much more secure now than when you saw them last the delaware oil corporation have come in on that you know the progress payments are practically uptodate and i think those ships will be all right but if they arent the north borneos are in the market for two tankers hogan reckons he could shift two of them there if needs be but i think theyll be all right with laevol watch out for trickery on the last payment said warren take nothing but real money cheriton nodded after the tankers weve got three small tramps and one vessel of eight thousand tons for carew and mason shes at a fair price the others arent so good but the real thing is weve got a good chance of a lookin on the admiralty side rearmament thats right i went with hogan to the admiralty the other day for a formal conference on our capacity theyve got us earmarked for a couple of destroyers if things get too bad politically and they have to accelerate the programme thats very good if it comes off i dont suppose it will now thats about all of my news weve got two thousand eight hundred men employed and thats about our full capacity unless wc went on night shift and thats not practical upon commercial work he paused now what i want from you is this warren have you got any view about our first years balance sheet plentysaid warren he leaned his arms upon the table you must make this first years accounts as bad as ever they can be he said youve got a marvellous opportunity to do so now one that youll never have again you must examine every contract that youve got with jennings and grierson must tell the auditors that every contract will be carried out at a loss hell probably be right of course but he must pile it on youve got to make reserves this year against every possible contingency probable or improbable i see you must show in this year all the losses that youre going to make next year and the year after if you can swing the figure of this years loss up to a hundred thousand pounds thats grand if you can get the auditors to make it a hundred and fifty thousand so much the better cheriton shook his head i dont think we could get it up to that get it as high as you can in your chairmans speech just say that full reserves have been made in this years accounts for contracts negotiated by the late chairman thats literally all you need to say by way of explanation i dont exactly like the thought of that i do man alive youve got a chance here to make the yard secure for the next ten years if you can play your hand the way it should be played pile everything into this years loss including a lot that really ought not to be there if you do that next year youll be bound to show a profit and the year after if youve done it properly this year then as soon as youre showing profits and a decent show of orders in hand get rid of this years losses by writing down your capital pay a dividend and make another issue to replace the capital i see what you mean said cheriton at last ill have to think it over but weve got nobody upon the board now that youre shut up here to help us in that sort of business warren smiled thats probably a good thing in itself its possible to be too clever in that way he thought for a minute still im sure that what ive told you is your proper course look go and have a talk with heinroth tell him that youve seen me and tell him that ive suggested this get his advice hes very close in with the market and he underwrote the issue so hell want to see it go hes a good chap too tell him i want his help in this thing as a personal matter take his advice cheriton nodded hes a jew i suppose he is said warren firmly and a damn good chap i did a lot with heinroth and he never let me down cheriton went away and warren settled down again to his quiet life in a short letter a fortnight later cheriton told warren that he had discussed the company with heinroth and that they were proceeding cautiously upon the lines that warren had suggested he got another letter a week after that from miss macmahon i dont know she wrote diffidently if you would like me to come and see you ill understand you if you feel youd rather not but lord cheriton told me that hes been to see you and i understand that you are allowed a visitor every three months i have to come to london early in the new year and i could come on down from there get a message to me before then to let me know if youd like me to come down you know id come a great deal farther than that but i know you cant write very often so i shant expect to hear from you before christmas he had an opportunity that month to include a message to her in a letter writhen to cheriton by special permission on matters connected with the company he wrote tell miss macmahon i agree with her proposal in regard to the man that she wrote to me about and i should be glad if she would carry on upon the lines that she suggests she came to him on a raw windy day in january when he had served seven months of his sentence she got up from the table as he came into the visitingroom i shouldnt have known you she exclaimed youre looking so well henry whatever have they done to you youre looking ten years younger he smiled at her im sorry my dear that wasnt what was meant to happen to me here but it has she stepped back merrily and looked at him its quite absurd youve put on weight havent you he nodded about a stone im up to twelve stone now you should be more than that she came and sat down with him at the table the warder discreetly in the background you know henry i was afraid you might be terribly run down i sort of dreaded what you might be like one thinks about such horrible things prison you know when one doesnt know about it l know he said its very sweet of you to come i had to if youd let me and now i find you simply bursting with health like this my dear im terribly glad tell me do you find the time pass very slowly he shook his head i did for the first week but now i dont know it just slips away she settled down to tell him all about sharples and such items of the business of the shipyard as she knew he learned that the town was growing almost normal new shops had been opened woolworths had returned and the trams were running once again there was a lot of talk that lord cheriton was trying to open up the rollingmills again attendances at outpatients were very much down on last year the first of the oil tankers had been launched shortly before christmas and was now finishing at the quayside there was a lot of talk in the town that they might have to build destroyers for the admiralty the half hour allowed them for the visit stretched by the warder in charge to forty minutes was over before she had been able to tell him half of all her news warren went back to his cell cheerful and content equally happily she walked back along the cowes road to newport station to begin upon her long journey back to sharples she came to him again in april and in july and every three months for the remainder of his sentence in the intervals she wrote to him each week long informative letters designed to keep him in touch with the world of his business interests to supply him with the information in the newspapers that were withheld from him she got into touch with morgan still secretary of warren sons and mortimer and learned from him weekly what his chief would like to know besides her own news and the news of sharples her letters told him about commodity prices the gold standard and the rates on treasury bills he learned about the french budget from her and about the changes in the government in greece and he was continuously informed about the principal movements of the stock market in november warren was released and walked out of the prison a free man he had told nobody the exact day of his release he did not know it himself until a few days previously he went by bus to cowes and thence by boat and train to southampton and london there he reported to the criminal record officer at scotland yard and went to a hotel next day he travelled up to sharples by night he breakfasted in newcastle and took the local train to sharples a talkative gendeman stout and rubicund got into the carriage with him observed that it was a fine morning and extracted from him the information that he was going to sharples eh sharples he said wheezing a little wonderful the way that sharples has come on time was not so long ago either there wasnt a man in work in sharples and thats a fact im telling you warren nodded i heard it had a bad time in the slump aye and then there was that financial swindle some years back one of those flybynight city financiers chairman of the shipyard too he got them in a proper mess got three years for it he did and serve him dam well right but since that time theyve gone ahead and theyve been full of work this long time past building destroyers for the admiralty now so they tell me its good to see the work come back again said warren mildly aye barlows the shipyard was before they changed the name there was seven barlow destroyers at the batde of jutland did ye ever hear that warren got out of the train at sharples and went walking through the streets towards the yard the town was utterly different from his memory of it in two and a half years it had changed almost beyond all recognition the streets were full of cars delivery vans vehicles opall sorts the pavements thronged with housewives shopping with their baskets the desolate air of cleanliness had altogether gone the sky was grimed with chimney smoke the children playing in the little streets looked more robust and better clothed with colour in rneir cheeks at every corner there appeared to be a new shop front trams and buses clanged and screamed along the streets and around the doors of the reopened woolworths perambulators were clustered thickly he passed a new large supercinema the clamour of the shipyard beat upon his ears a quarter of a mile away the surge and ebb of the clatter of the pneumatic riveters as he approached the gate he saw the halfbuilt ships looming up behind the wall there was one half plated on the slips that was obviously a warship of some sort he approached the gate slowly almost diffidently so much had happened here it was so different from when he had last seen it he had the feeling of an interloper in the place upon the blackened tenfoot wall not many yards from the gate was a sign that he did not remember hesitating for a moment to go in he went across to look at it it was a bronze plaque about three feet square apparently a memorial of some sort dignified and restrained as he approached he saw it bore embossed in low relief the sculptured head and shoulders of a man in profile he read the words below henry warren he gave us work he stood there staring at it for a few minutes smiling a little illogically moisture welled into his eyes a few children playing some complicated game chalked out upon the pavement stopped to notice the stranger mary said ellen anderson in a hoarse whisper maree coom over here i got somethin i want to tell you that bloke there she whispered its the man in the picture tisnt course it is i bet you tisnt i bet you all right now you got to go and ask him ellen wriggled nervously you ask him you got to ask him you bet it was all right i will ask him warren became aware of a very dirty little girl pulling at his sleeve please mister she whispered nervously are you the man in the picsher warren smiled thats right he said im the man in the picture the little girl left him sped across the road and into the kitchen of a little house coom over here and look mummy quick she gasped i seen the man in the picsher warren turned into the yard and went down to the office in the african bush and in towns like sharples news travels very fast warren was hardly at the office building before a dozen women were clustered at the gate peering at him down the entrance road he had hardly got to cheritons office before the men upon the ships knew all about it a chattering and gossiping ran down the streets from house to house women threw their shawls over their heads went to the door and out in to the street to see what was happening within the yard the men upon the ground sidled towards the offices the men upon the ships seeing the flow knocked off their work and paused to watch the word went round from mouth to mouth that mr warren had come back dennison the foreman plater stopped a thin trickle of men leaving the job god love us men he cried are ye all daft its twenty minutes yet to go before dinner get back on to the job theyre saying mr warrens in the offices whats that to you get back along and go on working till its time for dinner hoots said one if it wasnt for mr warren there wouldnt be no dinner there was a laugh the stream of men towards the offices grew larger uncontrollable in a moment men were streaming off the ships the foremen pleading with mem desperately only the fitters in the engineroom of one destroyer stayed at work their foreman had been middleweight boxing champion in the navy the men surged round the offices they surged into the time office led by jock mccoy a charge hand labourer the desk clerk rose like a flushed partridge youre not allowed in here he cried the navvy thrust his way across the room git oot o the way ye wee daft fule he said there ane thing only in this place will tell the toon that mr warrens back an that things gaen to wurk an if ye dinna like it ye can stop yer bluidy earoles the hooter wailed in short staccato bursts it blew long blasts short blasts continuous blasts intermittent blasts as various hands tried the experience of pulling at the cord it brought the women to the doors the shopkeepers out into the streets enquiring what the noise was all about it brought a stream of women and children down towards the gates it brought the farm hands far beyond the town to a standstill beside their byres in the little harbour at the entrance to the river it brought the fishermen together wondering what the row was all about it brought the stoker in the shipyard from his boilers in a frenzy agonized that he was losing all his steam it brought the sisters in the hospital to the entrance of their wards it brought the porter flying to the almoners little office off the secretarys room she started in her chair but it cant be she exclaimed he wasnt coming here till some time next week she sat hesitant irresolute listening to the mad cacophony of the hooter out of her window she saw people in the street all streaming down towards the yard mr williams came into his office a sheaf of invoices in hand he sat down at his table opened a ledger presently he raised his head and looked at her theyre saying that your mr warrens in the town he said mildly are ye no going down to meet him then she too left her desk and ran with the rest
