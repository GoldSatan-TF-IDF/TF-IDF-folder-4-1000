when i shoved through the doorway of morleys joy house youd have thought i was the old dude in black who lugs the sickle the place went dead quiet i stopped moving i couldnt push uphill against the weight of all those stares somebody sneak lemons into your salads quick check of the talent it looked like somebody with an ugly stick had gone berserk that or those guys spent a lot of time diving into walls and shaving themselves with hatchets i saw enough scars and bent noses to open me a sideshow the joy house boasts that kind of clientele aw damn its garrett that was my pal puddle safe behind the bar here we go again troops puddle goes twoeighty maybe more his skin is the hue of somebody whos been dead awhile you ask me rigor mortis set in above the neck twenty years back several dwarves an ogre miscellaneous elves and a couple of guys of indeterminate ancestry chugged their sauerkraut cocktails and headed for the door guys i didnt even know guys who knew me did their damnedest to pretend they didnt a murmur spread as the ones who didnt know me got clued in what a charge for the ego call me typhoid garrett hi everybody i chirped going for cheerful aint it a grand night out it wasnt it was raining cats and dogs and the critters were quarreling all the way to the ground i had dents in my head from random volleys of hailstones not being bright enough to wear a hat on the plus side flash floods might clear the garbage festering in the streets some of that was ready to get up and walk the city ratmen get lazier every day hey garrett come on over well a friendly face saucerhead old buddy old pal i steered for the shadowy corner table tharpe shared with another guy i hadnt spotted him because of the gloom back there even close up i couldnt make much of tharpes companion the guy wore heavy black robes like some species of priest complete with cowl he exuded gloom like a miasma he wasnt the kind youd have over to liven up a party drag up a chair tharpe said i dont know why hes called saucerhead he dont like it much but ranks it higher than waldo which a parent or two hung on him i planted my behind tharpes companion observed seems youre less than welcome here are you diseased he wasnt just gloomy he was forthright a social handicap worse than bad breath ha saucerhead snorted hahaha thats good licks hell thiss garrett i told you about him the mist begins to clear but not around him it didnt im starting to feel a little hurt here i said youre wrong louder youre all of you wrong im not working im not into anything i just thought id drop in and catch up on my friends they didnt believe me at least nobody cracked wise about me not having any friends saucerhead said if youd come around and socialize sometimes instead of just when youre up to your crack in crocodiles maybe folks would smile when they saw you grumble grumble hard to argue with that youre looking good garrett lean and mean still working out yeah more grumbles i dont much like work especially not workouttype work i figure in any rational world a man will get all the exercise he needs catching his share of blonds brunettes and redheads got it so far im garrett investigator and confidential agent not animated by any overwhelming ambition with a penchant for figures of a certain kind and a knack for stumbling into things friends and acquaintances dont find enthralling im a young thirty sixfeettwo gingerhaired and blueeyed and the dogs dont howl when i go by though the hazards of my profession have left traces which give my face character i say im charming my friends disagree say i just wont take life serious well you do too much of that and you end up as dark as this friend of saucerheads puddle arrived with a huge tankard of my favorite food that divine elixir that makes it necessary for me to work out hed drawn it from his private keg hidden behind the bar the joy house doesnt serve anything but rabbit food and the squeezings thereof morley dotes is a rabid vegetarian i took a long drink of bitter beer youre a prince puddle i fished out a silver mark yeah im in line for the throne he didnt pretend to make change a prince indeed you could buy a pony keg wholesale for that the price of silver being what it is how come youre in here instead of gamboling through acres of redheads my last big case involved whole squads of that delightful subspecies unfortunately only one of the bunch turned out palatable redheads are that way theyre either devils or angels and the angels are no angels i think its because they try living up to an image from an early age gamboling puddle where did puddle pick up a word like gamboling the man had trouble with his own name on account of it had more than one syllable you been going to school or something puddle just grinned i asked what is this teak on tommy tucker night with easygoing old garrett playing tommy puddles grin widened into an unappealing smear of rotten and missing teeth he was one guy who should convert and become one of morleys bornagain vegetarians saucerhead said you make yourself a fat target i must for everybody you hear what dean did dean is the old boy who keeps house for me and my partner and cooks for me hes about seventy hed make somebody a fine wife while we jawed tharpes tablemate filled and tamped filled and tamped the biggest damn pipe i ever saw it had a bowl like a bucket puddle snagged a brass coal bucket off the bar licks used copper tongs to transfer one small coal to his pipe he puffed clouds of weed smoke potent enough to sky us all musicians saucerhead muttered as though that explained the ills of the world i didnt hear garrett whats he done now found you another cat dean was going through a straycollecting spell id had to get firm to keep from ending up up to my belt buckle in cat hair worse he says hes moving in like i dont get a vote and he goes on about it like hes making some kind of supreme sacrifice saucerhead chuckled there goes your extra room no place left to stash you a spare honey poor baby gots to make do with one at a time grumble grumble aint like im overstocked i been doing with none at a time since tinnie and winger ran into each other on my front steps puddle laughed heathen tharpe asked what about maya i havent seen her in six months i think she left town its me and eleanor now eleanor is a painting on my office wall i love the gal but she has her limitations everybody thought my situation was hilarious except tharpes friend he wasnt hearing anybody but himself anymore he started humming i decided he couldnt be much of a musician he couldnt carry a tune in a handcart puddle stopped snickering long enough to say i knew you was up to something not your usual but you still looking to get bailed out damnit i just wanted out of the house dean is driving me buggo and the dead man wont take a nap on account of hes expecting glory mooncalled to do something and he dont want to miss the news i defy anybody to put up with those two for half as long as i have yeah you do got a hard life saucerhead sneered my heart goes out tell you what ill trade you i take your place you take mine ill throw in billie billie being his current flame a little bit of a blond with temper enough for a platoon of redheads do i detect a note of disenchantment no you detect the whole damned opera thanks anyway maybe next time saucerheads place was a oneroom walkup without furniture enough for company i lived in places like that before i scored big enough to buy the house i share with the dead man saucerhead tucked his thumbs into his belt leaned back smirked and nodded nodded and smirked a smirk on his ugly face is a wonder to behold he ever holds one too long the crown might declare it a national park he claims hes all human but from his size and looks youve got to suspect he has a little troll or giant in him you aint ready to deal garrett i cant say i got a lot of sympathy for you i couldve gone to some secondrate swillhouse and drowned my sorrows in ardent spirits pouring my woes into the ears of sympathetic strangers but no i had to come down here that works for me puddle kicked in when i hit the part about ardent spirits dont let us hold you up i never did count him as a friend he just came with my friend morley though morleys friendship can be suspect enough you take the joy out of the joy house puddle hey garrett the place was rocking till you walked in saucerheads pal licks wasnt even gurgling now but he kept puffing like a volcano and grinning i was getting the smoke secondhand but was ready to start humming myself i lost track of what i was saying started wondering why the place was called the joy house which made it sound a lot more exotic than the vegetarian hangout it is licks suddenly shot up like hed been goosed he headed for the door sort of floating as though his toes barely reached the floor id never seen anyone do weed so heavy i asked tharpe whered you find him licks he found me him and some other guys want to organize the musicians say no more i could imagine their interest in saucerhead tharpe makes his living convincing people his technique involves bending limbs in unnatural directions two or three morleys descended the stair from the second floor staring toward licks as the musician hit the exit morley had heard about me puddle had warned him through the speaking tube to his office upstairs hard to tell through the smoke but dotes looked irked morley is a breed part darkelf part human the elf side dominates hes short trim so handsome its a sin and sin he does as often as he can with anybodys wife wholl hold still hed grown a little pencilstroke mustache he had his black hair slicked back he was dressed to kill though his type looks good in anything he drifted our way showing a lot of pointy teeth whats that thing living under your nose saucerhead offered a crude suggestion morley ignored him you quit working garrett you havent been around why work if i dont have to i tried looking smug though my finances werent comfortable it costs to keep house you have something going he occupied the chair vacated by licks waved at persistent weed smoke not hardly i gave him my sad tale of woe he laughed too imaginative garrett i almost believe you i have to admit when you make them up they sound like things that could happen so what is it something hushhush i havent heard about anything shaking this towns getting dull he talked that long only because i was stammering damn not you too you never come around except when you need muscle to hoist you out of a hole youve dug yourself not fair not true ive even gone so far as to eat some of the cow chow his joint serves once i even paid for it you dont believe me then tell me this wheres the woman what woman dotes and saucerhead and puddle all grinned like shiteating possums thought they had me on the run you claim im working wheres the woman i get into one of my weird cases theres always a lovely around right so you see a honey on my arm hell my lucks so bad id almost go to work just to huh they werent paying attention they were staring at something behind me she liked black she wore a black raincloak over a black dress she wore hightop black boots raindrops shimmered like diamonds in her raven hair she wore black leather gloves i imagined shed lost a black hat and veil somewhere everything about her was black except her face that was as pale as bone she was about fivesix she was young she was beautiful she was frightened i said im in love morleys sense of humor deserted him he told me you dont want anything to do with her garrett shell get you dead the womans gaze arrogant from amazing black eyes passed over us as though we didnt exist she chose to perch at a table isolated from those that were occupied some of morleys patrons shivered as she passed pretended they didnt see her interesting i looked some more she was about twenty she wore lip paint so red it looked like fresh blood that and her pallor gave me a chill but no no vampire would dare tunfaires inhospitable streets i was intrigued why was she afraid why did she scare those thugs know her morley no i dont but i know who she is so shes the kingpins kid i saw her out there last month chodos daughter i was stunned also a lot less romantically inclined chodo contague is tunfaires emperor of crime if its on societys underbelly and theres a profit in it chodo has a piece of it yes you went out there you saw him yes he sounded a little vague there hes really alive then id heard but id had trouble believing it see my last case the one with all the redheads ended up with me and my friend winger and chodos two top lifetakers going after the bastard winger and i took a powder before the dirty deed figuring wed be next if we hung around when we left crask and sadler had the old boy ready to go on the meathook but it hadnt taken chodo was still boss wazoo crask and sadler were still his top headcrushers like theyd never had a thought of putting him to sleep that worried me chodo had seen me plain enough he wasnt the forgiving sort chodos daughter whats she doing in a dump like this what do you mean a dump like this you cant even hint that the joy house might be less than top of the mark without morley gets his back up i mean obviously she thinks shes a class act whatever you or i think shes got to figure thiss a dive this isnt the hill morley its the safety zone thats morleys neighborhood the safety zone its an area where folks of disparate species get together for business reasons with a lessened risk of getting murdered its not your uppercrust part of town all the time were rattling our mouths whispering im trying to think of some good excuse for going over there and telling the girl shes made me her love slave and all the time im doing that my little voice is telling me dont make a damned fool of yourself any kid of chodos is going to be murder on the hoof i must have twitched morley grabbed my arm youre getting desperate hit the tenderloin common sense dont stick your hand in a fire i hung on to my ration of sense i settled back i had it under control but i couldnt help staring the front door exploded inward two very large brunos brought half the storm in with them they held the door open for a third man who came in slow like he was onstage he was shorter by a couple of inches but no less muscular somebody had used his face to draw a map with a knife one eye was halfshut permanently his upper lip was drawn into a perpetual sneer he radiated nasty oh boy morley said know them i know the type saucerhead said it for me dont we all the scarfaced guy looked around he spotted the girl he started moving somebody yelled shut the goddamned door the two heavies there took their first good look around and got a read on what kind of people hang out in a place like the joy house they shut the door i didnt blame them some very bad people hang out at morleys place scarface didnt care he approached the girl she refused to see him he bent whispered something she started then looked him in the eye she spat chodos kid for sure scarface smiled he was pleased he had him an excuse there wasnt a sound in the place when he yanked her out of the seat she betrayed pain by expression but didnt make a sound morley said thats it his voice was soft dangerous you dont mess with his customers scarface must not have known where he was he ignored morley most times thats a fatal error he was lucky maybe morley moved the thugs from the doorway got in his way dotes kicked one in the temple the guy was twice his size but went down like hed been whacked with a sledge the other one made the mistake of grabbing morley saucerhead and i started moving a second after dotes did we circled the action chasing the scarfaced character morley didnt need help and if he did puddle was behind the bar acquiring some engine of destruction rain hit me in the face like to drove me back inside it was worse than it had been when id arrived there saucerhead said pointing i spied the loom of a dark coach figures struggling as scarface tried to force the girl inside we pranced over me unlimbering my favorite oak headknocker as we went i never leave home without it eighteen inches long it has a pound of lead in its business end very effective and it dont usually leave bodies littering the street saucerhead beat me there he grabbed the scarfaced guy from behind twirled him around and threw him against the nearest building with a force that drowned the rattle of distant thunder i slithered into the vacated space grabbed the girl somebody was trying to drag her into the coach i slipped my left arm around her waist pulled pushed my headknocker past her figuring id pop a bad boy between the eyes i saw eyes all right eyes like out of some spook story full of green fire three times too big for the wizened little character who wore them he had to be a hundred and ninety but he was strong he hung on to the girls arm with hands like bird claws pulled her in despite her and me both i swished my billy around trying to avoid seeing those eyes because they were poisonous they scared hell out of me made me feel cold all the way down to my tailbone and i dont scare easy i got him a good one upside the head his grip weakened that gave me a chance to line up another shot i let him have it his mouth opened wide but instead of a scream butterflies poured out i mean like about a million and two butterflies so many the coach was filled they were all over me i stumbled back flailed around id never been bitten by a butterfly but who knew about the kind that come flapping out of some old geeks mouth saucerhead pulled the girl away from me tossed me back like a rag doll dived in there and pulled that old guy out you dont want to get in saucerheads way when hes riled he breaks things the old mans eyes had lost their fire saucerhead lifted him with one hand said what the hell you think youre pulling gramps and tossed him over to ricochet off the same wall that had been scarfaces undoing then tharpe went over and started kicking one for this guy one for that no finesse i heard ribs crack i figured i ought to calm him down before he killed somebody only i couldnt think how i didnt want to get in his way when he was in that mood and i still had a flock of soggy butterflies after me tharpe calmed himself down he grabbed the old man by the scruff of the neck and pitched him into the coach the old boy made a sound like a whipped puppy tharpe tossed scarf ace in on top of him then looked up there wasnt anybody on the drivers seat so he just whacked the nearest horse on the rump and yelled the team took off hunching down against the rain tharpe turned to me takes care of those clowns hey what happened to the girl she was gone damned ingrate theres a broad for you hell he looked up let the rain fall into his face a moment then said im going to get my stuff then what say you and me go get drunk and get in a fight i thought we just had a fight bah bunch of candyasses wimps come on i had no intention of going troublehunting but it did seem like a good idea to get in out of the rain away from the butterflies i told you i hadnt used up my ration of sense one of the two thugs was blocking the water flow in the gutter in front of morleys door the second came flying out as we started in hey tharpe yelled watch where youre throwing your trash i looked around inside the girl hadnt gone back in there morley and puddle and i settled down to wonder what it was all about saucerhead went off looking for a real challenge i did my best to get my moneys worth out of puddles keg while morley and i dissected cabbages and kings and butterflies and the old days that never were that good though id had me a moment now and then we solved the ills of the world but decided there was nobody in authority with sense enough to implement our program we were disinclined to take on the job ourselves women proved a topic of brief duration morleys recent luck undershone my own it was too much to take seeing that great blob puddle tipped back in his chair thumbs hooked in his belt grinning smugly in regard to his own endeavors the rain continued relentless at last i had to face facts i was going to get wet again i was going to get a lot wet if dean failed to respond to my pounding and whooping at the door with set jaw and scant optimism i took my leave of morley and his establishment dotes looked as smug as his man he was home already i hunched my chin down against my chest and wished id had the sense to wear a hat i wear one so seldom it doesnt occur to me to top myself off when that would be wise right away rain started sneaking down the back of my neck i paused where wed rescued chodos mysterious daughter from her more mysterious assailants there wasnt much light the rain had swept away most of the evidence i poked around and was on the verge of deciding half had been my imagination before i found one big bedraggled butterfly i salvaged the cadaver and carried it as carefully as i could cradled in my left palm my place is an old red brick house in a onceprosperous stretch of macunado street near wizards reach the middleclass types have all abandoned ship most of the neighboring places have been subdivided and rented to families with herds of kids usually when i approach my house i pause to inspect it and reflect on the good fortune that let me survive the case that paid me enough to buy it but cold rain down the back of the neck has a way of sapping nostalgia i scampered up the steps and gave the secret knock bambambam as hard as i could while bellowing open up dean im going to drown out here a big flash of lightning thunder rattled my teeth in their sockets the sky lords hadnt been feuding before just tuning up for another great flood thunder and lightning suggested they were about to get serious i pounded and yelled some more the stoop isnt protected from the weather maybe my ears were still ringing i thought i heard something like a kitten crying inside i knew it couldnt be a cat id given dean the word about his strays he wouldnt lapse i heard shuffling and whispering inside i did some more yelling open this damned door dean its cold out here i didnt threaten mom garrett didnt raise no kids dumb enough to lay threats on somebody who could just go back to bed and leave me singing in the rain the door creaked open after a symphony of curses and clanking bolts and rattling chains old dean stood there eyeing me from beneath drooping lids he looked about two hundred right then he is around seventy and real spry for a guy his age if he wasnt going to get out of the way i was going to walk over him i started moving he slid aside i told him the cat goes as soon as the rain stops i tried to sound like it was him or the kitten he started rattling bolts and chains i stopped all that hadnt been there before whats all the hardware i dont feel comfortable living somewhere where all there is is one or two latches to keep the thieves out we needed to have us a talk about assuming and presuming i knew damned well he didnt buy that hardware out of his own pocket but now wasnt the time i wasnt at my best whats that youve got id forgotten the butterfly drowned butterfly i took it into my office a shoe box of a room behind the last door to your left heading back to the kitchen dean hobbled after me bringing a candle he has decrepitude down to an art its amazing how incapacitated he gets when he has a scam running i used his candle to light a lamp go back to bed he glanced at the closed door of the small front room a door we shut only when theres somebody or something in there we dont want seen something was scratching its other side dean said im wideawake now i might as well get some work done he didnt look wideawake you plan to be up long no im just going to study this bug then kiss eleanor good night eleanor was a beautiful sad woman who lived once upon a time her portrait hangs behind my desk i go on like were into a relationship that drives dean buggy i have to balance the scale somehow i settled into my worn leather chair like everything else around my place including the house it was secondhand it was just getting adjusted to a new butt just getting comfortable i pushed my accounts aside spread the butterfly on my desk dean waited in the doorway till he saw i wouldnt react to the accounts being out then he huffed off to the kitchen i popped a quick peek at the last entry made a face that didnt look good but go to work gah sufficient unto the day the evil thereof meantime there was this raggedy old green butterfly it couldve been a beauty before but now its wings were cracked and chipped and split bent and washed out a disaster i suffered a moment of déjà vu id seen its cousins in the islands while i was doing my five years in the royal marines therere a lot in the swamps down there theres every kind of bug the gods ever imagined except maybe arctic roaches maybe creation was handled by a heavenly committee in areas where departmental turfs overlapped the divine functionaries went to competing and they all for sure dumped their bugproduction overruns in those tropical swamps but the heck with the bad old days im all growedup now what i had to ask was what was i doing with the flutterbug in the first place i was definitely for sure guaranteed not even a little bit interested in anything involving driedup old geezers with stomachs so sour they belched up butterflies id done my good deed for the decade id rescued the maiden fair it was time to get on with things dearer my heart like hustling deans latest fuzzball charity out my back door i swept the bug cadaver into the trash bucket leaned back started thinking how nice it would be to put myself away in my nice soft bed garrett hell every time i forget my socalled partner the dead man hangs out in the larger front room that takes up the whole front side of the house opposite my office an area as big as my office and the small front room together a lot of space for a guy who hasnt moved since before tunfaire was called tunfaire im thinking about putting him in the basement with the other junk that was here when i moved in i went into his room a lamp was burning there that was a surprise dean doesnt like going in there i glanced around suspiciously the room contains only two chairs and two small tables though the walls are hidden by shelves of books and maps and memorabilia one chair is mine the other has a permanent resident if you walk in not knowing what to expect the dead man can be a shock first theres just a whole hell of a lot of him four hundred and fifty pounds worth second hes not human hes loghyr since hes the only one of that tribe ive ever seen i dont know if hed set the loghyr girls swooning but by my standards hes one homely sucker like he was the practice dummy when the guy with the ugly stick was doing his apprenticeship after fat you notice hes got a snoot like an elephant fourteen inches long then you notice that the moths and mice have nibbled him over the years the reason hes called the dead man is that hes dead somebody stuck a knife in him about four hundred years ago but loghyr just dont get in a hurry his soul or whatever is still hanging around in his body i gather you have had an adventure since hes dead he cant talk but he doesnt let that slow him down he just thinks right into my head he can also go rummaging around in there amongst the clutter and spiders if he wants mostly hes courteous enough to keep out unless hes invited i took another look around the place was too clean dean had even dusted the dead man something was up those two had gotten their heads together that was a first that was scary im nothing if not cool i covered my suspicion perfectly knowing it was going to be something i wouldnt like i decided to get even first the dead man made a big mistake when he taught me to remember every little detail of everything when i was working i started talking about my evening the theoretical basis of our association is i do the legwork and suffer the slings and arrows and thumps on the head and he takes whatever i learn and runs it through his selfproclaimed genius brains and tells me whodunit or where the body is buried or whatever it is im trying to find out thats the theoretical basis in practice hes lazier than i am i have to threaten to burn the house down just to wake him up i was dwelling in lingering detail upon the charms of the strange miss contague when suspicion bit him garrett he knows me too well yes sweetly what are you doing filling you in on some odd occurrences occurrences incidentally of but passing interest unless your passions have overcome your brain yet again you could not possibly be considering involving yourself with those people could you i thought about lying just to rattle his chain we do a lot of that back and forth it passes the time but i said there are limits to how much ill let a skirt override my good sense indeed i am amazed and surprised i had concluded that you have no sense at all good or bad we do get going usually its play wit and halfwit its up to you to guess whos who one point for you old bones im going to go put myself on the shelf for the night if dean explodes in another mad burst of energy and decides to dust you again tell him he can wake me at noon i have this thing about mornings no sane man gets up then they come too damned early in the day think about it all those early birds out there what do they get ulcers heart trouble caught by homeless cats but not me not old garrett im going to lean back and relax and loaf my way to immortality i wish you could sleep in after your valiant rescue job and your heroic attempt to turn a profit off that puddle creature you deserve a reward why do i get the feeling youre about to stick it to me why shouldnt i sleep in i dont have anything else to do you have to be at the gate of the alkhar at eight oclock say what the alkhar is the city prison tunfaire is notoriously short on law enforcement and justice but once in a while some clown is so clumsy he stumbles into the arms of the watch once in a while some braindamage case actually gets himself some time what the hell for theres people up there dont like me if you were to avoid every place where someone does not like you you would have to leave town in order to find room to breathe you will be there because you have to tail a man who is to be released at eight i had it scoped out him and dean had found me work on account of they were worried about our dwindling funds the brassbottomed nerve they were both getting bigheaded but sometimes it helps to play dumb im a past master at playing dumb im so good i fool myself sometimes what would i want to do that for three marks a day and expenses it should take only a modicum of creativity to shift our household budget into the latter category i got down and peered under his chair there were still a couple little sacks down there we arent broke yet thats where we keep our cash theres no place safer any thief who gets past the dead man is somebody so bad i dont want to mess with him anyway if i kick dean and his cat out and cook for myself thatd be beer money for months garrett yeah yeah it really was getting time to hustle up some money only i didnt like the idea of jobs being handed to me im the senior partner in this chicken outfit the boss har tell me about it and while youre doing that put one of your spare brains to work thinking about who keeps a roof over whose ungrateful head phsaw do not be petty this is the ideal job a simple tail the client simply wishes to trace the movements of the convict right so this clown makes me leads me into an alley practices the latest dance steps on my face this man is not violent nor should he expect to be followed it is easy money garrett take it if its that easy why me why not saucerhead he always needs work i sent a lot his way we need the money get some rest you will be rising early maybe how come its me that has to get out and do the hustling but first how about you drop me one or two more hints here like maybe a description just in case more than one guy graduates from college tomorrow like maybe the initials of the guy whos hiring me so i can practice my deducing and figure out who im supposed to report to the client is one bishoff hullar oh great you got me working for a sleazy taxidance operator from the tenderloin bring me down in the world why dont you i used to play with real villains like chodo and his boys who do i follow somebody who stiffed one of his girls and why the target is one barking dog amato a colorful name gods barking dog you got to be kidding you know him not personally i know who he is i thought everybody over ten knew barking dog amato i do not get out much anymore i resisted temptation hed want me to be his wheels barking dog amato aka crackpot amato given name kropotkin f amato i dont know what the f stands for probably fruitcake the mans a total loony spends all his time hanging around the chancery steps with a brass megaphone yelling about how the powers that be swindled his ancestors hes got a whole roadshow he hauls around signs and banners and displays he hands out broadsides to anybody who gets close enough to let him shove one at him hes got conspiracy theories that boggle master conspiracy theorists he can connect anything up with anything and produce a diabolical plot to rule the world or fleece kropotkin amato of his birthright hes big on the emperor being behind everything the empire that preceded the karentine state fell ages ago but theres still an imperial family hanging around awaiting the call its only influence on todays world is it provides some small funding for the bledsoe charity hospital nobody but barking dog could imagine them being secret masters of anything interesting entertaining in small doses but if you get too close youll get grabbed and told the whole story of how his noble family got defrauded of its title and estates hell his father was a butcher down on winterslight his mother was some kind of breed out of the bustee the only conspiracy that victimized him was the one that got us all conscription and the war he started his barking after they mustered him out then the man is harmless a deluded fool thatd cover it as harmless deluded and foolish as they come one of our more entertaining street characters which is why they let him hang out with his megaphone how did this harmless fool get himself thrown into jail why would anyone want him shadowed can he be more than he seems i was working on that already it had been a while since id seen the barking dog in action but then i hadnt been onto his turf i hadnt missed him he wasnt the sort anyone would miss if he disappeared maybe once in a while somebody would ask whatever happened to that cacklehead what used to howl on the chancery steps hed get a shrug and forget it nobody would get excited and go looking i was sure barking dog would have inventive things to say about his prison time maybe devils from another world were after him now hed never rattled anybody from this world enough to get himself locked up maybe it was venageti secret agents or the little people or the gods themselves the god gang dont need excuses to turn malicious im going to bed chuckles i got out before he could change my mind muttering three marks a day to tail barking dog amato it cant be true the foot of the stairs is just a couple steps from the kitchen door i leaned in to wish dean a good night after you get rid of that cat start thinking about the floor in the dead mans room since you two are such good buddies now it could use sanding and refinishing he looked at me like he was seeing spooks i chuckled headed for bed he pulled any more stunts id have him in there for three months sanding and polishing and painting and generally getting himself a good dose of employer vengeance i hit my room shucked my clothes brooded about having to go to work for about as long as it took me to plop my head into my pillow insomnia isnt one of my shortcomings there are those old dean among them whose major personality flaw is a compulsion to spring up with the first bird chirp thats a dandy habit if youve got to get to the worms first me i swore off exotic chow when i parted ways with the corps i wont get into that situation again dean suffers from the delusion that sleeping till noon is a sin ive tried and tried to show him the light but his brain hardened along with his arteries he flat wont admit the truth of my theories no fool like an old fool i made the error of observing that aloud hell it was barely sunup you expect me to think at that time of night i got me a drizzle of ice water down my spine i screamed i cussed i said stuff to set dear old mom spinning in her grave i got up to no avail the old boy had him a head start i sat on the edge of my bed put my elbows on my knees and my forehead in my hands i asked the gods which i believe in once a week what id done to deserve dean hadnt i always been one of the good guys come on fellows lets all play a prank on the universe and let true justice reign for a day get that old sucker i blinked between the heels of my hands i glimpsed dean peeking around the doorframe time to get up mr garrett you have to be outside the alkhar in two hours ive started breakfast my suggestion about breakfast reversed the traditional alimentary process he wasnt impressed he clumped downstairs i groaned vigorously and stumbled to a window there was barely enough light to see the city ratmen were banging and clanging their trash carts while they pretended to do something useful a herd of dwarves hustled past carrying bundles bigger than they were they were a sullen surly silent gang see what getting up early does except for dwarves and street sweepers the thoroughfare was barren sane folk were still in bed only impending poverty kept me from easing back into mine what the hell i could turn old barking dog into a career anybody dumb enough to have him tailed deserved to have his purse looted sure be safer than most jobs that come my way i prettied myself up and moseyed downstairs i paused outside the kitchen to put on a heavyweight scowl though at that time of night if my rest is disturbed scowling comes naturally which did me no good i stepped into the smells of spicy sausages stewed apples fresh hot tea biscuits just out of the oven i didnt have a chance he wont cook like that when im not working im just hanging around its maybe a bowl of cold porridge developing a crust if i want fresh tea ive got to put the pot on myself what do you do with these workethic fanatics i mean i dont mind if he busts his butt working for me which ive never noticed him doing my problem is hes one of those characters who want to redesign the rest of us his ambition is to see me collapse from overwork rich before my thirtyfirst birthday im going to fool him that wont never come im going to stay thirty forever i ate too much dean hummed as he cleaned his pots he was happy i was employed i felt abused trivialized such a vast array of talents and skills wasted trailing a nut case it was like using a rosewood fourbyfour to swat flies dean was of such good cheer about my employment that he forgot to kvetch till i was halfway through my second helping of apples you go past the tate compound to get to the alkhar dont you mr garrett ohoh when he misters me he knows i wont like what hes got to say this time he was pretty transparent not today he was going to nudge me to make up with tinnie which i wasnt going to do on account of id decided i was done apologizing to women for things i didnt do tinnie wants to make up she knows where to find me but i got up something you need to think about dean maybe while youre finding a home for that cat and thats what youll do if i suddenly find me a wife to manage the house that would hold him i headed for the front door i didnt get there the dead mans voice rang in my head you are leaving without taking adequate precautions garrett he meant i was leaving the house unarmed i said im just going to follow a crazy man i wont get into trouble without bothering to go into his room he doesnt hear physically you never plan to get into trouble yet each time you assume that attitude and go out unprepared you end up wishing you had had the foresight to carry something is that not so that was uncomfortably close to the truth i wished it wasnt i wished we lived in a more civilized age but wishing never makes anything so i went upstairs to my closet of unpleasantries where i keep the tools i use when the tools i prefer my wits fail me i grumbled all the while and wondered why i resisted good advice i guess i resented the fact that i hadnt thought of it myself lessons you dont want to learn come hard tunfaire is not a nice city i hit the street in a black humor i wasnt going to make the city any nicer like most public buildings in this town the alkhar is generations overdue for renovation it looks like the prisoners could walk through the walls if they wanted the alkhar was a bad idea from the beginning a porkbarrel project making somebody rich through cost overruns and corner cutting the builder used a pale yellowgreen stone that absorbed grunge from the air reacted with it streaked turned uglier by the hour and did not stand up being too soft it chipped and flaked dropping talus all around the prison leaving the walls with a poxy appearance in places thered been mortar decay enough that stones were loose since the city hardly ever jailed anybody there seemed to be no financial provision for prison maintenance it was raining still though now the fall was just a drizzle just enough to be a misery i posted myself under a forlorn lime tree as downandout as any alleydwelling ratman it didnt know the season but its sad branches offered the only shelter around i recalled my marine corps training and faded into my surroundings garrett the chameleon right i was early not something that happens often but since i started my exercises i move a little faster with more energy maybe i should go for a mental workout too develop some energy and enthusiasm in that direction the trouble with me is my work investigating exposes you to the slimy underbelly of the world being a weak character i try to make things better to strike the occasional spark in the darkness i have a notion my reluctance to work springs from the knowledge that if i do ill see more of the worlds dark side that ill butt heads with the truth which is that people are cruel and selfish and thoughtless and even the best will sell their mothers at the right time the big difference between good guys and bad is the good guys havent yet had a fat chance for profiting from going bad a bleak world view unfortunately reinforced by events almost daily a bleak view thats scary because it keeps on telling me my turn is coming a bleak street that dirty cobbled lane past the alkhar very little traffic that was true even in good weather ive felt less lonely less touched by despair alone in the woods the street was a problem professionally as well as emotionally i didnt blend in people would start wondering and maybe remembering though they wouldnt come outside people in this town avoid trouble barking dog came stomping out of prison thumbs tucked into his belt he paused surveyed the world with a prisoners eye he was about fivefeetsix sixtyish chunky balding had a brushy graying mustache and ferocious huge eyebrows his skin was tanned from decades in the elements denouncing conspiracies prison hadnt faded him his clothes were old and tattered and filthy the same hed worn when hed gone inside the alkhar doesnt offer uniforms barking dog so far as i knew had no relatives to bring him anything his gaze swept me he didnt react he raised his face enjoyed the drizzle then started moving i gave him half a block before i followed he had a unique way of walking he was bowlegged he had arthritis or something he sort of rolled along lifting one whole side of his body swinging it forward following with the other i wondered if he hurt much prison wouldnt do wonders for arthritis barking dog wasnt in a hurry he ambled savoring his freedom id hang out in the rain myself enjoying it if id been locked up but i wasnt terribly empathic at the moment i muttered and sputtered and grumbled such thoughtlessness keeping a crack investigator out in the rain wasnt his fault though was it i started plotting vengeance on the dead man always an interesting mental exercise that what sanctions can you exercise against somebody whos been murdered arent many options left even us masters of the game get sloppy its easy when you dont feel threatened i didnt feel threatened barking dog wasnt the kind of street bruno i run into ordinarily somebody big as a house and half as smart and just as easy to shove around barking dog was damned near a little old man little old men dont get violent or if they do they pay some big stupid bruno to do it for them i strutted around a corner and oooph right in the breadbasket lucky for me barking dog was damned near a little old man and little old men dont get violent i folded up tried to prance away from his followup wonder of wonders i made it he was after all damned near a little old man i gagged and hacked and got my breath back meantime barking dog added things up and decided he hadnt gotten enough oomph on his punch and his best move now was to apply heels and toes vigorously to the cobblestones not unwise tactics considering the mood i was in all of a sudden i got me trundling after him lucky me id been working out so i was in good enough shape to come back quickly before long i was keeping up then i started gaining ground barking dog looked back only once he saved his energy for streaking away me i started taking corners more carefully it didnt take me long to catch up grab him by the shoulder block his futile blows and force him to sit on somebodys steps what the hell was that for i demanded he looked at me like i was a fool maybe he was right i hadnt exercised a lot of wisdom so far he didnt answer me it didnt look like he was planning to make a break so i sat me down beside him far enough off so he couldnt cream me with a backhand that hurt guy how come that look again what you take me for bruno oh that hurt more than the whack in the gut im an experienced investigator not a street thug a crazy old man aint got sense enough to get in out of the rain im one with nature you going to get to it to what the threats the armtwisting ha my turn to do the looking you dont fool me with that dumb look somebody sent you to keep me from telling the truth craftily i asked what truth would that be craftier he told me if they didnt tell you they dont want you to know wouldnt want to get you in as deep as i am crazy and i was sitting there talking to him in the rain downwind they hadnt given him a scrubbing before they turned him loose no threats i dont care what you do he didnt understand hows come youre dogging me to see where you go get him with a new technique tell the truth confuse him all to hell it worked he was puzzled why damned if i know guy paid my partner who took the job without consulting me naturally hes housebound so im the one out here drowning he believed me probably because i wasnt twisting limbs whod want to know that he seemed lost nobody takes me serious hardly nobody anyway i checked to see if we were drawing a crowd barking dog had one voice level loud like hed been yelling so long that was all he could do too i wondered what theyd fed him in jail he had breath like a buzzard not to mention he wasnt appetizing visually what with his wild eyebrows mustache bulbous nose and buggy eyes at least he didnt try to handbill me or want me to sign a petition might as well push my experiment to the limit guy called bishoff hullar who i dont know no bishoff hullar runs a taxidance scam in the tenderloin he looked at me queer sure i was lying or crazy then he frowned a nominee of course say what a nominee a standin who hired you for somebody else he began nodding grinning somebody was out to get him he liked that idea after all these years somebody was out to get him somebody was taking him seriously he was about to be persecuted probably so id never spent much time wondering about barking dog occasionally id given thought to whether or not he believed what he said it was common knowledge his claims about his family were exaggerated none of his conspiracy claims had borne fruit and that in a town where everybody who was somebody wanted scandal ammunition to use against other somebodies nobody tried to shut him up what did they nick you for what the hell i wasnt going to get much wetter and the damp was toning down the miasma around amato sixty days a comedian what was the charge its a matter of record wouldnt take me an hour to get the story he mumbled something what public nuisance he didnt boom this time either they dont give you two months third complaint his excitement over being persecuted had faded now he was embarrassed he was a convicted public nuisance even so more than a few days seems excessive i kind of got carried away at my hearing fiftyfive days were for contempt heavy time even so the magistrates i knew were pretty contemptible they ran their courts like feeding time at the zoo it would take some barking to aggravate any of them i recalled outrageous claims id heard amato make yep he had run into somebody with no sense of humor somebody who didnt know barking dog was a genuine loony harmless in the extreme nobody else could get away with the stuff he said maybe you were lucky i told him you get somebody really pissed they could toss you into the bledsoe part of the charity hospital is a madhouse you get stuffed in there you wont get out unless somebody outside springs you there are plenty of stories about people who have gone in and been forgotten for decades barking dog went pale under his tan that scared him he started to leave hang on oldtimer he settled resigned he thought the threat had come the bledsoe just sitting there beside him talking to him id begun to feel like a candidate for the cackle factory you wont talk eh no i shook my head water from my hair dribbled into my eyes im getting paid which maybe ought to be enough but id sure like a hint why im spending time with you i suspected that on reflection hed decided that he didnt know a cold drizzle can be a great cure for a case of the fantasies my thoughts flitted like drunken butterflies trying to make sense of what was happening the only answers i found were that this was a practical joke or a mistake or a sinister plot or something it couldnt be the job advertised i heard the dead man three marks a day and expenses i hadnt thought to ask if wed taken a retainer whatre your plans i asked right now youre going to get wet son first im going to go see if i still got me a place to live if i do then im going to go buy me a bottle and get drunk you want to hang around wait for me to sneak off and make contact with your bosss secret enemies you just go ahead he spoke with conviction when he mentioned getting drunk that wouldnt be the first thing id go for after leaving jail but he was maybe a little past catching honeys as a second choice it didnt sound bad how about tomorrow tomorrow its back to the old grind unless its raining then ill stay in and make the acquaintance of another bottle i got up lets walk over where you live then get you tucked in then ill see this hullar clown find out whats shaking nobody likes being made a fool and i was developing the sneaking suspicion id done it to myself i shouldve asked more questions when i was talking to the dead man i decided to start with him work my way back to bishoff hullar dean let me in what in the world are you doing home he hoisted his nose at the dripping i did need to consult the genius i pushed past but hung a surprise left into the small front room huh no cat no sign of a cat but i smelled it dean shuffled from foot to foot i gave him my most evil look pretended to twist a neck to the accompaniment of dramatic noises i headed for the dead mans room he was pretending to sleep i knew he wasnt he wouldnt nod off before he heard the latest from the cantard he was obsessed with glory mooncalled and expected news of the republican generals adventures momentarily i went inside anyway dean hustled in with a raggedy blanket he tossed over my chair so it wouldnt get wet i settled stared at the dead man said thats a pity him drifting off just when we finally hear something from the war zone make me a quick cup of tea before i hit the street again what news from the cantard you are a treacherous beast garrett the treacherousest as bad as the kind of guy whod send you out to follow a nut case as a joke joke you can come clean i wont hold a grudge ill even admit it was a good one you had me out there for hours before i figured it out i hate to disappoint you garrett but the fact is we have been hired to report the movements of barking dog amato the client paid a fiftymark retainer come on i admitted it was a good one let up it is true garrett though now seeing the thoughts and reservations and questions rambling across the surface of your mind i grow curious myself i wonder if i too have not been the victim of an elaborate hoax somebody really paid fifty marks to have amato watched there would be nothing under my chair otherwise i was sure he wouldnt take a joke that far you didnt ask questions no not the questions you wish i had had i known what a barking dog amato was i would have asked them somebody had begun pounding on the front door dean apparently was too busy to be bothered wait a minute i looked through the peephole first id learned the hard way i saw two women one was hugging herself shivering neither seemed to enjoy the weather i opened up can i help you ladies i used ladies poetically the younger had twenty years on me both were squeaky clean and wore their finest but their finest was threadbare and years out of style they were gaunt and threadbare themselves one had a trace of nonhuman blood both put on nervous smiles as though id startled them by being something they didnt expect the younger screwed up her courage are you saved brother huh have you been born again have you accepted mississa as your personal savior huh i didnt have the foggiest what the hell was going on i didnt even realize they were talking religion that doesnt play much part in my life i ignore all the thousand gods whose cults plague tunfaire so far ive seldom been disappointed in my hope that the gods will ignore me apparently my not slamming the door was great encouragement both women started chattering being a naturally polite sort of guy i halfway listened till i got the drift then i grinned inspired come in come in i introduced myself i shook their hands i turned on the old garrett charm they became uneasy almost to the point of suspicion i probed only deeply enough to make sure their brand of salvation wasnt limited to humans most of the cults are racist most of the nonhuman races hold to no gods at all i confessed im not free to entertain a new system of beliefs myself but i do know someone who should see you my partner is the most ungodly sort you can imagine he needs let me caution you hes stubborn in his wickedness ive tried and tried youll see please come with me would you like tea my housekeeper just put the kettle on they chattered steadily themselves what i had to say mostly got shoved in in snatches they followed me i had a hell of a time keeping a straight face i sicced them on the dead man i didnt stay around to watch the fur fly as i hit the rain i wondered if hed ever speak to me again but who needed spiritual guidance more he was dead already already headed down the path to heaven or hell but the grin on my clock wasnt any smug celebration of my ingenuity id had me another attack of inspiration i knew how to turn the barking dog business into a scam that would make us both happy the man could read and write he did his own signs and broadsides and he was harmless and he needed money id seen that where he lived so why not have him keep track of himself i could hand his journal over to my client split my fee with barking dog save myself hunking around in the weather the more i thought about that the more i liked it and whod know the difference so the heck with bishoff hullar i wouldnt press my luck there id stay away except to collect i chose a new destination i went off to sell barking dog i didnt anticipate any trouble i would appeal to his sense of conspiracy some white knight eh our hero thirdstring con artist i didnt suffer much guilt the bishoff hullars of the world deserve what they get hell before i got to barking dogs place i was chuckling some of us take a notion were what the world perceives us to be so we create images the world feeds back you see it especially with kids you get some pathetic louse of a parent always sniping at his kid telling him hes no good and dumb pretty soon hes got a dumb nogood kid thats your oneway version im talking about creating yourself i worked at it not always consciously when i wanted the world to think i was bad i didnt make my bed i changed my socks only once a week i cleaned house once a year whether the place needed it or not when i wanted to look real mean i stopped brushing my teeth barking dog must have lived in those same two rooms for about eleven thousand years without cleaning once the place could become a museum where mothers showed their kids why they ought to pick up after themselves the smell suggested it was the one place in tunfaire not infested by vermin the smell was the smell of barking dog amato confined and reinforced by time and made heavier by oppressive humidity barking dog had no handle on the principles of hygiene thank whatever gods hed been out of there awhile id never seen that much paper anywhere not even in the offices of royal functionaries once barking dog muffed both sides of a handbill sheet he flipped the cull over his shoulder when he brought in food its wrappings paper or cornhusk joined the rejected handbills the broken cadavers of earthenware wine bottles lay everywhere unscathed survivors apparently were returned for the deposits the entire history of barking dog amato lay there in sedimentary layers ready to be excavated by a historical adventurer unencumbered by a sense of smell i took that in at a glance after amato invited me in i wasted a second glance on his furniture that amounted to an artists easel where he painted posters and placards and a rickety table where he calligraphed handbills a semiclear corner boasted a ragged blanket two steps inside i saw that id leapt to an erroneous conclusion barking dog did indeed clean house there was a second room with no door in its doorway where he moved his trash whenever his primary got too deep he didnt apologize he seemed unaware that his housekeeping varied from the norm he just asked what did you find out from that hullar i didnt go see him what happened was i had an idea you didnt strain nothing doing that it must be on my forehead in glowing letters that dont show up in a mirror youll like it be good for both of us heres the plan i told him how we could make a few marks his eye developed a malicious twinkle son im maybe gonna like you after all you aint as dumb as you look its my disguise i grumped want to do it why not i can always use an extra mark but dont you figure we ought to go fiftyfifty when i got to take time out of my busy schedule to do all the work i figure the splits fine at two for me and one for you i have the contract ill have to rewrite whatever you give me and ill have to hike over to the tenderloin to deliver it barking dog shrugged he didnt argue found money he muttered speaking of money how do you live not to mention pay for all that paper even junk paper isnt cheap papermaking is a laborintensive industry maybe theres some with enough sense to see the truth and want to spread it he glowered he wasnt going to tell me squat could be a helpful believer tunfaire boasts a fine crop of lunatics with more ripening daily or maybe he was stealing paper or maybe he had a fortune stashed with the gnomish bankers you never know in this town almost nobody is what he seems i answered surliness with a shrug ill catch you every couple days yeah hey maybe you could give me a hand only at long range his breath had taken on new freight a heavy wine odor that combined with its previous fetor in a lethal gas maybe we could bottle it and send it to the cantard it could discourage entire venageti brigades how some religious nut grabbed my spot while i was away set up next to him stick close outlast him the mans faith wouldnt outlast barking dogs aroma that dont work then ask me all right he was doubtful he couldnt smell himself his nostrils were corroded to the bone see you i had to get out my eyes were watering my nose was running my head was spinning i didnt hurry home i let the rain rinse the smell off me i wondered if it would ever stop raining should i invest in a boat the weather had a bright side flying thunderlizards hadnt pestered tunfaire since the rains started everyone cheered when those monsters first appeared they gobbled rats and cats and squirrels and most especially pigeons pigeons dont have many fans but the thunderlizards shared some of the pigeons worst habits the missiles they launched were both larger and more precisely targeted there was talk of bounties the monsters tended to be attracted by the hill where the rich and powerful live they favor high places the upper classes and thunderlizards both if the latter had had the sense to stick to the slums there would have been no dangerous talk the only warning was deans smirk filled with so much childish malice i knew something was going on garrett ohoh id forgotten id left him with those evangelists i considered taking a powder but hell it was my house a man is king in his own castle i stepped into the dead mans room yeah sit down i sat warily he was too calm have you contemplated the state of your immortal soul i believe i screeched next thing i knew i was headed down the hall staring back at his closed door with bugged eyes somewhere a cat meowed this couldnt be happening to me it wasnt real i was going crazy if this kept up id be out there howling at the sky alongside barking dog it got worse i ducked into the kitchen for a beer found dean at the table having tea with the religion women one had a kitten in her lap dean seemed spellbound by the ropes of sand the other was spinning the cat woman said wont you join us mr garrett we were just sharing the wonderful news with dean wont you share the joy with us too joy she was as joyous as the piles she didnt know the meaning of the word the fraud she was smiling but that was a domino everything behind it was holierthanthou sour she would remain constipated as long as she suffered the suspicion that somebody somewhere was having a good time sorry some other time im just going to grab a biscuit and run i knew her kind a barking dog with a bath only her fantasy contained a harsh metallic flavor of violence barking dog was determined to expose imaginary devils she wanted to scourge them with fire and sword yet she was painfully formal and polite if i stopped moving for a second she would pin me and soon drive me over the edge she wouldnt let go till id gotten so damned rude id be embarrassed for a month i grabbed my biscuit and fled to my office i asked eleanor you havent gone gaga on me too have you she gave me her best enigmatic look i settled behind my desk things were falling apart around me i had to take charge before chaos conquered all i had to get this stormtossed ship back on a steady keel it was my own damn fault trying to pull a fast one on the dead man i groaned id just gotten comfortable and now somebody was pounding on the front door nobody ever comes around except to see me nobody ever wants to see me unless they want me to work nobody ever wants me to work except when ive just gotten comfortable then my attitude improved maybe it was more evangelists i could turn the new bunch loose on the pack already infesting the place they could go to the theological mattresses right here i could have a ringside seat while they fought it out toe to illogical toe see im an optimist whoever said i always look on the dark side i did right well when you do that your life fills with pleasant surprises and seldom are you disappointed answering the door provided one of the disappointments i did peep through the peephole first i did know i wouldnt be happy once i opened up but i didnt have much choice his name was westman block he was the law such as the law is in tunfaire he was a captain of that same watch that couldnt catch anyone more dangerous than barking dog amato i knew him slightly which was too well he knew me we didnt like each other but i respected him more than i did most watchmen when he took a bribe he stayed bought he wasnt too greedy i opened up captain i nearly didnt recognize you out of uniform polite i can manage it sometimes i glanced around he was alone amazing his bunch run in crowds thats one of their survival skills can we talk he was a small thin character with short brown hair graying around the edges there was nothing remarkable about him except that he seemed worried and he was almost polite hed never been polite to me before i was suspicious immediately a healthy dose of paranoia never hurts when you deal with the westman blocks i have company captain lets walk then and dont call me captain please i dont want anyone guessing who i am damn he was working hard usually he talked like a longshoreman its raining out there cant put anything past you can they no wonder you have that reputation see just not my day i pulled the door shut without bothering to holler to dean what did i have to worry about i had a heavenly host on guard why dont we scare up a beer then i feel the need for about a keg taken in one big gulp be quicker if we just walk his little blue eyes were chips of ice he didnt like me but he was working hard not to offend me he wanted something bad i noted that hed acquired a little mustache like morleys must be something going around all right im a civicminded kind of guy but maybe you could drop me one little hint you figured it already garrett i know you i need a favor i hate to ask for a big favor i got a problem whether i like it or not youre probably the only guy i know of can solve it i think that was a compliment really i swelled with newfound power it almost matched the growth of my paranoia im the kind of guy gets really nervous when my enemies start making nice on me yeah he grumbled something that must have been in a foreign language because no gentleman would use words like the words i thought i heard watch officers are all gentlemen just ask them theyll clue you in good while they pick your pocket what id better just show you it isnt far i touched myself here and there making sure i was still carrying after a block during which he muttered to himself block said we got a power struggle shaping up up top garrett what else is new we havent had a big shakeup or a king bite the dust for a couple years but overall we change rulers more often than barking dog changes clothes theres a reform faction forming i see bad news for his bunch grim you see what i mean yeah id heard grumblings myself but those were there all the time down here in the real world we dont take them seriously all part of politics nobody really wants change too many people have too much to lose glad you do because we got something come up that gots to be tooken care of fast we got the word else its going to be our balls in a vise see he even talked like a gentleman where do i come in i hate to admit it but there aint none of us knows what to do damn he was in trouble he was scared they must have showed him a vise heated red hot with ground glass in its jaws i put in some time thinking you was the only answer you know what to do and youre straight enough to do it if i can get you to i didnt say anything i knew i wasnt going to like what i was about to hear keeping my mouth shut kept my options open marvelous the restraint i showed in my old age you help us out with this garrett you wont be sorry well see youre taken care of feewise and youll be covered with the watch from here on in well now that would be useful ive had my troubles with the watch one time they laid siege to my house it took some doing to work that one out right so what is it i had a creepy feeling didnt take a genius to figure it would be something big and nasty i better just show you he insisted despite his finesounding offer i was liking this less and less we walked only a mile but that mile took us over the edge of the world into another reality into the antechamber of hell the bustee now i understood why he was out of uniform tunfaire boasts peoples of almost every intelligent race mostly they clump like with like in closed neighborhoods likewise with humans not of the ethnic majority breeds fall into the cracks live in between catch as catch can often welcome nowhere twothirds of the city is ghetto slum poverty is the norm but the bustee is to those slums as the slums are to the hill people there live in tents made of rags or in shanties put together from sticks and mud and trash scavenged before the ratmen could collect it or they cram in a hundred to the building meant for five or ten two hundred years ago when the structure had windows and doors and flooring that hadnt yet been torn up to burn for heat during the winter they lived in doorways and on the street some so poor they didnt have a grass mat for a mattress they lived amidst unimaginable filth the ratmen wouldnt go in there without protection the soldiers wouldnt go in less than companystrong if at all too many soldiers had come out of there and wouldnt go back even to visit the bustee is the bottom you cant roll downhill any farther you roll that far chances are youll never climb back not till the dead wagons come only the deathmen are safe in the bustee each day they come with their wagons wearing their long gray robes with the veils that conceal their faces to collect the dead from the streets and alleys they chant bring out your dead bring out your dead as they work they wont leave the streets to collect they load their wagons and make their deliveries to the city crematoriums they work from dawn to dusk but every day they get a little farther behind death in the bustee is as ugly as life in the bustee there is no commodity cheaper than life in the bustee there is only one commodity of any value at all young men hard young men who have survived the streets these fellows are the only real beneficiaries of the cantard war they enlist as soon as theyre able and use their bonuses to get whoever they can out of hell then despite their hard and undisciplined youths they work hard at being good soldiers if theyre good soldiers they can make enough to keep their families out they go down to the cantard and die like flies to keep their families out that such love should flourish let alone survive in the bustee is ever an amazement to me frankly i dont understand how it does in the more affluent slums youth seems to victimize those closest to it first another world the bustee they do things differently there block stopped walking i halted he seemed to be having trouble getting his bearings i looked around nervously we looked too prosperous but the streets were deserted maybe it was the rain but i doubted that there was something in the air this way block said i followed ever more alert we saw no one till i spotted a pair of obvious watchmen though out of uniform peeking from a narrow passageway between two buildings that might have been important back at the dawn of time they were as big as they get in the bustee the men faded back into the passageway my nerves worsened i was supposed to go back in there with a guy loved me the way block did but he didnt dislike me that much not enough to bring me down here for that kind of fun i stepped into the passage and almost tripped over an old man he couldnt have weighed more than seventy pounds he was a skeleton with skin on it he had just enough strength to shake the deathmen would collect him before long all the way back block said i didnt want to go but i went and wished i hadnt i like to think i developed a solid set of emotional calluses in the marines but thats only because my imagination cant encompass horrors worse than those i saw and survived in the war i keep thinking theres no devils work that can surprise me anymore i keep on being wrong there was a little open area where porters had made deliveries in a bygone age several watchmen were there they had torches to break the gloom they looked like they hoped the rain would drown the torches i didnt blame them the girl had been about twenty she was naked she was dead none of that was remarkable it happens but not the way this had happened somebody had tied her hand and foot then hung her from a beam head down then they had cut her throat and bled her and gutted her like a game animal there was no blood around though the human body is filled with an amazing amount i muttered they caught the blood and took it away my meals for the month wanted to desert me block nodded he was having his troubles too so were his boys and they were angry besides hell i was angry but my anger hadnt had time to ripen no telling why shed been gutted maybe for some of her organs her insides had been dumped on the ground but were gone now carried off by dogs they had been at the body too some but hadnt done much damage their squabbling had brought about the discovery of the corpse block told me this is the fifth one garrett all of them like this all in the bustee thiss the first one down here that we know of yeah this could happen here every day i looked at her again no even in the bustee there are limits to the sickness theyll tolerate they dont kill for sport or ritual they kill for passion or because killing will directly or indirectly put food in their mouths this girl had been killed by somebody insane i said she came from outside she was too healthy too pretty none have been bustee women garrett theyve turned up all over town i havent heard about anything like this i hadnt been out listening though we been trying to keep it quiet but words starting to get around which is why were about to go in the vise the powers that be want this lunatic and they want him sudden on reflection i said captain block sir i dont believe youre being entirely forthright maybe if thered been fifteen or twenty of them and people were getting panicky theyd bestir themselves up there but youre not going to convince me they give one rats ass what happens to four or five street girls they dont care garrett but these aint street girls they was all from top families all of them gave some perfectly good even trivial reason for going out the days they were killed extended errands visits to friends everything perfectly safe yeah theres no such thing as perfectly safe in tunfaire and that kind of woman doesnt go anywhere without armed guards its a status thing so what about their guards most of them dont got no idea what happened they delivered their charges to friends houses went on about their ratkilling theres something going on but the guards arent it though maybe their memories would improve some on the rack only we aint been authorized to go that far yet any leads at all diddly nobodys seen or heard nothing thats the standard state of affairs throughout tunfaire nobody sees anything i made a sick grunting noise and forced myself to look at the victim yet again shed been a beauty slim with long black hair unpleasant as the truth may be you feel it more when they waste the pretty ones block looked at me like he expected some blast of wisdom so what do you want from me as if i didnt know find out who did this give us a name well take it from there i didnt have to ask what was in it for me hed told me his word was good like i said he stayed bought what else do you know thats it thats all we have bullshit come on block what that right there tells you a bunch just by being what it is especially if the others were like it they were all right they gutted them they took their blood that stinks of dark religion or black sorcery but if its a cult it cant have a base else the bodies would have been disposed of there unless they wanted them found theres the weakness in my thinking maybe were supposed to think its ritual when its just crazy or maybe crazy when its ritual though its crazy for sure nobody sane would do that you keep saying they you figure on more than one i thought about it itd been a gut reaction yeah somebody had to get her away from her bodyguards somebody had to bring her here somebody had to strip her and tie her and string her up and do that i dont think a solo crazy could manage i flashed on a kidnapping id helped break up one rainy evening went stiff and cold any connection seemed unlikely but these girls got anything in common besides being highclass they know each other they all the same physical type this one couldnt have been confused with chodos brat but she did have a similar build black hair and dark eyes age range is seventeen to twentytwo all with dark hair and eyes except for one blond all between fivefour and fiveeight built pretty much alike near as i could tell seeing them this way five of them that we know about there was that in tunfaire there might be that many more not yet found or reported you have yourself a blueassed bitch of a problem captain these things are hard to untangle because theres nothing to grab hold of that makes any sense to anybody who isnt crazy if you get many more the thing will turn into a circus i know that garrett goddamnit thats why i came to you look you want me to beg ill beg only no block i dont want you to beg that had its appeal but i couldnt stomach it i want you to calm down i want you to come walk with me in the rain and tell me everything you know and i mean everything whatever little thing you hold back to keep from embarrassing somebody important might be the key i hadnt decided to get involved not yet i wanted to distract him long enough to walk him over to my place so he could have a sitdown with the dead man the dead man could sort everything stashed in his feeble mind and probably hand him what he needed to solve his case thus would i satisfy my civic obligation i could feel smug without having to stick my neck out only thing was going back out that narrow passage blocks boys went with us carrying their torches those spat and sputtered in the drizzle and gave me more light than id had coming in which meant there was enough light for me to spot the butterflies there were three of them they werent anything special just little green butterflies but how come there were butterflies dead in an alley in the bustee i stopped when we reached the narrow street take that old man somewhere and feed him get a doctor to look after him do whatever you have to do to get him well enough to tell us what he saw if he saw anything block told his men do it i headed for home block hustling along beside me telling me anything he thought might help i didnt listen as closely as i could have besides being horrified i was bemused by the fact that i might hold the fate of the watch in my hands i could destroy the useless bastards or maybe even force them to become some small percentage of what they were supposed to be hell people will do anything to keep their jobs sometimes even do their jobs i wasnt used to that kind of power maybe id have to have dean follow me around whispering in my ear to remind me i was mortal dean had noticed that the door was unlocked hed locked it i whooped and pounded till he tore himself away from his evangelists when he opened up he had a gleam in his eye that had nothing to do with salvation you rogue you he pretended he didnt understand what i meant hell a fling would be good for him and them both if it didnt kill him id never let westman block enter my house before he did so warily like a soldier visiting an enemy stronghold the dead man is no secret anyone interested in such things would know he lives with me but hardly anyone has seen him they go into his room with all sorts of wild prejudices then find out the real thing is worse than anything they imagined i told block you take the chair i need to pace he couldnt stop staring whatre we doing here old bones there is a genius you dont believe me ask him i thought wed lay it out for him hell find connections tell you where to start looking old bones wasnt talking i couldnt tell if that was a good sign or bad i did know that if he cooperated he would bring more than genius to bear here hed been around a long time something from yesteryear might be the key to todays horror it had happened before there are horrors that recur in long cycles like locust plagues but separated by generations if these murders were cultist they might fit one of those cycles the dead man wasnt talking but he was listening he was poking around hes damned subtle but when he starts prying i can tell if im paying close enough attention garrett shall we set all sham aside shall we abandon all childish efforts to abrade one anothers nerves i will not yet admit that we must pursue this monster but i will stipulate that we owe the situation a close look you grow up ill grow up block gave me a strange look he hadnt heard the dead mans end the dead man can do that if he wants it makes some of our conversations spooky excellent i will set my concern for your soul in abeyance for the moment oh boy he wasnt going to let me off those women had offended his sense of rationality he hates people who wont examine beliefs critically most of the time he hides it when he deals with me but he holds the majority of humankind in contempt of the godsknowhowmany sentient species in the world we humans are the only ones who insist on fervent belief in things logic and our senses demonstrate to be implausible amongst other races those who stumble into neverneverlands of wishful thinking are considered insane and are dealt with about the way we deal with barking dog or more harshly other races dont make priests out of their nuts then give them money and follow them wherever they lead i take it youre going to handle this garrett block said he was nervous as hell most people are around the dead man he has a considerable reputation all of it deserved hes done some amazing things since ive known him were considering it i was fighting myself laziness and the desire not to get involved in another bizarre case warred with outrage outrage was ahead by a nose the white knight had been on the shelf too long his only chance to strut his stuff his rescue of chodos spooky daughter but the white knight has his weaknesses while he doesnt mind charging full tilt against a visible villain rusty sword flailing he hates having to hunt the villain down legwork buries his resolve faster than anything the hard boys can do by way of threat or violence and this thing would be solved by legwork relax garrett it should not be so bad as you anticipate i saw block jump so knew the dead man had included him in this time captain block i sense that you have a great deal hanging upon the outcome of the investigation you propose block turned pale took on kind of a green tinge around the edges having somebody talk right into your head is not a reassuring experience not the first time and especially so when youre a guy who has a whole encyclopedia of corruption stashed and doesnt want it out where the world can see i guess youd say it was a measure of his distress and determination that he coped so well he bounced back quickly yes theres a lot of heat from the top of the hill itll get hotter every time some dizzy bitch gets herself offed you are certain there will be more damn straight what do you think i think you are correct the dead man was all business now the killings will continue and will come more and more rapidly until the people responsible are destroyed i think we are up against something like nothing any of us has seen before the evidence i glean from your minds tells me this is the work of a compulsive killer who cannot help doing what he is doing and who will have to do it again ever more often to appease the devil that drives him but it also tells me he is not doing this without help i asked you figure theres a connection with with what had happened at morleys place only he cut me short yes we had something he didnt want handed to block garrett i see you shrinking from the legwork this will entail you are correct in your estimate this will require talking extensively with everyone even remotely involved the families of the dead women their guards the people who found them and the watchmen who followed up people in the neighborhoods where the bodies were found he knows how to beat a guy down i shrank with every word i was the size of a mouse i looked for a hole in the baseboard so i could scoot off and hide he was talking about the rest of my life i do legwork because its what i do talk to people and talk to people and poke and prod until things start to happen but i dont like it partly because im lazy but mostly because of the people i never cease to be amazed and appalled by the sheer scope of human wickedness you are not considering our resources garrett right i was busy feeling sorry for myself we have the watch a thousand men for legwork is that not so captain will not every man of the watch throw himself into this with the greatest vigor its our asses if we dont theyre already hinting we have another five murders i figure the watch is out of business break my heart i saw what the dead man meant id been too involved in myself the watchmen would do anything to cover their asses maybe even their jobs we just had to grab them by their instinct for selfpreservation then do as i tell you i want to interview the bodyguards and the parents myself also those who found the corpses your men will canvass the neighborhoods where the women were found also the areas where they were seized i doubt you will gain much cooperation but cooperation is unnecessary even you watchmen will have developed a rudimentary sense for when someone is not being forthcoming bring any such persons to me i will open them up i marveled the dead man makes me look hyper usually i have to threaten mayhem just to get his attention when theres work to do he was jumping into this one headlong i hadnt agreed to do anything yet his enthusiasm suggested a secret agenda or he knew something he wasnt sharing i eyed him narrowly as he continued with block telling him what times he wanted whom to come be interviewed suspicion and paranoia become habits in this business you take fits where you dont even trust yourself when the dead man takes a notion to snooze he can hang in there for months and when hes awake he can go around the clock for days he had that in mind poor old dean was going to die answering the door block had to borrow pen and paper to remember all his instructions it took him half an hour to write them down i paced and worried and wondered then the dead man dismissed the watchman i walked him to the front door youll never regret this garrett i guarantee we clean this up you got a free pass for life sure i know how long gratitude lasts about as long as it takes for the bill to come due especially in tunfaire the only guy i know who sticks to that kind of promise is chodo contague he used to drive me crazy repaying imaginary debts that gave me a shiver old chodo always paid his debts and he owed me a big one i closed the door behind block put chodo out of mind went charging back to find out what the hell old chuckles thought he was doing not yet garrett dean the dead man did not often extend his mindtouch beyond his room that was a courtesy he extended us get rid of those harridans commend them to your nieces we have a commission his nieces i hurried into his room you want to create monsters dean had a platoon of spinster nieces all frontrunners for miss homely tunfaire they drove him to despair which was why he had conscripted himself as a fulltime member of my household he couldnt take it anymore can you imagine that pack in pursuit of a mission from god dean has sense enough to avoid that eventuality while we await him i will tell you what to do backtrack from events at mr dotess place but first bring mr dotes and mr tharpe to see me we will want their help we might want it but how are we going to afford it my share of what im getting to watch barking dog wont captain block will assume expenses you should pay closer attention i quoted an exorbitant fee he was desperate enough not to quibble if theyre as scared as he puts on they could put up enough from bribe money to pay anything exactly we have been handed an unprecedented opportunity where hes concerned money has no provenance its never dirty only the people who handle it are i intend to pursue it with vigor with my vigor he meant thats the reason youre jumping on this i didnt believe it let us say that i find my mind growing as flabby and slothful as you allowed your body to become i must get into shape before it is too late i am not yet prepared to slide into oblivion oblivion i put that away where i could find it next time he started in on the condition of my immortal soul what he said sounded good i didnt believe it and he knew that but he didnt let me press there is no time to waste get mr tharpe and mr dotes mr tharpe didnt want to get got hed gotten rid of billie and had replaced her with a little blond who could have been her sister the new hadnt worn off enough for him to see that he wanted to stay home and play anyway it aint even dark out yet garrett you only work at night now getting in the habit doing these odd jobs for licks so sunlight for me talk to the dead man you dont want the work no harm done ill get somebody else wont be as good but ill make do never hurts to butter him up whats shaking a serial killer a real psycho his nibs can fill you in i dont know why he wants you he just started spouting orders like a fountain okay ill talk to him he looked at his friend she scorched me with a lethal stare i said i got to see morley and got out of there before the woman carved their initials in my trunk morleys place was sparsely populated it had just opened his customers are like the stars seldom seen before dark those in there then were early bats trying to get a jump on their competition nobody got excited when i walked in nobody knew me the guy behind the counter was new he was a skinny little halfelf like morley handsome as hell but barely old enough to think about taking advantage of that he was trying to grow a mustache it was catching i need to see morley i told him names garrett tell him it is business and theres a shitpot in it the kid looked me straight in the eye morley who the hell is morley i dont know any morley one of those kid ill take into account the fact that youre new ill take into account the fact that youre young and dumb and figure you got to be a wiseass when im done accounting i just might pull you over the bar and pound away till morley comes down to see about all the screaming get on the tube the audience wasnt much but it did exist the kid thought he had to show me quick as an eyeblink he showed me a razor elves have a love affair with sharp steel especially the young ones he was so predictable i was there with my headknocker as fast as he was with the blade i popped his knuckles he yowled like a stomped cat the razor flew down the counter the audience gave us a hand and a mountain of a man lumbered out of the kitchen garrett what you doing this was sarge another of morleys old hands he came out of the same production batch as puddle i asked to see morley kid pulled a razor sarge shook his head sadly what you want to go do that for spud man wants to see morley give morley a howl morley wants to have him friends like this thats his lookout spud i asked what kind of name was spud not even a dwarf would tag his kid spud what we call him garrett names really narcisio morleys nephew his sisters kid got to be more than she could handle morley brought him down here so he could straighten him out meantime the kid talked to the voice tube that connected to morleys office i shook my head morley dotes going to set somebodys feet on the straight and narrow morley whose real career is cutting throats and breaking bones and running an occasional con or even a straight ripoff if the stakes are big enough my pal morley sarge put on a big grin i know what youre thinking but you know morley i knew morley he could believe mutually contradictory things at the same time with religious fervor his whole life was a tangle of contradictions he lived them all with passion he could sell you anything because he believed every word he said when he said it that was why he did well with the ladies and no matter that he might take up a completely new passion five minutes hence he was completely committed now morley had done some good where spud was concerned the kid wasnt happy about being shown up but he put it away from him he told me morley will be down in a few minutes you want something while youre waiting puddle still got his keg back there tap me one off it he owes me a couple gallons sarge chuckled whynt you finish the whole thing i love to watch him puff up like a big old toady frog when he comes in and finds out somebodys been at his keg ill do my best company i jerked a thumb skyward yeah his lucks coming back glad somebodys is sarge chuckled again you shoulda married that maya when she asked she was all right he patted spuds shoulder said you done all right just dont be so fast with that razor next guy might not be nice like garrett he headed for the kitchen i wondered what he was doing back there i wouldnt trust him anywhere near food in preparation not even the horse fodder they serve at morleys place i figured the kids ego needed a boost so i sort of sideways apologized for being so hardass the audience had lost interest so he could halfway apologize too i only been here a couple days mr garrett he recognized the name now always somebody coming in here to pester my uncle you looked like an unhappy husband i laughed not a husband just unhappy morley isnt satisfied unless hes taking needless risks like refusing to fool around with a woman if she isnt married he used to have a bad gambling problem too but he got over that morley came downstairs looking smug without saying so he wanted me to know his life was going great way better than mine i couldnt argue lots of peoples lives were going better than mine whats going on garrett need some privacy to talk you on a job this time dead man says we might need to subcontract also he wants to pick your brain take the table in the corner i picked up the beer spud had drawn off puddles keg you have so many of them up there you cant hide them all usually we went to his office to discuss business no place is just a mess got a little carried away that one he didnt make me believe maybe it wasnt a woman maybe they wanted me to think it was a woman because it had to do with his real business i didnt ask i just went to the table and sat then told him what there was to tell he listened well he can do that when he wants you think theres a connection with what happened the other night i dont know the dead man thinks so and he knows how to handicap interesting youd say something else if youd seen that girl i expect so i dont approve of killing people who dont ask for it i mean i find interesting the idea of taking money from the watch for once instead of seeing it go their way i raised an eyebrow its one of my finest skills he said thats the way it works garrett im not under chodos protection i dont want to be part of the outfit theres always a price for independence made sense when i considered it there were a thousand watchmen and only a handful of guys in his bunch as long as the watch didnt get greedy it would be easier for him to pay than fight not that he would like it but he was very much the pragmatist the watch wouldnt bother chodo of course a lot of people are beholden to him and he wouldnt take kindly to any attempt to muscle his operations morley thought about what id told him let me finish up upstairs ill walk over to your place with you i watched him climb the stairs what did he have going hed set it up so hed be sure he was with me when i left so i wouldnt hang around outside to see who left after he did that didnt make sense if i wanted to know i could ask the dead man after morley talked to him if i let the dead man know i wanted him to peek ah paranoia saucerhead opened the door a butler morley cracked youre coming up in the world garrett saucerhead didnt crack a frown who shall i say is calling sir he filled the doorway a charging bull couldnt have moved him morley didnt when he started inside hey what gives check it out big guy its raining out here i said im thinking about getting into the boat business might be the coming thing saucerhead cocked his big ugly phiz like he was listening he was waiting for the dead mans goahead even on us which meant old bones had convinced him anything could happen saucerhead was the type to make damn sure it didnt while he was on the job the dead man had him not trusting his own eyes what was this what did he suspect saucerhead finally grunted stepped aside like he didnt think it was such a hot idea morley shot me a puzzled look headed down the hall he ducked into the dead mans room garrett says theres something sinister about what happened at my place last night for twenty minutes i felt like an orphan five of them morley said theyre keeping a good wrap on it then i only heard about one last month down at the landing i jumped in that was the one before the one before the one they found this morning this nut is on a shrinking time cycle after the first one he waited six weeks then four weeks for the one in the landing then three weeks then a couple days over two weeks to get this last one unless theres some in there we dont know about theyd be hard to miss all of them strung up with their throats cut and the guts gone and the watch hasnt had any reports of daughters missing from the hill the guy doing this has got to be doing some homework up front hes not just hanging out on the corner waiting for the right rich girl hes picking his targets and hes working several at the same time what makes you think that he blew the snatch on chodos kid but grabbed another woman in time to have her hung up this morning crazy dont mean stupid my old mom used to say ive seen that proved often enough the man doing this was doing a lot of planning hed be aware that his fun would cause a stir hed be real careful morley the guy made a real dumb move last night maybe double dumb he did it in front of witnesses and he went for chodos kid hed get less heat going after the kings sister you remember she was scared when she came in i have a notion the snatch was blown once already and somebody was desperate to cover his tracks far as going after chodos kid what you have to do with this character and i cant myself is put yourself inside his head try to think like he does hes a genius and knows it hes been messed up and playing out psychotic dramas since he was a kid and he keeps getting away with it maybe he doesnt quite see the rest of us as real anymore maybe were just things like the bugs and rats he started out on maybe he thinks there cant be any kickbacks as long as hes careful in his mind chodo might not be a worry any bigger than dean is i understood but wasnt sure morleys ideas held any water i didnt know what to think tunfaire has killers by the battalion but none like this muckers and coldblooded pros were the multiple murderers i knew this monster was a hybrid a mutant last night is the only starting place we have morley said we have to talk to the girl i made an ugly noise i know means the outfit gets in on the hunt i was surprised they werent already i said so morley observed means she didnt mention it when she got home maybe she was doing something her father wouldnt approve he wore a frown though like he thought that couldnt be quite right boyfriend shes human i backed off inside and considered bitten by sudden suspicion shed run into morleys place when she was in trouble shed shown no sign of knowing him but no he wouldnt his need to take risks wouldnt push him that far would it the dead man intervened gentlemen i sense the approach of persons i must interview i will be at that all night garrett i suggest you rest till morning i may have suggestions for you then apparently hed shuffled through morleys head and had gotten what he wanted if thered been anything there sometimes that was arguable i was wound up more than i realized i could start like i was eager to get to work if i calculate accurately we have eleven or twelve days before the killer acts again that should be ample time the wheels of the law and mr contagues organization will grind every clue fine by then there is no need to rush and risk doing ourselves harm what he was going to stamp his approval on my loafing im no fool i hustled morley out the front door brought in the couple i ran into there introduced them to the dead man as the parents of the first victim then headed upstairs as soon as i was flat on my back i thought of fifty things i should have discussed with morley like did he have any idea who those brunos were who stormed into his place after chodos brat he would have tried to find out i knew him after hed brooded awhile hed have decided that booting them around and chucking them out in the rain wasnt good enough hed want a whack at the guy whod sent them he might be miles ahead of me i let my thoughts drift back to what had happened went over it seeking a clue nothing that special about the three men if you had the money you could recruit a thousand like them only thing remarkable was that theyd dared invade a place owned by morley dotes local professionals knew better those three hadnt had outoftown accents therefore they werent professionals not streetside anyhow i didnt doubt they were professional thugs which led me off blueskying who had thugs on staff who wouldnt get into the streets much only priests and people on the hill the priest angle was so juicy i set it aside to look at the other first off the hill a lunatic up there would be in a fine position to observe the movements of prospective victims i tried to recall the appearance of the old geek with butterfly indigestion that didnt match any hill people i knew what about the coach i recalled it though details were getting vague big black and fancy a custom fourhorse job silver brightwork the killer had money couldnt be many coaches like it i fought it for fifteen minutes but it was a struggle foredoomed eventually i swung my legs off the bed got up and hunked downstairs so much for good intentions i donned a cloak and marvel of marvels a hat the hat was deans i didnt think hed miss it saucerhead came to see what i was up to im going out for a while shouldnt be long i scowled at the closed door to the small front room tell dean that if that cats still here when i get back they both go out in the rain i went to see a friend his name was playmate he was nine feet tall and black as coal big enough to make saucerhead nervous but he was as gentle as a lamb and religious to boot he was in the stable business he owed me early in both our careers id saved him from human sharks he never ceased to amaze me no matter what time i showed no matter how inconvenient my appearance he was always glad to see me this time was no exception garrett he boomed when i strolled into his stable he dropped a curry comb and bounded toward me swept me up in a ferocious hug he turned me loose only after i started squawking like a bagpipe damn playmate sometimes i wish you was a woman nobody else is excited to see me your own fault come around more often maybe you wear out your welcome yeah its been a rough year ive been neglecting my friends specially that little bit maya i forgot my mission momentarily youve seen maya i thought she left town been a while come to think she used to come around help out some just cause she liked the horses i knew there had to be something wrong with her the look he gave me told me more than he could have said in words maya had cried on his shoulder i couldnt really look him in the eye he said youve been having troubles all the way around i hear miss tinnie somebody named winger he was implying it so i said it yeah i have a way with the girls the wrong way come over here and sit i have a pony keg ive been nursing should be a sip or two left which was all right by me except it would be warm brew playmate liked his beer warm i prefer mine just about ready to turn to chunks but he was offering beer right then i had an inclination to surround several gallons i settled on an old saddle accepted a big pewter mug playmate plopped his behind on a sawhorse trouble is he told me those gals all been growing up getting interested in something besides fun i know its hell getting older dont mind me its the preacher getting out i knew that too back when i saved his bacon hed been thinking of getting into the religion racket on his own hed have done good but wouldnt have gotten very big tunfaire has a thousand cults always there are plenty of disenchanted wouldbe believers eager to sign on with the thousandandoneth playmate had taken a look around decided that he was insufficiently cynical and dishonest to make a real go of it he may be religious personally but hes practical the preacher is right playmate and its maybe him i need to talk to problem yeah thought so soon as i saw you what a genius with playmate i commit the same sin as with morley i dont go around unless i need help i resolved to do better in the future right garrett duck here comes a lowflying pig i laid it out for playmate i didnt hold back my story upset him so badly i was sorry i hadnt softened it some whod want to go and do something like that garrett killing little girls they hadnt been little but that was beside the point i dont know i mean to find out thats where i thought you might help that coach outside morleys wasnt any junker or rental i dont think theres another like it nearest ive ever seen is chodo contagues coach and it didnt have the gaudy silver brightwork playmate frowned at every mention of morley dotes he didnt approve of morley he frowned again when i mentioned chodo if playmate was the kind to keep a little list the first name on his would be chodo contague he sees chodo as a cause of social ills rather than as an effect custom coach id guess so and similar to chodo contagues a little bigger and even fancier silver trim and a lot of carving tell you anything know whose it is dont know that but i can make a good guess who built it if it was built in tunfaire bingo i almost let out a whoop maybe i did let out a whoop playmate looked at me oddly for a moment then grinned shyly helped some as soon as you tell me that coachmakers name atwood linden atwood that name meant nothing to me at my income level i dont buy many custombuilt coaches i dont hang out with those who do where would i find mr linden atwood coachmaker tinkery row excellent that narrowed it right down to a whole neighborhood where potters potted tinkers linked and at least one wainwright wrighted wains the neighborhood lies south of the tenderloin and north of the brewery district stretching east to west beginning a few blocks in from the river and parallels a street called tinkers lane that is one of the oldest parts of town some artisan families have been established there for centuries playmate glanced toward the stable door going to be getting dark soon you figure on going down there right away yes thats not a nighttime neighborhood pretty soon theyll all close up have supper then the menfolk will head for the corner tavern so its late its already too late for five women the dead man thinks this guy wont kill again for another eleven or twelve days but i dont count on it playmate nodded conceding the point ill walk with you you dont need to do that just tell me where trouble follows you i better go with you takes a certain touch to deal with atwood anyway youve done enough i didnt want to put playmate at risk he didnt deserve it my job is dealing with people your style is maybe a touch too direct and forceful for atwood ill walk you down arguing with playmate is like arguing with a horse dont get you anywhere and just irritates the horse maybe if he would get into another line id visit more often any line where there werent so many horses around i dont get along with those monsters their whole tribe is out to get me ill get my hat and cloak he said knowing hed won before i conceded i looked around wondering where hed hidden the circus tent hed wear i spied a horse eyeballing me it looked like it was thinking about kicking its stall down so it could trot over and dance a flamenco on my tired bones dont waste time the devils have spotted me theyre cooking something up playmate chuckled he has one big blind spot he thinks my problem with horses is a joke boy do they have him fooled we stopped to have supper my treat which strained my budget severely playmate ate like a horse but not cheap hay youre on expenses garrett i was just figuring on cleaning the watch out of pocket change not driving them into bankruptcy he got a good laugh out of that one simple pleasures for simple minds tinkery row is all light industry singlefamily operations that produce goods without producing much smoke the nastier stuff is down south the nastiest across the river the air gets chunky and takes on flavor when the wind is from the east past the smelters and mills their stench can make you long for the heavy wood and coal smoke of winter or the rotten garbage of summer tinkery row is four blocks wide and eight blocks long approximately measuring by normal city blocks there arent many of those in tunfaire there never has been any planning applied to the citys growth maybe we need a good fire to burn it all down so we can start over and do it right playmate insisted on sticking with me he said he knew the neighborhood and knew linden atwood i gave up i needed to spend some time with somebody who wasnt going to give me a lot of hassle i let him lead but insisted on setting the pace myself my legs werent long enough to match his prodigious stride he strolled i scampered once we got into tinkery row he chatted up people who still had their doors open hoping for a late sale i huffed and puffed tinkery row is a safe neighborhood the villains stay away because the natives have this habit of ganging up justice is quick and informal and applied with considerable enthusiasm everyone seemed to know playmate nobody knew me but my feelings werent hurt thats a plus in my line i puffed out you spend a lot of time down here grew up here one street over pop made tack which explained the interest in horses maybe but i changed in the war came back too nervous just couldnt fit in kind of slow and timeless around here people dont change get fixed in their ways i could probably tell you who is where doing what right now though i havent been around for months right now linden atwood is having supper with his missus at home his sons are having supper with their families and his apprentices are eating bread and cheese while they clean the shop about a halfhour from now theyll start drifting into the bicks and kittle each one will buy a pint of dark theyll all go into a corner and nurse their pints for an hour then somebody will say hed better get on home and get to bed cause he has to make an early start in the morning old linden will tell him to stay have another on him and hell buy the round theyll all sit another hour find the bottoms of their mugs at the same time then theyll get up and go home a thrill a minute life in tinkery row it was the longest speech id ever heard from playmate while he made it he led me to and into the corner tavern with the name i found unfathomable most taverns do have odd names like rose and dolphin but thats because most people cant read a sign with a couple of symbols will hang over the door serving as both name and address bicks and kittle didnt have a sign and when i finally asked playmate about the name he told me those were the families who ran the place some mysteries just arent worth unraveling playmate studied the layout the place wasnt crowded he held me back while he chose a table we dont want to trespass on the regulars apparently they became disturbed when casual trade usurped their traditional tables playmate chose a small one in the middle of the small room it appeared less shopworn than most playmate ordered but i paid he asked for the dark beer you can get any beer you want as long as youre willing to go down the street for your pale or lager real set in their ways i do like the occasional dark beer though and this proved to be a fine brew with a strong malt flavor i like to taste the malt more than the hops hardheaded atwood comes in let me pick the time and do the talking i nodded made sense the place began filling young and old they were all cut from one bolt i wondered if there would be a problem what with playmates being the only dark face in the place nope soon guys started dropping by to exchange a few words of greeting while eyeing me sidelong curiously but with manners too steady to express that curiosity aloud playmate identified the apprentice coachmakers when they arrived atwood never took apprentices till a few years ago the wars fault he lost a couple sons then none of his grandsons made it back has three still doing their five years though maybe theyll get lucky the apprentices were old for that middle twenties in atwoods place id take kids educate them so they could avoid the line units supply outfits always need wainwrights playmate looked at me like id missed the point of everything hed said tonight where would he find kids any tinkery family with kids would bring them up in the family trade all right i did miss that sort of the surviving sons appeared then linden atwood himself linden atwood was that rare creature a man who fitted his name and looked like a coachmaker in my preconceptions he was a skinny little dink old with leathery skin all his own hair intelligent eyes and plenty of bounce his hands were hands that still did their share of work he stood like he had a board nailed to his back seemed confident of his place in the world he and his crew were one big happy family he was no aloof patriarch he his three sons and four apprentices got into a spirited argument about whether or not the kings rules were turning tunfaires football players into gangs of whining candyassed wimps now there was something worth arguing about kings rules went into effect before i was born karentine football or rugger is so rough now i wouldnt want my enemies playing in old style football i think the only rule was no edged weapons i take it football is popular down here serious business best players come out of tinkery every block has a team kids start out as soon as they can walk not only hardheaded but not very bright but i kept that thought to myself not very tolerant goes along with the other two most places played some myself when i was younger playmate told me why am i not surprised hed have made a team all by himself playmate was slick he managed to insinuate an opinion into an argument so old it was obvious ritual elicited a response because apparently in his olden days hed been a star before i understood what was happening he and i were part of atwoods crowd i pursued playmates advice diligently the dead man would have been impressed by how long i kept my mouth shut in time the atwoods veered from the tried and true long enough to betray polite curiosity concerning playmates presence playmate gave them a big grin like he was mocking himself for taking anything seriously my pal garrett and me were on sort of a crusade those guys understood a crusade they were religious real salt of the earth and backbone of the nation hadnt had an original thought in generations pardon i do get overly critical at times curiosity levels rose playmate played with them a minute then said i better let garrett tell it hes the one been closest to it im just trying to lend a hand i pictured block exploding if he heard i was hanging out his dirty laundry all over town grinned told the story of the dead girls the atwoods were properly horrified i played to that noted the old man paying closer attention than the others who just wanted to be entertained i said so right now it looks like the only way to trace this monster is through his coach everybody got it then the whole gang got quiet and grim all eyes turned to the old man he considered me neutrally you suspect that coach came from my shop mr garrett i have no idea mr atwood playmate says youre the premier coachmaker in tunfaire if it was built here according to him youre the only man with the talent to have built it i expect so describe it again i did recalling every possible detail the sons were less skilled than he at concealing their thoughts i knew that coach had been built by linden atwood the question was would the man expose his buyer he would we delivered that coach built to strict and exacting specifications about three years back mr garrett i do not believe in false humility it was the finest coach ever built in tunfaire i will accept responsibility for that but i refuse any blame excuse me one son muttered damn things jinxed the old man glared madame tallia lethe wife and mother of the icemasters direfear commissioned it three months after she took delivery there was an accident she fell a wheel rolled over her head oh boy i knew we could get some bigtime sorcerers into this karentine wizards mainly belong to the elemental schools earth air fire and water the windmasters and storm wardens of the air school are common firelords more so there may be earth schoolers elsewhere in karenta but none in tunfaire waterschool types are almost as rare i didnt know we had any icemasters here we dont the old man said the woman lived here the icemasters are dead anyway crossbones bight ah the big naval battle of the war we got our karentine asses kicked unfortunately for the venageti a naval triumph hadnt meant much strategically i see i said not seeing at all madame had no heirs the estate passed to the crown the crown agents auctioned everything lord hellsbreath bought the coach there was a name to conjure nightmares the only hellsbreath i recalled was no healthier than madame lethe he had some bad luck himself right he was murdered the assassin got away he was in the coach when it happened a son volunteered crossbow bolt right in the eye another said he demonstrated with enthusiastic gestures and sound effects then who got the coach duchess of suhnerkhan lady hamilton i knew that one does seem like it was unlucky the kings greataunt lady hamilton had decided to visit the family estate at okcok she hadnt bothered with an escort though thered been a full moon out werewolves had given her a fatal set of hickeys linden atwood grunted but conceded nothing that was a year and a half ago i guess its changed hands a few more times no crown prince rupert brought it back to town and stored it in the coachhouse behind lady hamiltons town house far as i know it hasnt been out since the old man produced a pipe and pipeweed he filled up lit up leaned back closed his eyes puffed and thought the clan waited quietly i followed their lead playmate signaled for another round of the dark on me naturally the beers arrival wakened atwood he tilted forward drained half his mug wiped foam with the back of a hand belched said i dont put no stock in this jinx stuff garrett we were pals now id bought him a beer but was i you id be careful seems like everybody that gets near that coach gets dead he frowned he didnt like that at all what if word got out what if people started thinking it was the coachmakers fault im not much on haunts and jinxes i told him but if that coach is jinxed you got any notion how come beats the shit out of me he guzzled the other half of his beer shit happens sometimes it dont make no sense playmate horned in thanks mr atwood sure was good of you to talk to us he nudged me with a knee got up i wondered why he was in a hurry but id promised to follow his lead i piled on my share of thanks and excused myself followed playmate into the rain what was that how come the runout atwood was getting glassyeyed in about a minute he was going to start in on his boys that didnt make it home from the cantard i thought you might want to get some sleep tonight oh yeah you got to feel sorry for the guy but that dont mean you got to go live in his hell with him hes got to lay his own ghosts himself true but i was surprised that playmate thought so i pulled my cloak tighter there was enough wind to make the night cold past my bedtime garrett hope all that helped you hope hell it cracked the thing all i need now is to find out whos been using that coach and how hard could that be i mean the crown princes duties included running karentine internal security the tunfaire watch were one obscure arm of the many he oversaw and if what block said was true the heat on the watch had good old rupert behind it come around more often garrett playmate said at least soon enough to let me know how this comes out he strode off like he was late for a date with one of his mares i stood absorbing some rain for a moment startled then shrugged playmate did these things he didnt know he was being rude and unsociable what now morleys place thats what now it wasnt that far out of my way i dropped by my reception was no more charming than before maybe not as good more people departed the others seemed edgy except for saucerheads pal licks who was at the same shadowed corner table stoned out of this world puddle gave me a huge scowl glanced down at his keg i told him that rat sarge said he was going to blame it on me morley here puddle already had a finger pointed skyward and an eyebrow up i nodded to make sure he understood that i wanted to see morley as well as to know if he was home with puddle you have to take it by the numbers he dont fill in the gaps so good he was the kind of guy who thought if you couldnt solve a problem with a right cross or a club then it wasnt a problem in the first place and therefore didnt need solving ignore it and it would go away puddle grunted growled at the speaking tube fluttered a hand to indicate that i should go on up apparently morley didnt have company i climbed the stairs tiptoed to morleys door listened before i knocked i didnt hear anything usually there was scurrying as somebodys wife headed for cover all i heard was morley telling me to come in i opened the door something zipped past the end of my nose morley was behind his desk his feet up leaning back tossing darts i didnt recognize the painted face serving as his target you doing the hoodoo voodoo on somebody not really found all that in a junk shop velvet painting of a guy who looks like my sisters husband zip wham another eye put out whats up no company tonight too wet out there these days nobodys going to be seeing much company as long as this weather keeps up zip wham right in the end of the nose want to get those darts for me youre a bundle of ambition tonight yeah long as youre doing my legwork you see that creep licks downstairs so i dont have to go look for myself hes there unconscious i think the smoke was pretty thick he snagged his speaking tube puddle toss that creep licks out now dont leave him where hell get run over morley put the tube down looked at me i hope he gets pneumonia you have a problem with the man yes i dont like him so bar him his moneys as good as yours maybe better he spends it here that didnt get a rise so he asked whats up you look like you cant wait to get something off your chest i got a line on the coach coach what coach the one out front that they tried to drag chodos kid into i found the man who built it he told me where i can find it i explained morley sighed took his feet down isnt that just like you here i am having the time of my life and you have to walk in and mess it up he got up opened a closet dug out a raincloak and fancy hat that must have set him back a dozen broken bones what you doing lets go check it out huh way i see it that beats hell out of trying to get to see chodo you carrying here and there finally started to learn eh i guess whats the problem with chodo i thought you were tight its me thats on his list i dont know i sent word i needed to talk that it was important i never got an answer thats never happened before then comes a roundabout kind of hint that nobody out there wants to hear from me and if im smart i wont bother them ever again odd i couldnt figure that morley was an important independent contractor chodo owed him a listen been odd ever since you and winger went out there and getting odder every day we were headed downstairs now i asked whats with the mustaches that the coming thing huh im seeing them all over on you it dont look bad on spud it would look good if he could grow one but on puddle it looks like some damn buzzard built its nest on his lip he doesnt take care of it morley darted to the counter spoke to puddle briefly i noted lickss absence and puddles wet shoulders licks remained with us in spirit the smoke was thick enough to slice when it rains and the wind blows it gets real dark in tunfaire streetlamps wont stay lighted though those lamps exist only in neighborhoods like the hill and the tenderloin where the wraths of our lords temporal and lords criminal encourage thieves and vandals to practice their crafts elsewhere tonight the hill was darker than a priests secret heart i didnt like it given my choice i want to see trouble coming morley was as excited as a kid planning to tumble an outhouse i asked whats your thinking on this i looked around nervously wed approached lady hamiltons place unchallenged which made me just that much more anxious i dont believe in good luck i do believe in cumulative misfortune in bad luck just lying back piling up interest till it dumps on you in one big load we climb over the wall see if the coach is there you could give glory mooncalled lessons in innovative tactics i didnt like his idea we could get ourselves arrested we could get ourselves hurt we could get ourselves fatally unhealthy the private guards on the hill are a lot less inhibited than their publicpayroll counterparts dont get all worked up garrett wont be anything to it thats what you said the time you conned me into helping deliver that vampire to the old kingpin that time you didnt know what you were doing true but where would he get the idea i knew what i was doing now youre too optimistic to live comes of living right comes of eating horse fodder till you have the sense of a mule you could do with more horse fodder yourself garrett meat is filled with the juices of things that died terrified they make you timid yourself i have to admit i never heard anybody call a cabbage a coward there they go all clear there who go were we hanging around soaking because hed seen someone why didnt he tell me these things he did have better night vision one of the advantages of his elvish blood the disadvantages of course started with a conviction of personal immortality it isnt true what you hear about elves being immortal they just think they are only an arrow through the heart will talk them out of the idea morley took off toward the hamilton place i followed watching everywhere but where i was going i heard a sound looked for its source as i jumped ten feet high walked right into the hamilton wall you must have been some marine morley grumbled and continued muttering about no wonder karenta couldnt win in the cantard if i represented the kingdoms best and brightest probably a hundred thousand guys down there would be happy to let you show them how to do it morley wasnt a veteran breeds dont have to go the nonhuman peoples all have treaties exempting people up to oneeighth blood the nonhumans you see in the cantard are natives or mercenaries and usually both and agents of glory mooncalled besides except for the vampires and werewolves and unicorn packs who are out to get everybody the cantard is a lot of fun morley squatted cupped his hands ill give you a boost the wall was nine feet high youre lighter i could toss him right over thats why you go first i can climb up there without help a point not one that fired me up to go first but a point this business was more in his line than mine he wouldnt buy my plan which was to go pound on the front gate and ask to see the deadly coach that was too prosaic for his sense of adventure i shrugged stepped into his cupped hands heaved my reluctant bones upward grabbed the top of the wall in expectation of getting my fingers ripped to hamburger by broken glass broken glass is an old trick for discouraging uninvited company oh my now i was really disheartened there was no broken glass i pulled my chin up level with the top peeked where was the trap they had to have something really special planned if they didnt use broken glass morley whacked me on the sole better move your ass garrett theyre coming back i didnt know who they were but i heard their footsteps i took a poll opinion was unanimous i didnt want to find out who they were up and over i went i landed in a small garden gently failing even to turn an ankle morley landed beside me i said thiss too easy come on garrett what do you want you have a closed house here whos going to guard that exactly what i want to know you ever begin to sound optimistic im going to flee the country come on sooner we do it the sooner youre out of here i grunted agreement looks like the coach house there i dont like sneaking much i still thought we should have tried the front way morley scooted to a door in the side of the coach house i let him lead i noted how carefully he moved for all he did so quickly whatever he said he wasnt taking chances in his line you didnt get old taking anything for granted my line either for that matter neither of us had brought a lantern you do dumb things when you rush still there was light enough leaking from nearby homes to let morley see a little he told me somebody was here before us they jimmied the lock he tried the door it opened i looked over his shoulder it was blacker than the inside of a buzzards belly in there and about as inviting something made noises and shuffled around something breathed something a lot bigger than me always a courteous kind of guy i offered after you sir morley wasnt that sure he was immortal we need a light now he notices this the kind of planning you re going to do when you take over in the cantard ill be back in five minutes he vanished before i could argue five minutes it was more like twenty the longest twenty i ever lived excepting maybe a few dozen times in the islands when i was in the corps dancing the death dance with venageti soldiers he wasnt gone ten of those five minutes when from my lurking place under a crippled lime tree where i was trying to drown less speedily i noted a light moving past a downstairs window inside the hamilton house probably a candle it had a ghostly effect casting a huge only vaguely humanoid shadow on a drawn shade i gulped air damn me if my luck didnt hold somebody came outside and headed straight for the coach house i heard muttering then realized that there were two of them the guy with the candle was leading closer it was my old buddy with the bad stomach he didnt look like much now a sawedoff runt in clothes that had been out of style since my dad was a pup he wore the kind of hat they call a deerstalker id never seen one outside a painting before he was bent and slow and shaky and a damned near perfect match for my notion of what a pederast ought to look like hunking along behind having trouble navigating was scarface the guy saucerhead had bounced around so thoroughly he moved slower than the old guy like hed aged a hundred years overnight saucerhead hadnt broken much but hed left both of them with plenty of pain now what jump in and make a citizens arrest accuse somebody of something and maybe get my own bones rearranged maybe cause the geezer another attack of dyspepsia and have him belch carnivorous butterflies all over me maybe just end up in court for assault my mind wanders at such times examining the dark side i wish i had saucerheads capacity for lack of doubt there are advantages to being simple while i tried to decide and wondered where the hell morley was with the light those two dragged their bruise collections inside the coach house light flowed through cracks as they lit lamps or lanterns talk continued but i could distinguish no words i crept to the doorway still could make out nothing i heard a horse snort jumped boy was i glad i hadnt gone in there before they wouldve ambushed me for sure it sounded like they were fixing to harness a team the cussing level suggested that was difficult when you were all bruised up sounded like some impressive descriptive work being done in there i wanted to hear more i need to expand my vocabulary i slipped my fingers into the gap between the door and its frame pulled outward slowly till i had a crack through which to peek so i could spy on a whole lot of horse stalls and tack racks doing a whole lot of nothing pretty dull stuff i had the wrong angle someone had the right angle to see the door move inward i heard one voice say something soft but startled heavy footsteps lumbered my way like a stomping troll wearing stone boots i thought about doing a fast fade but thought too long i barely had time to duck aside before the door flew open i couldnt run so i did the next best thing i bopped scarface over the head with my listen stick his conk thunked like a thumped watermelon he sagged looked at me like i wasnt playing fair well why should i thats dumb with his kind id get hurt if i tried i thumped him again to make my point i bounced over scarface popped inside charged the little character with the sour stomach and antique clothes dont ask me why seems plenty dumb in retrospect just say it seemed like a good idea at the time he was trying to get the street doors open i cant imagine why his team were still in their stalls he wasnt going to drive away and he wasnt going to outrun anybody on foot either but there he went heaving away and spitting green moths he heard me coming and spun around for him a spin was a slow turn his one hand dropped to a kind of frayed rope that served him as a belt hitched his pants his eyes started glowing green i got there with my stick one of his moths bit me stung like hell and distracted me so the old boy could slide aside enough for me to whap his shoulder instead of the top of his gourd he howled i bellowed and flailed at bugs his eyes flared and his mouth opened wide i avoided his gaze and the one big green butterfly that flew from his maw i flailed crosswise catching him alongside the jaw i put too much on it bone cracked he folded like a dropped suit of clothes my juices were flowing i bounced around looking for more trouble so cranked the horses just backed up in their stalls and waited for me to go away i checked scarface he was snoring getting soggier by the second i darted back to the old man who wasnt snoring he was making funny noises that said he wouldnt be breathing at all pretty soon id broken more than his jaw a green giant butterfly crept halfway out from between his lips got stuck he held on to his crude rope belt with both hands like he didnt want to lose his pants and started shaking im not in the habit of croaking people ive done it sure but never really by choice and never because i wanted to now i was wound up this was the hill up here the guardians of the peace were no halfblind unambitious watchmen interested only in collecting their pay if i was caught anywhere near a dead man what the hell is this i didnt quite leap into the hayloft just maybe ten feet not even a record for the standing broad jump but i was out the door the old man had wanted to use thirty feet into the wet before i recognized morleys voice still shaking i went back and told him what had happened the presence of a dying man didnt rattle him at all he observed youre learning huh case solved and wrapped in a day you dig up your buddy block tell him where to find his villain end up with your pockets stuffed with gold you still have the luck yeah but i didnt feel lucky i didnt know that that little old man had gotten his thrills carving on pretty girls morley closed the yard door eased toward the street door i said hold it i have to take a look around in the house why he said that sharply like he didnt want me going that way in case theres any evidence i need to know he gave me the fish eye shook his head shrugged the notion of a conscience was alien to him if you have to you have to i have to i tripped over the old mans sidekick as i stepped into the garden well another mystery some wicked soul had come along and stabbed him in his sleep i scowled at morley morley wasnt abashed didnt need him garrett and now you wont need to keep looking back just because the guy had caused a scene at the joy house i didnt argue wed had the argument more times than i liked to recall morley knew neither pity nor remorse only practicality which he had a habit of reminding me was why i turned to him so often maybe but i think i go to him because i trust him to cover my back id grabbed the old mans lantern it was out now after my spill i pushed it aside dragged the body into the coach house closed the door and headed for the big house by the light of the lantern morley carried i snagged the extinguished lantern as i went the house wasnt locked it took us only moments to get inside and find something we entered through a dusty kitchen we needed go on no farther seconds after we entered morley said check this garrett this was a threegallon wooden bucket a tribe of flies had made it a place of worship their startled buzz and the smell told me that it was no water pail rusty cakes of dried blood adorned it they had to use something to carry the blood away i shone my light around spotted a set of knives on a drainboard they were not ordinary kitchen knives they were decorated with fancy symbols they were decorated with dried blood too morley observed they didnt take good care of their tools you didnt see the way they moved after theyd danced with saucerhead they probably didnt feel much like doing housework you satisfied now i had to be yeah no point lollygagging around maybe getting ourselves hanged with all that evidence morley grinned you really are learning garrett i figure maybe another hundred years and you can get by without a babysitter i wondered if maybe he wasnt a little too optimistic being no fool morley went his own way i found captain block the last place i expected at the bachelor officers quarters at the barracks the watch shares with the local army garrison those troops are less use than the watch coming out for nothing but ceremonies and to stand guard at various royal edifices i got the usual runaround trying to reach block but it had no heart in it maybe hed left word a certain battered old marine might want to get hold of him sometime he was dressing when i walked in and started dripping on his carpet i take it youve got something garrett for the life of me i couldnt figure why he wasnt thrilled to see me just because it was after midnight i found your man huh dumbstruck is really amazing on a naturally dumbfounded face that villain you wanted found the fellow who entertained himself by whittling on pretty girls if you want him ive got him uh yeah he didnt believe me yet put your slicker on cap ive had me a long hard day and i want to get on home you found him tada first thing you knew hed figure it out yep but youd better get rolling if you want to cash in yeah sure he was in a daze he couldnt believe this for a moment i entertained suspicions they didnt get too rowdy but how i had a thousand men looking they never caught a whiff didnt know where to sniff you get the nose when you have to make your living at it sounds like you plain got lucky luck helps should i bring some men you wont need them they wont give you any trouble must have been an edge to my voice he looked me askance but was too shocked still to pursue it he shrugged into an army overcloak jammed a waterproof hat onto his head you dont know how much we appreciate this garrett i have my suspicions just show me by making sure you dont forget to drop my fee off at my place what he managed to look affronted somebody had the audacity to question the integrity of the watch you think wed screw you the gods forfend me think a thing like that about our brave watchmen surely you jest captain he heard the sarcasm and didnt like it but had become too excited to take offense hell he took off like the proverbial bat dashing boldly into the night and rain till he realized he didnt know where the hell he was headed im moving as fast as i can captain i told him and i was i did want to get home i had big ambitions in the night lumber trade i put in about two thousand miles of legwork today tracking these monsters down monsters theres more than one the man didnt listen i shook my head he fell into step beside me as bouncy as a fiveyearold one more than one captain the big villain was a guy about a thousand years old who was some kind of wizard the other was your basic street bruno middle thirties was now he sounded nervous even wary you keep saying was youll see he saw he was less than thrilled did you have to kill them he stared at the old man like he hoped the crazy bastard would rise from the dead no i couldve let them kill me but then youd still be looking wouldnt you i stared at the old man rattled block didnt notice first the old boy had crawled to the garden door before hed checked out then hed gotten naked what there was of him was so dried up it looked like something had sucked out everything inside his skin that skin was dead white i wondered if maybe he wouldnt rise from the dead if he hadnt already a time or two then i shook off the fit of superstition and concentrated on a problem that was real and immediate someone had been into the coach house in my absence somebody who had stripped the dead man and had ripped off a crazy miscellany from the tack and tool racks that smelled of a crime of opportunity committed by some downandout amateur by someone who had seen a door open had darted in for a nervous peek had taken what he could use and had grabbed everything else he could carry that looked like it might sell for enough to make a down payment on a bottle of cheap red wine was i to go ahunting this thief id keep an eye peeled for a short skinny wino all cocked up in a new suit of old clothes complete with one of those absurd deerstalker hats block complained wouldve had a lot more impact if id been able to bring them to trial i dont doubt it a bit it wouldve been a circus the show of the year i wouldve loved to have seen it but he was belching butterflies and staring green fire and getting ready to lay some serious sorcery on me i couldnt talk him out of it come on let me show you some evidence i led him to the kitchen showed him the bucket i wanted to show him the knives but they werent where id seen them last that damned morley collecting souvenirs i felt more comfortable in the house now that i had an officer of the law along to explain to the local custodians i took time to look around more carefully i didnt see anything new you satisfied i expect he held up a big glass jar morley and i had overlooked it contained a human heart in a clear fluid ill have my people come take the place apart you know who owns it i know ironic coincidence there wont be any problems though the prince is determined hell just be doubly pissed because somebody dared hell breathe fire i chuckled youre welcome to collect the kudos captain i dont want his kind noticing me just see that i get paid then youre happy im happy and tunfaire is happy soon as word gets out now unless you insist on my help im dragging my weary ass home and putting it to bed go ahead he said distractedly and garrett yeah thanks youll get your money and ill still owe you for this miracle there you go i got me out of there while the getting was good the dead man was still doing interviews when i got home there were people in with him and people waiting in the small front room dean was doing a shift on the door i gave him my most malicious smile and sneered now you know what it feels like to be up at an absurd hour i made a quick sally into the small front room in search of feline game but did not find my prey dean eyed me nervously and kept his mouth shut excellent i thought as i trudged upstairs first thing in the morning wed have a talk about that cat first thing in the morning i didnt talk to dean at all about cats anyway he rolled me out at some absurd hour before noon told me his nibs wants you in his room ill bring your breakfast there i groaned and rolled over dean didnt bother with the usual roust that should have warned me but it was morning who thinks in the morning i just grumped some illplaced gratitude in the general direction of heaven and burrowed into my pillow bugs started chewing on me felt like bugs biting anyway when i started flopping and swatting and cussing and digging around i couldnt find a thing but the nibbling kept on keeping on it was morning it took me a while to figure it old dean hadnt salted my bed with insects the dead man was prodding me still cussing and dancing and swatting i pried myself out of bed that part of my mind that was working duly noted the discovery of a hitherto unsuspected aspect of my partner he would persecute his allies as readily as his enemies though my eyes only pretended to be open and my legs rebelled at every step i made it downstairs without suffering any disaster i stumbled into the dead mans room and dropped into my chair weakly looking around for something i could use to start a fire as soon as i got the ambition good morning garrett you wouldnt think youd get much expression out of his style of communication but he sure managed to sound as happy as a clam that didnt know it was being fattened up for a chowder i am so pleased you could join me the sentiments i expressed were less sociable what the hell you bubbling about what the hell did you drag me down here for the sun aint even up yet which wasnt strictly true somewhere out there above the rain clouds there was a sun that had been up for hours it just hadnt been up for enough hours i could contain my curiosity no longer the gentlemen of the city watch came round to pay their respects and debts this morning they were generous beyond belief dont mean much them showing up with one sceat makes them generous beyond belief how much the full one thousand marks moreover only a thousand i grumped naturally i grumped a thousand was a major score but id have grumped if theyd brought money around by the wagonload you couldve waited till a decent hour moreover he continued ignoring me completely they brought the latest news from the cantard my theories have been vindicated at last the expected collapse of glory mooncalleds revolution indicated by all those defections and desertions has proved chimerical he was just biding his time against the ripe moment aw hell now i understood why hed dragged me out didnt have a thing to do with money hed gotten his big chance to crow with me in no condition to fight back id figured mooncalled was on his last legs the evidence was there defections and desertions had been strong indicators that the rebellion was about to fold hell there were refugees from the cantard scattered all over karenta now id seen plenty right here in tunfaire i didnt bother asking how mooncalled had conjured another miracle the man did these things i went to work on the breakfast dean brought and waited on the dead man he would want to rub it in he loves it when i lose an argument completely he let me have it blow by blow the uneconomical way the way i do him when i want to yank his beard he claimed most of the defections and desertions hadnt been genuine furthermore mooncalled had just been lying low staying ahead of the various armies occasionally encouraging the venageti forces or karentine to come to blows while he awaited one of those rare but exceedingly violent storms that sweep into the cantard from the gulf i saw a few of those while i was down there all you can do is take cover and hope the cover stands up to the wind and rain while his enemies were paralyzed mooncalled had struck in both directions one force attacked full harbor karentas biggest bridgehead in the cantard hed tried before and had failed this time hed succeeded taking full harbor with all its supplies and munitions another force attacked quarache venagetas logistical bastion in the southern cantard quarache is bigger and far more important than full harbor it surrounds the only big reliable oasis in that part of the desert the venageti war effort hinges on continued control of quarache without it they wouldnt be able to project their power far enough to threaten the silver mines losing full harbor would hurt the karentine effort but not cripple it karenta has other bases along the coast venageta doesnt i tried a weak sally your boy is in deep shit now chuckles theyll send the marines to take the harbor back hes never gone up against marines except for a sly touch of amusement he ignored me he continued his story quarache didnt go the way of full harbor mooncalled hadnt had the strength to carry it completely fighting continued as the venageti rushed reinforcements in from everywhere were reclaiming quarache in prolonged desperate expensive housetohouse combat like most ordinary karentines ive developed an affection for glory mooncalled not that i want my kingdom to lose a war but when you spend your whole life a witness to the corruption incompetence and greed shown by our overlords you cant help but admire a guy who makes rude noises in their faces and brassily dares them to do their worst then dances around mocking them while they stumble over their own feet too i think a lot of us nurture the secret hope that mooncalleds antics will compel an end to the endless war this is really why you dragged me out of bed this and the fact that i wish to hear details of what happened last night and he did seem intensely interested i recalled that he had been from the beginning like hed suspected something he didnt want to share how was it that you managed to conclude the thing so quickly ah i think i detect a hint of jealousy a note of disbelief the law of averages suggests you should be capable of stumbling through unaided occasionally it is true that i remain amazed at your ability to flout that law so frequently yes he was piqued hed put all that time into all those interviews which we hadnt yet discussed expecting to dazzle one and all with a startling indictment then id had to go spoil his game by tracking down that jinxed coach garrett the killjoy thats me you want to tell me what you thought was going on when block first told us about the women somebody pounded on the door timing it as though the dead man had had him waiting in the wings that will be mr tharpe i allowed him to return home last evening he had personal matters to settle stay seated dean will handle the door i yelled dean throw that cat out when you let saucerhead in i waited till tharpe came in before i started my story you got lucky saucerhead said when i finished lucky hell that was a prime piece of deducting and detecting tharpe grunted unconvinced i didnt see anybody else thinking about attacking it by looking for the coach i still say you lucked out garrett how about if the old geezer used some regular coach how about if he walked but he didnt and thats the point and thats what cost him he decided to break in on a closed house and use it for his base and found him a spiffy neato coach there and just couldnt resist going in style and it cost him for a second i wondered if the jinx had gotten old butterflybreath but i didnt care i wasnt much bothered by having croaked him now i hadnt run into many people whod needed killing more i couldnt feel bad about doing the world a favor you lucked out saucerhead insisted and wouldnt be swayed neither would the dead man mr tharpe i have an errand for you should you care to extend your employment you pay i play saucerhead liked the dead man for some reason this building has become suspiciously free of vermin that was because id burned a dozen sulfur candles one day while he was taking one of his sixweek naps i thought id do him a favor bugs like to snack on him i am accustomed to employing large numbers of insects when i examine the various permutations of action available to the forces operating in the cantard i cannot indulge my curiosity without them you already heard what glory mooncalled done then yes i am excited i need a few thousand insects with which to evolve through the options available to the surviving combatants he had a habit of lining bugs up on the wall like soldiers and running them through maneuvers a disgusting vice now wait a minute i protested i just got this place deinfested bugs and mice are the dead mans worst enemies left unchecked they would devour him in no time so you are the villain responsible he knew darned well i was he just hadnt brought it up before i am he said i im also the guy what owns this dump im also the guy whats feeling damned put upon on account of ive got a housekeeper whos moved in uninvited and figures its his duty to drag in every stray cat he can find im also the guy what dont like the floor crunching under his tootsies whenever he starts looking for the chamber pot in the dark never mind about the bugs saucerhead let him use his imagination the dead man sent me an exaggerated mental sigh so be it i fear then mr tharpe that we have no further need for your services i gave the dead man a narroweyed look hed given up too easily hes right what do we owe you not enough so i dont got to go back to raising knots on heads for that creep licks a sad story nobody liked licks including me and i didnt know him guy has to make a living i guess i counted out a few coins not much tharpe seemed satisfied he hadnt done anything but answer the door you might maybe add a little tip on account of personal hardship garrett personal hardship i had to be here instead of home though maybe from what i hear you done forgot about women not quite not yet but its fading fast so be cynical and selfserving go apologize to tinnie he liked tinnie hell i liked her i just couldnt get along with her redheaded temper for now the songs you sing do change abstinence does make the heart grow fonder saucerhead seemed in no hurry to leave he and the dead man were wondering what might have snapped inside the butterfly mans head and left him wanting to carve up women i figured this was my chance i gathered my breakfast leavings took them to the kitchen once i disposed of the evidence id slide upstairs and catch me forty winks somebody banged on the door what was this id worked so hard to discourage customers that i didnt get this many visitors in a week anymore dean made like he was too snowed in cleaning up so i took care of it myself hoping for some randy sex goddess i got barking dog amato id forgotten him completely you forgot all about me garrett he accused pushing inside forcing me back with his personal chemistry no i lied i figured you hadnt had time to get anything ready yet been raining not much else to do making signs and handbills gets old youd think a drenching would wash the grunge away not so water just brought it to life i considered propping the door open maybe opening a few windows so the wind could blow through if id lived on the hill i might have tried it in my neighborhood you wouldnt dare even during a typhoon there would be some opportunist ready to accept the challenge besides i only had one downstairs window once past me amato halted dripped reeked looked around you got that thing that whatsit they call the dead man id sure like to take a gander at that you know what i mean i tried shallow breaths i dont know why we bother it never helps why not youre a man he ought to meet i wished old bones had him a working sniffer id lock them in together till amato sold him his whole zany conspiracy collection i opened the dead mans door held it for amato saucerhead in my chair halfturned saw barking dog his face scrunched up into a worldclass frown he didnt ask though he got a whiff thats why he gasped i see you got a client id better go goodbye all in one long exhalation he slid out the door almost before i got through he tossed me a look that told me he wanted to hear all about it later a lot later after the miasma cleared i winked make sure the front door is closed barking dog said my god its an ugly sucker got a hooter like a mammoth dont it another missionary garrett this is kropotkin amato you recall the arrangement we made you know what i mean you still intend to harass me you will recall that your previous effort met with a singular lack of success me no nor did you bother mentioning any arrangement though i discern the details in your mind we did not contract to have the man watch himself we didnt contract anything smiley barking dog looked baffled i would have too hearing only half the conversation i changed subjects you can understand why i did it i didnt want to bruise amatos feelings the dead man could peek inside his head see why we didnt have to mount a major campaign you are correct garrett this time however unlikely he believes his theories which you will understand make them the reality in which he lives i suggest you do meet our principal try to ascertain why he deems it worthwhile to keep tabs on mr amato good morning mr amato i have been anxious to make your acquaintance since mr garrett first undertook to trace your movements the rat was going to lay it off on me uh hi barking dog was at a loss for words maybe i ought to check to see if this was really him one breath and i knew i didnt have to check look here chuckles dont you go mr amato and i have a great deal to discuss garrett i suggest you visit mr hullar and see if you cannot unearth a reason for his interest yeah garrett what you been doing anyhow you was supposed to i fled defeated would barking dog care that id neglected him only to save tunfaire from a vicious serial killer he would be sure they had bought me off even though he was the subject i was supposed to investigate for them i gave the stairway one longing look then got into my rain gear i checked my pockets to see how much cash i had maybe i could rent me a room and catch a few winks i made a sudden sally into the small front room before i left thinking id snatch deans cat and drag it along but the cat wasnt in evidence only the scratches it had left on my furniture then i realized that i had nothing to report to hullar i trudged back and pried barking dogs report away from him he and the dead man were weaving drunken spiderwebs of conspiracy theory already the tenderloin is that part of town which caters to the side of people they keep hidden any vice can be found there any sin committed almost any need fulfilled the hookers and the drug dens and gambling pits are just the surface the glamour at least those aspects of those things that can be glamorous when seen from the street its a glitzy street or streets really the area is bigger than tinkery row and more successful nothing sells like sin after the hill its the most prosperous cleanest safest and most orderly part of the city some very unpleasant people make sure it stays that way it all belongs directly or indirectly to chodo contagues empire bishoff hullars taxidance place is as tame a dive as you can find there thats all the girls do dance and talk to lonely fellows and try to get them to buy drinks maybe a few make personal arrangements but there are no facilities on the premises the place is as shabby as theyre allowed to get down there frankly i dont see how hullar stays in business competing with neighbors who offer so much more the place wasnt jumping when i arrived but it was just after noon then a couple of sadlooking sailors sat at a table talking to a sadlooking girl who sipped colored water and didnt pretend very hard that she gave a damn about what the sailors were saying a doddering ratman mopped around the other tables all those had chairs piled atop them there was nobody on the dance floor though a couple more girls were loafing by the bandstand where three wornout old musicians werent trying very hard to stay awake both girls glanced at me wondering if i was worth the effort of making so long a trek one who looked like she might break out in a case of puberty any day lazily packed a pipe with weed the guy behind the bar had to be the worlds oldest dwarf he wore the full costume complete with a pheasants feather in a peaked little cap he had a beard that should have kept the floor swept of debris whats it going to be ace he wiped the bar in front of me with the same rag hed been using to polish mugs beer pint yeah light dark light lager pilsner just draw one surprise me weiders if you got it i figured i owed old man weider a little commercial loyalty what with him having had me on retainer so long hasty always hasty he drew me a pint wet enough for you out there oh my a talkative bartender wet enough hullar around who wants to know suddenly he was completely alert names garrett im supposed to be doing something for him yeah he wiped the bar next to me while he thought about that after a moment he said ill check off he trundled i rose onto my toes watched wondering if hed stumble over his beard hi im brenda the pipe smoker had puffed up enough ambition to hike all the way over i glanced at her resumed studying the wasteland behind the bar the woman was less interesting up close it was obvious she wasnt a child that that was just her hook the gamine had gone a long time ago probably before she was old enough to become a gamine i said im just here to see hullar business oh her voice had had little life before now it was dead i glanced at the musicians i could part with a few coppers though if you could explain why those band guys are here at this time of day i didnt know hullars place well but didnt think there was any music during the day somebody kicked the shit out of them last night after work theyre waiting to talk to some guy about it licks coming in to put the arm on them youre in ace the man says come on back i dropped a halfdozen coppers into the womans hand she made an effort to find a smile but had trouble remembering where shed left it i wanted to say something to waken her spirit but couldnt think of a thing so i just said thanks and hurried after the dwarf if i let him get too big a head start id miss out when he tripped over his beard bishoff hullar was five feet tall three feet wide bald as an egg in his sixties ugly as sin itself the width wasnt fat id heard he was a strongman in his younger days and that he kept up in case there was a call for his talents sit garrett he indicated a rickety antediluvian chair he had a voice like rocks tumbling around inside an iron drum somebody had done the leadpipe thing on his throat in his onceuponatime you got anything for me i gave him barking dogs report he took it started reading i said i have some questions i glanced around his workplace you couldnt call it an office he sat behind a table with some writing tools on it but also makeup pots which suggested the girls used the place for a dressing room overall it was as tacky as the rest of the place huh he looked up piggy little gray eyes narrowed basic stuff my partner never got around to asking because he thought this job would be a good joke on me hullars eyes got narrower joke barking dog amato nobody in the world is going to pay somebody to spy on a lunatic least of all a guy who runs a place like this down here i cant see you even knowing barking dog i dont wouldnt know him if he walked in and sank his fangs in me whats it to you youre getting paid im the guy what takes his butt onto the street amongst the slings and arrows hullar i kind of like to know why im doing that and who for that way i have a notion what direction to expect trouble from when it comes youre not going to see no trouble they all tell me that if there wasnt trouble though they wouldnt come to me in the first place i dont play blindfolded hullar he put the report down looked at me like he was making up his mind whether to kick my butt or not not won the toss you got a good rep garrett why i picked you ill take a chance i waited he brooded the dwarf bartender waited at the door maybe to see if the boss would need help there wasnt much tension though i didnt feel threatened i aint got much here garrett we aint got much but were like family we take care of each other on account of were all weve got this here is like the last ledge before the fall into the pit i couldnt argue that i kept my opinion to myself my old mom used to suggest strongly that i just might learn something if i could manage to keep my mouth shut long enough to listen mom was right but i didnt get the message for years and i still forget it far too often somebody works for me comes to me with their trouble usually i try to lend a hand if i can i do that maybe they give me a little help when i need it right makes sense only in the real world it doesnt work that way very often one of your people wants barking dog watched he eyed me still taking my measure youre a cynic you dont believe in much especially not people maybe thats a good thing in your line kind of folks you probably have to deal with yeah i was proud of me i kept a straight face he glanced at the dwarf got a response i didnt catch all right heres the way it is garrett amatos kid works for me when he got himself tossed in the alkhar she hes got a daughter youve heard that one about knocking a guy over with a feather that feather would have smashed me like a bug yeah this amato hes a loony but harmless you know that i know that only hes got a habit of naming names shes scared maybe he named the wrong one some hilltype asshole what dont got a sense of humor maybe the old man is about to get his ass in deep shit girls a little lightheaded herself if you get my drift but shes family here and when my people worry i try to fix it so they dont so what i want from you is you should keep an eye on the old nut let me know if hes about to step in it so i can yank him out of the way before he gets run over understand yes and no barking dog with a daughter how did he ever manage that a bit hard to buy yeah something about it you dont like you just say youre out ill get somebody else i picked you on account of they say youre almost honest but i can live without you its just a big chunk to swallow you dont know barking dog you did youd know why i cant figure him for having a kid crunch tell sas to bring us a couple of beers the dwarf left we didnt talk after a while a woman came with two beers light for me and dark for hullar id seen her with the gamine muttering with the musicians i hadnt noticed then but up close the resemblance to amato was there she even had those spooky eyes that looked like they were seeing things hidden from the rest of us she pretended not to study me while i pretended not to study her thanks sas sure bish she left sure looks like him i admitted there you go any problems now not really i wondered if shed studied me because the dwarf had told her who i was probably maybe hed sent her back more to give her a look than to give me one this supposed to be a secret secret ill tell my partner of course he wont kick it around but is it supposed to be a secret from the rest of the world probably wouldnt hurt the guy maybe does have an enemy or three suppose he catches on that im watching am i allowed to tell him why i dont figure that would do sas no good look i know this aint in your usual line pretty tame you being used to mixing it up with sorcerers and gangsters and hill folk but it means something to us you dont got to make a career out of it i aint paying that much but wed all appreciate it if youd let us in on it should he get his ass into something he cant handle right i rose good enough i believed him because i wanted to believe him you dont much see people do nice things for people one of your girls said your musicians are having problems you dont need to worry about that tooken care of for a moment he looked like the evil thing id pictured him to be or will be real soon how about you take my mug back out to crunch i took both mugs the dwarf grunted when i made my delivery for an old guy especially for an old dwarf crunch was astonishingly polite as i headed for the street i glanced at the bandbox and almost tripped over my feet a man had joined the musicians he was one guy id hoped i wouldnt ever see again he stared at me i stared back he had nothing on me in height and only a little in weight but size didnt make this man he reeked menace the way barking dog amato reeked uninspired personal hygiene he scared you just by being around even when he smiled his name was crask he was one of chodo contagues top cats he hurt people for a living he enjoyed his work i realized id stopped to stare he kept staring too each of us was wondering what the hell the other was doing there when my brain unfroze again i had no trouble figuring him he was there because of the battered musicians old licks didnt have a license from the outfit him and his buddies would be in deep shit if crask caught up especially deep for picking on musicians in the tenderloin the tenderloin was chodos even the king doesnt mess around down there i almost made it to the door before i got stunned again the girl blew in as i reached for the latch i dodged gaped for all she reacted i was a ghost she was the one those villains had dragged out of morleys place the one morley claimed was the kingpins daughter i turned stared maybe panted some as she strode toward crunch crasks face went as cold as death my heart jumped but it wasnt me he was watching the girl glanced his way stopped made a little sound of surprise whirled and sprinted for the street she ricocheted off me as she went i purred whip me beat me crask came pounding up behind me as i stepped into the rain to watch her fly away he halted beside me what the hell was that i asked what you doing here garrett he sounded suspicious nasty suspicious like gettingreadytobreakarmsandlegs suspicious what are you doing here i thought you were too bigtime for legwork she come here to meet you huh that was a surprise notion uhuh no touch ill break things crask was scary but i wasnt afraid of him in any headbutting contest i figured our chances were equal if we got to prancing around pounding on each other he was scary because he was a killer and a smart one if he decided to send you over you might as well start counting your beads you stay away garrett or theyll find parts of you all over town i didnt know you had a woman who is she fact was i thought he and his sidekick sadler had a thing huh im going to tell you this once crask i dont know the girl i have seen her before once she walked into morley dotess place night before last two minutes later a bunch of guys roared in and tried to kidnap her me and morley and saucerhead showed them what we think of guys who pick up their girls the rough way she disappeared before we finished beginning and end of story now its your go who is she how come you got your balls in an uproar you dont need to know the girl was out of sight now crask frowned after her as much puzzled as angry hed bought my story probably because id not lied to him much in the past what was she doing at dotess place you got me never said a word just came in looking scared sat by herself then three guys blew in and dragged her out he grunted i didnt know about that thanks garrett ill give you one back tell tharpe it aint going to be healthy hanging around with those guys trying to mess with the musicians i was going to suggest that anyway after i saw you in there i started moving planning to put some distance between us before it occurred to him to bring up old business garrett damn what you see the girl around again pass the word wed like to know sure but why who is she just do it he went inside without turning his back i hustled away breathing hard it had been an encounter id dreaded more than necessary maybe maybe the street in front of hullars place didnt strike him as the best stage for my demise peace and harmony broke out all over i had nothing to do but loaf deliver the occasional report to hullar and keep an eye on deans crowd whenever he had them over for one of his rehab parties you wouldnt believe how rowdy old men can get there werent any cats around and except for his barbs about me not working dean wasnt a nuisance the dead man went to sleep visions of glory mooncalled dancing in his head saucerhead resigned from the musicianorganizing racket just before morley reported that he was no longer obliged to endure the custom of that human smudgepot licks i got out and visited bought a few rounds for friends reforged contacts even dropped by the brewery and spent a few days checking employee theft for weider as always he wanted me to take the job fulltime as always i couldnt overcome my horror of holding down a real job nobodys life stays on that high and relaxed a level especially not mine the gods have a special garrett harassment squad dedicated solely to my persecution so i should have known the good times were over the morning i went out to run and found that the rains had returned i was in my office busting my skull trying to fake up numbers that would impress the tax thugs with the depths of my destitution somebody hammered on the door i groaned it was nearly suppertime and dean was fixing a standing rib roast that would be bloody rare and would melt in my mouth with all the extras smelling the odors from the kitchen had me drooling already dean asked shall i ignore it no its probably saucerhead tharpe had been around a lot lately his flame had walked his luck hadnt been good since there enough to feed him too barely saucerhead does put it away there wont be anything left over i shrugged ill get even with him someday you just want to get away from what youre doing he tottered down the hall to the accompaniment of renewed pounding somebody was awfully anxious dean was right i did want to get away i hate the whole idea of taxes what have i ever gotten from the crown a pack and a collection of weapons and a fiveyear adventure in the war zone i had to give back the pack and weapons they just wanted to rip me off so they could give some other kid a chance to see the acne on the ass of the world i got out of having to be creative but all things considered id rather id stayed with the taxes it wasnt saucerhead it was a guy id hoped never to see again captain block dean showed block into my office block looked frazzled i couldnt help myself now what block planted his behind settled his elbows on his knees buried his face in his hands same as before youll have to see it look i bailed you out once isnt that enough deans cooking supper itll be ready in half an hour so he told me also told me you were busy doing taxes yeah you wouldnt be the kind of guy whod forget to report a fat cash payment from the watch would you damned right i would be why one mission of the watch is to investigate alleged tax fraud we dont do much of that but when theres a report we have to act to cover our butts ill find my hat how far do we have to go not far he smiled weakly i knew i could count on you and im sure your purse wont get hurt this time either no happiness came through his smile he looked more stressed than last time what had him by the short hairs now something that would be politically painful surely by getting out tapping the wind of rumor whispering through the streets i knew block had turned catching old bugbreath into a big score suddenly there was a lot of stuff going on in the shadows prince rupert was getting behind westman block block had hidden irons in the fire it all had the knights of the street feeling nervous i made sure i was equipped for trouble just because of the company id be keeping trouble followed block we talked about the cantard as we walked glory mooncalled had abandoned his effort to capture quarache but had hamstrung the venageti ability to project their power far into the desert id also been on the mark about the marines getting the job of retaking full harbor that operation had begun i had mixed feelings they brag that when they turn you into a marine they make you a marine forever the more we talked the more i realized that block was thoroughly spooked whatever his problem it was going to be something i wouldnt like now i was spooked identical i said staring at the gutted naked girl she hung in an alleyway behind abandoned tenements on the near south side those tenements had been occupied by ratmen squatters until a few hours ago they were long gone now in the rain and poor light the dead girl was a ringer for the one block had shown me in the bustee this cant be block i got them i had to believe id gotten them im not made to shake off killing the wrong villains block wasnt so scared for his behind that he couldnt see what was bothering me you got the right guy garrett dont doubt that for a minute after we got the princes goahead we took that place apart you wouldnt believe what we found theyd been in there a long time they kept pieces of all their victims there were bodies in the cellar girls but not the type my guess is they used them for practice before they went after the real thing i stared at the new corpse listened to the flies sing there was one thing i told him about that missing clothing and knives id discovered that morley hadnt taken away any souvenirs i didnt mention morleys name it wouldnt appeal to block you didnt mention any of this before i thought everything was wrapped up before but yeah but elvis a nondescript watchman hurried over captain show mr garrett what you found elvis had a folded scrap of paper tucked into a pocket inside his rain cape inside it were three green butterflies i shivered as though the rain had turned to sleet how long since the last murder twelve days this one was right on schedule i was afraid youd say that id been confident he would i dont know why i asked maybe i hoped hed show me i was wrong the killer is dead but the killing goes on how can that be garrett now i understood why block was so rattled this wasnt just a matter of his career being in jeopardy i dont know what happened to the old mans body it was cremated i saw them both go into the ovens what did you do with the old man from the bustee did you get anything out of him block looked embarrassed he died huh we tried too hard gave him too much of everything he overdid himself to death i just shook my head it could only happen around me you recheck the hamilton place since you found this got the report before i came after you nothing there no connection what about the coach hasnt moved the wheels are chained so it cant be and the horses were sold they didnt belong there they were squatters too know who this girl is yet no but it wont be long before we do shell be somebody he meant shed be related to somebody none of the dead girls had been important in their own right yet but theyd all come off the hill if the pattern holds i was scared and confused i told block i was scared and confused and didnt know what to do now except wed better talk it over with the dead man before we do anything he did interview all those people block brightened yeah if theres anything to start on he ought to have it i recalled my roast that wonderful expensive roast that had had me drooling for hours i wasnt hungry anymore it probably dont mean a thing now i said but did you ever find out who we caught the old guy no dipshit the lead horse in the team in yes block glanced around then whispered idraca matiston whoa scares me who the hell is was idraca matiston keep it down will you somebody i take it that was enough of a somebody that you dont want word getting around whisper idraca matiston viscount nettles lady hamiltons lover had a bit of a bizarre reputation to begin which is why we wrapped it fast and quiet and other quarters let it out hed passed on from complications he was in and out of the hamilton house all the time and nobody thought anything of it because hed always been now i know what i know id go back and take a closer look at lady hamiltons mishap if the prince would let me i still dont know who youre talking about i dont keep up with the ruling classs scandals guess it doesnt matter now anyway no it doesnt were under orders to forget that episode i was willing to forget everything except when i looked at the young woman without her entrails i shut up did not press block but i did wonder about a woman who would take an antique like old butterflybreath for her lover your dream came true i told dean when he let us in im employed youd better be more careful what you wish for is it that bad worse go wake up the dead man what about supper everything is overdone now he almost whined hes proud of his cooking if youd seen what i did you wouldnt want to eat either oh then ill have to get everything off the stove and put away right away thus he evaded having to deal with the dead man he has a real talent for getting out of things by having something else to do that has to get done first i told block we may have to light a fire under him i think hes only been asleep about a week sometimes these spells last for months dean since you dont want to handle his nibs you get to go get morley that would fix him he was less comfortable at morleys place than in the dead mans room the brave captain block endured our juvenile maneuvers without comment maybe there was a human being in there maybe i could grow to like the guy incompetence and all i led the way storming the ramparts or whatever i hadnt been into the dead mans room since well before his nap began things had changed gods block swore i made an inarticulate sound something like a squeal the place was full of bugs big bugs little bugs enough bugs to carry the dead man away if they got into teamwork and i knew who was to blame the fat stiff had worked a deal with saucerhead behind my back the real question was how had he worked it so the creepycrawlies hadnt gotten into the rest of the house to give his scheme away i muttered i hope youre enjoying your dreams about the cantard despite my efforts chitin crunched underfoot what is this block asked he collects bugs believe it or not and doesnt bother to get rid of them when hes done playing with them now ill have to use sulfur candles again i hate it when i have to do that i wondered if dean had been in on the deal probably that would explain the absence of the cat hed know id start exterminating as soon as i found out no cat would survive a thorough sulfurcandle job i started considering doing a sulfurcandle job on myself it had been half an hour he dead block asked like for good his nibs hadnt twitched a mental muscle no just napping really he picks his times for when its most inopportune how come i shrugged these things happen to me what do you do fuss and fume and threaten to light a fire under him scream and yell and run in circles what if that dont work then i muddle through on my own i started loosening up to do my screaming and circling id exhausted fuss and fume and threaten block started wadding scrap paper from a trash box nobody had emptied in an epoch he tossed the wads under the dead mans chair i got attentive whatre you doing my money was under there i hoped he hadnt noticed going to start that fire you mentioned hell you got balls after all i talked about it but never seriously considered doing it i leaned against the doorframe watched this could get interesting the bugs started getting excited more excited than they usually do when someone is stomping around i began to suspect that my partner wasnt as far away as hed like me to think block grabbed a lamp damn he was going to go for it all the way i wouldnt interfere in it for anything grinning i observed i figure the fire will get his attention before its big enough to be a threat to the house after four hundred years hes pretty dried out ever hear about how when the dewife invaded polkta they couldnt find enough wood to heat their stills no trees in polkta so they dragged old mummies out of the ancient polktan tombs and burned them instead block paused really he had a big dopey frown on really a body dries out for a few hundred years itll burn not great but good enough so you dont have to do without your liquor oh block didnt care about curiosa in fact he was baffled what did this have to do with a bunch of drunken barbarian tomb robbers in a faraway land a hundred years ago i had to wonder about the man and my cherished notions about the watch maybe i was wrong maybe they werent all bonelazy and graftbitten maybe some were wellmeaning like block most of the time but were too stupid to handle their jobs block squatted to shove the lamp under the dead mans chair call him off garrett it lives hang in there captain im starting to get something garrett take a peek inside a head or two old bones weve got a problem block froze flame a foot from the wastepaper eyes a hair too high to spot my stash i have called you a curse upon my waning years garrett i have been too kind many a time have i been tempted to terminate our association i should have yielded you are rude pushy thoughtless uncouth only a certain crude charm shields you my mother loved me but what did she know eh i could spend hours cataloging your shortcomings but this is not the time youve done it often enough that i know them by heart anyway excellent you do have your redeeming virtues first time id heard that from him tinnie and maya and one or twelve other ladies had mentioned an occasional virtue and a morethanoccasional failing but including an allconsuming laziness however this once you were correct to disturb me gods you can carry me away ive seen it all now your manners are deplorable you might have found a more civil means of obtaining my attention but your assessment is correct you cannot handle this without my assistance smug character eh i signaled block to back off hes awake i breathed easier with the watchman away from the household fortune i feared it would come to this the hints were there but i allowed your success on the hill come so swift and with such apparent finality to deceive me because i wanted it to be true yes even master realists such as myself may in a lifetime succumb occasionally to wishful thinking the mind and the heart naturally eschew horror brag about your failures loudly longly humbly and you can make a virtue of them make it look like youre a regular guy i asked how come i get the feeling you werent asleep at all you were just rehearsing cut the awshucks comedy chuckles girls are dying right on schedule they shouldnt be you talked to everybody who had anything to do with the others did you get anything give us an angle tell us how to stop this thing for good that may not be possible not in the sense you mean if it is what i feared at first glimpse captain block i need to know about that man you took from the bustee garrett i want to know about those ritual knives i felt him digging into my mind deeper than usual presumably he was doing the same to block at the same time blocks eyes got huge in my case i felt him digging after things i hadnt noticed noticing at the site of the most recent murder its neither fun nor comfortable having somebody prowl through your head i hate it youd hate it too there are things in there that nobody ought to know but i didnt shut him out i can do that if i work at it hard enough he surprised me butterflies yes so three times now butterflies this is a new twist though no one has mentioned butterflies in connection with any of the victims you did not see yourself i feel that we are dealing with a single killer no shit i couldnt see there being a bunch of guys all getting the same idea hey wouldnt it be neat if i found me a pretty young brunette and strung her up and bled her and cut her guts out indeed garrett absolutely one particularly interesting fact that emerged from my interview series was that the blond young lady tania fahkien was not a natural blond in fact the state of blondness had befallen her only hours before her demise are any of them natural blonds not many in my experience just so the point is the coloring of the victims is worth pursuit even block had gotten that far i said so of course but we forgot that in our excitement over having brought the killer to ruin correct the details do seem inconsequential when youve got your bad guy nailed down and everything wrapped you said you feared this did you have some idea what was going on before i spoiled everything by getting lucky but not as lucky as i thought yes as you suspect these sorts of murders have come around before i know of three previous series though without any direct knowledge of the first two outbreaks those occurred while i was still among the ambulatory surrounded by a people whose foibles and tribulations were at best of marginal and academic interest the victim types and killing methods were similar but insofar as i recall there were no butterflies so maybe nobody noticed you dont see what youre not looking for but blocks one man had perhaps there was no reason to look for butterflies though as i noted i was not that interested in those outbreaks other than as behavioral curiosities amongst the unwashed and ignorant latecoming barbarian a creature capable of firing his distilleries with the remains of his dead he does like to get his needles in all right you know something you said you feared this how about you get to the point before all the brunettes in town are lost to us i confess to a personal penchant for redheads but brunettes are a valuable resource in their own right horrors out of olden times garrett its happened before right surprise me a surprise fact me a fact i was never involved with those prior cycles yet they were dramatic enough to stick in mind though with few useful details i can see that i was getting exasperated and he was enjoying that how about remembering what you can remember he sighed mentally but forged boldly into new territory by ignoring my impatience then as now the victims fell into a narrow range of physical characteristics they were female young brunette attractive by human standards with very similar features in fact facial similarities seemed more important that height or weight the faces of many women flickered through my mind as he had reconstructed them from his interviews and ancient recollections none were related but all could have passed as sisters all had faces much like that of chodos daughter if not as pale and wore their hair as she had when id run into her at hullars hey for the first time i realized that shed worn her hair differently there that shed had a full head of hair hanging long not the helmet id seen at morleys place hairstyle could be a key the dead man produced several notions of styles from olden times the faces and figures remained vague but the hairstyles were identical with that worn by chodos daughter at hullars all the recently departed had had bushels of hair so maybe we got us an unhappy hairdresser block said stalking down the corridors of history eliminating the gauche and passé the man had a sense of humor after all weird but he had one i said this mess is getting kind of spooky smiley and i wasnt alone in thinking so despite his flirtation with levity block was green around the gills there is sorcery in it garrett grim gruesome ancient and evil sorcery necromancy of the darkest form dead men who have gone to the crematorium do not rise up and resume their atrocities really what genius hell i figured that out im not a detective for nothing deductive reasoning or was it inductive i can never keep those two straight there is a curse at work if this outbreak is indeed connected with those that went before it is a very potent curse in those cases when the guilty parties were apprehended and executed the killings stopped but did start up again later eventually apparently after generations they started up again right away this time block said this was the first time the guilty party was caught quickly this was the first time without a trial and execution this was the first time the guilty party was cremated whats that got to do with anything block demanded he was into the thing now in fact he was back over by that lamp looking like he was thinking about starting a fire just to make the dead man get on with it he wasnt as dumb as he pretended as i recollect the earlier killers were caught tried convicted and hanged two were hanged i believe the first was beheaded beheading was the punishment in fashion then in each case the remains went into unmarked graves executed criminals still go into unmarked graves thats part of the punishment and i asked so from block garrett garrett must you be so determinedly thick of wit i have given you everything you need use your brain for something more than landfill that keeps your ears from clacking together the same old challenge use my godsgiven mind and talents to figure it out for myself hes no fun at all but he thinks hes bringing me up right block grabbed the lamp and headed for the dead mans chair i waved him off hes right sort of hes given us what we need anyway if you bully him he gets stubborn its a pride thing hell let you burn him and the house both before hell give you a straighter answer block eyeballed me a moment before he decided i was telling it straight a goddamned oracle eh he put the lamp back where it belonged so whats he talking about wheres our point of attack i didnt have the foggiest all i knew was that the dead man had seen some fog and if he had then it was right there in front of my face of course you not being in the middle of it stressed out and confused and still smelling the stink of a girl who died in terror you have it all scoped out and youre telling yourself that garrett hes too dumb to be believed i nearly had it i started to get a eureka grin my unconscious was hinting that it might pay off if i was a good boy but then somebody went to hammering on the door the front door is the curse of my life could i brick it up slide in and out the back way it some pest found himself facing nothing but rough brick would he persist in trying to inflict himself on me i lost whatever was about to surface i glanced at block he looked like he was having trouble figuring out how to spell his own name no help there i trudged to the door glanced through the peephole i saw morley and dean staring back i was tempted to leave them there but morley was the kind of guy who would chew his way through a door if he thought you were letting him cool his heels anyway he didnt deserve to be left out in the rain and i didnt see how i could let him in without admitting dean too so i opened up and let the whole crowd stamp in with their ingrate comments about how long it ought to take to unlock a door it occurred to me not for the first time that i could sell my place for a lot more than i paid for the wreck it was when i bought it i could move on somewhere where no one knew me i could get me a real job put in my ten or twelve hours a day and suffer no hassles the rest of the time whoever bought my place could enjoy what i left behind i could make the sale more attractive by offering the houses contents at no extra cost caveat emptor so long dean goodbye dead man you got me over here youd better catch my attention fast morley told me not even a query about my health but what are friends for if not to make us feel little and unloved ive got a date indeed i tried my dead man impression you will recall a certain corpse in a certain coach house on a certain hill not so long ago relating to a certain series of distinctly unpleasant murders as in the waste of highgrade dalliance talent probably for someone far less deserving than you or i but yes the one we came across during our evening constitutional one night why were we doing this id started it and i didnt know except that dean was there to witness whatever we said but why should i care what dean thought the guy liked cats theres something fundamentally wrong with a guy who likes cats why should his opinion concern me what about it this about it the gentleman who got his deserts that night despite having found his way into a city crematorium hasnt given up his hobby say what morley couldnt stay with the game theres been another murder just like the others right on schedule we dont know who she was yet but we will soon i gave a jerk of the head toward the dead mans room official company the dead man tells us theres a curse involved sorcery no really you dont have to take that tone dean you have work to do you want to hang out here twentysix hours a day you damned well better he might be in his seventies but he didnt let the years slow him a bit he stuck his tongue out like he was six then he headed for the kitchen fast as a glacier smoke boiling around his heels as he fled i told morley about my plan to sell the place as is to anybody who had a few marks to invest he didnt jump at the opportunity dean wasnt impressed with the threat i had to spend more time on the streets had to learn how to be nasty again dean beat the sevenyear locusts to the kitchen i celebrated the new age by nudging morley into my office explaining the situation here being morley part elf and familiar with things sorcerous and eldritch he cut straight to the heart of it immediately finding the thing that had been nagging me since the dead man had told me hed given me enough to go on the man you skragged was naked when you brought the watch captain the men buried in the old days would have gone into the ground wearing whatever they had on when they were executed which would have been what they were wearing when they were caught the clothes must be the key or something the old boy had on him an amulet jewelry something that whoever got into the coach house took when he stripped the corpse cut it by that point id gotten the point if you follow me it wasnt the man that was cursed it was something that went with the man like maybe some knives i shuddered i shivered i went cold all over this was grim i would have to do some legwork one hell of a lot of legwork i would have to dig out records that went back to imperial times to see what the villains had in common what piece of apparel decoration or whatnot that might carry a curse compelling a man to waste ladies who ought to be conserved for fates sometimes known as worse than death is it really worse girls the case had developed a certain rhythm i should have expected what happened next as i was about to rejoin block and the dead man it was guaranteed somebody pounded on the door three guys with knives i muttered as i headed that way dean having proclaimed himself incapacitated before the pounding stopped i peeped through the peephole i wish it was three guys with knives i considered pretending nobody was home but barking dog knew better he had come around often enough to know our dark secret somebody was always home i opened up uhm been more than a week garrett you aint been over to get my papers he bulled in behind the usual aromatic advance guard dripping he produced his latest report you writing the history of the world what else i got to do it dont stop raining i dont like getting wet i noticed huh nothing nothing cabin fevers making me cranky maybe you ought to polish your speeches it cant rain forever no only all day every day you noticed that its mostly just raining during the daytime how did the weather get so screwed up garrett i thought about tossing him something flip about the cantard and stormwardens but feared hed go off the deep end with some wild new theory youd think the gods themselves dont want me spreading the truth them probably more than most mortals i left it at that mostly because i didnt get a chance to say anything more barking dog froze his eyes got huge his breathing ragged he threw one hand up fingers twisting into the sign against the evil eye he said gah gah gah in a high squeak retreated toward the door its him he croaked garrett its him him was captain block who stood in the doorway to the dead mans room gaping when i turned back to amato i saw nothing but the door closing behind him gah gah i said making the horns what was that block asked what was amato doing here him and the dead man are buddies they get together to make up stories about the secret masters its amazing how they get along whats your story how do you know barking dog blocks cheek twitched he looked like he wasnt sure where he stood in the course of my labors as a minion of the hidden manipulators the puppet masters who pull the strings on marionette judges and functionaries i was forced to circumscribe mr amatos freedom i laughed you arrested him i didnt arrest him garrett whatever he claims i just asked him to come talk to a man who was put out about something he said hed have been fine if he couldve kept his mouth shut for five minutes but he just couldnt resist tearing into the best audience he ever had one thing led to another i had to take him in front of a magistrate for a formal warning about libel he couldnt stop running his mouth donner doesnt have a sense of humor he doesnt find barking dog an amusing street character the more he bore down the more amato jacked his jaw so he got pissed gave amato fiftyfive days for contempt and all of that is this running dogs fault you never heard such carrying on as when we were walking him over to the alkhar hell if he couldve kept his mouth shut then id probably have screwed up and let him get away but he pissed me off a different view of events i said though his version isnt much different he said it was his own fault block chuckled but grimly i wish all our rebels were as harmless huh one of the reasons the prince wants to get serious is he thinks were on the brink of chaos the way he puts it if the crown cant demonstrate its willingness to fulfill its social contract with the karentine people in an obvious and popular fashion well head into a period of increasing instability the first sign will be the appearance of neighborhood vigilante groups we already have those some places i know he thinks theyll get stronger and become politicized fast if glory mooncalled stays lucky each time he makes fools of us more movers and shakers head down there to help tame him the more that go the fewer there are to keep the peace here he thinks the vigilantes may connect up form private militias then different groups that dont agree politically will go to knocking each others heads got it some might even take a notion to get rid of the folks running things now the crown could end up as one more gang on the streets good boy me i didnt say a word about that overall we karentine rabble are unpolitical all we want is to be left alone we avoid what taxes we can but do pay some as protection money you pay a little here and there the tax goons dont grab everything near as i can tell thats the common mans traditional relationship with the state unless hes a state thug himself i said i might have to take a closer look at this prince if he really thinks the crown is something besides a mechanism for squeezing out cash to benefit the privileged classes i buttered too much sneer onto my remarks block didnt understand that i was being cynical and sarcastic instead of seditious he gave me a thoroughly dirty look i said maybe i should pay more attention to the fable about barking dogs running mouth maybe garrett what did you do down there thats a question every veteran understands and every human male adult in tunfaire who can stand on his hind legs and plenty who cant anymore are veterans the one thing the crown does very well indeed is find every man eligible for conscription army combat infantry to begin then longrange recon after i was wounded they moved me into military police i saved a baronets ass once which is how i came to get this job a hero but that didnt mean squat most everyone who lives long enough to get out does something heroic sometime even some downright nasty scum like crask have medals they trot out its a different world in the cantard its a different reality regardless of where they stand heroes or villains the men with the medals show them off with pride contradictions being human is contradictory ive known killers who were artists and artists who were killers the man who painted eleanor was a genius in both fields both natures had tortured him his torment ended only when he crossed paths with someone even crazier i said were wandering far afield lets scope out what to do about this killer you buy that about it coming back from the dead you mean like theres been outbreaks before block nodded from him yeah i buy it wed better dig into the old records you have the manpower and access for that and the clout to get around functionaries what do i look for i dont know a common thread anything if the same spirit is coming back again and again then its been caught and stopped before we see what they did back then we can do it now and maybe figure out how they screwed up so the cure didnt take if your buddy dont have something he caught from barking dog yeah if whatre you going to do i saw the first guy alive and dressed ill work the clothes and hope i get lucky again he eyed me narrowly he thought i knew something i did but what good would it do to tell him there was a survivor of a murder attempt and she was chodo contagues kid hed get himself a case of heart troubles complicated by hemorrhoids right so tell me one thing garrett what the hell is morley dotes doing here he wasnt dumb enough not to know that morley and i went way back i know what he is block and i know what he isnt but how to explain that this professional killer never offed anybody who hadnt asked for it how explain that morley had standards less flexible than most people on the right side of the law hes my window onto the other side of tunfaire theres anything to find out there hell find it i hoped i wasnt sure why id sent dean for morley now though it had seemed the thing to do at the time maybe he could conjure me a connection with chodos kid she had to know something her pretty head might hold the one fact we needed to nail this butterfly freak right she was the type who saw nothing but herself shed probably forgotten butterfly granddad as soon as the fear went away block scowled not liking morley being involved gods spare me the born again even when theyre born again only so they can cover their asses dont go righteous on me i said it wont help how did he know anyway morley was keeping his head down blocks scowl deepened ill go get my men started ill let you know what they find sure he would after he milked every ounce of advantage my opinion of him had improved but not so much i didnt think he was a born functionary him using me was still a desperation measure do i saw him into the drizzle then went to find out what the dead man thought another thousand marks if i wrap it permanently so the man promised he delivered before the dead man was pleased with himself for having wangled another cash commitment from block occasionally ive complained about the way you occasionally would you not prefer frequently or consistently possibly even persistently or continuously once in a while whenever the sevenyear locusts sing but i did want to make the opposite point that was a coup getting him to pay again he is desperate and desperate times are the best times for those who are alert to opportunity i understand what do you think about interviewing chodos daughter morley had invited himself out of my office into the dead mans room now he invited himself to comment this came up before my overtures were not greeted with cries of joy leave it to me i got style get word to crask that i want to talk about the girl dont say what girl he dont know i know who she is i dont get it how can he not know you dont have to get it just tell him i want to talk to him about a girl you dont say which one hell know what i mean him and me can take it from there youre working an angle garrett you ought to know better you always get yourself into deep shit what is it dont try anything with the kingpins kid you get a notion like that slash your wrists and save the rest of us some grief what do you think i asked the dead man an interview with the girl may prove unproductive but an interview is necessary to demonstrate that if possible arrange to see her here the very core of my master plan you lie but i do trust your sense of selfpreservation will deflect your inclinations i am a mature human being sir i do not look upon all members of the opposite sex as objects of desire morley sneered only those over eight and under eighty youre not helping sure i dont plan to be in bed alone when i go but i dont plan to go for a couple centuries either ha i convinced me all but one tiny part that wondered what id do if chodos daughter suffered some miraculous remission and not only became able to see me but decided to whisper sweet nothings sometimes even the stoutesthearted of us white knights find the dictates of reason conscience and survival overruled by parts not amenable to the dictates of the mind theres a sociopath in each of us just waiting to miss the connection between an act and its consequences right morley didnt believe me i got the impression the dead man didnt either my own doubts were less apocalyptic id seen enough of the woman to have become deafened to the sirens of that fantasy i might snort and stamp but i wouldnt lose control she wasnt my type we talked about this and that till morley decided hed heard enough bad news he said if im away too long puddle and sarge and the kid will have me set for the poorhouse sure lets go watch them race the flying pigs i saw morley out rejoined the dead man what now garrett im thinking real hard about taking a nap indeed and what was that mr amato brought i trust that you do recall that we have another iron in the fire come on you want me to drag that mess down to hullar it occurred to me that doing so might be useful in more than the obvious way when you deliver the report invest a few minutes in trying to learn if anyone knows why the contague woman turned up there i did wonder about that but you were not ambitious enough to pursue it you really must make tnt your motto garrett tnt today not tomorrow take it from an expert the only thing one should defer is ones final appointment with death hang around with the dead man long enough and you can read him well enough to get messages that arent in his words what he hadnt said but meant was that if i didnt go make myself a nuisance at hullars place i wouldnt get any peace at home you compromise thats life every day you make deals that buy you peace or an opportunity for a good nights sleep i decided the path of least resistance lay through bishoff hullars taxidance place crunch and i were getting to be buddies after only five minutes of squinting and thinking he remembered that i preferred beer that saved him one question in his routine i saved him the others by asking for a pint of weiders pale lager then told him tell hullar garretts here garrett right he tiptoed away i waited for his feet and beard to disagree no such luck that dwarf defied the laws of nature he took a while i sipped beer and surveyed the place id never seen it so busy it was jumping three couples were dancing while the band snored through something i might have recognized had it been played by real musicians three tables boasted customers there wasnt a girl left over to hustle me though by now they had me pegged for a waste they remembered better than crunch did one of the girls caught my eye she was new she had some life left and she was a great actress unless she really was having a good time she was younger than the rest an attractive brunette who looked enough like the brunette id seen earlier to cool my fantasies be out in a minute crunch said behind me id turned to lean against the bar while i studied the local wildlife i glanced over my shoulder crunch looked back puzzled he didnt understand what was going on he had an idea i was a bagman for the outfit only i made deliveries instead of collections id caught him on a real good day first time around most of the time he was like this puzzled by everything whos the brunette there crunch he squinted had trouble making her out he fumbled out a pair of cheaters perched them on his nose pushed them back with a finger like a driedout potato i was surprised glasses are expensive that theres the new girl mister right come with a name her or me he puzzled it but didnt come up with anything before hullar descended on the stool beside me his back to the bar too he accepted a mug from crunch it dont get no better than this garrett i glanced his way i read no more from his expression than from his tone was he saying this was heaven on earth was he stating a fact about business was he being sarcastic maybe he didnt know himself i handed him barking dogs latest shit dont you got nothing else to do all i want to know is is the crazy bastard getting his tit in a wringer i dont need to know every time he picks his nose a point i kept trying to get across to barking dog i said first time i dropped in here crask was here crask wary suddenly crask like from the outfit he was talking to the musicians if you say so i dont remember he remembered fine else he wouldnt have so much trouble with his memory a girl walked in just as i was going to leave she headed for crunch like she had something on her mind only she spotted crask and suddenly hightailed it if you say so i dont remember none of that what can you tell me about her nothing he was real definite about that so definite it was a cinch id be beating my head against a wall if i kept after him ive used my noggin to dent a few walls in my time all that banging has taught me how to tell when its going to be the head and not the wall that gets broken i dropped it whos the new girl he shrugged they come and go they dont stick for a while you never find out calls herself candy thats not the truth why my turn to shrug i dont know something different about her shes having fun get those sometimes do it for the kick takes all kinds to make a horse race garrett he tapped barking dogs report whats this shit say he alive same old barking dog only going bonkers because the rain wont let up long enough for him to preach good next time just tell me that never mind you bury me with five hundred pages of every time he picked a zit i maybe agreed on expenses but not on that much paper i didnt look at hullar he wasnt in one of his better moods but neither did he want to be left alone tenderloin people are that way they want to spend time with somebody from outside who isnt a customer or somebody with a moral ax to grind they just want to feel like real people sometimes they are real people maybe realer than most theyre more in contact with reality than are those who buy their time or those who condemn them their real sin is that theyve shed their illusions hullar missed his illusions he wanted to be distracted from those nights when this was as good as it got up for a story i asked what kind good guys and bad guys and lots of pretty girls what im doing besides peeping barking dog shoot but dont look for me to give you no help gods forfend its just an interesting mess i gave him most of it edited where appropriate thats sick garrett real sick i thought i heard of every freak there was but thiss a new one them poor girls and butterflies butterflies i dont know if theyve got anything to do with it weird you got a curse at work or something maybe you ought to find you a necromancer hey i know i know a guy weird but real good goes by dr doom weve met i dont think hed be much help weird for sure doom was more fraud than expert i think he did have a knack for laying ghosts id bring him in if that was what it took hullar shrugged you know your situation yeah desperate i eyed the happy brunette in more ways than one i wondered if there might not be something to the idea of apologizing to tinnie fate wasnt throwing anything else my way hullar saw me looking he snickered go ahead garrett give it your best shot but ill tell you this candys all talk and no play shes the kind that far as shes concerned its good enough to know she couldve got you if she wanted she gets you there she starts looking for the next one story of my life i levered myself off my stool catch you later got an appointment with an overcooked roast dean does miracles when he wants the roast wasnt a disaster considering the goalongs were excellent i ate till i was ready to pop then though it was early i rambled into the hall and stared upstairs awaiting a flood of ambition it was a long climb to a cold lonely bed this is where the sad strings are due only with my luck the orchestra would whip into an overture right it wasnt mood music i got it was garrett come report not quite an overture but close enough no point arguing the sooner done the sooner to sleep what sleep when i finished telling about my visit to hullar i got i want you to go back there work the tenderloin for the next nine evenings spend time with that candy huh a notion has been brooding in the back of my rear brain your assessment of candy as outofplace hatched it huh what repartee what about all the legwork the research on olden villains take care of that days work the tenderloin nights watching for young ladies off the hill amusing themselves by playing lowerclass roles it clicked candy chodos kid highclass girls hanging out in lowclass dives for the kicks not unlikely if thats some fad i will ask captain block to revisit the families of the dead girls i may have interviewed the wrong people sisters and girlfriends might have been wiser parents are the last to know what their youngsters are doing you may be onto something only a few victims had known one another and that only casually but if you put sisters and girlfriends and a fad for slumming into the gaps you might find a pattern we might indeed what do i look for girls who fit the killers particulars maybe we can identify the next victim before she is taken we have nine days before the killer must slake his need if the pattern proves out if the girls were playing games we will know how and where the killer selects his victims with captain blocks help we can watch all potential victims and grab our man when he strikes im way ahead of you now only do we have to start tonight tnt garrett you have not been shortchanged on sleep recently true and i was too fired up to sleep now anyway might as well go drink beer and ogle girls in the line of duty hell all of a sudden this mess had begun to look a little interesting tunfaire by night becomes a different city especially when theres no rain it had stopped raining for the moment i carried my raincloak over one arm and strolled checking out the nightside the ratman hordes were about their legitimate tasks of cleaning and illegitimate tasks of removing everything not nailed down kobolds and gnomes and numerous varieties of little people dashed here and there on business sometimes i wonder how so many peoples can live side by side with so little contact sometimes i think tunfaire is a whole series of cities that just happen to occupy the same geographical position i saw a troll family obvious bumpkins gaping at the sights i got propositioned by a giantess of ill repute who was evidently suffering a business slump i ran into a band of goblins riding redeyed hounds that looked more wolfish than domesticated id never seen goblins before i walked with them a ways swapped stories they were bounty hunters they specialized in tracing runaway wives they were a ferocious unpleasant bunch clinging grimly to an old trail the goblin woman they were after was evidently smarter than the bunch of them put together they had plans for when they caught up they never doubted they could outlast a mere woman it would seem wives are a premium commodity amongst goblins where five or six males are born for every female goblins dont go in for polyandry or equal rights or homosexuality or any of that wimp stuff real macho men male goblins onethird will die in fights over females before age twentythree i watched the hunters ride off and didnt blame goblin wives for cutting out first chance they got i encountered several families of centaurs refugees from the cantard working together doing bearertype jobs what a concept jackasses with the brains and hands to load and unload themselves i have almost as little love for centaurs as i do for ratmen the only centaur i ever knew well was a thorough villain there were dwarves everywhere day and night tunfaire teams with dwarves theyre industrious little buggers all they do is work if they could figure out how theyd do without sleep what you dont see much of at night outside certain areas is human people you do see a human be careful chances are his intentions arent honest or honorable that in fact can usually be counted on to get you by if youre young and strong and dont look an easy mark most people will stay away only the nastiest craziest bad boys prey on other bad boys hell there i go giving the wrong impression what im talking about is late nights after the entertainment hours much later than it was then people were out i wasnt seeing them because i wasnt following the streets they usually chose for safety sometimes i tempt fate at one point i joined several ratmen in a fast fade into an alley we watched a gang of ogres tramp past grumbling and cussing they were headed for the north gate on their way to hunt thunderlizards night is the best time to hunt them the beasts are sluggish then theres good money in thunderlizard hides they make the toughest leather i dont like ogres much either but wished this bunch luck the southward migration of the thunderlizards has been rough on the farmers who have been losing both fields and livestock more its always nice to see an ogre doing something honest you dont very often crunch recognized me right away he plopped a pint onto the bar you back no its my evil twin he thought about that couldnt make sense of it asked need to see hullar wouldnt hurt if hes not busy hullars never busy got nothing to do off he went he didnt step on his beard this time either he was a magician i scanned the place business had dropped off but the girls were still occupied there were two i hadnt seen before two daytime girls were gone the new girls were a blond and a brunette not of the sort at risk both seemed outofplace maybe the dead man was right maybe the girls were slumming the streets are no place to play if you dont know them youll make more than your share of lethal mistakes if you come down off the hill wearing your arrogances and assumptions the natives wont be impressed of course if its a game maybe youll forget your superiorities while youre playing until you get into a tight place hullar waddled out dragged himself up onto a stool sucked up a beer crunch had waiting scanned the action shrugged you couldnt disappoint bishoff hullar a man after my own heart he expected the worst slumming garrett not exactly i cant believe youve taken a shine to the place a man with your rep no this has to do with that other thing im working the murders you didnt tell me there was another one last night word was getting around i got to thinking over supper about candy and the girl who wasnt in here the other day that you and crunch never saw and dont know occurred to me the rich girls might be playing bad girls just for fun like the blond and brunette there dont look like the sort id expect in here uhm you know the tenderloin hullar you know whats going down there a fad among the rich girls bored because the guys are off to war how come you want to know maybe my girlkiller spots his victims down here maybe i can spot him looking for his next target you in the guardianangel racket i grunted you been out of touch garrett yeah the rich broads been coming down not just the kids neither them that only want into it at the edge work places like mine the wild ones mostly older ones end up peddling their asses at the passionate witch or black thunder or someplace the outfit goes easy on them theyre good for business you got a skillion lowlifes would love to throw the pork to some hightone lady i understand the psychology dont we all dont we all and thats whatll cause the trouble hmm good for business having all this fine young stuff down here gotten a lot of cash moving despite the weather but how long before their fathers and husbands catch on then what do we got eh good point the parents wouldnt be pleased and human nature being what it is the girls wouldnt get the blame the richer people are the less they seem able to hold their kids responsible for their actions how many of them you figure there are couldnt be a lot or there wouldve been a lot of excitement already i dont get around much garrett i aint out there counting heads and figuring whos working the tenderloin why you know what i mean i know but they do stand out people talk you ask me tops theres maybe been a hundred biggest part is over now just a few comelatelies and them that gets a special jolt from going bad you got maybe thirty these days mostly hardcore ones like my candy are the exception now whole thingll be dead in two months theyll find some other game hullar shrugged could be i dont worry about rich kids makes you even they dont worry about you i eyed candy didnt look like id get a chance to talk to her she had a couple of sailors on the string hullar or crunch would have to do some bouncing if she led them on too far going somewhere eagleeye hullar had noticed me getting up thinking about eyeballing any other girls i can find any suggestions where to look you want just brunettes candys type basically he got thoughtful he wasnt concentrating on my problem though he had one eye on candys sailors he was getting steamed crystal chandelier the masked man the passionate witch mama sams place i seen your type all them places one time or another not saying theys any there now these gals they come and go dont do regular hours neither thanks hullar youre a prince eh whats that crunch snarled suddenly he came up from behind the bar with a nasty club you want to watch your mouth boy hullar shook his head prince he yelled in crunchs ear he called me a prince got to pardon him garrett he lipreads sometimes he dont do so good crunch put his stick away but didnt stop scowling he wasnt sure he ought to trust his boss over his imagination everywhere i go i get involved with screwballs the crystal chandelier as the name implied pretended to have class hill girls would be just what the management ordered i headed there first i was in and out in the time it took to slurp a beer i didnt learn anything except that somebody there knew my face and didnt like what i did for a living i did better at the masked man i knew somebody there the name of the place was appropriate again people donned masks before they showed themselves inside likewise those who worked the place the masked man catered to a select clientele the guy i knew was a bouncer a breed nine feet tall with muscles on his muscles and more between his ears than anywhere else i downed three beers before he understood what i wanted to know even then he wouldnt have talked if he hadnt owed me and what he had to say wasnt worth hearing only one hilltype gal worked the masked man these days a blond so screwed up she scared the owners he hadnt seen a brunette in weeks the last had quit her second night but he did remember her name dixie dixie right thats useful thanks bugs here have a beer on me hey thanks garrett youre all right bugs is one of those guys who are always amazed when you do something nice no matter how trivial youd think after a while the whole world would be nice just to watch him be amazed i drifted over to the passionate witch the witch was strange even for the tenderloin i never quite understood the place a lot of girls worked there mostly dancing mostly without wearing much they were very friendly theyd crawl all over you if they thought you might stuff a mark into their pants they were available but not to everyone there was a kind of bid board the girls worked the crowd getting guys drunker and randier and driving the bidding up till closing a crafty girl could pull more with one trick there than some who worked all night the traditional way whatever will separate a mark and his money its there in the tenderloin ever see so many bare boobs in one place garrett i jumped you dont expect your friends in those places i hadnt found one downtown been a while nope never and i shouldnt be seeing some of these here now downtown billy byrd was the guy theyd had in mind when theyd decided somebody looked like a ferret he was a walking stereotype he looked slimysneaky and was he spied on people sold information to anyone whod pay id used him myself which is how he knew me downtown wore a lot of junk jewelry and flashy clothing he carried a longstemmed ivory pipe he tapped its mouthpiece against his teeth pointed it at a woman case in point right bigger dont always mean better she was something before gravity set in downtown billy byrd was the kind whod think gravity sets in you working garrett i didnt have much use for downtowns type but i stayed polite i wasnt spending much itd help if i stuck with somebody whose cheapness was accepted else i might get asked to take my questions to the street would i be here if i wasnt half the guys here would say that if i asked i understood then what downtown was doing in the passionate witch he was working looking for faces he might sell later i told him im working something maybe i can help with maybe im looking for a girl a special kind brunette seventeen to twentytwo fivefeettwo to fiveten long hair reasonably attractive highclass you dont want much do you she got a name no its a type im interested in any woman like that working the tenderloin yeah how come because some creep is snatching them and cutting their guts out i want to find him so i can explain why we dont consider that behavior socially acceptable downtown eyed me a moment weasel mouth open come on over here garrett i got a table with some pals i followed but feared it was a mistake byrd ran his mouth steadily how long before word spread i wouldnt catch anybody if the girls hid out and the bad guys lay low downtown led me to the worst table in the dive you had to send carrier pigeons to the bar waiters got lost trying to get back there downtowns two pals looked sleazier than he did cheap flash must have been in along with mustaches they had bought their nights supplies before lighting sit garrett there was a spare chair shaker give the man a beer screw you byrdo shaker had a palsy he had a face like a rats it was loathing at first sight what you giving away our beer dont be a butthead shaker business the man might maybe be in the mood to buy we got something he might want shaker and downtown glared at one another while the third man contemplated the secrets inside a beer bottle then shaker pushed a bottle my way it was the oldfashioned stone kind not used by commercial breweries anymore which meant the beer inside was cheap stuff from a oneman cellar operation fit only for the poorest of the poor my stomach started whimpering before the first blast headed south i couldnt be intimidated we investigators fear no beer besides id swilled so much already that it had become hard to care what went down next downtown didnt introduce anybody common practice on the street nobody wanted anybody to know them but downtown didnt bother not dropping names either garretts looking for a guy that snatches girls he looked at me cuts them open right the one doing the jobs we been hearing about i nodded sipped from my bottle was pleasantly startled that was damned good for cellar beer i found the trademark it didnt match that on the other bottles so the brewer was putting his product up in whatever came his way too bad i said way i figure it he grabs rich girls working the quarter for kicks i expect he scouts them before he grabs them i want to spot him doing it before he snatches the next one downtown eyed shaker what do you say now butthead i asked there something that im not getting downtown one minute garrett he kept looking at shaker well his minute had flown i figure you got somebody big behind you garrett some girls father maybe a bunch of them somebody whats got more money than sense and is out to buy revenge right something like that downtowns bunch would melt like salted slugs if i told them who was paying somebody that might pay damned good if somebody handed them the whole thing on a platter i dont think you can downtown youre shucking me running a game you heard i was asking around you decided to see if you couldnt rip me off wound a man to the heart downtown billy was in pain garrett my man this is me your old buddy downtown billy byrd i never done you wrong never was anything in it for you you just being nasty you know that aint my style hed never gotten caught everything was his style if he thought he could get away with it so ill give you the benefit of the doubt whatve you got i tell you then i dont got nothing to sell im not buying a pig in a poke downtown ive got enough cats already his face screwed up into a frown that had to hurt he didnt understand in the old days lessthanscrupulous peasants sold gullible city folks baby pigs in tied sacks only when the sacks were opened out jumped some very unhappy cats all right garrett i got your point heres the way it is gal like the one youre looking for name of barbie worked here up to last night aint in tonight youll notice so so the bidding went outrageous way high and when it come time for her to deliver her half two guys come in to pick her up and take her somewhere not upstairs it might be a lead but i was less than excited id dealt with downtown before hed try to make a mountain out of some molehill and sell it for a fortune you arent impressing me yet it isnt unusual for the high bidder to take his prize home not even unusual for him not to show his face he showed his face when he was bidding scruffy little dink like a bum somebody cleaned up but not much definitely not no high roller was a bum that was the third man downtown grinned dickiebird says he seen the guy before on the downandout anyway it all looked funny we decided to scout it out you never know what might be handy to know like here you are already wanting to know what we saw maybe i do what did you see you want it all for free dont you no way garrett we got to live too you aint heard enough to know if you want more then youre gonna have to do without i pretended to study it then i dug out a few small coins im interested but youll have to talk a lot more than youve done downtown traded looks with his pals they had to trust his judgment that put them in a spot i hoped id never occupy ive never understood how downtown survived his five in the cantard going to take a chance garrett going to tell you more than i would anybody else but only on account of i know you on account of i trust your rep for playing square my hairs getting gray looks to me like its falling out whoa touchy talk downtown right always in a hurry here it is the two guys that come in for barbie put her into a coach with the dink that did the bidding only hed changed somehow gotten spooky she didnt want to go but he grabbed her i thought maybe id give her a hand only the guys eyes got weird green yeah like green fire youre holding my interest downtown but if thats all youve got shaker knew one of the guys helped push her into the coach ah i dont know him see shaker said its like i seen him around hes not somebody i pal with like downtown just a guy i seen around heres the one that makes or breaks you guys you know where to find him shaker said i know where he cribs i dropped coins on the table ill be back in a while im going to bring a guy to talk to you if you put us together with this guy you know hell fill your pockets i was out of there before any of them could respond morley had company i had to wait then wait then wait some more while i waited saucerhead came in i waved he joined me glumly cheer up i need some muscle i told him like now right away unless your investments cant wait would i be whats the matter just dont feel like it garrett not in the mood since when do you have to be in the mood to make yourself a mark hey busting heads aint all the fun it looks like garrett i know i know how would you you dont wale on nobody unless you feel good enough to pick up a few coppers running a message i guess yeah i could handle that i sent him to fetch captain block if i had to wait around forever for morley to finish playing i might as well pull in the money man while i did i did wait and i waited and then i waited i waited so long i got sober no morley block and tharpe showed up dripping it was raining again i thought some more about getting into the boat business when morley still showed no sign of growing bored with his guest i said the hell with him we can handle it without him lets go block was relieved he didnt think it would be politic for him to associate with a professional killer saucerhead said ill tag along thought you werent in the mood maybe ill change moods its raining out there its always raining lets go block said very little till we enjoyed the privacy of the street i hope this is something good garrett i need it yeah pressure again you dont feel it down here the hill is in a panic some people up there are carrying on like the venageti were at the gates i need something fast anything tell you what this doesnt pan out you pass the word for them to keep their daughters out of the tenderloin give me a break garrett i mean it theres a fad amongst the deb set go down and play sleazegirl that wont make their fathers happy but its a fact it looks like our killer picks his victims from rich girls working the quarter that wont make anyone happy not when it gets out you recall none of the stories we got about the victims ever mentioned anything like that i think we talked to the wrong people people who didnt know and didnt guess because the bodies werent found near the quarter maybe some suspected i can think of several stories that sounded like somebody trying to make somebody look good block sniffed grunted hawked he was working on a cold we get lucky maybe we wont have to deal with any of that we dont get lucky maybe we can let the word get around without it looking like its your fault it will come out if this goes on much longer block grunted again i glanced over my shoulder my instincts were right we were being followed did you maybe bring a few helpers block glanced back yeah theyre mine clumsy arent they they dont get much practice thought it might be handy having a few guardian angels hovering aw you dont feel comfortable in the tenderloin make fun while you can garrett things are gonna change nice talk but i wouldnt put one copper on it good intentions cant overcome the inertia of decades we reached the passionate witch i checked my companions before i went inside tharpe was fine and block didnt look like the law were going to be talking to some real lowlifes let me do all the jawing no matter what understand saucerhead said means you captain you want to lose these guys fast let them get a notion what you are i gave tharpe the fish eye he said i know downtown billy byrd garrett bottom of the barrel i said im going to try to bring them out here you bring money i asked block some i wont let them rob me they dont have imaginations that big what theyd call robbery youd call a tip i shoved into the passionate witch the evening was fading but downtown and his pals were hanging on nursing their stone beer bottles waiting for opportunity to knock i knocked downtown grumbled i thought you forgot us had trouble finding my man huh guy i work for one who wants to know what you know hes outside wants to listen he brought money you ready to deal now you want to wait for the kings birthday he dont have time to waste why dont he come in its wet out there he dont want to show his face you have to get wet anyway you got to show us the way right i guess shaker take care of the bottles to recover their deposits of course dickiebird cmon i led the way downtown and dickiebird followed like they counted on trouble each kept a hand inside his shirt knives shaker wasnt near the bar getting deposit refunds hed vanished awful nervous arent you downtown think about it garrett we got a bunch of murders hill gals what probably got daddies that eat nocounters like you and me for snacks could get hairy sure could i didnt like being included in his nocount family im at least a onecounter but it hasnt yet were counting on what you tell us fixing it so it never does yeah he was starting to think about holding me up block stepped out of the shadows these the men saucerhead wasnt to be seen somebody had to watch for shaker block looked damned evil in a bad light he might do yes they say they think they saw the last victim who called herself barbie get snatched they think they knew one of the snatchers block eyed downtown and dickiebird whats the deal huh i asked you have a plan downtown you got a price talk to us uh oh downtown looked around for eavesdroppers or maybe to see if shaker had him covered yeah like this you pay half now we show you where to find your guy hell be home i guarantee like hed maybe checked while i was collecting block he dont go out you pay us off we split you forget you ever saw us not bad i said only lets make it you get the other half after we grab the guy and make sure hes the one you saw garrett take it easy man hell know who fingered him if hes the real thing you wont have to worry about what he knows block said how much downtown tried to get a better look at block this dont sound like nobody off the hill garrett dont worry about where he comes from worry about earning his money yeah right we figured about thirty marks would be fair ten apiece small men have small ambitions block had trouble keeping a straight puss he jingled coins handed me three gold fivemark pieces i passed them to downtown who stared at them in the light leaking from the passionate witch damn he was stunned by the certainty that hed just blown a rare opportunity too late son i told him when he started to say something you set the price time to deliver uh yeah he led off we walked maybe a mile into an area of dense tenements occupied mostly by newcomers to tunfaire reasonable enough the man we wanted couldnt have been in town long only the ignorant wouldve gotten into what he had downtown and dickiebird led us to a fourstory row place in the middle of a long block pure people storage though more upscale than most depressing the clouds parted let a moonbeam sneak through it was the only light but i didnt complain it was nice to have the drizzle stop even for a little while downtown said top floor rear door hired a sleeping room all to hisself you did a lot of research downtown his weasel face stretched in a nasty smile i knew somebody was going to want the goods on this one block growled but stifled his opinion even starryeyed idealists knew you couldnt sell tunfaires people the idea of civic responsibility not after theyd watched their betters do nothing but look out for themselves for centuries topfloor rear i grumbled thinking of the climb inconsiderate bastard right you get him out well finger him well all go home right right saucerhead tharpe materialized he lugged a limp shaker over one shoulder yeah just making sure you were there why had he bopped shaker maybe just for the hell of it block said ripley scout the place out shadows detached from shadows downtown gawked as two men entered the row building he knelt beside shaker muttered about maltreatment and distrust i asked if you was us would you trust you he didnt have an answer for that blocks man returned puffing somebodys in there all right hes snoring theres only one door aint no other way out unless theres a window downtown volunteered there is if hes got real spring in his legs he could maybe jump across to the roof behind this place i said if hes asleep he shouldnt have time to get up open a window make a jump better let me make sure saucerhead suggested gently pointing out that he was the specialist all right saucerhead and block and i went upstairs while ripley went around back just in case we tried to be quiet but theres something about your step when youre headed for trouble i sensed sudden fear and alertness behind those doors where people were awake blocks other man waited upstairs block whispered still snoring he had to ask hell yes he was still snoring i never heard anything like it that ripping and roaring had to be one of the wonders of the world careful i told saucerhead he nodded everybody got out of tharpes way he seemed to swell up then charged the door exploded though i was right behind saucerhead it was over before i could contribute anything meat hit meat snores turned to baffled groans saucerhead said got him under control i said take him downstairs tharpe grunted block slid around opened the window got him ripley get around front we clumped downstairs i smelled the fear from behind those doors we hadnt destroyed the more i thought how this was for those people the less i liked what i was doing our prisoner was groggy when we hit the street block demanded is this the man downtown and dickiebird stayed out of the moonlight while edging closer yeah dickiebird said thats him i asked you saw this man help put the girl into the coach i was playing a role now and saucerhead was good enough to catch my cues i believed dickiebird the prisoner was one of the men whod tried to kidnap chodos daughter we had a different killer but the same assistants apparently thats the guy garrett downtown insisted what do you want come on pay up block had his helpers take the prisoner while he paid up you know these three men garrett in case this is a con and i want to find them i know them i was still reserving the incident at morleys place couldnt explain my confidence in them hey garrett i ever do a number on you not yet downtown go on enjoy yourselves a man could make ten marks go a long way in this part of town downtown and his buddies flew off like the breeze with money in hand they would be hard to find for a while you want to help with the questioning block asked not particularly only if you insist what i want is to go to bed ive been knocking myself out finding this lead i do want to hear what you find out from him sure he shook my hand thanks again garrett winchell get him moving i didnt say anytime captain because he was the kind who would take me up on it the dead man wasnt impressed he refuses to be impressed by anything but himself hes afraid ill get a big head he did relent though when i returned from watching block and his troops with great fanfare before numerous official witnesses raid an abandoned brewhouse and nab a creepy old man who was beyond doubt the perpetrator of the most recent murder clothing and body parts were recovered these monsters liked their souvenirs not to mention that the old boy spat a ton of butterflies some poisonous before they subdued him subdued meant dead again i didnt see that part but the dozen watchmen they carried off on stretchers implied that block was right when he insisted there had been no choice the dead man remarked i do hope captain block exercises appropriate precautions i think he will excellent so it would appear that the matter is closed except for collecting from block indeed take the rest of the evening off sleep in tomorrow were sure generous with time that isnt our own arent we tomorrow you must resume the investigation as though nothing has been accomplished continue seeking miss contague try to identify potential victims and take a closer look at this fellow you rooted out tonight he may have had more than one associate he did but the other guy headed out of town before we finished arresting the first one he lived in the same dump so what the hell you finally gone gaga you think we got the wrong killer i am confident your famous luck held and you swept up the very villain but you got the right man before and death did not miss a stroke you dont think itll take i have strong hopes but i think a wise man would prepare beforehand against the wiles of evil and the ineptitude of the watch it would be most excellent if everything worked out but should it not no time will have been wasted not so all a matter of viewpoint im not the guy who gets to sit here daydreaming im the one who runs back and forth till his legs get worn down to the knees im going to bed wake me up when the wars over should the worst occur you will regret having failed to take minimal precautions sure all right so maybe id play with it some more just in case what could it hurt did i have anything else going anyway there were some pretty pretties around the edges of the thing i might luck onto one who was sane and sociable staying in just meant doing time with deans cronies anyway the amount of beer those old boys were putting away while they were supposedly rehabbing upstairs it wouldve been cheaper to hire professional help it was like nothing in my experience i couldnt fathom it the dead man was frothing with ambition he had hold of the case like a starving dog a bone he wouldnt let go it was easier to get out of the house into the drizzle and do legwork than it was to stay in and argue especially with dean taking the dead mans side it might be time to think about an apartment the dead man still had block digging through the records too block was our best buddy now wed turned him into the princes fairhaired boy he was the hero of the hill his name was at the top of the short list to head the new improved serious and hopefully useful watch what we hadnt been able to get him to do was pay his bill he meant to stiff us he said hed pay up just as soon as he was sure wed given him the permanent solution hed wanted to buy right he meant to stiff us i didnt care if he was the dead mans buddy i didnt care if he was tight with prince rupert i had him on my list to turn over to the saucerhead tharpe collection agency meantime amidst all else i maintained my thrilling surveillance of that ferocious threat to the peace barking dog amato mainly by collecting his reports skimming them then passing a few appropriate comments to hullar so he could give something to the daughter barking dogs autobiographical ambitions dwindled as he foresaw the advent of better weather i was grateful especially after he went into rehearsals for his new more forceful act designed with the help of the dead man days hurried past i lumbered around town trying to get some line on the oldtime killings i got nowhere if there was any glory to be had block wanted his boys to get it i wasnt allowed access to any public records evenings fled too i made and lost friends in the tenderloin people down there were appalled by what had been done to those girls but they were more appalled by what making potential future targets safe might do to business the consensus was you got the guy dont bother us the dead man fell back on an ancient and adolescent device for getting some of the women out of the tenderloin he sent anonymous notes to their families six days after my amazing coup involving downtown billy byrd i told the dead man ive found the girl in fact ive found two of them one of them would have to be it candy at hullars place of course and the other dixie starr she works mama sams casino dixie starr really call it her business name barbie was the only victim who came close to using her real name the most recent victim had been one barbra tennys daughter of a viscount with obscure connections to the royal family said family including prince rupert barbras mother was a stormwarden on duty in the cantard no proofs would convince her father that his daughter had been selling her favors at auction for kicks before reality slithered dread tentacles into the fantasy dixies name came up before at the masked man this is a girl with problems candy on the other hand is a real innocent on the street i dont think itll be hard to find out who she is i doubt shed notice if i just followed her home and the identity of the dixie woman i have it already shes emma setlow her father and grandfather are meat packers who found a better way to preserve sausages they made their mint off army contracts and you have gotten nothing useful from your search for information from the past blocks made sure i cant get near any official records from what i can see though hes not doing much looking himself whatever he says hes too busy making political hay and spreading his influence throughout the entire watch i suspect he will change his attitude damn if i didnt think he knew something he wouldnt share there came a dawn when there was an actual break in the rains dean became so excited that it was still dawn when he wakened me i cussed and threatened but he won out he got me interested what did daylight look like without rain my body whined and dragged but i hauled out and headed for breakfast dean had the kitchen curtains back and the window open place needs airing out probably i shrugged sipped tea streets are going to be crazy dean nodded i need to do some shopping i nodded back barking dog will launch his new show the rain doesnt start up i cant miss that everyone in town would find some excuse to get out even knowing everyone else would be in the streets at least the city will be clean dean observed it will the rains lasted long enough for that now if people would just keep it that way he delivered a plate of biscuits steaming straight from the oven drooling i left him to do the talking i didnt hear it which meant id grown distracted that had been happening more and more as more and more the women of my heart became the women of my imagination anyway i looked up and found the old boy absent puzzled i started to get up then i heard him coming down the hall talking hed answered the door hed let someone inside going to have to have a talk with him someone just had to be captain block not again i muttered loudly enough to be heard dean set another place poured tea block settled went to work daubing a biscuit with honey i ignored his existence not sure yet garrett block said around a mouthful of biscuit may be trouble again aint my problem aint going to be my problem only problem in my life is deadbeats block got hot sudden and major he thought we were trying to exploit his misfortune he was right but hed set the terms and i figured he was getting off cheap considering the alternative block cooled down before he risked speaking garrett do you recall the knives from the hamilton place the ritual tools what about them theyve disappeared we got them back when we went after spender spender having been the accursed bum in the abandoned brewery huh they was locked up in the barracks armory i got space there for keeping evidence i saw them there day before yesterday last night they was gone so tomorrow night is the next time the killer would strike wow thats right i laid on my most sarcastic tone like i was amazed a watchman could work that out a corporal elvis winchell who was part of the raid force the other night disappeared yesterday sometime he had access to the armory apparently he and a private price ripley were isolated with the killers corpse for about seven minutes during its trip to the oven and youre afraid winchell will yes i need your help again garrett its wonderful to be appreciated it really is but youre talking to the wrong guy you need to see my accountant huh id lost him the dead man but hes put out with you too with me its money with him its information oh back to that back to that its the bottom line i have a feeling that if you talk him into anything hell insist on payment up front block didnt argue he didnt dare we were about to discover how desperate he really was i passed him on to the dead man i slipped out while their backs were turned it was going to be a long dull argument block hadnt yet panicked negotiations are fun for the dead man my tastes are more earthy more basic maybe not as simple as a hotfoot but not cerebral it always helps if theres a lady along especially if shes no lady barking dog got the better of his crackpot religious squatter by showing up earliest the nut was there when i arrived he was sullen he growled a lot amato tended his placards and ignored him barking dog looked confident he was ready his return had been noted his normal audience consisted of functionaries who worked in the area they kept an eye on him wondering when hed start raving speculation was rife his absence had left him looking primed with fresh madness his reappearance was a happening resented by a single soul the holy crackpot finally left in a huff barking dogs venue is the chancery steps seems appropriate in a sense in the old days the chancery was a court of equity but time changes everything today its mostly a place to store official records civil type for the duchy plus some royal records half the main floor has been occupied by the functionaries who manage military conscription in this end of karenta they migrated from the military chancery years ago after having been crowded out by procurement offices that grow faster and faster as the war winds down the chancery structure is a relic of the empire built late evidently with an eye to impress to reach the huge brass doors of the main entrance you have to climb eighty dark granite steps that span the entire front of the building each twenty steps there is a level stretch ten feet wide vendors and people like barking dog take advantage of those if it can be sold from a tray hung from the neck youll find it for sale outside the chancery amatos spot was at the left end of the first landing most of the traffic in and out of the building naturally passed that way plus barking dog was just high enough to be seen and heard easily from the street i planted myself on the stone rail alongside the next landing up nodded to barking dog he acknowledged my presence with a smile he adjusted his placards he had four all on sticks with bases meant to hold them upright whether entering the chancery or just passing in the street people slowed paused hoping the merriment would break out soon several clerk types accumulated looking uncomfortable their superiors had sent them to keep track and to call when the nonsense began barking dog was as crazy as a herd of drunk possums but he had his fans judging from his placards his text for the day would be a traditional crowd pleaser the international conspiracy which denied barking dog amato his rights and properties he let word spread before he spoke he waited past the commencement of the business day then he started soft and slow without the brass megaphone while word spread that he was starting i noticed something that had escaped me during more casual viewings barking dog had him a kettle out marked to encourage donations passersby surprised me with their generosity maybe amato was less the fool than i thought maybe this was how he paid for supplies maybe this was the whole point no that couldnt be true hed live better than he did he started gentle and slow and sane almost conversationally his chats with the dead man had paid dividends his soft voice arrested passersby made them strain to hear i couldnt hear from behind him signs and portents he said when he did raise his voice slightly yea signs and portents the hour is coming it is at hand the wicked shall be revealed in all their ugliness they shall be found out and rooted out and we who have endured who have borne their weight upon our shoulders till we have become hunchbacks we shall see our agony repaid i glanced around was there anybody here who might know me that sounded suspiciously like he was going to take a plunge into sedition that seemed an unwise career move to me sedition was the sort of talk that could get you thrown into a real prison if you were dumb enough to talk it on the chancery steps instead of at the bar in your neighborhood tavern outside in broad daylight it might sound serious instead of just bitching ha fooled you garrett everyone listening heard hunchbacks and jumped to the same conclusion the crowd grew quieter waited for barking dog to step into it up to his knees then shove his foot in his mouth how come people get such a kick out of watching a disaster in progress barking dog veered off ninety degrees they have stolen my houses they have stolen my lands they have stolen my family titles now they strive to steal my good name so they can silence me when i denounce their wickedness they had me incarcerated in the alkhar in their efforts to stifle me they have tried to silence me through fear but by stealing everything from me they have left me entirely without fear they have left me nothing to lose by stealing everything they have also taken those signs which remind them of who i am they forget whom they consigned to vile durance kropotkin f amato will not yield kropotkin f amato will fight on so long as a single breath remains in his abused flesh that was all old stuff excepting the prison references he began to lose his audience but then he did something hed not done before he named names and he started moving stalking back and forth flinging his hands around shrieking in rage again i thought he was digging himself a grave but then realized hed named only names on the public record and he hadnt said anything objectionable about them hed just surrounded their names with racket that might nail them through guilt by association the man was damned clever the mans damned clever i bounced high enough to bruise my skull on lowflying clouds i mean using the truth to tell lies that way crask had appeared out of nowhere behind me i barked why the hell you got to do that he grinned because its fun watching you jump he meant it he would keep trying to make me jump till the day he really did greet me with a knife what do you want my mood wasnt what it had been its not what i want garrett its never that its what chodo wants you know that im just an errand boy right and a sabertoothed tiger is just a pussycat ill play what does the kingpin want i tried to keep one eye on barking dog amato was into a foamingmouth frenzy now excoriating and denouncing everyone and everything and drawing one of the best crowds of his career but i couldnt keep my mind on him with crask so near crask said chodo wants to talk about the girl the girl dont get cute shes his kid it aint right shes down to the tenderloin whatever shes doing there that dont look good that cant get out you dont like it tell her to knock it off there you go again cute you know it aint that simple garrett sure it isnt like she was some kid off the street just slap her around maybe kick in a few ribs when she dont do right you got a problem with your mouth garrett i been telling chodo for a long time you got a problem with your mouth for a while there he couldnt see that but hes maybe seeing things clearer these days youll maybe want to keep a lid on the wiseguy stuff when you see him i always had see him i hadnt planned to see that old coot ever again i told crask that were all entitled to our opinions and maybe even our little dreams i reckon but sometimes they got to change garrett i glanced around crask wasnt alone naturally hed brought enough help to carry off three or four uncooperative characters my size i suppose you have a point i stood indicated he should lead the way i considered taking a powder barking dogs crowd might have made escape possible but i had a feeling i wasnt in danger yet had i reached the head of the kingpins list theyd have just hit me killing was a businesslike business with chodo and his main men they didnt waste time tormenting their victims unless there was a big publicrelations dividend to be gained from killing somebody an inch at a time pity to miss the rest of this i nodded at barking dog yeah old goofs on a roll but business is business lets go our immediate destination stood at the curb on the far side of the chancery it was a big black coach similar to the one the old butterfly man had ridden chodo contagues personal coach how many of these does he have it hadnt been that long since id fallen out of a similar one scant seconds before it became a lunch bucket for a thunderlizard taller than most threestory houses this is a new one i figured since it looked and smelled new you cant fool us trained investigators that other earlier ride had sprung from a misunderstanding that had irked me at the time so much so that id decided to whack chodo before he came after me again id joined forces with this very crask to see the job done but chodo was still alive still in charge i couldnt figure it crask is smart but he isnt much of a talker its a long haul from the skirts of the hill out to chodos estate you have plenty of time to consider the meaning of life if youre traveling with a crask and a couple other stiffs who lack even the redeeming value of having brains you tend to drift away into philosophy theres only so much amusement to be had from farting contests and exchanges of grotesque misinformation about female anatomy try as i might i couldnt get anything better going all i got out of crask was an indefinite impression that there was more going on than he cared to tell me which made perfect sense if he planned to break my neck you dont tell the pig ahead of time that its come the day for making bacon all i had going was the dubious comfort i could take from knowing that crask had no cause to go to all this trouble just to ice me i hadnt seen chodos place since the night winger and i broke in planning to hasten chodos journey to the promised land nothing appeared changed except that the damage had been repaired and a fresh herd of small thunderlizards had been brought in to patrol the grounds and graze on intruders just like old times i muttered weve added a twist or two crask informed me grinning evilly like he hoped id think he was bluffing and would have a go at sneaking in that would appeal to his selective sense of humor like old times chodo greeted his company in the pool room it was called that because there was a huge indoor bath in there ive seen smaller oceans the bath was heated usually though this time was an exception the poolside was decorated by a small herd of unclothed beauties there just to lend that final touch of decadence while we waited i asked where are the honeys i miss them you would chodo didnt want them around while his daughter was staying here he never got around to bringing them back what did that mean that the daughter wasnt staying here anymore patience garrett all will come clear the man himself arrived looking little changed he was in his wheelchair with a heavy blanket wrapped around his lap and covering his legs hands like tallow claws lay folded upon his lap i couldnt see his face his head had fallen forward it swayed back and forth sadler stopped him at the far end of the pool fiddled with his chair tilted him back so his head stayed level id never seen chodo in anything approaching good health but now he seemed way worse than ever before he looked like somebody had poisoned him with arsenic then hed suffered severe anemia till the vampires got him his skin was almost translucent he was dressed and groomed as though for dinner with the king and that only made the sight of him more horrible i started forward crask caught my arm from here garrett sadler bent to chodos right ear mr garrett is here sir he spoke softly i barely heard him nothing shifted in chodos eyes i saw no light of recognition i saw no evidence that he could see at all his eyes didnt move and didnt focus sadler leaned forward as though to let chodo speak into his ear he listened then straightened he wants to know about his daughter no pretense about her now whatever you know all your speculations i already told you he wants to hear it with everything you left out bullpucky maybe i wasnt supposed to notice maybe they didnt care if i did chodos lips hadnt moved he hadnt done anything but drool i flashed back to the night we tried to scribble the end of his story we crask sadler winger and i had had him cornered along with a witch hed been chasing the witch did get herself elevated to a higher plane before winger and i cut out but shed made a final gesture before checkout shed given chodo a fist in the face shed been wearing a poison ring filled with snake venom so rather than killing chodo the venom had induced a stroke how nice for crask and sadler they must have thought themselves beloved of the gods when that happened their original plan had been to do chodo and grab control of the outfit before anyone realized what was happening that was the historically preferred solution to the problem of the transition of power in the underworld but it meant a long shakeout period while potential challengers were eliminated this way there was no problem with the succession chodo was alive they could pretend he was still in charge while they gathered the reins slowly it was grotesque i played along not playing along would be a capital crime i suspected much of the time i function well in tight situations i didnt betray my thoughts i pursued a conversation with chodo through sadler as though i sensed nothing unusual i gave them a thorough briefing on the serial killer and young women frequenting the tenderloin sometimes its best you dont shield people from the truth seen her lately sadler asked not since that day at hullars you didnt try to trace her why no i lost interest once i knew who she was youre not as dumb as you look crask observed like you protective coloration sadler gave me the fisheye you wouldve known who she was after seeing her at dotess place speaking of morley the reason i asked him to contact you is the girl might know something that would help stop this killer and i didnt figure hunting her up personally would sadler cut in you said the killer was dead he was determined to trip me up maybe we hope but hes been dead before the killings didnt stop you dont think theyre going to the ritual knives disappeared a watchman who was around the corpse and who had access to the knives has disappeared that may not mean anything but why take chances ive identified two women who fit the victim profile ill see them covered like a blanket did i sound like i was making sense sadler bent stayed bent a long time though chodos lips never moved yes sir ill tell him that sir he straightened chodo says he has a job for you garrett he wants you to find his daughter he wants you to bring her home the resources he has he cant find her not without everybody knowing hes looking crask said he cant go looking himself garrett that would be like admitting he cant control his own family yeah and folks might even wonder why shed run away i see i turned away pretended to pace finally stopped i can handle it but i could use a little something to get started with i mean i dont even know her name let alone anything about her belinda crask said she wont be using it teach your mama to suck eggs boy belinda youre kidding nobodys named belinda anymore after chodos old granny the man didnt crack a smile she raised him up until he was old enough to run the streets crask had a faraway look i hoped he didnt wax nostalgic about the old days chodo had a decade on him so they couldnt have run the bricks at the same time but crask and sadler like most of chodos inside boys had come into the business from the streets with time out for special education at crown expense in the university of the cantard i can handle it i said again i seldom demur when dealing with the kingpin facetoface a weakness of mine being fond of breathing sadler leaned down as though startled listened yes sir ill see to it sir he straightened ive been instructed to advance you a hundred marks against your fees and expenses maybe it was the season all these people throwing money my way im on the job i said only i hope i dont have to walk ten miles home hint hint but i wouldnt press the issue i wanted out of there bad soon before there was anything more i thought a lot during the ride home concluded that finding beautiful miss belinda contague might not be healthy crask and sadler might consider me disposable once they had her in hand under control my disposability probably had plenty to do with why they had chosen this particular investigator to investigate there was one fine chance they figured i knew too much already in fact just to be optimistic i was going to count on that so the one thing i had going for me was the fact that i hadnt found the girl yet as long as she stayed unfound things would stay just dandy for me the more i thought the more i was convinced i had to simplify my life i didnt have enough eyes to watch all the directions i needed to watch night fell before i got home with the darkness came rain surprising me i dont know why wasnt like it was something new i headed up the front steps wondering how i could find belinda contague without seeming to find her before i weaseled out of my troubles with crask and sadler where have you been dean demanded before the door opened wide enough to admit me what are you my mother you think its any of your business you drop in while im explaining to his nibs i could maybe drop a few housekeeping hints while i was at that anything to get a little cleaning done in there without having to do it myself dean read me like a book he was old and slow but far from senile he harrumphed headed for the kitchen but halted as he came abreast of my office doorway i nearly forgot you have a guest in the small front room oh a new cat big enough to rip my leg off or barking dog on a midnight mission no amato would be across the way swapping insanities with the dead man evangelists only one way to find out i opened the door time passed i finally came around when the woman cracked you like what you see or are you just a mouth breather sorry you werent what i was expecting then put your eyes back in their sockets jocko why surprised your father just drafted me to find you belinda in his usual smoothtalking way he offered me the job without giving me any chance to turn him down that shut her up she stared his driver just now dropped me off stared back i liked what i saw she didnt hurt the eyes at all she still preferred black she still looked good in black you look marvelous in black not many women wear it so well she would look good in or out of anything she had what it took though i got the impression she was used to hiding it for the moment the cat had her tongue i wondered where dean had the beast hidden belinda didnt match the victim profile tonight her hair was short black as a ravens wing made more remarkable by the pallor of her skin and the brightness of her lip rouge i wondered if the pale skin was a family look if she would resemble her father in a few years she looked pretty much the way she had at morleys place and not much the way she had at hullars at hullars probably wearing a wig shed fit the profile perfectly theyre a protean breed women oh i love them i do i do however they disguise themselves belinda rose like she meant to make a run for it my father my father is your father is in less than total control of his faculties his lieutenants who hijacked me and dragged me out to the estate made a big show of it being his idea oh excuse me im garrett dean said you wanted to see me im glad too ive wanted to meet you since that night at the joy house she looked puzzled the joy house she edged sideways shed changed her mind about wanting to see me weeks back in the safety zone you ran in and stole my heart then some brunos tried to steal you remember big black coach old boy with green eyes and butterflies on his breath your basic everynight weird kidnapping upset when the gallant knight of the streets rescued the distressed damsel youve been dieting you were four inches taller and sixty pounds heavier then ha ha that was saucerhead he used to be my buddy he helped me a little my heart was broken when you didnt stick around long enough to say thanks thanks garrett youre blocking the doorway no shit youre quick i told saucerhead youd be quick i told everyone youd be sharp is that a problem me not moving i thought you wanted to see me that was before you told me you work for the ugly twins did i say that i didnt say that i couldnt have said that i have a longstanding reputation for refusing to work for them or your father though i might let one or the other labor under the misapprehension i tried my famous boyish grin guaranteed to set any girls little heart going pittypat stow the bullshit garrett let me out of here i dont think so youre not dragging me off to the uglies no way why would i do that my life wouldnt be worth two coppers if i did mine either mine especially i dont really know about yours let me out of here not till i hear why you came doesnt matter now you arent the guy i need because i know crask and sadler i shrugged as though trying to shake off a broken heart cant win them all but you are the girl i need ive been looking for you for weeks why its about the people that tried to snatch you youre their only target that got away she got real pale that wasnt the reaction id expected she asked what do you mean youve heard rumors about the killer who strings girls up and guts them ive heard talk i didnt pay much attention thats funny i wouldve paid a lot of attention after somebody almost dragged me off was that them she was grim suddenly hard like her father yes oh in a small voice an i feel foolish voice you and me were the only ones who ever saw him facetoface and lived she didnt really need to remember saucerhead did she and i only saw him for a second you mustve had more to do with him and his boys you were running from them when you showed up at morleys i was working parttime at bishoff hullars dance parlor i dont know why for the hell of it i didnt do anything but dance some girls i knew used the place to make dates i know the scam one night that night two men tried to pick me up their boss had seen me they said he wanted to meet me id be well paid for my time i said no they persisted i told them to eat shit and die they wouldnt take no for an answer hullar had to run them out but they didnt go away they tried to grab me when i left work plausible some guys think that when a woman says no shes only being coy possibly because so many women have only been being coy when theyve said no from what i saw at morleys that night those guys hadnt been long on social skills why the joy house funny place to run morley dotes i hoped his reputation would scare them off long enough to give me time to think then when they came in i hoped dotes would get upset about them getting physical inside his place he did i couldnt run to my fathers people i wouldve had to explain why i was in the tenderloin in the first place what about the guy who wanted to meet you so bad i guess that was him in that coach that was the only time i ever saw him well hell wonderful shed be no help unless the dead man found something she didnt know she knew great back to where i started so even though youve changed your mind how come youre here whats up she studied me i think hes after me again anyway its somebody with that same smooth style sending guys to talk for him i got scared i heard you were straight i thought you could get him off my back the butterfly man had good taste if not good intentions belinda wasnt dressed for it but she couldnt hide the fact that she was a looker her mother must have been something she hadnt gotten those looks from her father i could discourage him whyd you change your mind because i mentioned your father because of crask and sadler im not going to let them profit from what happened to my father and they know it should i reveal my past role tell her crask and sadler had done nothing but exploit a situation that had fallen into their laps didnt seem the best strategy theres never been any love lost between me and the uglies when they were your dads top boys they strained at their leashes wanting their chance at me now they can pick their time i wish i had time to worry about that but i have to concentrate on this killer hes about due to strike she was distressed again then he wasnt taken by the watch a captain somebody was doing a lot of crowing a while back captain block his optimism was premature i told about the two killers so far and asked her to fill me in on the dandies whose sweet talk had so impressed her that shed come running to me i learned a lesson belinda contague didnt listen any closer than her father ever had i dont get it how come the murders keep happening i shrugged crazy stuff happens inside somebodys head you didnt get the right man odd mostly belinda was a girl of the street what youd expect of a thugs daughter but something kept sneaking through something suspiciously redolent of refinement shed been away from home most of her life a secret because chodo hadnt wanted her to become a hostage to fortune i had a feeling shed learned to be a lady while she was away we got it right belinda both times without a doubt the killers liked to keep souvenirs and the men we caught had them this time we have an idea who may have caught the curse if it moved on but we cant find him we can guess when his compulsion will make him kill weve identified his three most likely victims youre one and somebodys been bothering you actually i thought small sour smile you thought they were crask and sadlers beagles and you could leave me in the middle while you did a fast fade on everybody she nodded youre not as put out as id expect thats what i do get in the middle its easier when a pretty woman wants me there save that stuff garrett im immune ive heard all about you checking up i put on my best hurt look what me the white knight the rooming house where i stay under a name ill keep to myself thank you caters to single women sounded like the antechamber to heaven i maintained a neutral expression and so ive heard about you you recall a rosie tate i gasped choked should i be outraged or should i laugh good old rose sure i know rose i did her out of a fortune by making sure the lady her brother named in his will got what she had coming i didnt let her get her way by wagging her tail at me yes i know rose shes got a real boner for me i didnt know they let her out on her own rose tate running loose could be a disaster worse than a platoon of serial killers the woman was nasty as gorgeous as they come but nasty you think shes a joke not hardly not rose rose is a joke like a starving sabertooth is a joke make that a starving sabertooth with a toothache i faked a laugh so she still holds a grudge that woman wants your head she didnt say anything about any money rose was never one to let little things like truth and accuracy get in the way when she was creating a mood in her audience tell me about it didnt take two weeks before every girl in the place was ready to strangle her way it goes its hard to be a crowd pleaser in my racket so what about crask and sadler garrett i dont really know i can remember when either one of them would have died to protect me or the family name they would have done anything to shield me from a breath of scandal thats the way those people do things they have this elaborate code of honor i know and part of it is that women and children are exempt but the last thing your father ever said to me was look out for his baby i dont know why i told her it wasnt a smart move she didnt need to know i didnt need to hoist up a sign saying heres a way to manipulate me i said i would i didnt think id need to crask and sadler said youd be taken care of maybe they had their fingers crossed that sounds like them him and them too my father had a thing about you garrett he used to go on about honorable men about how there were none left except for you and you were going to get yourself killed for your trouble he didnt know me the way he thought i have my bad moments like anybody else he was funny some ways garrett besides having crotchets about you he was always honest with his daughter meaning meaning i was never in doubt what he did unlike most females near his kind as far back as i can remember he told me all the hows and whys and wheres and dirt that makes the business go i never thought anything was strange till he sent me off to school then i got embarrassed i lay awake nights i prayed my little heart out then i found out all the other girls were embarrassed by their fathers too and half of them made up the most outrageous stories to explain why i realized that no matter what my father did he did love me and that was more than most of my classmates could say cue the violins bunky the kingpin was a loving dad when they were totting up the score at the gates to hell he could tell them i done it all for my little girl chodo was the next thing to dead and still he kept surprising me belinda i have to admit i admired your father even when i hated what he was and what he did to people but all thats something we can go into later right now every minute brings me nearer to the time the girl killer will have to do what hes got to do to stay happy what bottom line some people need rougher stimulation than others thats what the tenderloin is all about providing junk for the weirdstuff junkies my sweet belinda surprised me by responding in an accent neither of the street nor of the hill my daddy woulda been proud a you garrett some people some people is just sick and caint get it off thats the heart of it isnt it wheres the line between whats unusual and whats unacceptable when does weird become dangerously perverted she looked me straight in the eye ill let you know hey garrett of course the dead man would yank my chain right then he wants to see you belinda looked puzzled who does my sidekick watch him hes not fast on his feet but hes sly the dead man youve heard of him thatll puff his ego garrett do get on with it i thought i was getting on with it as good as i could under the circumstances belinda gave me a strange look the dead man sent your love life was not my concern get her in here were a little hasty today are we what the hell are you doing garrett talking to the walls i wish to speak with you miss contague what the hell is this garrett get the hell out of my head it aint me babe i thought you knew about the dead man she wasnt heading for the door she was pressing closer to me a development i didnt discourage i eased her across the hall i know i know you didnt think youd have to deal with him you thought the stories were exaggerated they are mostly except about how ugly he is garrett and testy hes real testy like a badger with bad teeth my god look at that nose she clutched my arm i melted i tried to slide the arm around her to comfort her but she wouldnt let go id have bruises in the morning garrett take your gloating lessthanwinning personality into the kitchen indulge your true nature guzzling beer while the lady and i exchange reminiscences hey lets not get personal i went to the kitchen and sulked indulged in my favorite food weiders pale lager garrett hell here i was barely through my fourth pint and he was rattling my chain what did a guy have to do to relax i stamped in there past belinda she asked brightly where can i find dean kitchen what do you want chuckles the girl is exactly what she appears to be he was astonished obviously i am amazed that she is so honest and forthright so it isnt hereditary that is not what i meant what you really mean is she didnt know a damned thing we could use and youre thrilled about it after a fashion i convinced her that it would be in her best interest to remain here out of sight in our guest room till we do something about the killer say what he doesnt like women of any species he doesnt want them in the house to visit let alone to hide out indefinitely you going through some change actually recommending that a female stay here he sure wasnt trying to do me any favors it would not be the first time that depends on how you add things up i would love to match wits with you but that game has lost its savor i want you to go see if you cannot charm either the candy woman or the dixie woman into spending the night here why he had more faith in me than i did i despair of teaching you to employ your reason because once you lure the potential victim close enough i can make sure she is not out there when the killer goes hunting tomorrow night because then i would have two of the three most likely targets under my protection freeing you and captain block to concentrate on the remaining woman right ive watched those two women in action smiley candy dont play and dixie is out of my price range snowballinhell time i have faith you will find a way right this defeatism amazes me in a man who so regularly disturbs my naps with the gales of whooping and snorting emanating from his room regularly i can just about count on the fingers of one finger the number of times garrett i am dead not stupid yeah well so maybe i underexaggerated but i do wish i was doing half as good as you think i wish you were too you are more easily endured when stow that howre we going to move a bunch of women in here we dont have dean can see to their wants i will see to their safety you go to the tenderloin bring us back one if theyre even working you have to remember they dont do this stuff for a living its parttime for kicks anyway why should we bother did block catch up on his payments we came to an agreement there are no financial obstacles really nice of you to keep me posted i hope you took him so bad he wont come around here ever again i suggest you adjourn to the tenderloin and lay groundwork is that what you call it but i have to let everything else ride mr hullar will not expire if he misses his regular report on the adventures of barking dog amato i want to be right on top of this killer if he has survived i insist i was willing to arrange that only i didnt know how to get him out there unless maybe i hired a wagon and a dozen sturdy moving men i could just see him dashing gallantly about town bringing his special style of derringdo to the dismay of the wicked and cheer of the downtrodden your brain has become a snake pit but i have only one snake pit i withdrew danced lightly upstairs to see how my unexpected guest was settling in mostly i got to watch dean help her settle he interposed himself like he was her maiden aunt dean had been having his rehab parties for weeks my bedroom which lies across the front of the house and the guest bedroom have been done for a while but till dean and his pals went to work the other two rooms had remained untouched repositories for junk that should have gone to the basement or street long ago the parties had gotten the room across the back set for dean partly it wasnt finished but he no longer had to sleep on the daybed downstairs when we had company still his room needed plenty of work to become really habitable the more he got between me and belinda the more i considered leaving the gaps in the outside walls there for him to handle himself come winter look what i really need to know is whatever you know about the girl called candy at hullars i have to come up with a way to make her stay away tomorrow night i didnt work with her i barely knew her to say hi damn somehow i had the idea all you girls should know each other im getting really tired of this whole thing you cant give me anything dean scowled though even he realized id intended no double meaning belinda caught his scowl raised an eyebrow i fell in love all over again because thats one of my own great talents then winked when dean wouldnt see her no i went away wondering look i snapped when the dead man started in on me during my report i did my best i let barking dog drive me crazy telling me about his day so id have something to tell hullar then i spent two hours trying to get somewhere with a dame so dizzy she thought me trying to save her life was a new pickup routine she finally told me to screw off and die not exactly a boost for the ego but i did find out that she wont be working tomorrow night she has family obligations excellent if we fail tomorrow we will have her as bait next time how come youre so sure well have more trouble with this killer i am not sure i am taking a page from your philosophy looking on the dark side expecting the worst if nothing happens i will have had a wonderfully pleasant surprise yeah i hope you get your wonderfully pleasant surprise im going to bed it was a bitch of a day all that beer in the line of duty there are limits stand watch if that woman finds she cant control her urges ha she is sound asleep without a thought of anyone named garrett anywhere in her mind what is she then a nun never mind i dont want to know i want to sleep good night tight bedbugs bite all that stuff i made it upstairs before the summons came garrett come down here rather than prolong the pain by fighting i went what this would have to be good you did not tell me about the other woman dixie at mama sams remember i remember she didnt show up for work she was expected in but she didnt make it nobody was surprised that was the way she was all right she was time wasted but shes supposed to be there tomorrow for sure shell be our bait good night whatever questions he had he took answers directly without forcing me to spend more time on one of our famous exchanges i climbed the stairs again this time i made it all the way to my room before he prodded me garrett there is someone at the door hell with them let them come back at a civilized hour i settled onto the edge of my bed leaned forward to untie my shoes garrett captain block is at the door i believe he has brought bad news but he is too excited to read reliably great for block id make special arrangements he could come back next week nevertheless i pried my carcass off my bed and trudged down the hall downstairs up the groundfloor hall to the door peeped through the peephole the dead man was right that was captain block out there i held another brief debate about whether or not to admit him i finally gave in and unlocked the door i was a tad more frank than usual you look like death on a stick im considering suicide and you came here for help thats not one of our services ha ha he grabbed a march on us garrett bring him in here garrett say what you cant go talking around things tonight im so tired im wasted winchell he snatched the candy woman tonight because he knew wed be set for him tomorrow night ripley was with him how do you know i saw them i was down there scouting out how i wanted to do cover tomorrow night i saw them snatch her when she left work i chased them till i collapsed they saw me too they laughed at me you lost them i lost them im going to kill myself i told the dead man you want to let him do that now so i can get some sleep ill get rid of the body tomorrow nonsense captain block you must return to your barracks and turn out every man who knew corporal winchell or private ripley determine if any knows where either man might hide send squads to check those worry more about saving the girl than capturing the villains a success there will endear you to the public and your superiors alike i suggest you begin moving now if in fact you do manage to overhaul the villains do capture rather than kill them the curse will be easier to control with its carrier still alive i tried that last time the clown made us kill him i suspect that too is part of the curse whoever cast it originally for whatever reason you seem to be taking an inordinately long time examining the official records was a genius he did not just toss off a spell that compelled someone to go forth and slaughter a certain sort of woman he created a curse that interacts with its environment that learns when it fails that goes on and gets harder to overcome with time block had grown pale theres no way to beat it if i do stop it today it gets harder to stop tomorrow i can think of several ways to stop it none are especially appealing you can make certain the current cursebearer dies in the presence of someone so handicapped that he cannot manage a killing or with a prisoner who will never be released i am now convinced that the accursed must be kept alive while the appropriate experts study him and determine how to deactivate the curse cantrip by cantrip alternatively inasmuch as each transfer has been from a dead man to a living one through direct association we might experiment with a live burial even better might be a live burial at sea perhaps entombment if we could be certain the tomb would remain unopened forever you saying the curse itself cant be stopped only the guy wearing it i asked that has been the situation to date in reality burial has just been a means of passing the problem to a subsequent generation i smell legwork indeed much of it legwork that should have been done already i suspect actual dismemberment of the curse will require identification of the sorcerer who cast it and a clear picture of circumstances surrounding the casting motive may be as important as means knowing why the curse was created could provide a clue as to how to get at it where to start unraveling it i told block ill bet hes been thinking this way since the first time you came around and youve been sloughing off the research on account of it seemed like too much trouble he didnt argue and neither did the dead man i said whatevers happening now im not involved ive got sleep to catch up on block opened his mouth dont start on me captain how many times do i have to drag your ass out of the fire before youre satisfied you have the same equipment i have old bones here told you what to do go do it save a life get famous wheres dean cant he let block out gone to bed come on i grabbed block by the elbow do what he says get that research when you can good night out the door he went sputtering i got me a few hours of horizontal but not hardly enough a big racket awakened me i smelled food cooking so it mustve been around the solar dawn though still a long way from any time when a rational being would be awake for whatever irrational reason i pulled on my pants and stumbled downstairs i rambled into the kitchen dropped into my customary chair i thought those little shit morcartha were all taken by the army for aerial scouts in the cantard morcartha are a flying race knee to hiphigh resembling oldfashioned red devils with batstyle wings only theyre more brown than red theyre a contentious loud and obnoxious species possessed of no consideration whatsoever they came from the north fleeing thunderlizards tunfaire had been plagued by them till somebody suffered a seizure of smarts and hired them as auxiliaries if they did what they were paid for they could have a dramatic impact these come from a new wave of immigrants mr garrett dean handed me a cup of tea or so they say i suspect the hired tribes are returning hoping they can get paid to leave again likely why couldnt we have lived in imperial times its one damned thing after another look at all this shit morcartha on the rooftops thunderlizards everywhere one of those fivehorned things swam the river and went crazy on the landing last month i felt sorry for him huh i cracked an eyelid looked to my left discovered that i was sharing the table with my houseguest and me in nothing but my pants i felt sorry for the big stupid thing it didnt know what was happening it was terrified all those little creatures screaming and throwing pointy things at it you hear that dean aint that a woman for you heres a monster going berserk stomping people to death ripping up property and she feels sorry for it actually i rather felt that way myself yeah and so had i and probably everyone else who hadnt suffered directly from the poor beasts fear and confusion when you went and looked at the thing now caught in a big pen on a vacant lot it just seemed a big lovable puppy that looked like it had moss and lichen growing on it i dont see how you can call something that weighs in at fifteen tons cute but it was cute i guess it was good practice in case one of the big carnivores tries the same trick he always have to play hardass dean come on on a firstname basis already the old boy drives me crazy doing that always miss belinda pay him no mind he means well dean you checked how you feel lately sir you said something nice about me this is a nice young lady mr garrett i approve thoroughly id like you two to get to know one another holy shit ah yes sir i know who her father is we cannot be held accountable for our choice of ancestors i know who your father was that was news to me if he meant that hed known the old man personally back in those olden days before pop went to the cantard to get himself killed as i understand the situation this isnt a problem mr contague begging your pardon miss belinda is as good as dead and the real say lies with mr crask and mr sadler two funloving boys who havent stopped being dangerous because theyve started running things by forging chodos signature whatre you trying to do dean im doing what i always do mr garrett im matchmaking his easy admission struck me dumb belinda found nothing to say either we exchanged helpless looks i added an apologetic shrug dean said ive spoken with miss belinda extensively and find her quite your type behind her antagonistic public face belinda snarled is this some kind of teamwork seduction effort garrett i protested you have to excuse him hes got this thing about getting me involved dean didnt listen he hummed and did kitchen work while we traded excuses and accusations then declared the dead man is napping why dont you two go upstairs make love two or three times then finish arguing over lunch i couldnt believe dean would say something like that this just wasnt the dean i knew not that i found the idea repulsive something about belinda got to me belinda just sat there staring while dean smiled then winked i suffered the faintly hopeful suspicion that she didnt find deans suggestion entirely repulsive either however this had become one of those situations where you couldnt carry forward if both of you were randier than a cat in heat i said youre pushing your luck dean im going back to bed im sorry miss contague please dont think ill of me because of deans presumptions i thought dean was going to break out laughing was this some scheme to sabotage all hanky before it turned into panky belinda didnt say anything as i fled i thought i detected the faintest look of disappointment you know how it goes as soon as i was alone and the risk of her reaction was no longer part of the equation i stared at the ceiling and entertained regrets while belinda contague grew more attractive by the moment any warts magically fading an incurable romantic thats me i was about to head out and see what block had accomplished or had not as was more probable though the fact that he hadnt been back did seem promising belinda came bounding upstairs can i go no hey therere people out there looking for you i dont think your continued good health is uppermost in their minds and the way you look wed be in trouble before we got two blocks whats wrong with the way i look not a damned thing and thats the problem was i to walk out of here with you right now my neighbors would hate me for life also anybody crask and sadler might have watching the place would be sure to recognize you it isnt like they trust me to dig my own grave unsupervised oh hell she stamped a foot a neat move you dont see that often it felt rehearsed if you were a redhead nobody would pay any attention i mean the uglies wouldnt my neighbors would hate me even more and i dont know if i could stand it if you were everything you are now and a redhead besides dean leaned out of the kitchen behind belinda gave me a look that said he thought i was laying it on with a trowel belinda said youre laying it on with a trowel garrett but i love it i hate being cooped up ill see about becoming a redhead or maybe a blond would you like that breakfast was forgotten sure anything im easy just dont put on a hundred pounds and grow a mustache she winked my spine turned to water but i wasnt a complete dummy i wondered why she was getting so nice i suggested you might change your look while youre at it especially if the black is like a trademark good idea she blew me a kiss i looked at dean who looked back and shrugged shook his head i couldnt tell if he meant he didnt know or didnt want to be blamed i started toward the door again garrett the story of my life i cant go anywhere or do anything without everybody in range nibbling at my time i stalked into the dead mans room yes tell captain block that on consideration i feel last nights abduction to have been that only the candy woman will not be murdered until tonight at the necessary hour if the captain has as seems likely with him given up searching and is waiting for a body to surface then he is im on my way i hit the street i made the tail within a block i took him for one of the outfits boys not chosen for his skill at remaining unobtrusive crask and sadler wanted me to know they were watching the really good tails would stay away till they thought id had time to do some serious searching id fool them i wouldnt look at all block wasnt hard to find i went to his headquarters hoping to get word where to look and behold there he was right there in the shop what the hell you doing hanging out here i demanded we didnt get anywhere last night i had five hundred men on the street they found squat i called it off after midnight didnt seem there was much chance wed do any good then all the killings took place before midnight near as we know youre waiting for somebody to find the body for you the dead man said you would be block shrugged im open to suggestions unless you think you need another thousand marks just to open your mouth on the house this time the dead man said tell you the girl is alive they wont do her till tonight the killer never breaks his schedule he just grabbed her last night because he knew wed be watching later still alive block grabbed his chin with his left hand and started kneading while he thought about that still alive more silence more thought ive had all the men winchell knew trying to guess where hed go to hide who hed get to help him probably wouldnt need anyone but ripley maybe not laudermill a staff sort of sergeant materialized a classic of the type his butt was twice the width of his shoulders sir anything yet on winchell or ripley winchell hasnt contacted any family or friends theyre still checking on ripley but hes a negative so far too i had a thought which has been known to happen maybe we could try looking on the inside when this happens it always startles people this one surprised even me what was winchell working on huh casewise look block ive been close enough to know youve been going a little farther than youre telling anybody except maybe the prince looking to make a splash when they cut you loose i figure whatever i dont care but some of your guys have been making some serious efforts to do real police work lately was winchell what was he doing maybe i got you block held a debate with himself showing expressions that suggested he was reluctant to let a cat get out of a bag finally laudermill get me relway and spike in here soon as you can laudermill departed with astonishing quickness for one of his bulk he was a twentyyear man for sure growing anxious about his pension block said these guys relway and spike were teamed with winchell and ripley on a decoy thing i wanted to test theyre irregulars theyre off shift now so it might take a while to find them i never thought to check the auxiliary operatives the irregular watchmen appeared sooner than block expected and way too soon for me where peace of mind was concerned neither was human relway was some unlikely breed that was half dwarf and fractions of several other things he was ugly also to my surprise he seemed to be decent and pleasant less scarred by his ancestry and appearance than id have guessed he was committed to the mission of the new watch an apparent fanatic likewise spike who was a ratman i dont like ratmen my dislike verges on being a prejudice i couldnt believe this ratman was for real an honest ratman is a contradiction in terms an oxymoron block told me relway and spike are volunteer auxiliaries till i get my budget approved i already have a verbal commitment for funds sufficient to add four hundred undercover operatives these two will direct one of the companies down where theyll be taking you scary stuff secret police great crimestoppers to begin maybe but how long before blocks ambitious prince discovered that they could be employed to root out persons of doubtful political rectitude sufficient unto the day so lets find out about our boys block questioned relway and spike they did know of a place where winchell and ripley might be hidden it was a hole theyd scouted while scoping out their operation they hadnt used it but that wouldnt keep winchell away now block snapped garrett you go with these two cover the place scout it out ill be right behind you with reinforcements away he flew relway and spike eyed me expectantly probably figuring me for a watch officer they were excited they were going to be part of something big and real before they were even officially policemen i jerked my head toward the door lets do it elvis winchell and his sidekick had guts relway and spike told me about the scam theyd started before chance brought the corporal and price ripley up against something too big to handle their target area was the waterfront around ogre town real badlands winchell would wander the worst parts pretending to be drunk ripley relway and the ratman would blend into the derelict scenery then would jump whoever jumped winchell i admired winchells balls but had reservations about his methods hed made only two actual arrests of two fairly inoffensive young muggers but hed sent a bunch of thugs home kneecapped set to spend the rest of their lives on the victim side of the line he felt that word would spread and the bad boys would take their business elsewhere maybe i said but i think theyd have just killed you four of us spike demanded i was startled not at all used to being addressed as an equal by a ratman a second later i was amused by this discovery of my own flaw spike continued muggers dont have a guild and they dont work in crowds i lived in this area for years the muggers never work in groups of more than four two is most common we handled foursomes easily captain block gave us the tools maybe id better not pursue this i dont think i want to know theres a new order coming garrett relway said lot of people have had all they can take the pendulum is swinging youre going to find people saying that if the crown wont solve social problems theyll take care of them themselves the man went on at great length till i was ready to send him off to debate those women id sicced on the dead man that time relway though he had no human blood was determined to be a factor in tunfaire society i suggested maybe youre overstepping friend nonhumans are here only by treaty they dont want to be subject to karentine law they better not claim its protection either i hear you garrett and youre right there should be one law for everyone youre born in this city and live in this city you should help make this city a decent place to live i done my part i did my five in the cantard and took my karentine citizenship i got the message dont look down because he was a breed hed paid his dues same as me i edged away from relway he was a committed activist every third sentence included the new order clearly capitalized politicals make me nervous translation they scare the shit out of me theyre weird and they believe the weird shit they say without looking at the implications of their becoming successful luckily politicals are few in tunfaire and those few are despised outcasts they ought to learn to be less threatening like barking dog amato now i saw how relway had sublimated the anger and hatred that should result from being an unusual breed and notably ugly besides he would keep on smiling but would restructure the world so hed become one of its shining lights fine go for it buddy just include me out of the revolution and its aftermath im happy with my life the way it is relway and spike led me to a tenement that had burned recently but incompletely though abandoned its cellars remained habitable defining habitable by liberal standards i asked how do we find out if anybodys in there it was broad daylight i was strutting around with two guys winchell knew two guys with no ability to cut any slack they had blackandwhite minds an hour earlier winchell and ripley were their best buddies now those two were just names on the sleazeball list scum in need of expungement relway gave the ruins the fisheye spike youre better at getting around quietly check it out ratmen are sneaky bastards spike went off like a ghost not toward the place that interested us relway and i made ourselves invisible while we waited relway was a chatterbox with a nose a foot long he wanted to know all about who i was and why i was interested in the case none of your business i told him in a huff relway said you could at least show some manners you could be polite ill be important in the new order im not polite to block i wouldnt be polite to his boss im not going to waste polite on you and the rat i didnt particularly want to be here fate keeps messing me around i hear what youre saying same shit happens to me maybe more looking the way i do nothing wrong with the way you look i lied theres the rat whats he signaling i think he means theyre in there he wants to know what we do now what we do now is wait for block i got a feeling this winchell is nasty id just hate it if he got away over my dead body i know where youre coming from garrett relway waved and poked the air so did spike im not big on becoming a dead hero myself i do want to see the new order arrive you wouldnt be the garrett thats the investigator would you probably why i didnt mess up any of your family or pals did i no nope what youre looking at is something you aint going to believe exists a real one in a trillion a pervert an honest breed who comes from a family thats never had even one member taken in for questioning his tone was challenging and deservedly so because my attitude reflected the general prejudice what was embarrassing was that it wasnt a prejudice i really felt were off on the wrong foot here and its mostly my fault relway it isnt personal ive been in a foul mood since i got up i usually save my venom for the ratmen youre weird garrett here comes the man he meant block evidently block was held in high esteem in some quarters block still held me in high enough esteem that he sought approval before he moved the place is surrounded gonna take some doing for anybody to get out dead man says take them alive if you can the curse probably cant transfer while theyre still alive they part must be touching ripley somehow or winchell whichever isnt the primary carrier yeah got you i guess theres no reason to stall anymore might as well do it a thought had wormed through my head several times lately id pushed it out over and over it came back again i was going to be sorry but i maybe ought to go with the first rush the girl will recognize me if i let her know its a rescue we can maybe keep the panic level down maybe save ourselves some people getting hurt thats up to you you want to go go im giving relway first shot tell him what youre doing then dont give him no grief while hes doing his job hes better than any of my regulars right i joined relway im going in with you the girl knows me you armed not for blood i showed him my headknocker he shrugged dont get in the way of the real cops what a straight line it was all i could do to avoid temptation relways storm group were armed up to take a town from a venageti guards division i hoped theyd had some experience along those lines they hadnt had any training since you figure to face that much trouble no relway said but this bunch will be ready for whatever trouble they do find good thinking no way you can get chewed out for not being ready when you go in ready for everything relway smiled there you go i looked across the street spike was restless things always get more real at moments like this you had it that way down there worse lots worse i was a scared kid then me too you ready i wont get any readier follow me he took off garrett the white knight pranced the cobblestones a step behind followed by a halfdozen uniformed champions of justice who had no idea how to accomplish what theyd been ordered to do they hadnt joined the watch to capture madmen or protect tunfaire from villains the ratman had a tiny basement window scouted as we arrived he dived through wriggling his hideous naked tail lashing behind him i think thats what gets me about ratmen the tails theyre really disgusting after you relway said as that tail slithered inside what that window was too small it wasnt meant to pass a body it was as big as it was only because some smalltimers had worked on it so they could get inside and clean the place out of what i cant imagine you said youre the hero she knows shit and i did volunteer for this i flopped on my belly and shoved my feet through the window the ratman pulled relway shoved i popped through hit the floor stumbled over a loose brick muttered where are they back where you see the light spike whispered that made him real hard to understand ratmen have trouble enough talking without whispering their throats arent made for speech you cover while we get more men down this ratman had spent a lifetime dealing with humans he hadnt hidden himself away from the mainstream content to live in societys cracks taking only what no one else wanted my respect for him rose i readied my headknocker advanced toward the light which leaked around a poorly closed door i wondered why winchell and ripley hadnt either attacked us or made a run for it seemed to me we were making an armageddon sort of racket all of a sudden i had three guys behind me and relway telling them weve got the other way out covered lets do it garrett i took a deep breath and hit the door i hurled myself at it expected to demolish my shoulder the door collapsed i didnt know my own strength i was a regular saucerhead tharpe i tore it right off its hinges i collapsed after two staggering steps over a footing of broken bricks elvis winchell and price ripley were hard at work snoring on beds of sacks and rags evidently carrying a curse was exhausting work the only open eyes around belonged to candy she responded to my entrance but not in any wild display of joy hell she didnt know why we were there for all she knew we were pals with winchell and his sidekick i stumbled to my feet were the rescue crew winchell and ripley had begun to respond finally relway bopped ripley over the head before the poor guy could get his eyes open relway wasnt having any trouble with the footing he looked positively graceful spike had less luck putting winchell back to sleep winchell evaded his blows scooted away his eyes trying to sparkle green maybe he didnt quite have the hang of it yet gods he looked awful like hed aged fifteen years in the time since hed helped bring in the villain downtown byrd had given us ripley too looked bad but not nearly as bad as winchell rescue crew you sure you look more like a circus act spike and two watchmen were chasing winchell winchell wasnt cooperating at all relway and the other man were stuffing ripley into a big sack block appeared at the other entrance to the cellar was careful not to place himself in extreme danger i called hey captain this one dont need rescuing shes got it under control already candy said youre the guy whos been hanging around hullars i cut the cords binding her ankles they were nice ankles i hadnt noticed how nice before id been entranced by all the nice stuff higher up garrett thats me trusty knighterrant invariably refused and abused for trying to warn people that theyre in danger watch the hands boy ive heard about you ripley was headed for the street now out of it but winchell was putting up a fight even though relway and spike working together had a sack over his head and arms neither relway nor winchell was in uniform having been employed both had been able to afford reasonably nice civilian clothing vaguely surprised though i noted that winchell used a rather heavylooking piece of rope for a belt ive heard about me too sometimes i dont recognize myself what did you hear obviously not that im a prize spike relway and the gang managed to get winchell tipped over and all the way into the giant sack relway got busy tying it shut prize pig you remember a rose tate relway kicked the flopping sack better than a cell on wheels he told nobody in particular ah sweet rosie again i said yes let me tell you about rose this is a true story that youll believe if you know rose and will call a fairy tale if you dont i had time the boys seemed to be getting along fine without me just to make sure i didnt lose my audience i became totally inept at untangling and cutting relway and the boys started dragging winchell toward the door winchell writhed and cussed all the way he wasnt alone in that sack in fact green butterflies fluttered around the basement confused more worried about the single candle burning than anything else again i wondered what the butterflies had to do with anything if they did maybe they were just something like a skunks spray then there was just candy and me and she didnt seem distressed by my lack of haste as i talked about rose tate in fact i started looking around for the knives id seen at the hamilton place while i talked in the back of my mind was a curiosity about how she knew rose when i finished my story i asked howd you come to meet rose you have a good idea whats going on with me i know youve been asking around hullar told me i was just trying to keep you from having a date with the guy they just hauled out of here he likes to whittle on rich girls i got that part i guess maybe i should thank you for not letting him eat my liver that would be nice i finally found the knives under the mess winchell had been using for a bed i didnt want to touch them but supposed theyd be harmless as long as winchell was breathing thank you garrett and i do mean it i get real sarcastic when im scared notice how we werent talking about how shed met rosie i didnt you must be scared shitless all the time when youre down to hullars then that was how she was known there as a sarcastic bitch youre going to ruin your chances garrett i made a sound like a steam whistle youre beautiful but im losing interest fast in fact im beginning to wonder why i wasted my time here your personality is sabotaging the advantages nature gave you story of my life garrett i make a point of shoving my foot into my mouth whenever things start going good im predetermined to fail thats what my mother says all right i promise ill try thank you you saved my life other than the obvious what can i do for you block appeared in the doorway and stuck his oar in what are you up to down here garrett looking for stuff find anything yeah those knives the dead man said we should break them block came a couple steps closer looked at the four naked blades is it safe to mess with them that way winchell and ripley still healthy yeah then theyre safe unless you go sticking yourself he made a rude sound took the knives ill bust them up right now he left i told candy other than the obvious which is less obvious than you think you can come to my place and talk to my partner hes the brains of the outfit he wants to see you he some kind of freak cant come see me hes handicapped i hid my grin nobody is handicapped like the dead man is handicapped we climbed out of the cellar candy never stopped yammering i did gestures of defeat tried to introduce her to block formally so shed know who got official credit for her rescue it didnt sink in she was chattering at me he was interested only in breaking the knives which he accomplished thoroughly cracking each into four pieces that ought to take care of that block was puffed up and happy pride goeth before i told myself better make sure they dont have anything else off that bum we dont know its the knives carrying the curse we burned the bum and everything he was wearing now well burn these yeah right not before we can do something about the curse later candy was still after me i said woman im not going to keep on i dont do masochism but do walk along with me see my partner my place is right on your way home i paused to stare at the captives both were lost inside burlap sacks winchells seethed ripleys did nothing but left me with an uncertain frown a little bitty thing like a clothes moth fluttered away while i was looking meantime candy demanded how do you know your house is on my way home i admit i havent figured out who you really are yet but i do know you come off the hill rich girls are the only kind this killer liked so if youre going to go home and hide out from the real world and tell yourself how lucky you were and forget all this and treat the lower you an acmeist or an anarchist huh you lost me but i hadnt lost her i was heading home and she was tagging right along the dead man would be pleased theyre crackpot underground groups garrett there are dozens of those pointillists deconstructionists calibrators avatars atheists realists postmoderns the way you were going on i dont have anything to do with politics mainly in hopes that politics wont have anything to do with me its my considered cynical opinion that no matter how much were overdue for a change any humandirected change will be for the worse to the benefit of a smaller and more corrupt ruling class at that moment i saw the face of the next fad revolution meantime do you have a name a real name all those ists would have as their troops poor little bored rich girls candace really youre using your real name might as well nobody ever used it but my brother he died in the cantard last year he was a cavalry captain im sorry im sorry garrett huh you lost somebody there too i got it yeah not like its a unique experience is it so what do most people call you mickey mickey how did they get mickey out of candace she laughed she had a wonderful laugh when she was doing nothing but being happy i could feel myself becoming distracted i dont know from my nanny she had pet names for all of us what i was chuckling you wakened a memory my little brother we called him foobah foobah i dont know my mom she called me wart wart yeah i can see that she danced away pointed wart wart hey knock it off people were staring she did a pirouette wart the famous investigator wart she laughed took off running she ran because i started after her she could run pretty good she had the legs they were such nice legs i didnt try too hard just floated along enjoying the view that started when we werent far from home it swept into macunado street so i caught up said couple blocks up that way this is my neighborhood people know me she laughed as she fought for breath yes sir mr wart ill maintain your dignity mr wart she was still laughing and giving me a hard time when dean opened the front door belinda was in the hallway she scowled at candy candy scowled at belinda wasnt any doubt they recognized one another candy gave me one last jab did you know his nickname is wart dean i growled bring refreshments to the dead mans room also smelling salts in case i bop this one over the head i had a problem suddenly i was caught between two gorgeous women both interesting each eyeing the other like a cat fixing to sharpen her claws on me i was out of practice but remembered how my luck ran when the fur started flying most of it would be mine theyd be happy to gang up on me i heard a noise from the small front room and suffered the inspiration of my life i popped in there before deans latest stray made cover it was a little furball so friendly that even i if pressed wouldve admitted it was cute i darted back into the hall where the ladies were exchanging killer stares i got that kitten purring i guess you guys know each other i told candy shes hiding out here from the killer i told belinda the killer snatched her last night we just rescued her i brought her by to talk to the dead man i figured id heard shed been taken she looked at the kitten without that sparkle kittens ignite in the eyes of their fans damn inspiration wasted arent you sweet candy cooed great halfway there anyway why dont you hold him while i check in with my partner she hadnt reacted to me calling him by name i played pass the kitty headed for the dead mans door as i neared it candy jumped frowned in that way people do when first they hear from his nibs direct i stepped inside you see what i got out here any special way you want to handle her just bring her in he was vastly amused by something i could guess what two women me panting shamelessly trying to conjure some way to have my belinda and candy too this will be a true test of your fabled charm especially as both women have been forewarned by your old friend rose tate make fun of my misery prepare her she is under a great deal of stress still my appearance may be too much for her as a surprise i thought she was handling her stress pretty well taking it out on me the kitty thing did work the women were together now examining the cat but talking about candys adventure i said he wants you to come in now i need to warn you hes not human dont be too startled when you see him candy didnt seem surprised is he real repulsive like an ogre no hes just fat mostly and hes got a big nose hes a sweetheart belinda said who is i demanded can i take josh with me candy meant the kitten named already belinda nodded never consulting me all right i said as though anyone cared what the owner thought in his own home good idea the cat could be a focus for some good feelings good thoughts when those might still be pretty hard to touch candy went into the dead mans room she didnt start screaming belinda remarked i really do think you may be one of the good guys garrett huh she waved a hand like shed heard things about me she didnt want to repeat in my presence i was baffled how much could those two have said while i was with the dead man women go figure them belinda took my arm cuddled up to my side it too early for you to take me to the kitchen and buy me a beer we found dean putting the final touches on a hot meal whats this i asked you need to eat and the young lady you brought home obviously hasnt had a decent meal for some time food is serious stuff to dean if he had his way every meal would be a production hes appalled by my attitude that food is just fuel though i do enjoy good food when i eat it i just wont go out of my way or spend any extra call me a savage i drew beer for belinda she said ive been thinking about my problem with crask and sadler good i hadnt had time can you get the door mr garrett dean asked an impressive amount of racket had broken out there i cant interrupt this sorry i told belinda she just smiled and winked now what i groaned as i stepped aside so block could come in dont tell me you screwed up again i couldnt stand it if you told me you screwed up again winchell got away garrett i begged you not to tell me you screwed up again it wasnt my fault the hell it wasnt you were in charge the guy was tied up in a gunnysack how could he get away some damned fool decided he wanted to take a look so he opened the sack i nearly screamed and the butterflies got after him and winchell just politely crawled out and waltzed away right right what i ought to do is take you and this other damned fool and tie you both up in a gunnysack and dump you in the river this other damned fool is prince rupert and hes been quite good about not trying to shift the blame well goodee ill cheer when hes crowned so what whyre you here bugging me block sneered im not i want to see your partner hes done well guessing what the killer will do because he has a diseased mind too im sure he knows youre here he has somebody with him right now just hang out in there i indicated the small front room hell call you im having lunch and youre not invited you incompetent sonofabitch i sat down opposite belinda why dont we kiss off tunfaire why dont we get married and run off to the carnival islands and open a fortunetelling booth thats an interesting proposition what brought it on the watch let the killer get away that madman is back on the street and hes got eight or ten hours to play his little prank but if candy and i are here hell kill somebody else he has to kill somebody somehow like it or not my house became the tactical headquarters of the hunt for elvis winchell by sunset prince rupert had made himself a guest i couldnt keep him out but i was a hardass about his yesmen jumped in there with a ferocious confrontational smile and said your lordship i havent the facilities to serve all those men when he wasnt instantly offended enough to holler for the headsman i went so far as to suggest their numbers are attracting attention it was way late but the night people were out there and they were noticing the crowd we compromised he didnt bring anybody inside this prince rupert was the first royal id met what i saw didnt impress me either way though later the dead man did blather on about the good intentions hed found in the mans mind at that time i wasnt in one of my better moods so just remarked that the road to hell was paved and so forth the sun hadnt yet risen when word came that theyd found emma setlow aka dixie starr in the usual state the troops had arrived while the ritual was winding down winchell had taken another successful powder but his helper had been captured the knives had been recovered knives i asked what knives we already broke the knives the knives in question turned out to be plain old kitchen knives not the best for the job they had done the dead man observed i suspect we will find that the knives were not the vehicle for the curse hell i muttered i had that figured winchell wouldnt still be on the hoof if they were the knives are broken shattered but the curse goes on cute what about the guy they caught the helper was a retarded ratman who admitted hed been babysitting dixie since her kidnapping which had taken place well before the snatch on candy meaning winchell had decided to stock up on brunettes after he had escaped from block and the prince hed just run off to where hed had dixie stashed i muttered i dont like this this winchell sounds too damned smart winchell block sneered winchell needs help tying his shoes it is the curse gentlemen this time around meaning this return to the world it has reached some critical stage of growth i suspect it would not be false to state that it has reached a point where it has begun to teach itself not just to learn in the slow way a dog does through numerous repetitions it might behoove us to consider the horror of the possibility that it may develop an ability to reason wait a minute wait a minute a curse makes your cow go dry or gives you shingles or makes your kid crosseyed it isnt something that in the world of your village charm seller you are correct probably no sorcerer alive today could cast this spell but this spell comes down from a time when giants walked the earth giants were walking the earth right outside well within a mile anyway but i didnt argue one of the earliest lessons i learned about dealing with old bones is dont get him going on the good old days giants well maybe but were here to develop a strategy considering the prince and captain block that strategy would be as much political as it was aimed at removing a major villain from the streets the dead man agreed with me winchell will keep as short a profile as possible but he will not be able to remain hidden he may be able to do without a helper but his need to kill is on a short and shortening cycle six nights from tonight he will have to kill again inasmuch as miss altmontigo has been rescued he will have to develop his next victim from scratch assuming we can keep our two houseguests isolated that he sent to me alone our guests didnt need to know we had anyone special squirreled away he will be hunting if he manages to get his victim without help this time he will still have to recruit helpers he cannot stop killing and he cannot stop the circle of death growing smaller every time so that he has to kill sooner whoa whoa block said there a point to all this yammer yes winchells financial resources cannot be vast counter his recruiting efforts by offering a substantial reward for his capture whos miss altmontigo i asked regretting it before i finished speaking yet i wondered why hed hesitated that instant before and after because of block and the prince candy to you or mickey one very unsettling point here the altmontigos are an ancient and honored family from the highest heights of the hill what was i getting into i had a royal prince and as hightoned a young woman as could be found visiting at the same time not to mention i was giving shelter to a princess of the underworld all of that meant notice i dont like being noticed by people with that kind of power the arguments went on and on dawn came and went i said the hell with it i wasnt contributing anything and wasnt hearing anything useful to me what suggestions i did make were ignored so let the great powers scope things out their own way after they screwed up and looked like complete fools i could lean back smugly and tell them they shouldve listened to me in the first place i stopped at the foot of the stairs belinda was up there candy was up there dean was on the daybed in the small front room again that damned kitten started rubbing up against my ankle purring trying to get in good i picked him up little buddy first thing in the morning you get to learn a valuable lesson you cant get by on cute and the kindness of strangers youre going to hit the street the cat purred and somebody pounded on the door i didnt get in any hurry i ambled toward the front door wondering if i couldnt boobytrap the front steps putting in something where if you didnt trip the secret safety you got dumped into a bottomless pit wonderful idea but unfortunately not really practical the practical thing to do was ignore the door only most people who want to see me know i have that habit and know that ill storm to the door eventually if they just raise hell long enough this little nightmare visitor was one neglected subject slash coconspirator name of barking dog amato just what i needed in the middle of the night well morning it had turned morning when i wasnt looking i didnt wake you up did i no me i havent been to bed yet i was just heading there its been a nasty day in a nasty week in a nasty month the girl killer i heard there was another one thats on the street already word gets around when people are interested i guess come back to the kitchen i jerked a thumb at the dead mans door your old pal block is in there cooking up something with his nibs i settled amato at the kitchen table beer sure whats up i asked as i drew two well its an imposition i know i got up it was raining out i was sick of doing signs and handbills so i got out and started walking my feet brought me here what the hell i didnt need sleep who needs sleep when you lead a righteous life some leftover apple pie here want some sure i dont get much decent food what did you think the other day you made a hell of a start i didnt get to see it all though i noticed you disappeared not by choice some of chodo contagues thugs came around told me the man wanted to see me i thought i saw some of those guys just before you disappeared you know chodos people not by direct experience thank heaven but ive watched the outfit for years gathering information they havent tried to profit at my expense yet but when they do ill be ready which meant what there was someone inside the outfit who suffered from mercy and tolerance not hardly belinda walked in candy was right behind her neither was formally attired barking dog immediately proved that he wasnt all crazy his eyes bugged he drooled if the moon had been up he would have howled at it he squeaked who are these lovely ladies garrett theyre involved in the serialkiller thing this one is belinda and this one is candy guys this is kropotkin amato belinda wasnt impressed but candy practically jumped out of her underwear she just had to ask barking dog amato looking me right in the eye sass father in two blinks amato was a changed man sas like in a nickname for lonie you know lonie amato belinda caught on grabbed candys hand candy was chalk pale but apparently belindas move wasnt fast enough to stifle her she said sure we work with sas dont we so i thought you girls have wasted the night away having a hen session upstairs i hoped a guy named garrett hadnt played too prominent a role barking dog said lonie is my daughter not many people know i havent seen her since she was five my wife she never believed in what i was doing she thought i was crazy maybe i was maybe not it didnt matter she took off with lonie you know lonie you really know lonie even crackpots get to shed their tears the girls didnt know what to say i waved them off i said old buddy i guess i owe you a little confession the reports weve been doing theyve been going to your daughter through hullar yeah he was a nominee but not a villain lonie really you know my daughter garrett ive seen her thats all i dont know her is she all right tell me about her tell me everything im going to break your heart old buddy i cant we get along and weve worked some things together but you arent my client hullar is for your daughter i cant tell you anything unless they say its all right i will tell you that shes healthy she aint up in the world but shes a long way from down you want to know more ill see what hullar says belinda said ive changed my mind youre a real shit garrett what if i was working for you would you want me telling your business without permission she grumbled she made noises she understood barking dog might well be enthusiastic about news of his daughter but would the daughter be eager to have him intrude upon her life lonies wishes had to be consulted barking dog reached that conclusion too maybe faster than i did he said garrett you talk to her see if shell meet me you work that out where i can see her ill be your slave for life anything you want its yours i loved that girl and i havent seen her since she was practically a baby belinda and candy looked at me like they expected pearls of wisdom to drip from my lips as though with a wave of rusty knights blade all could be made right between barking dog and his longlost child there was a lot of sentimental emotion floating around if i was going to gain any ground with either of these beauties i was going to have to play for the reunion im a cynic i admit it i had to do it to maintain my chances no way was i going to waste my precious time on that out of sentiment im one of the hard guys you cant get me with that mush i hoped amatos heart didnt break when he found out what his daughter did hell i didnt know what she did did i she danced for bishoff hullar that didnt make her a whore anyway that wasnt any of my business i said i dont want to be impolite guys but i really am beat ive been hustling all day you ladies want to stay up talk to mr amato thats fine with me make sure the front door is locked when you go to bed what that means is one of you has to stay up till mr amato and those clowns in there with his nibs leave the dead man proved that one of his brains had room left for me while he entertained royalty you need not concern yourself garrett i suspect that i will not get rid of this prince short of being so rude he hauls us up on charges i am confident dean will be awake in ample time to see our last guest out do get some sleep that didnt sound good at all he isnt kind to me unless he has plans for me if he wanted me rested he meant to run me into the ground later i patted amatos shoulder talk to the girls ill see about your daughter two minutes later i was between the sheets i killed the lamp and was unconscious before my head hit the pillow the dead man ran me into the ground for days i got to do all the legwork blocks men were supposed to have done already actually they had gathered all the relevant records into one room in the chancery cellar they just never got around to doing anything with the documents so i got to winnow and collate where i could i had to bring in help with the older documents which were recorded in the abandoned odellic alphabet and wouldnt have been readable anyway because the language has changed so much while i goofed off days and spent profligate evenings in the tenderloin block hunted winchell and tried to avoid public notice word was out that he was the man charged with ending the killings it was also out that he wasnt having much luck the scale and scope of the mess were getting exaggerated the precursors of hysteria filled the air which made no sense because people get murdered every day curse or no curse i think blocks mistake was offering a reward for winchell despite that being the dead mans idea that focused attention attention got the poor fool working on an ulcer his buddy rupert couldnt shield him from all the highranking dolts who just had to explain to him the best way of doing his job the prince himself was guilty of forgetting they were after a killer who was a bit out of the ordinary tell the man block grumbled he dont listen to me getting disenchanted not yet but close i can still realize that hes got his own problems and thats why he cant give us more help its just a tad irritating when he shuts out whatever he doesnt want to hear though i shrugged a cynics shrug i had no faith in his prince so block made excuses for him he does have enemies garrett plenty of people think tunfaire is just dandy the way it is now mostly theyre people whose fortunes would suffer from an outbreak of law and order if it isnt law and order itll be an outbreak of something the signs were growing stronger i ran into some old ladies who want to demolish all the breweries wineries and distilleries thats going too far i tried to tell them i said there is no civilization without beer beer is the lifeblood in the veins of society they wouldnt listen that put a smile on his face fanatics what can you do we get fifty complaints a day about these religious nuts mississans whatever they are his grin meant he thought id invented the old ladies i hadnt they were working the chancery steps a few levels above barking dog crowded into a spot nobody else wanted i wasnt worried about them in no rational society would theirs be an idea whose time could come i saw a lot of amato spending my days at the chancery he wasnt the same barking dog the old fervor had gone i made a point of catching him on his break whats happening hey something gone wrong im scared he didnt beat around it scared you barking dog amato yeah me people havent really noticed yet but they will you did then wherell i be whats the matter what happened maybe he had somebody persecuting him for real my daughter suddenly im vulnerable when i didnt know about her nobody could get to me youre safe hardly anybody knows about her now were not talking i sniffed the air what was that aha amato wasnt nearly as aromatic as once hed been yeah i guess i keep telling myself them what knows is decent folk then i get scared of her i raised an eyebrow i snuck down to the tenderloin i figured she had to hang out around that hullars place sometimes else how would he know to hire you right everybody thinks hes an investigator so i hang out and hang out and finally i get me a look at the gal they call sas and she looked all right i told you that shes got people to look out for her now i know about her theres no way i can get around meeting her facetoface and that scares the shit out of me what do you say to your kid you aint seen since she was this high it would terrify sas too when the time came she didnt know that he was aware of her existence i kept debating whether or not to tell hullar it would piss him off but i guessed id better i understand but dont let the stress get you you may have a valuable mission ahead huh you should get out among the people hang around the taverns and sidewalk cafes plotting urban revolution isnt a poor boys hobby poor folks stay too busy working to keep body and soul and family together amato shook his head i wouldnt fit in sure you would get yourself some new clothes put in some time getting in touch with todays popular climate how come mild suspicion he still didnt trust me completely theres a new spirit afoot it doesnt amount to much yet but it could you ought to be aware of it i thought he could become a real force on the street if he addressed real fears and angers lots of people had heard of him he was a folk hero people did listen when he stopped talking about himself he spoke largely out of imagined pasts now but there was no reason he couldnt apply his passion to futures as yet unimagined captain block caught me during my chat with barking dog he looked less like a watchman than ever though he was welldressed his henchmen too were trading uniforms for street clothing apparel had become a statement those who shed the red and blue meant to take their work seriously the rest would become unemployed if prince rupert gained control of the citys police powers hows it going block asked he ignored amato barking dog pretended block was invisible it was a good working arrangement ive got a story sort of its not as clear as id like it wont be much use the documentation is all of the wedidthisandthat thiswomangotkilled sodidthatone wecaughtthevillainandhangedhimandburiedhimwherehefell variety not a hint how to control the curse back then the curse didnt migrate from villain to villain the way it does now it didnt get the chance i think the people involved understood it better and it wasnt as sophisticated as it is now and the local wizards werent always out of town the job wasnt just up to the watch before the second killing round ended everybody knew they were dealing with an accursed man whod opened the grave of the first killer and we as brilliant as our forebears had gotten that far too hooray they didnt do anything about it sure they hanged a man and buried him where they thought he wouldnt be found they were wrong im no expert on sorcery but ill bet this curse has some kind of summons built in that calls till somebody hears it and sets it free smarter and nastier than its ever been before block mused and today we cant do anything about it even if we want we dont have anyone who can neutralize it because of the war yep all our real badass wizards were in the cantard what about your end i asked you never know he or his boys might have tripped over winchell not a trace well have to trap him its set the girl goes back to work tonight she skips tomorrow night works the next two nights the extra one is in case he can hold off for a day your partner says he wouldnt move two days early i didnt think winchell would be dumb enough to go where he was expected at all block continued the only people in the place not part of the cover team will be hullar the dwarf and three girls hullar trusts with his life there wont be no way winchell can get to her if he has to do it hell have to take the bait if he had to have either candy or belinda but i wasnt the least bit confident that winchell wouldnt find other victims unless his girl luck was as bad as mine i didnt criticize the dead man had scoped out this plan he termed it his martialarts approach we would lay back and let the curse betray itself ive already mentioned his plans obvious weaknesses just suppose he gives it a skip and takes second best the minute we find a body were on his trail spikes hired the best ratman trackers in town theyre on call in fact hes got them wandering around in case they cross winchells track by chance when everything you can do isnt enough you do whatever you can give block that this time he was giving a hundred percent he asked you identify the sorcerer responsible only to a probability it goes way back farther than we thought theres still some stuff i need translated before i can say for sure though goddamnit say something for unsure hey temper the oldest depositions first time there were killings mention a drachir nevets i checked with a historian hed never heard of a drachir nevets but he did know about a lopata drachir of nevetska a real shadowy oldtime superwizard who was always into it with a sorcerer named lubbock candide drachirs forte seems to have been writing curses so complicated that nobody could escape them block grunted thought a moment amazed me by knowing the names he was better educated than id suspected why this particular curse any hints more shadowy stuff candide had a daughter arachne right a major asskicker herself unless the translator was yanking my leg both drachir and candide were out to win her favors and found a dynasty of witchkings arachne decided shed rather snuggle up with daddy which pissed drachir off mightily which im guessing led him to send a curse after her all that would have been way way before the first killings yeah im thinking maybe that wasnt the real first time around only the first that got recorded like maybe arachne deflected the curse earlier and buried it and didnt tell anybody maybe the man could think when he wanted it might be useful to find out if there are any extant portraits of drachir and the candides especially arachne block grunted he wore a faraway look this just wont be settled the easy way will it not hardly heavens the things i was going to have to talk over with the dead man and him not in a charitable mood because the news from the cantard had such a lullbeforethestorm feel speaking of things not settling easily without making a big todo catch a look at the guy watching us from up where the old ladies do their temperance thing block looked chodos man crask bingo im going to trust you with something barking dog had gone back to work early not wanting to be close to a minion of his oppressors no one would hear the other girl at my place belinda her full name is belinda contague as in the daughter of chodo contague shes hiding out with me because crask and sadler want to kill her huh why because they did something to chodo poisoned him or something ive seen him what the hell everybody lies to the police hes a vegetable they just pretend hes giving the orders belinda knows that which is why they want to get rid of her i think i missed something garrett belinda can take them down they have to cover their scam or lose control i got into it because they wanted to hire me to find her for them a girl who happens to be one of the main targets of our killer that had been a problem for me briefly i thought it was one damned long coincidence till i realized i was looking at it from the wrong end from the end where we are chasing winchell look at it coming the other way the thing between belinda and crask and them has been going on for months the girlkiller thing is just something she stumbled into going somewhere else she wouldnt have been involved at all if the other thing hadnt made her run away from home chance brought me into it at one point rather than another sooner than later the players had me chalked in for their game block looked uncomfortable how come youre telling me it aint healthy knowing too much about chodos business because theres a very large and nasty man up there giving me very evil looks hes unhappy because i havent been busting my butt trying to find belinda instead of noodling around with some whocares serialkilling thing as i recall im supposed to call on the watch if it can give me a hand not to mention that you might get a kick out of poking a stick into the eye of an evildoer of crasks stature knowing he doesnt really have chodo behind him tell you the truth garrett i think getting crask off the street is a grand idea he snarled it setting off alarms what had i done but i dont have much confidence in it being a healthy idea whats he doing glaring daggers probably thinking how nice it will be to drag me somewhere where he can do dental work on me why the girl he doesnt know shes staying at my place he hasnt seen me lift a finger to find her despite my having been told very plainly that it would be in my best interest to do so youre sure chodos out of it absolutely then maybe ill have some fun with crask but dont expect a lot these people always have friends in high places how well i know i muttered block winked have a nice day he strolled away looking thoughtful leaving me beached and sputtering i did notice that he had friends in the crowd mostly his auxiliaries hed begun to enjoy his role as honest watchman i wondered if hed started turning all bribes away or only the most embarrassing ones i hoped the new order thing didnt go to his head truly there can be such a thing as too much law and order though i cant foresee tunfaire ever suffering from that i bade a soft farewell to barking dog he was on a roll did not have time to set his brass megaphone down he indicated his latest report on himself i snagged it and moved away awaited crask crask was displeased with me what kind of creep are you garrett hanging out with dogshit like block hes not so bad were old pals didnt you know sort of in business together too the new order like that i couldnt get the caps in like blocks creature relway got a problem with that i got a problem with you you was hired to do something you aint doing it youre mistaken despite having had money forced upon me i didnt agree to anything not to say i refuse the job but i do have a couple other things to wrap before i get to it so flutter away no chodo hires you youre on the job now its the only job on your list aw shucks here we go how long you known me crask long enough you know no matter how many ugly faces you pull no matter how many muscles you flex im going to do things my way i told you i have things to finish first you wait in line just like you was real people youre pissing me off garrett eek that was the idea i have that effect on people especially the kind who jump lines or think they deserve special consideration if he was going to do anything i wanted him to do something stupid in public look here look real close i want you should see my heartfelt pain at how im causing you distress i come here just going to caution you gentle garrett just going to take a minute out to show you the error of your thinking so to speak but now i got a feeling we need to go someplace and talk you arent half as slick as you think crask that was block materializing out of nowhere why dont we all sit down on the steps here like we was old buddies bug off asshole crask said aint none of your business what were talking about maybe youre right but maybe im not interested in that block backed up a couple steps settled onto the stone wall at the edge of the chancery steps he waved a man stepped out of the crowd even i was startled he seemed to have come from nowhere block said well blinky blinky replied we removed the coach we arrested three men well how about that crask didnt look at block he put it all on me what the hells going on here garrett you know as much as i do block said you could be going down shit whatre you pulling block smiled times are changing crask i been waiting for that to happen he looked up at me smile malicious me and crask go way back same neighborhood same outfit in the cantard to start we share a lot of memories crask stirred uneasily the strain in blocks voice said this was old business coming to a head crasks confidence was less than complete things did seem to be changing you mess with me block youll think a shit avalanche fell on you i doubt it like i said times are changing youre running out of friends i been waiting the day i made captain i had a special cell fixed up in the alkhar im looking for an excuse to put you in it hoping you make me break all your bones putting you there i dont know why it works out that way but almost every prisoner who was on the watchs topfiftyassholes list seems to end up committing suicide maybe its rough in there he winked at me said thanks garrett id almost forgotten what i owe this butthead at the same time crask put on his most menacing face you want to be dead garrett you dont mess with me like this and get out alive what do i have to lose werent you going to do me and the kingpins kid as soon as i found her come on garrett you think im weak by your standards but do you really think im stupid crask was ready to skin people alive my plan to drive him crazy had worked only one of blocks men stepped up and bopped crask from behind whaling on his head with a stick that was cousin to my own crask didnt go down first crack the stick man stared at his tool for a moment astonished then before crask regained his equilibrium blocks man whacked him half a dozen times real fast making sure he got the effect he wanted traffic on the steps cleared back funny not one soul thought of hollering for the watch block asked what do you think shall i put him away let sadler shit a few bricks trying to figure what happened to him youre not scared what theyll do not anymore block smiled relway appeared though i had no solid reason to think so i feared relway was the most dangerous creature in this new order watch well lock him up for a few days just so hell know what it can be like the show moved away from me then i worried for block this could cause him big trouble he might have a cell fixed up for crask but i couldnt see crask staying in it no matter what rupert planned the kingpin had friends everywhere once sadler learned about crasks predicament heavyweight wheels would start turning still i watched relway block was creating his own personal secret police force fast possibly with the best of intentions but if he pulled many stunts like snatching crask hed find himself riding a tiger i reported everything to the dead man he was not pleased you think i am chuckles captain block has grown overconfident his act is premature his organization however extensive cannot challenge the syndicate even in transition i cannot see his men remaining loyal through a crisis corruption has its own historical momentum historical momentum he starts using terms like that its time to batten down theres about to be a big sententious blow in the matter of mr amato his trepidation is understandable next time you see him suggest he stop in and visit just a downhome good old boy my partner i made a rude noise id spent three days burrowing through centuries past and he showed no interest whatsoever he could ignore with the best of them in the matter of the sorcerers candide and drachir it appears that we should contact appropriate experts i consulted experts already smiley linguists and generalists both names excite vague resonances but no special memories before my time i fear my opinion is that block should have saved his special cell for our special villain he was racketing around all over the place probably itll take a tough lockup to keep whoevers wearing the curse till we get the appropriate wizards on the case suddenly the dead man went shy his tenor tentative behind a display of confidence baffled me if only because i couldnt conceive of any situation in which he ought to be hiding something from his senior partner in the matter of miss altmontigo pause like he was fixing to feed me a line of bull so feeble he couldnt expect a moron to buy it i had a visit from her stepfather we enjoyed a turbulent session ill bet you know how fathers get he had to face facts meaning somebody who considers himself my partner outstubborned somebody who knew he was on this earth for only three score and ten and saw time slipping away meaning that relentless bombardment with fact forced him to assume a cooperative stance you got to him by dropping the princes name hes not so hard to figure actually the real clincher was my observation that he no longer has any legal hold on miss altmontigos person only on her property i frowned each time he mentioned miss altmontigo he sort of stumbled but i turned to his point for reasons unclear to me karentine property law assumes women dont have the sense the gods gave a goose the law gives husbands and fathers veto powers over all transfers even where they have no other claim on money or property i suppose thats meant to save those silly girls from giving everything to cults and or con men only a widow can execute contracts in her own name i guess good sense rubs off in bed i suggested she might get around him on the property of which she has a great deal inherited via his maternal grandmother who was something of a feminist activist he manages the property at a handsome profit to himself hed hung a lantern on the loophole a woman of legal age can marry without permission she could marry a dying man who had no other heirs making herself a quick widow this doesnt happen too often but when it does and there is a fortune at stake the cases become public entertainments witnesses sell their testimony to the highest bidder you can guess about the lawyers everything not nailed down it aint nailed down if they can get it loose with a prybar youre home belinda invited herself in rolled her eyes skyward that woman she may work at hullars but she has no concept of the real world i frowned a question at the dead man a juvenile female rivalry ignore it sensible advice maybe though not taking sides can be dangerous too if theyre really wound up belinda asked did we make any headway today i told her about my day the dead man didnt grouse about hearing it all again was my report on drachir all that intriguing belinda became preoccupied after i mentioned crask twice i had to ask whats with him before i got an explanation of the dead mans funk that friend of yours the big one came by saucerhead yes he brought some news about the cantard i dont think it was welcome excuse me belinda didnt like military stuff bad news smiley i asked something you didnt want to hear your marines have recaptured full harbor i told you it would be a different story i felt me a big surge of pride they really do get you that is the least of it karenta has launched a general offensive on a shoestring and a prayer supported by morcartha auxiliaries karentine forces are attacking venageti and republicans everywhere going to be a lot of regrets going out to the mothers of a lot of karentine heroes then a great many more will go to venageti and republican mothers the morcartha appear to be serving both loyally and with efficiency if they persist they will devour glory mooncalleds ability to gather superior intelligence by harassing his scouts relentlessly they are assuming all the traditional cavalry roles including raiding and screening and holding and they are doing it through the air where neither mooncalled nor the venageti can touch them they have wrested air supremacy from mooncalleds flying allies already so do not be thick it may mean the war is all but over with karenta the winner assuming the morcartha remain steadfast we will witness a slaughter karentine troops will be in the right place at the right time in superior numbers supported vigorously from aloft every time and the end of mooncalleds dream may be the beginning of karentas nightmare victory may be defeat our wiser leaders may have realized that long ago that may be why the war dragged on when the cost of victory exceeds that of continued warfare huh i was in one of my sharper states you have on occasion commented on conditions that could arise should all the soldiers come home oh sure after generations of warfare the economy depends on continued conflict whole sectors are managed by nonhumans peace would bring on dislocations of vast magnitude social stress and strife call it the war thats lost by winning exactly have we done anything to steel ourselves we are nonpolitical our services will be in demand always against fate even the gods conspire in vain that sounded like a bowdlerized quote i didnt mention my suspicions it does no good to call him on a theft hes shameless belinda came back ive been thinking garrett i need to see captain block a scheme worthy of your father miss contague but poorly timed i do not think i can urge this strongly enough this is not the moment to challenge mr crask and mr sadler their side of the ledger has all the pluses and your few reliable friends are preoccupied with this traveling curse even so let me suggest a few steps we might take when the time does come i groaned when we take steps i do the stepping they conversed i waited left out belinda was full of bounce when she left having delivered a potent and promising thankyou kiss what was she planning her scheme involved transporting me to mr dotess establishment say what the woman is mad i cant move him to sweep around him let alone push him out of the house there was a certain elegant evil in her plan he sent rather wistfully he did not explain we will explore elements of it in our free time these coming days this will require visits from numerous outsiders apprise dean right and have dean blame it all on me even when it was obvious the whole thing was one of the dead mans chuckleheaded schemes so there we were fooling around closing out one of tunfaires worstever serialkiller deals up to our ears in watch and informants and the dead man was trying to set up some scam to get crask and sadler off belindas back i got to play gofer grumbling gofer when block didnt have anything better for me to do i must admit though that miss belinda contagues gratitude stretched the limits of imagination and almost those of endurance we had so many villains in and out i lost count most werent your basic thug type they were magistrates and military men and entrepreneurs and yes even watch officers men whose vision defects had made chodo powerful and them wealthier than they should have been they all knew belinda her birthday parties had been chodos annual excuse for gathering them together they came belinda talked about crask and sadler and her dad while the dead man poked around inside their heads those who would line up against belinda left with their thoughts scrambled so theyd forget having seen her saucerhead and morley and morleys men puddle and sarge hung around being insurance the dead man was sure winchell wouldnt go after candy again even if we threw her out naked and gave him a big head start belinda offered to go dangle on the hook came the night this time i was determined to stick it out till it wrapped block and his allthumbs boys werent going to screw it up again i wanted out id done work enough for three cases the only up side was i hadnt gotten pounded around which happens too often in my line hullars place was stuffed with picked watchmen most of them auxiliaries more of the same were scattered around the neighborhood the tenderloin was lousy with law the outside crew came and went buying beer we insiders bought more hullar leaned against the bar told me this asshole with the knife is going to make me rich all you guys in here sucking it down you really got to catch him we could let him do his stuff right there on your dance floor let the mess draw the ghoul trade touchy cant help it the hour was late tension was rising the troops worked harder and harder to pretend they were ordinary slobs i shouldve told them to lean back and take it easy they were plenty ordinary and they had slob down pat we shouldnt be out here garrett hullar was right winchell might recognize me maybe the watch was rubbing off on me instead of the other way around belinda came to the back room where hullar and crunch and i were killing time drinking she needed reassurance so did crunch he was put out relway had ousted him from behind the bar i could handle any whippersnapper what went to bothering the girls hullar no reason me being pushed off my job im sure you could crunch but im not in charge crunch turned his glare on me i said were talking about a psycho killer crunch a total crazy you dont know him the man behind the bar does i hoped relways disguise would hold up if you were out there he could walk in and cut your throat before you knew it was him its for your safety this had played before i was tired of it i gave belinda a peck on the cheek squeezed her hand getting close hang in there break a leg all that he shouldve made some kind of move already garrett i was afraid she was right somebody shouldve come to check her out maybe tried to pick her up i was worried too an hour later the consensus had spread to the street something had gone wrong our fish hadnt bitten somewhere a woman was dying because but no one gave up playing his part i was in the shadows looking into the dance hall when sadler walked in he looked incredibly evil his expression grew more wicked as he spotted belinda she was dancing with a watchman disguised as a sailor she spotted sadler momentary fire touched her eyes sadler headed toward her once he passed a certain point everyone in sight moved he realized hed walked into something fur started flying steel lashed the air i stepped out to remind the boys that we werent killing people tonight barking dog amato waltzed into the place there you go we have us a rousing brawl going everybody closing down a setup in which everybody had a specific role including those of hullars girls whod stuck around to make it look good we have maybe twenty people screaming and yelling we have bodies flying everywhere and in walks barking dog amato looking for his daughter he spots me instead he ignores the uproar hey garrett thiss luck a watchman flew past him thrown by sadler who was in a truly foul temper i tried to get to barking dog so i could move him somewhere a little less violent he demanded wheres my girl garrett i come down here and come down here and hung out till i finally got me the nerve to talk to her and when i do i find out this sas aint my baby at all her names sasna progel and all she knows about lonie amato is shes heard hullar and his dwarf henchman mention the name another watchman sailed by whatre you trying to pull were in the middle of something now could you maybe step over there out of the way and hang on a minute sadler roared my name like hed decided i was the root of every evil hed ever suffered he charged better look out garrett amato said he headed for a corner that fellow dont look too friendly that fellow didnt at that he trampled watchmen then he tripped over one i planted a strong right on his temple it put him on his knees but didnt put him out i threw a little of everything i had while he was getting up he got up anyway i bruised some knuckles on my left hand then sadler hit me back i flew off to visit barking dog sadler came after me ignoring all those other people giving him hell it was like he was holding me personally responsible for his pain he bent down to pick me up barking dog let him have it which was like a bee stinging an elephant if the bee dont pick his spot barking dog didnt but he did irritate sadler enough that he decided to hammer amato one bishoff hullar strongman popped sadler with something that looked like a fist but couldnt have been because sadler folded right up hullar breathed on his knuckles said were supposed to be looking out for a girl not having us a good time garrett he pointed ill be go to hell winchell had decided to drop in after all there he was making his way to the bandstand overlooked in all the excitement hey we got a party now belinda eyed him uncertainly wondering if he was the one she was supposed to fear the whole place went silent winchell started moving fast i yelled everybody joined in it was the battle of sadler all over again only winchell was tougher the curse had made him a superman he got to belinda hoisted her onto one shoulder headed for the door when i tried to talk him into changing his ways he deposited me on the back of my lap under a table nobody slowed him down till crunch decided to take matters into his own hands brought up a pony keg and politely tossed it across the room to meet winchells surprised face the keg was full not bad for an old hairbag winchell never got his eyes uncrossed the boys from the street came in and helped close him down they tied and gagged him and most of the excitement was over he looked small and old now like the curse was turning him into the old greeneye whod started it all at morleys then belinda was all over me past her i saw barking dog buttonhole hullar it was a while before the excitement faded block arrived he circled winchell smugly i told him you let him get away again im personally going to drop you in the river with a reminder boulder tied to your toe relway get him sacked up and celled up and dont let that gag slip winchell looked spooky enough with his eyes glowing grinning block bragged wont be no mistakes this time garrett thiss our future here were gonna be careful were gonna wall him up in the cell i let crask stew in prince rupert is gonna send for the wizard help we need soon as he knows we got him i grumbled hinting that i might be less than confident about the competence of a certain prince and his watch you got any bright ideas yeah i got a real special one so i go hit the sack you want anything else come bug the dead man tomorrow tomorrow afternoon belinda said garretts going to have to get some sleep too huh us investigators have minds like steel traps too she winked i might let you catch a nap if youre a good boy oh block had gotten it before i did i was suitably chastened meantime barking dog was in full cry he had hullar and crunch both confused and on the run i was further chastened by fates unrelenting efforts to keep me chaste winchell had had a strong suspicion he was headed into a trap the curse had compelled him to go anyway but had permitted him some latitude in preparation it was smart enough to allow its steed its head when that was appropriate i hit macunado street with visions of a wild night dancing in my head and found my front door shattered dean lay in the hall about halfway dead his stray curled inside the curve of what looked like a broken arm crying belinda said ill look after dean you find out what happened i opened wide but sensed nothing from the dead man that scared me only once before had the villains gotten in and then theyd gotten only a few feet the dead man turned wouldbe intruders into living statues usually while they were still in the street here there was no evidence hed been able to do anything the invader had hiked straight from the entrance to the stairs had the dead man finally taken that long last step across to the other shore i got no sense of his presence go on belinda snapped be careful i edged forward my heart in my throat im not ashamed to admit i was scared this had the same feel i recalled going into the worst raids we pulled back when i was one of karentas brave young marines i crept along the wall to the dead mans door nudged it open i whirled inside ready for anything nobody there but my partner he looked unchanged but there was a difference i felt a tension unlike any id encountered before i sensed that he was safe and awake but way too focused to spare me a thought which meant the trouble was still in the house and he was a nightmare upstairs he had to be upstairs candy was upstairs but we already had winchell i felt for the dead man seeking confirmation he did not respond of course whoever did it is still here i told belinda and hes so strong hes fought the dead man to a standstill i think hes after candy im going after him but im afraid if i go upstairs he wont be there hell grab you and take off so check down here first she was calm and practical maybe it was hereditary i guess old bones can hold out a few minutes more nothing in here belinda said having entered the kitchen boldly and the cellar door is locked from this side a shriek came from above from candys room in candys voice could be bait something thumped the floor it sounded like a body falling belinda grabbed my arm i asked you reckon its a trap garrett right this is no time to make light tell me a better time i told me to pretend i was morley dotes this might be a job that called for morleys legendary cool if my honey didnt just have a guy up to play morleys cool i was tempted to send out for it only only what the hell was going on here i did my part i got winchell sewn up and delivered it was time to collect my reward and ride off into the sunset what was all this mess my office was clean i traded looks with eleanor that calmed me it reminded me that id gotten through bad times before that calm was my most potent weapon a little reason would help too sweetheart the small front room contained nothing but an odor cat haters know well you little shit you blew it i jammed my rain hat onto my head set course for the kitchen i banged around in there till i found the cheesecloth dean bought the time he had a bluesky idea about saving money by making his own cheese i told him did i want to cut financial corners id do without a housekeeper anyway to date we were out the cost of cheesecloth without no cheese to show i hacked off a few yards folded the cloth over my rain hat and tucked the edges under my collar front and back what in the world are you doing beekeeper trick you might want to try it yourself youre insane garrett but she followed my example she even made herself crude mittens i dug through drawers and poked into closets till i found my sulfur candles try not to breathe the fumes once i light these things theyll knock you on your ass belinda shook her head muttered obscenities but went along youre completely paranoid you know that dont you i have been ever since i found out they were out to get me anyway i couldnt stand it if you was to get butchered now youre a born romantic too thats me the man of a thousand faces all this was punctuated by repeated thumps and yells from above then the yelling stopped the silence seemed particularly ominous i think you better get on your horse garrett yeah i checked dean he was doing as well as could be hoped he had his hairball buddy to look out for him i wished we had time to send out for reinforcements but the silence upstairs told me i was all out of time white knight to the rescue well it was white back before the rust set in lets do it garrett no style this one but one hell of a set of legs i knew it i moaned it had to be something impossible there were butterflies on the second floor they were big and green and unpleasantly carnivorous but blessedly few and stupid watch those things i got a feeling if they nip at you it could spread the curse the way mosquitoes spread yellow fever people in tunfaire didnt generally know that but in the islands you learned from the natives if you were smart enough to listen when they told you something so light some candles belinda wasnt exactly supportive pushy even it wasnt time to light candles first i visited my goody closet dug out a nasty knife offered it to her whoever he is comes near you carve your initials on him with that for myself i chose a knife with a blade nearly long enough to qualify it as a shortsword i used it to point toward candys room i went first macho clown that i am and there was our interloper a monster of a man moving almost imperceptibly as he hoisted candy toward the ceiling he had rigged a block and tackle on a beam wed exposed while rehabbing he was ruled by the curse and he was going to do a girl on the spot it really is multiplying belinda whispered i kept my mouth shut my throat was too dry for chatter the man kept moving against all the dead mans power what incredible strength the curse gave why hadnt candy run out on him with the dead man slowing him down he couldnt hardly keep up with her huh belinda dont look this clown in the eye i have a feeling that if he lays the green eye on you youre a goner right she wasnt nervous not my gal belinda she was as cold as her daddy you want to do some candles before the bugs carry me off they tended to leak from the corners of the villains mouth i lighted a sulfur candle off the tallow candle belinda had thought to bring set it on the floor just inside the doorway to candys room as i set out the second candle the bad boy realized he had company gods he was huge he looked like saucerhead tharpes big brother where did winchell find him nothing that big should have been running loose he turned his head slowly why dont you stick him garrett you want to make a career of farting around dont you i do its because i have this hyperactive conscience in this case it was also because i was completely lost this wasnt suppose to be happening the girlkiller problem was supposed to have been solved at hullars place i was supposed to be in bed now if not asleep the big guy had candy hoisted up till only her head was touching the floor he let go the rope it squealed through the block down she crashed she started making noises behind her gag like she was trying out my name i really hoped she wasnt trying to relay a warning i didnt have time to fish it out of her the big guy had begun to get him a case of the green eye he was barfing butterflies most of those were green too old drachir had had a thing about green the big man was aging before my eyes hed put on a year or two in the past few minutes hed gotten shorter too though i wasnt ready to jump in for fifteen rounds he got a good look at belinda he charged like he was headed into a hundredmileanhour wind he puffed and snorted moths leaked from his nostrils they were pretty stupid moths or the curse controlling them was pretty dumb they mostly went after him i held a lighted sulfur candle in front of him he roared out butterflies that couldnt get me because of the cheesecloth he didnt seem to care though he had eyes only for belinda dont look the bastard in the eyes i reminded her sliding to one side i dropped to hands and knees scooted forward while the villain continued his glacial charge i cut the tendons behind his right knee and left ankle it took a while for his brain to get the word but he fell then he started to lift himself up again i drove my knife through his right hand pinning it to the floor belinda did his other hand you might try to get a gag on him garrett she did have the contague flair the cumulative pain and damage shocked the man enough that the curse slipped control the dead man jumped on that the villain became as rigid as stone like a far far whisper on a contrary wind came you took your sweet time i got candy loose how come you keep fooling around with these perverts i asked whats wrong with a nice straight guy like me she threw her arms around me she didnt say anything even when belinda cracked maybe she figured you were taken she just clung like she didnt plan to let go during this lifetime butterflies zoomed around drunkenly the sulfur fumes were getting to me too the bugs discovered bare areas on candy they called their friends i didnt know but what the curse could be carried by the little devils lets get out of here lock them in with the candles i considered sliding a few candles into the dead mans room while he was preoccupied just for effect belinda helped with candy though with poor grace i glanced at my unwanted guest butterflies still crawled out of his open mouth belinda said we cant leave him here why not hell croak ask me if i care think genius indeed boggle us with a first you keep out of this i grunted disgusted if the villain died id be the only place for the curse to migrate i didnt think that was such a great idea we do need to keep him unconscious he might commit suicide i had a sudden conviction that the curse had driven winchell into hullars place to provide a diversion from the attack here the dead man sent i can keep the man under control like you were doing when i got here bind him if that makes you more comfortable right i peeked inside candys room the big guys breath problem had improved the floor was covered with fallen butterflies only a few showed any life i said ive got an idea get the curse to jump to the dead man then it wouldnt then it would be able to talk to you direct miss practical i rounded up a ball of linen cord and went to work on our villain i used it all then gagged him good then i saved him from the fumes i gave belinda my nightstick bop him if he even twitches where are you going to get block to get this character out of here i didnt get that far not right away i might have known i should have expected it hell i should have counted on it it had to be in the stars it started out being about barking dog amato and no matter how i wriggled amato kept getting in the way so why on earth should i have been surprised to find barking dog camped out in my hallway with sas and dean sas looking mightily distressed while amato fussed over dean and dean groggily insisted there was nothing wrong dean was so woozy he didnt know he was hurt how do i get around this i muttered before anyone spotted me at the moment i didnt much care about barking dogs troubles garrett id been spotted dont start ive got problems of my own and its going to be real hard to give a rats ass about whatever is bugging you hey yo no problem i kind of figured youd be distracted when i saw this mess the curse managed to split somehow ive got another killer upstairs damn that put a sparkle in his eye what now im going to get captain block thats all right i understand ill hang out here keep an eye on things you dont need to go on home get some shuteye the dead man can be pretty handy when he wants i got a smug snicker from the other side of the wall and a denial from amato i wouldnt feel right garrett after everything you done for me anyway i got to talk to you about my girl this here sas aint my girl so id gathered earlier i didnt stay around to find out anything more i nurtured some small vain hope that the dead man would pity me and run him off before i got back the only good thing about finding block was i got to wake him up again i never had a big case before where i got to wake other people up it was always somebody coming around wanting me to be brighteyed at some absurd hour of the morning yes i insisted after getting through to his quarters you get off your fat political butt and come on over you can see for yourself the curse has spawned you dont grab this guy it keeps right on going like we never met anybody called winchell i guarantee you think im running around at this hour because im nursing a grudge you know me better block grunted unfortunately you cant just bring him in tomorrow im going home when i get there im handing this guy over to whoevers around if thats nobody he walks and i dont have nothing more to do with unraveling curses by oldtime lunatic wizards you really want to give me a thrill come up with some excuse for arresting barking dog amato material witness maybe hes set to drive me crazy block observed me under his brows briefly maybe wondering if he ought to jump on such a great straight line a nasty smile crawled around on his lips i said dont go getting any ideas about doing something im going to regret me forsooth maybe even more sooth than that echavar a servile type materialized as though hed been lurking outside just hoping block would holler inform relway that i need a squad to accompany me when i arrest another curse carrier or failing that a leading public nuisance i got the impression he wasnt talking about barking dog block didnt recognize the man whod invaded my place neither did his troops after checking him over and taking statements from candy and the dead man block grudgingly admitted it looks like you did the right thing garrett i always do the right thing tell it to your smelly buddy downstairs barking dog hadnt gone home the girl called sas had but only because blocks men had pried her loose from amato block and barking dog still werent wasting any love on one another block and i observed while relway and crew bagged my villain block asked you want me to vag him say what vag amato oh sorry you havent been in on discussions of the tools were getting to attack crime vagrancy laws relways idea came out of the research on those old wizards had those kinds of laws in imperial times you cant show youre gainfully employed or have money in your pocket bam you got a sudden choice of getting into a cell or getting out of town amato would be had if we went after him he never has had a job dont do that this was some scary shit since when do you go around nailing people because one of your guys has an idea since rupert liked it so much he got it decreed as law applies to anybody inside the walls race dont matter theres enough slack in the treaties to let us handle layabouts and social parasites as criminals if we treat everybody the way we treat humans nasty smile we might have us some unpleasant times ahead i hadnt a doubt that the lawandorder gang would deal with human undesirables more nastily than they would others meantime my pals crask and sadler are out at the kingpins place scheming up some special way to pay me back for whatever they think i did that irked me block and his boys were panting with law and order but crask and sadler had walked away because of their connections way it goes garrett i couldve let relway deal with them but youda bitched about that too huh crask coulda hanged hisself while he was inside out of remorse maybe he grinned remorse that was a good one somebody coulda stuck sadler tonight but if thatd happened youda pissed and moaned until we was all ready to help you swallow a chicken bone he was right morley was right i really did have to hone me up a more practical set of ethics its a proved fact fanatic adherence to ideals can be fatal in the real world especially in tunfaire where ethics and ideals are mystic words in a tongue unknown to ninetynine percent of the population i admitted he was right possibly but pretend im your conscience sometimes dont get so eager taking back the streets that you forget why we have laws in the first place thanks garrett any day now i figure to see you in a long gray robe howling on the steps of the chancery i had to get away he might brainwash me i was that tired he had me halfway gone already that was scary agreeing with the watch about anything going home wasnt much improvement i got rid of the worst of my uninvited guests but then there was still barking dog i wasnt especially kind ive been awake more hours than i know how to count during that time three different people tried to kill me maybe i exaggerated who knows what might have happened had certain parties had their way they tried to kill friends of mine the state im in im not going to listen to much complaining you got a bitch bring it around in a few days i didnt remind him that i wasnt on his payroll and he had no bitch coming so much for restraint my remarks won me all kinds of points with the ladies belinda opened her trick bag and discovered she had eleventeen varieties of hell she could give me for mistreating my elders candy got thoroughly huffy and completely forgot whod just saved her delicate posterior she took barking dog home and didnt return she is his real daughter the dead man told me i figured that out didnt even have to count on my fingers it is a long story then dont waste your time telling it im going to bed i sped belinda a meaningful look it didnt have any meaning for her she fussed over dean who had set up in the small front room again things she told him suggested she wouldnt be following through on earlier threats her mother entered a liaison with a man candy truly believed to be her father till quite recently must we now i eyed the front door the door that wasnt anymore could i trust the dead man to stay awake while i got some rest he indicated he could be trusted amidst his tearjerker story in which our beautiful young heroine overcame all obstacles to be reunited with her real father right chuckles we all saw how she was just foaming at the mouth to be reunited i figured shed be sick of him in about two days in fact she already knew enough that she hadnt wanted anything direct to do with him till tonight maybe never forever after once she got a look at the dump where he lived the dead man went on but i was stubborn i shut him out i shut out all their demands and went up to bed during the several seconds it took me to fall asleep i waxed nostalgic about the good old days when i lived alone and sometimes got to do things the way i wanted dean let me in through the new door his arm wasnt broken after all and our disaster hit the spot for a busybody like him hed had workmen in and was nagging them green as soon as the sun rose when id been able to sleep through the endoftheworld racket no longer id gotten up and gotten out pursuing the dead mans suggestion that i doublecheck on block and his boys what they did i told the dead man when i got back was stuff them in cells while they were unconscious then they bricked up the doors the cells dont have windows theres a slot in the door so food can be passed through that may be enough or a sewage chute i jumped in smugly all taken care of smiley taken care of i noticed the business about the rope belts the what rope belts all our villains wore them and then winchell turned up at hullars with his belt partly unbraided the guy that tore up our place had on what looked like it was what was missing from winchells rope i knew what was happening then the rope carries the curse you failed to mention that i snickered so i cheated a little so i wouldnt get all the glory hogged away what glory there will be none for you the public is going to believe that the triumph over the curse is all captain blocks fault he will see to it killjoy block has the ropes locked up in a box stashed inside a sealed coffin in another brickedup cell the dead man remained dubious given the ineptitude of the watch i was worried too i concealed it got some final translations on my research i was right the whole thing started over a woman they even found me a portrait of drachir who was a ringer for the old man in the coach i presume yeah you cant hold out on a determined mind reader and he wore butterfly earrings he had a strong interest in butterflies apparently and a stronger interest in outliving his rival he was stealing my thunder here id come home chockfull of news and he was stealing it out of my head or hed figured it out already yeah hed figured out how to become immortal the hard way when he set up the curse thing he put an extra twist on it so the candide woman whod spurned him would be sure to get got then he let himself get killed didnt matter to him he would come back to life through his curse except his curse always gets stopped just before it finishes recreating the man who created it you have to wonder about people like drachir who are willing to sacrifice hundreds on the off chance they might whip death for a while themselves there are people out there masquerading as human beings who never see you and me as having any more value than a beetle its a pity they arent content to devour each other i expected either prisoner to kill himself at the curses behest the dead man disagreed that would serve no purpose now suppose one of them did bite through the veins in his wrists what then not even block is stupid enough to enter the cell without a firstline wizard backing him up assuming any ever shows up indeed they may never they may never leave the cantard and meantime we got a corpse rotting someday somebody gets sick of the stink opens the cell the dead man had stopped listening vaguely he admitted there might be something to my concern but id made the mistake of nudging his thoughts toward the cantard suddenly he was preoccupied by the south thered been a flood of news id been picking it up all morning but hed gotten a big dose from saucerhead already that was my buddy tharpe rush right in with anything newsworthy if it was going to make garretts life a little more miserable i love the guy but he doesnt know from consequences if brains were glaziers putty he couldnt weatherproof a windowless room word out of the cantard made it look like we were in for a karentine triumph we could look forward to endless parades and countless mindnumbing speeches karentine losses were as heavy as id predicted but the morcartha had rewritten the cantard equation completely the venageti were done for theyd collapsed quarache was their northernmost outpost now that was so far to the south even our longrange commandos hadnt reached it till recently and glory mooncalleds republican armies while still motivated and courageous couldnt overcome the combination of numbers sorcery and vastly superior intelligence now ranged against them these days our commanders knew what the republicans planned before they started doing it didnt take any military genius to see that theyd soon be on the run and the morcartha would be employed to hunt them down hardly anyone believed the news many didnt want to believe it but it was hard to deny evidence that said three generations of warfare would end within a year that allout peace might erupt at any time and all because of some flying things that everybody considered vermin when they were visiting tunfaire goes to show you as saucerhead says you never know a real philosopher of the street saucerhead tharpe the future was becoming scary territory belinda never got the dead man down to morleys place she did manage to see all the underworld heavyweights and most of her fathers nominally legitimate associates first thing i knew she was headed home crask and sadler had slipped away from chodos place but they were still around somewhere biding their time candy faded from my life she returned to the hill probably to escape barking dog who was not welcome up there amato kept making a pest of himself wanting things from me that were beyond my capacity to provide i could not force open a door into a family that did not want to let him in i could feel sorry for the guy maybe but not much more i could continue delivering periodic reports to hullar without telling barking dog so candy could keep track but i couldnt give him what he thought he wanted i wouldnt give him candys adopted family name belinda sent a letter inviting me out i rented a buggy from playmate and dragged my bones out to see her she knew me better than i thought she waited till after playtime to roll her dad out same old chodo frisky as a wedge alert as a potato she was using him exactly the way crask and sadler had i was repelled i left as soon as i could without leaving anyone angry i was disappointed belinda was no better than the men shed ousted shed become the new kingpin by climbing over her fathers stillwarm flesh must you the dead man whined i was about to doze off about to abandon this vale of sorrow for the land of sweet dreams come on thats really laying it on thick report then get it over i need my sleep he couldnt have been too depressed regardless of the war situation he didnt threaten to close up shop for good i have suffered countless disappointments at the hands of your feckless race one more will not nudge me over the edge get on with the report i described my visit to the contague establishment most of it being a gentleman i did employ some discretion just to drive me crazy he observed it might be interesting to have mr contague visit sometime i suspect that all may not be what it seems there what do you mean by hey hed drifted off at a very fast drift and wasnt interested in awaking to explain himself leaving me hanging was the root of his plan of course no more belinda no more candy and tinnie still hadnt come around to tell me i didnt need to apologize for what i hadnt done you and me again lady i told eleanor alone at last maybe fingers crossed the dead man was really working out on his napping and there was a chance dean would be getting back out of the house for a while anyway one of his horde of ugly nieces had sold her soul or something and found a blind man to propose though im not religious i was praying no atheists on the battlefield i wanted the engagement to take i wanted dean to travel to the wedding which would take place out of town if it happened at all i would get rid of the cat i would burn a thousand sulfur candles or i might sell the place and contents and disappear before the one woke up and the other returned simplify my life move across town and change my name and get me an honest job i did learn that i have the second sight my prophecy was correct the next fad was revolution it stumbled out of the cafes and failed abysmally peopled by the very young the revolution neither asked nor accepted anything from the old and experienced and wise westman block and his secret police directed by relway sencer ate them alive the rebellion collapsed without having stirred any dust afterward block bragged that five members of the sevenman joint revolutionary direction had been relways agents need any more convincing that those fools were fools of the first water in the real world block had to pay me to save his bacon when he ran into real troubles he hasnt been around lately happily word is a whole cabal of wizards has agreed to research and unravel the candide curse and keep their eyes on one another so nobody gets any advantage from the spell just as soon as they catch glory mooncalled might be a while the dead mans hero hasnt given up neither the morcartha overhead nor the venageti proposal of an armistice has daunted him life was good life was normal i could sit back and do some serious thinking and beer tasting then morleys nephew spud showed up with the parrot supposedly a present from my legbreaker friend the parrot could talk morley figured i could use it to drive dean crazy and get rid of his cat the bird hated cats it swooped on them clawed at their ears and eyes word of advice word to the wise voice of experience dont ever bring a talking parrot within thinking range of a dead loghyr not ever
