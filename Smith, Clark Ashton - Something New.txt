something new clark ashton smith tell me something new she moaned twisting in his arms on the sofa say or do something original and ill love you anything but the wheezy gags the doddering compliments the kisses that were stale before antony passed them off on cleopatra alas he said there is nothing new in the world except the rose and gold and ivory of your perfect loveliness and there is nothing original except my love for you old stuff she sneered moving away from him they all say that they he queried jealously the ones before you of course she replied in a tone of languid reminiscence it only took four lovers to convince me of the quotidian sameness of man after that i always knew what to expect it was maddening they came to remind me of so many cuckoo docks with the eternal monotony of their advances the punctuality of their compliments i soon knew the whole repertory as for kissing each one began with my hands and ended with my lips there was one genius though who kissed me on the throat the first time i might have taken him if he had lived up to the promise of such a beginning what shall i say he queried in despair shall i tell you that your eyes are the unwaning moons above the cypressguarded lakes of dream land shall i say that your hair is colored like the sunsets of cocaigne she kicked off one of her slippers with a little jerk of disgust you arent the first poet that ive had for a lover one of them used to read me that sort of stuff by the hour all about moons and stars and sunsets and roseleaves and lotuspetals ah he cried hopefully gazing at the slipperless foot shall i stand on my head and kiss your tootywootsies she smiled briefly that wouldnt be so bad but youre not an acrobat my dear youd fall over and break something provided you didnt fall on me well i give it up he muttered in a tone of hopeless resignation ive done my darndest to please you for the past four months and ive been perfectly faithful and devoted too i havent so much as looked cornerwise at another woman not even that blueeyed brunette who tried to vamp me at the artists ball the other night she sighed impatiently what does that matter i am sure you neednt be faithful unless you want to be as for pleasing me well you did give a thrill once upon a time during the first week of our acquaintance do you remember we were lying out under the pines on the old rug that we had taken with us and you suddenly turned to me and asked me if i would like to be a hamadryad ah there is a hamadryad in every women but it takes a faun to call it forth my dear if you had only been a faun a real faun would have dragged you off by the hair he growled so you wanted some of that caveman stuff did you i suppose thats what you mean by something new anything anything providing it is new she drawled with ineffable languor looking like a poem to ennui by baudelaire she leaned back and lit another cigarette in her holder of carved ivory he look at her and wondered if any one female had ever before hidden so much perversity capriciousness and incomprehensibility behind a rosebud skin and harvestcoloured hair a sense of acute exasperation mounted in him something that had smouldered for months halfrestrained by his natural instincts of chivalry and gentleness he remembered an aphorism from nietzsche when thou goest to women take thy whip by jove the old boy had the right dope he thought too bad i didnt think to take my whip with me but after all i have my hands and a little rough stuff cant make matters any worse aloud he said its a pity no one ever thought to give you a good paddling all women are spoiled and perverse more or less but you he broke off and drew her across his knees like a naughty child with a movement so muscular and sudden that she had neither the time nor the impulse to resist or cry out im going to give you the spanking of your life he growled as his right hand rose and descended the cigarette holder fell from her lips to the turkish carpet and began to burn a hole in the flowered pattern a dozen smart blows with a sound like the clapping of shingles and then he released her and rose to his feet his anger had vanished and his only feeling was an overpowering sense of shame and consternation he could merely wonder how and why he had done it i suppose you will never forgive me he began oh you are wonderful she breathed i didnt think you had it in you my faun my caveman do it again doubly dumbfounded as he was he had enough presence of mind to adjust himself to the situation women are certainly the limit he thought dazedly but one must make the best of them and miss no chances preserving a grim and mysterious silence he picked her up in his arms
