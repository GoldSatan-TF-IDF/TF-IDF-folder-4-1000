chapter i dont want to stay here please dont leave me here evan ross tugged his mothers hand trying to pull her away from the front stoop of the small grayshingled house mrs ross turned to him an impatient frown on her face evan youre twelve years old dont act like an infant she said freeing her hand from his grasp i hate when you say that evan exclaimed angrily crossing his arms in front of his chest softening her expression she reached out and ran her hand tenderly through evans curly carrotcolored hair and i hate when you do that he cried backing away from her nearly stumbling over a broken flagstone in the walk dont touch my hair i hate it okay so you hate me his mother said with a shrug she climbed up the two steps and knocked on the front door you still have to stay here till i get back why cant i come with you evan demanded keeping his arms crossed just give me one good reason your sneaker is untied his mother replied so evan replied unhappily i like em untied youll trip she warned mom evan said rolling his eyes in exasperation have you ever seen anyone trip over his sneakers because they were untied well no his mother admitted a smile slowly forming on her pretty face you just want to change the subject evan said not smiling back youre going to leave me here for weeks with a horrible old woman and evan thats enough mrs ross snapped tossing back her straight blonde hair kathryn is not a horrible old woman shes your fathers aunt your greataunt and shes shes a total stranger evan cried he knew he was losing control but he didnt care how could his mother do this to him how could she leave him with some old lady he hadnt seen since he was two what was he supposed to do here all by himself until his mother got back evan weve discussed this a thousand times his mother said impatiently pounding on his aunts front door again this is a family emergency i really expect you to cooperate a little better her next words were drowned out by trigger evans cocker spaniel who stuck his tan head out of the back window of the rented car and began barking and howling now hes giving me a hard time too mrs ross exclaimed can i let him out evan asked eagerly i guess youd better his mother replied triggers so old we dont want him to have a heart attack in there i just hope he doesnt terrify kathryn im coming trigger evan called he jogged to the gravel driveway and pulled open the car door with an excited yip trigger leapt out and began running in wide circles around kathryns small rectangular front yard he doesnt look like hes twelve evan said watching the dog run and smiling for the first time that day see youll have trigger for company mrs ross said turning back to the front door ill be back from atlanta in no time a couple of weeks at the most im sure your dad and i can find a house in that time and then well be back before you even notice were gone yeah sure evan said sarcastically the sun dipped behind a large cloud a shadow fell over the small front yard trigger wore himself out quickly and came panting up the walk his tongue hanging nearly to the ground evan bent down and petted the dogs back he looked up at the gray house as his mother knocked on the front door again it looked dark and uninviting there were curtains drawn over the upstairs windows one of the shutters had come loose and was resting at an odd angle mom why are you knocking he asked shoving his hands into his jeans pockets you said aunt kathryn was totally deaf oh his mothers face reddened you got me so upset evan with all your complaining i completely forgot of course she cant hear us how am i going to spend two weeks with a strange old lady who cant even hear me evan wondered glumly he remembered eavesdropping on his parents two weeks earlier when they had made the plan they were seated across from each other at the kitchen table they thought evan was out in the backyard but he was in the hallway his back pressed against the wall listening his father he learned was reluctant to leave evan with kathryn shes a very stubborn old woman mr ross had said look at her deaf for twenty years and shes refused to learn sign language or to lipread hows she going to take care of evan she took good care of you when you were a boy mrs ross had argued that was thirty years ago mr ross protested well we have no choice evan heard his mother say theres no one else to leave him with everyone else is away on vacation you know august is just the worst month for you to be transferred to atlanta well excuuuuse me mr ross said sarcastically okay okay discussion closed youre absolutely right dear we have no choice kathryn it is youll drive evan there and then fly down to atlanta itll be a good experience for him evan heard his mother say he needs to learn how to get along under difficult circumstances you know moving to atlanta leaving all his friends behind that isnt going to be easy on evan either okay i said okay mr ross said impatiently its settled evan will be fine kathryn is a bit weird but shes perfectly harmless evan heard the kitchen chairs scraping across the linoleum indicating that his parents were getting up their discussion ended his fate was sealed silently he had made his way out the front door and around to the backyard to think about what he had just overheard he leaned against the trunk of the big maple tree which hid him from the house it was his favorite place to think why didnt his parents ever include him in their discussions he wondered if they were going to discuss leaving him with some old aunt hed never seen before shouldnt he at least have a say he learned all the big family news by eavesdropping from the hallway it just wasnt right evan pulled a small twig off the ground and tapped it against the broad tree trunk aunt kathryn was weird thats what his dad had said she was so weird his father didnt want to leave evan with her but they had no choice no choice maybe theyll change their minds and take me to atlanta with them evan thought maybe theyll realize they cant do this to me but now two weeks later he was standing in front of aunt kathryns gray house feeling very nervous staring at the brown suitcase filled with his belongings which stood beside his mother on the stoop theres nothing to be scared of he assured himself its only for two weeks maybe less but then the words popped out before hed even had a chance to think about them mom what if aunt kathryn is mean huh the question caught his mother by surprise mean why would she be mean evan and as she said this facing evan with her back to the house the front door was pulled open and aunt kathryn a large woman with startling black hair filled the doorway staring past his mother evan saw the knife in kathryns hand and he saw that the blade of the knife was dripping with blood chapter trigger raised his head and began to bark hopping backward on his hind legs with each bark startled evans mother spun around nearly stumbling off the small stoop evan gaped in silent horror at the knife a smile formed on kathryns face and she pushed open the screen door with her free hand she wasnt anything like evan had pictured he had pictured a small fraillooking whitehaired old lady but kathryn was a large woman very robust broadshouldered and tall she wore a peachcolored housedress and had straight black hair pulled back and tied behind her head in a long ponytail that flowed down the back of the dress she wore no makeup and her pale face seemed to disappear under the striking black hair except for her eyes which were large and round and steely blue i was slicing beef she said in a surprisingly deep voice waving the bloodstained kitchen knife she stared at evan you like beef uh yeah he managed to reply his chest still fluttery from the shock of seeing her appear with the raised knife kathryn held open the screen door but neither evan nor his mother made any move to go inside hes big kathryn said to mrs ross a big boy not like his father i used to call his father chicken because he was no bigger than a chicken she laughed as if she had cracked a funny joke mrs ross picking up evans suitcase glanced uncomfortably back at him yeah hes big she said actually evan was one of the shortest kids in his class and no matter how much he ate he remained as skinny as a spaghetti noodle as his dad liked to say you dont have to answer me kathryn said stepping aside so that mrs ross could get inside the house with the suitcase i cant hear you her voice was deep as deep as a mans and she spoke clearly without the indistinct pronunciation that some deaf people have evan followed his mother into the front hallway trigger yapping at his heels cant you get that dog quiet his mother snapped it doesnt matter she cant hear it evan replied gesturing toward his aunt who was heading to the kitchen to put down the knife kathryn returned a few seconds later her blue eyes locked on evan her lips pursed as if she were studying him so you like beef she repeated he nodded good she said her expression still serious i always fixed beef for your father but he only wanted pie what kind of pie evan asked and then blushed when he remembered kathryn couldnt hear him so hes a good boy not a troublemaker kathryn asked evans mother mrs ross nodded looking at evan where shall we put his suitcase she asked i can tell by looking hes a good boy kathryn said she reached out and grabbed evans face her big hand holding him under the chin her eyes examining him closely goodlooking boy she said giving his chin a hard squeeze he likes the girls still holding his chin she lowered her face to his youve got a girlfriend she asked her pale face right above his so close he could smell her breath which was sour evan took a step back an embarrassed grin crossing his face no not really yes kathryn cried bellowing in his ear yes i knew it she laughed heartily turning her gaze to evans mother the suitcase mrs ross asked picking up the bag he likes the girls huh kathryn repeated still chuckling i could tell just like his father his father always liked the girls evan turned desperately to his mother mom i cant stay here he said whispering even though he knew kathryn couldnt hear please dont make me hush his mother replied also whispering shell leave you alone i promise shes just trying to be friendly he likes the girls kathryn repeated leering at him with her cold blue eyes again lowering her face close to evans mom her breath smells like triggers evan exclaimed miserably evan mrs ross shouted angrily stop it i expect you to cooperate im going to bake you a pie kathryn said tugging at her black ponytail with one of her huge hands would you like to roll out the dough ill bet you would what did your father tell you about me evan she winked at mrs ross did he tell you i was a scary old witch no evan protested looking at his mother well i am kathryn declared and once again burst into her deepthroated laugh trigger took this moment to begin barking ferociously and jumping on evans greataunt she glared down at the dog her eyes narrowing her expression becoming stern look out or well put you in the pie doggie she exclaimed trigger barked even harder darting boldly toward the tall hovering woman then quickly retreating his stub of a tail whipping back and forth in a frenzy well put him in the pie wont we evan kathryn repeated putting a big hand on evans shoulder and squeezing it till evan flinched in pain mom he pleaded when his aunt finally let go and smiling made her way to the kitchen mom please its just her sense of humor evan mrs ross said uncertainly she means well really shes going to bake you a pie but i dont want pie evan wailed i dont like it here mom she hurt me she squeezed my shoulder so hard evan im sure she didnt mean to shes just trying to joke with you she wants you to like her give her a chance okay evan started to protest but thought better of it im counting on you his mother continued turning her eyes to the kitchen they could both see kathryn at the counter her broad back to them hacking away at something with the big kitchen knife but shes weird evan protested listen evan i understand how youre feeling his mother said but you wont have to spend all your time with her there are a lot of kids in this neighborhood take trigger for a walk ill bet youll make some friends your age shes an old woman evan she wont want you hanging around all the time i guess evan muttered his mother bent down suddenly and gave him a hug pressing her cheek against his the hug he knew was supposed to cheer him up but it only made him feel worse im counting on you his mother repeated in his ear evan decided to try and be braver about this ill help you carry the suitcase up to my room he said they carried it up the narrow staircase his room was actually a study the walls were lined with bookshelves filled with old hardcover books a large mahogany desk stood in the center of the room a narrow cot had been made up under the single curtained window the window faced out onto the backyard a long green rectangle with the grayshingled garage to the left a tall picket fence to the right a small fencedin area stretched across the back of the yard it looked like some sort of dog run the room smelled musty the sharp aroma of mothballs invaded evans nose trigger sneezed he rolled onto his back his legs racing in the air trigger cant stand this place either evan thought but he kept his thought to himself smiling bravely at his mother who quickly unpacked his suitcase nervously checking her watch im late dont want to miss my plane she said she gave him another hug longer this time then she took a tendollar bill from her pocketbook and stuffed it into his shirt pocket buy yourself a treat be good ill hurry back as fast as i can okay bye he said his chest feeling fluttery his throat as dry as cotton the smell of her perfume momentarily drowned out the mothballs he didnt want her to leave he had such a bad feeling youre just scared he scolded himself ill call you from atlanta she shouted as she disappeared down the stairs to say goodbye to kathryn her perfume disappeared the mothballs returned trigger uttered a low sad howl as if he knew what was happening as if he knew they were being abandoned here in this strange house with the strange old woman evan picked trigger up and nosekissed his cold black nose putting the dog back down on the worn carpet he made his way to the window he stood there for a long while one hand holding the curtains aside staring down at the small green yard trying to calm the fluttering in his chest after a few minutes he heard his mothers car back down the gravel drive then he heard it roll away when he could no longer hear it he sighed and plopped down on the cot its just you and me now trigger he said glumly trigger was busily sniffing behind the door evan stared up at the walls of old books what am i going to do here all day he asked himself propping his head in his hands no nintendo no computer he hadnt even seen a tv in his greataunts small living room what am i going to do sighing again he picked himself up and walked along the bookshelves his eyes scanning the titles there were lots of science books and textbooks he saw books on biology and astronomy ancient egypt chemistry texts and medical books several shelves were filled with dusty yellowed books maybe kathryns husband evans greatuncle had been some sort of scientist nothing here for me to read he thought glumly he pulled open the closet door oh he cried out as something leapt out at him help please help everything went black help i cant see evan screamed chapter evan staggered back in fear as the warm blackness crept over him it took him a few seconds to realize what it was his heart still thudding in his chest he reached up and pulled the screeching black cat off his face the cat dropped silently to the ground and padded to the doorway evan turned and saw kathryn standing there an amused grin on her face how long had she been standing there he wondered sarabeth how did you get in there she asked in a playfully scolding tone bending down to speak to the cat you must have given the boy a fright the cat mewed and rubbed against kathryns bare leg did sarabeth scare you kathryn asked evan still smiling that cat has a strange sense of humor shes evil pure evil she chuckled as if shed said something funny im okay evan said uncertainly watch out for sarabeth shes evil kathryn repeated bending down and picking the cat up by the scruff of the neck holding her up in the air in front of her evil evil evil seeing the cat suspended in the air trigger uttered an unhappy howl his stubby tail went into motion and he leapt up at the cat barking and yipping missed and leapt again snapping at sarabeths tail down trigger get down evan cried struggling to get out of kathryns arms the cat swiped a clawed black paw at her screeching in anger and fear trigger barked and howled as evan struggled to pull the excited cocker spaniel away evan grabbed hold of trigger as the cat swung to the floor and disappeared out the door bad dog bad dog evan whispered but he didnt really mean it he was glad trigger had scared the cat away he looked up to see kathryn still filling the doorway staring down at him sternly bring the dog she said in a low voice her eyes narrowed her pale lips pursed tightly huh evan gripped trigger in a tight hug bring the dog kathryn repeated coldly we cant have animals fighting in this house but aunt kathryn evan started to plead then remembered she couldnt hear him sarabeth is a bad one kathryn said not softening her expression we cant get her riled can we she turned and started down the stairs bring the dog evan holding trigger tightly by the shoulders with both hands evan hesitated i have to take care of the dog kathryn said sternly come evan was suddenly filled with dread what did she mean take care of the dog a picture flashed into his mind of kathryn standing at the doorway with the bloody kitchen knife in her hand bring the dog kathryn insisted evan gasped what was she going to do to trigger chapter i will take care of you doggie kathryn repeated frowning at trigger the dog whimpered in reply come evan follow me she said impatiently seeing that he had no choice evan obediently carried trigger down the stairs and followed his aunt to the backyard im prepared she said turning to make sure he was following despite her age she was at least eighty she walked with long steady strides i knew you were bringing a dog so i made sure i was prepared trigger licked evans hand as they walked across the yard to the long fencedin area at the back its a special place for your dog kathryn said reaching up to grab one end of the rope that stretched across the run attach this to the collar evan your dog will have fun here she frowned disapprovingly at trigger and there will be no problems with sarabeth evan felt very relieved that this was all kathryn wanted to do to trigger but he didnt want to leave trigger tied up in this prison in the back of the yard trigger was a house dog he wouldnt be happy by himself out here but evan knew he had no way of arguing with his aunt kathryn is smart in a way he thought bitterly as he hooked triggers collar to the rope since she wont learn sign language and wont lipread it means she gets to do whatever she wants and no one can tell her no he bent down and gave triggers warm head a pat and looked up at the old woman she had her arms crossed in front of her chest her blue eyes glowing brightly in the sunlight a cold smile of triumph on her face thats a good boy she said waiting for evan to get up before starting back to the house i knew when i looked at you come to the house evan i have cookies and milk youll enjoy them her words were kind but her voice was hard and cold trigger sent up an unhappy howl as evan followed kathryn to the house evan turned intending to go back and comfort the dog but kathryn grabbed his hand in an iron grip and staring straight ahead led him to the kitchen door the kitchen was small and cluttered and very warm kathryn motioned for him to sit at a small table against the wall the table was covered with a plastic checkered tablecloth she frowned her eyes studying him as she brought over his snack he downed the oatmeal raisin cookies and milk listening to trigger howl in the backyard oatmeal raisin wasnt his favorite but he was surprised to find that he was hungry as he gobbled them down kathryn stood at the doorway staring intently at him a stern expression on her face im going to take trigger for a walk he announced wiping the milk mustache off his upper lip with the paper napkin she had given him kathryn shrugged and wrinkled up her face oh right she cant hear me evan thought standing at the kitchen window he pointed to trigger then made a walking motion with two fingers kathryn nodded whew he thought this is going to be hard he waved goodbye and hurried to free trigger from his backyard prison a few minutes later trigger was tugging at the leash sniffing the flowers along the curb as evan made his way up the block the other houses on the street were about the same size as kathryns he saw and they all had small neatly trimmed square front yards he saw some little kids chasing each other around a birch tree and he saw a middleaged man in bright orange bathing trunks washing his car with a garden hose in his driveway but he didnt see any kids his age trigger barked at a squirrel and tugged the leash out of evans hand hey come back evan called trigger disobedient as always took off after the squirrel the squirrel wisely climbed a tree but trigger his eyesight not what it once was continued the chase running at full speed calling the dogs name evan followed him around a corner and halfway down the block before trigger finally realized he had lost the race breathing hard evan grabbed the leash handle gotcha he said he gave the leash a tug trying to lead the panting dog back to kathryns street trigger sniffing around a dark tree trunk pulled the other way evan was about to pick up the stubborn dog when he was startled by a hand grabbing his shoulder hey who are you a voice demanded chapter evan spun around to find a girl standing behind him staring at him with dark brown eyes whyd you grab my shoulder like that he asked his heart still pounding to scare you she said simply yeah well evan shrugged trigger gave a hard tug at the leash and nearly pulled him over the girl laughed she was pretty he thought she had short wavy brown hair almost black and flashing brown eyes and a playful teasing smile she was wearing an oversized yellow tshirt over black spandex leggings and bright yellow nikes so who are you she demanded again she wasnt the shy type he decided im me he said letting trigger lead him around the tree did you move into the winterhalter house she asked following him he shook his head no im just visiting she frowned in disappointment for a couple of weeks evan added im staying with my aunt actually shes my greataunt whats so great about her the girl cracked nothing evan replied without laughing for sure trigger sniffed at a bug on a fat brown leaf is that your bike evan asked pointing to the red bmx bike lying on the grass behind her yeah she replied its cool he said i have one like it i like your dog she said eyeing trigger he looks real stupid i like stupid dogs me too i guess evan laughed whats his name does he have a stupid name she bent down and tried to pet triggers back but he moved away his names trigger evan said and waited for her reaction yeah thats pretty stupid she said thoughtfully especially for a cocker spaniel thanks evan said uncertainly trigger turned to sniff the girls hands his tail wagging furiously his tongue hanging down to the ground i have a stupid name too the girl admitted she waited for evan to ask what is it he said finally andrea she said thats not a stupid name i hate it she said pulling a blade of grass off her leggings annndreeea she stretched the name out in a deep cultured voice it sounds so stuck up like i should be wearing a corduroy jumper with a prim white blouse walking a toy poodle so i make everyone call me andy hi andy evan said petting trigger my name is dont tell me she interrupted clamping a hot hand over his mouth she certainly isnt shy he thought let me guess she said is it a stupid name too yeah he nodded its evan evan stupid she laughed thats really a stupid name he felt glad that he made her laugh she was cheering him up he realized a lot of the girls back home didnt appreciate his sense of humor they thought he was silly what are you doing she asked walking trigger you know exploring the neighborhood its pretty boring she said just a lot of houses want to go into town its only a few blocks away she pointed down the street evan hesitated he hadnt told his aunt he was going into town but what the heck he thought she wouldnt care besides what could possibly happen chapter okay evan said lets check out the town i have to go to a toy store and look for a present for my cousin andy said hoisting her bike up by the handlebars how old are you evan asked tugging trigger toward the street twelve me too he said can i try your bike she shook her head as she climbed onto the narrow seat no but ill let you run alongside she laughed youre a riot he said sarcastically hurrying to keep up as she began to pedal and youre stupid she called back playfully hey annnndreeeea wait up he called stretching the name out to annoy her a few blocks later the houses ended and they entered town a threeblock stretch of low twostory shops and offices evan saw a small brick post office a barbershop with an oldfashioned barber pole out front a grocery a drivethrough bank and a hardware store with a large sign in the window proclaiming a sale on birdseed the toy store is in the next block andy said walking her bike along the sidewalk evan tugged triggers leash encouraging him to keep up the pace actually there are two toy stores an old one and a new one i like the old one best lets check it out evan said examining the cluttered window display of the video store on the corner i wonder if aunt kathryn has a vcr he thought he quickly dismissed the idea no way the toy store was in an old clapboard building that hadnt been painted in many years a small handpainted sign in the dustsmeared window proclaimed wagners novelties sundries there were no toys on display andy leaned her bike against the front of the building sometimes the owner can be a little mean i dont know if hell let you bring your dog in well lets give it a try evan said pulling open the door tugging hard on his leash trigger led the way into the store evan found himself in a dark lowceilinged narrow room it took awhile for his eyes to adjust to the dim light wagners looked more like a warehouse than a store there were floortoceiling shelves against both walls jammed with boxes of toys and a long display counter that ran through the center of the store leaving narrow aisles that even someone as skinny as evan had to squeeze through at the front of the store slumped on a tall stool behind an oldfashioned wooden cash register sat a grumpylooking man with a single tuft of white hair in the center of a red bald head he had a drooping white mustache that seemed to frown at evan and andy as they entered hi andy said timidly giving the man a wave he grunted in reply and turned back to the newspaper he was reading trigger sniffed the low shelves excitedly evan looked around at the stacks of toys it appeared from the thick layer of dust that theyd been sitting there for a hundred years everything seemed tossed together dolls next to building sets art supplies mixed in with old action figures evan didnt even recognize a toy drum set underneath a pile of footballs he and andy were the only customers in the store do they have nintendo games evan asked her whispering afraid to break the still silence i dont think so andy whispered back ill ask she shouted up to the front do you have nintendo games it took awhile for the man to answer he scratched his ear dont carry them he grunted finally sounding annoyed by the interruption andy and evan wandered toward the back of the store why do you like this place evan whispered picking up an old cap pistol with a cowboy holster i just think its neat andy replied you can find some real treasures here its not like other toy stores thats for sure evan said sarcastically hey look he picked up a lunchbox with a cowboy dressed in black emblazoned on its side hopalong cassidy he read whos hopalong cassidy a cowboy with a stupid name andy said taking the old lunchbox from him and examining it look its made of metal not plastic wonder if my cousin would like it he likes stupid names too its a pretty weird present evan said hes a pretty weird cousin andy cracked hey look at this she set down the old lunchbox and picked up an enormous box its a magic set astound your friends perform one hundred amazing tricks she read thats a lot of amazing tricks evan said he wandered farther back into the dimly lit store trigger leading the way sniffing furiously hey to evans surprise a narrow doorway led into a small back room this room evan saw was even darker and dustier stepping inside he saw wornlooking stuffed animals tossed into cartons games in faded yellowed boxes baseball gloves with the leather worn thin and cracked who would want this junk he thought he was about to leave when something caught his eye it was a blue can about the size of a can of soup he picked it up surprised by how heavy it was bringing it close to his face to examine it in the dim light he read the faded label monster blood below that in smaller type it read surprising miracle substance hey this looks cool he thought turning the can around in his hand he suddenly remembered the ten dollars his mother had stuffed into his shirt pocket he turned to see the store owner standing in the doorway his dark eyes wide with anger what are you doing back here he bellowed chapter trigger yipped loudly startled by the mans booming voice evan gripped the leash pulled trigger close uh how much is this he asked holding up the can of monster blood not for sale the owner said lowering his voice his mustache seeming to frown unpleasantly with the rest of his face huh it was on the shelf here evan said pointing its too old the man insisted probably no good anymore well ill take it anyway evan said can i have it for less since its so old what is it andy asked appearing in the doorway i dont know evan told her it looks cool its called monster blood its not for sale the man insisted andy pushed past him and took the can from evans hand ooh i want one too she said turning the can around in her hand theres only one evan told her you sure she began searching the shelves its no good im telling you the owner insisted sounding exasperated i need one too andy said to evan sorry evan replied taking the can back i saw it first ill buy it from you andy said why dont you two share it the owner suggested you mean youll sell it to us evan asked eagerly the man shrugged and scratched his ear how much evan asked you sure you dont have another one andy demanded going back to the shelf pushing a pile of stuffed pandas out of her way or maybe two i could keep one and give one to my cousin two dollars i guess the man told evan but im telling you its no good its too old i dont care evan said reaching into his shirt pocket for the tendollar bill well dont bring it back to me complaining the man said grumpily and headed toward the cash register at the front of the store a few minutes later evan walked out into the bright daylight carrying the blue can trigger panted excitedly wagging his stubby tail pleased to be out of the dark dusty store andy followed them out an unhappy expression on her face you didnt buy the lunchbox evan asked dont change the subject she snapped ill pay you five dollars for it she reached for the can of monster blood no way evan replied he laughed you really like to get your way dont you im an only child she said what can i tell you im spoiled me too evan said i have an idea andy said pulling her bike off the storefront wall lets share it share it evan said shaking his head for sure ill share it the way you shared your bike you want to ride the bike home here she shoved it at him no way he said pushing it back toward her i wouldnt ride your stupid bike now its a girls bike anyway it is not she insisted how is it a girls bike evan ignored the question and pulling at triggers leash to keep the old dog moving started walking back toward his aunts how is it a girls bike andy repeated walking the bike beside him tell you what evan said lets go back to my aunts house and open up the can ill let you mess with it for a while gee swell andy said sarcastically youre a great guy evan i know he said grinning kathryn was seated in the big armchair in the living room when evan and andy arrived who is she talking to he wondered hearing her voice she seemed to be arguing excitedly with someone leading andy into the room evan saw that it was just sarabeth the black cat as evan entered the cat turned and haughtily walked out of the room kathryn stared at evan and andy a look of surprise on her face this is andy evan said gesturing to his new friend what have you got there kathryn asked ignoring andy and reaching a large hand out for the blue can of monster blood evan reluctantly handed it to her frowning she rolled it around in her hand stopping to read the label moving her lips as she read she held the can for the longest time seeming to study it carefully then finally handed it back to evan as evan took it back and started to his room with andy he heard kathryn say something to him in a low whisper he couldnt quite hear what she had said it sounded like be careful but he wasnt sure he turned to see sarabeth staring at him from the doorway her yellow eyes glowing in the dim light my aunt is completely deaf evan explained to andy as they climbed the stairs does that mean you can play your stereo as loud as you want andy asked i dont think aunt kathryn has a stereo evan said thats too bad andy said walking around evans room pulling back the window curtains and looking down on trigger huddled unhappily in his pen is she really your greataunt andy asked she doesnt look very old its the black hair evan replied setting the can of monster blood on the desk in the center of the room it makes her look young hey look at all these old books on magic stuff andy exclaimed i wonder why your aunt has all these she pulled one of the heavy old volumes from the shelf and blew away a layer of dust from the top maybe your aunt plans to come up here and cast a spell on you while youre sleeping and turn you into a newt maybe evan replied grinning what is a newt anyway andy shrugged some kind of lizard i think she flipped through the yellowed pages of the old book i thought you said there was nothing to do here she told evan you could read all these cool books thrills and chills evan said sarcastically replacing the book on the shelf andy came over to the desk and stood next to evan her eyes on the can of monster blood open it up its so old its probably all disgusting and rotten i hope so evan said he picked up the can and studied it no instructions just pull the top off she said impatiently he tugged at it it wouldnt budge maybe you need a can opener or something she said very helpful he muttered studying the label again look at this no instructions no ingredients nothing of course not its monster blood she exclaimed imitating count dracula she grabbed evans neck and pretended to strangle him he laughed stop youre not helping he slammed the can down on the desktop and the lid popped off hey look he cried she let go of his neck and they both peered inside the can chapter the substance inside the can was bright green it shimmered like jello in the light from the ceiling fixture touch it andy said but before evan had a chance she reached a finger in and poked it its cold she said touch it its really cold evan poked it with his finger it was cold thicker than jello heavier he pushed his finger beneath the surface when he pulled his finger out it made a loud sucking noise gross andy said evan shrugged ive seen worse ill bet it glows in the dark andy said hurrying over to the light switch by the door it looks like the green that glows in the dark she turned off the ceiling light but late afternoon sunlight still poured in through the window curtains try the closet she instructed excitedly evan carried the can into the closet andy followed and closed the door yuck mothballs she cried i cant breathe the monster blood definitely glowed in the dark a circular ray of green light seemed to shine from the can wow thats way cool andy said holding her nose to keep out the pungent aroma of the mothballs ive had other stuff that did this evan said more than a little disappointed it was called alien stuff or yucky glop something like that well if you dont want it ill take it andy replied i didnt say i didnt want it evan said quickly lets get out of here andy begged evan pushed open the door and they rushed out of the closet slamming the door shut behind them both of them sucked in fresh air for a few seconds whew i hate that smell evan declared he looked around to see that andy had taken a handful of monster blood from the can she squeezed it in her palm it feels even colder outside the can she said grinning at him look when you squeeze it flat it pops right back yeah it probably bounces too evan said unimpressed try bouncing it against the floor all those things bounce like rubber andy rolled the glob of monster blood into a ball and dropped it to the floor it bounced back up into her hand she bounced it a little harder this time it rebounded against the wall and went flying out the bedroom door it bounces really well she said chasing it out into the hall lets see if it stretches she grabbed it with both hands and pulled stretching it into a long string yep it stretches too big deal evan said the stuff i had before bounced and stretched really well too i thought this stuff was going to be different it stays cold even after its been in your hand andy said returning to the room evan glanced at the wall and noticed a dark round stain by the floorboard uhoh look andy that stuff stains lets take it outside and toss it around she suggested okay he agreed well go out back that way trigger wont be so lonely evan held out the can and andy replaced the ball of monster blood then they headed downstairs and out to the backyard where they were greeted by trigger who acted as if theyd been away for at least twenty years the dog finally calmed down and sat down in the shade of a tree panting noisily good boy evan said softly take it easy take it easy old fella andy reached into the can and pulled out a green glob then evan did the same they rolled the stuff in their hands until they had two ballshaped globs then they began to play catch with them its amazing how they dont lose their shape andy said tossing a green ball high in the air evan shielded his eyes from the late afternoon sun and caught the ball with one hand all this stuff is the same he said it isnt so special well i think its cool andy said defensively evans next toss was too high the green ball of gunk sailed over andys outstretched hands whoa andy cried sorry evan called they both stared as the ball bounced once twice then landed right in front of trigger startled the dog jumped to his feet and lowered his nose to sniff it no boy evan called leave it alone leave it alone boy as disobedient as ever trigger lowered his head and licked the glowing green ball no boy drop drop evan called alarmed he and andy both lunged toward the dog but they were too slow trigger picked up the ball of monster blood in his teeth and began chewing it no trigger evan shouted dont swallow it dont swallow trigger swallowed it oh no andy cried bailing her hands into fists at her sides now there isnt enough left for us to share but that wasnt what was troubling evan he bent down and pried apart the dogs jaws the green blob was gone swallowed stupid dog evan said softly releasing the dogs mouth he shook his head as troubling thoughts poured into his mind what if the stuff makes trigger sick evan wondered what if the stuff is poison chapter are we going to bake that pie today evan asked his aunt writing the question on a pad of lined yellow paper he had found on the desk in his room kathryn read the question while adjusting her black ponytail her face was as white as cake flour in the morning sunlight filtering through the kitchen window pie what pie she replied coldly evans mouth dropped open he decided not to remind her go play with your friends kathryn said still coldly petting sarabeths head as the black cat walked by the breakfast table why do you want to stay inside with an old witch it was three days later evan had tried to be friendly with his aunt but the more he tried the colder she had become shes mean shes really mean he thought as he ate the last spoonful of cereal from his bowl of shredded wheat that was the only cereal she had evan struggled to choke it down every morning even with milk the cereal was so dry and she wouldnt even let him put sugar on it looks like it might rain kathryn said and took a long sip of the strong tea she had brewed her teeth clicked noisily as she drank evan turned his eyes to the bright sunlight outside the window what made her think it was going to rain he glanced back at her seated across from him at the small kitchen table for the first time he noticed the pendant around her neck it was creamcolored and sort of boneshaped it is a bone evan decided he stared hard at it trying to decide if it was a real bone from some animal maybe or a bone carved out of ivory catching his stare kathryn reached up with a large hand and tucked the pendant inside her blouse go see your girlfriend shes a pretty one kathryn said she took another long sip of tea again clicking her teeth as she swallowed yes ive got to get out of here evan thought he pushed his chair back stood up and carried his bowl to the sink i cant take much more of this evan thought miserably she hates me she really does he hurried up the stairs to his room where he brushed his curly red hair staring into the mirror he thought of the call he had received from his mother the night before she had called right after dinner and he could tell immediately from her voice that things werent going well down in atlanta hows it going mom he had asked so happy to hear her voice even though she was nearly a thousand miles away slowly his mother had replied hesitantly what do you mean hows dad did you find a house the questions seemed to pour out of him like air escaping a balloon whoa slow down mrs ross had replied she sounded tired were both fine but its taking a little longer to find a house than we thought we just havent found anything we like does that mean evan started we found one really nice house very big very pretty his mother interrupted but the school youd go to wasnt very good oh thats okay i dont have to go to school evan joked he could hear his father saying something in the background his mother covered the receiver to reply when are you coming to pick me up evan asked eagerly it took his mother awhile to answer well thats the problem she said finally we may need a few more days down here than we thought hows it going up there evan are you okay hearing the bad news that hed have to stay even longer with kathryn had made evan feel like screaming and kicking the wall but he didnt want to upset his mother he told her he was fine and that hed made a new friend his father had taken the phone and offered a few encouraging words hang in there he had said just before ending the conversation im hanging in evan had thought glumly but hearing his parents voices had made him even more homesick now it was the next morning putting down his hairbrush he examined himself quickly in his dresser mirror he was wearing denim cutoffs and a red gap tshirt downstairs he hurried through the kitchen where kathryn appeared to be arguing with sarabeth ran out the back door then jogged to the backyard to get trigger hey trigger but the dog was asleep lying on his side in the center of his run gently snoring dont you want to go to andys house evan asked quietly trigger stirred but didnt open his eyes okay see you later evan said he made sure triggers water bowl was filled then headed to the front of the house he was halfway down the next block walking slowly thinking about his parents so far away in atlanta when a boys voice called hey you and two boys stepped onto the sidewalk in front of him blocking his way startled evan stared from one boy to the other they were twins identical twins both were big beefy guys with short whiteblond hair and round red faces they were both wearing dark tshirts with the names of heavymetal bands on the front baggy shorts and hightop sneakers untied without socks evan guessed they were about fourteen or fifteen who are you one of them asked menacingly narrowing his pale gray eyes trying to act tough both twins moved closer forcing evan to take a big step back these guys are twice my size evan realized feeling a wave of fear sweep over him are they just acting tough or do they really mean to give me trouble i im staying with my aunt he stammered shoving his hands into his pockets and taking another step back the twins flashed each other quick grins you cant walk on this block one of them said hovering over evan yeah youre not a resident the other added thats a big word evan cracked then immediately wished he hadnt said it why cant i ever keep my big mouth shut he asked himself his eyes surveyed the neighborhood searching for someone who might come to his aid in case the twins decided to get rough but there was no one in sight front doors were closed yards were empty way down the block he could see a mailman heading the other way too far away to shout to no one around no one to help him and the two boys their faces set their eyes still menacing began to move in on him chapter where do you think youre going one of the twins asked his hands were balled into fists at his sides he stepped closer until he was just an inch or two from evan forcing evan to take a few steps back to see a friend evan replied uncertainly maybe these guys were just bluffing not allowed the twin said quickly grinning at his brother they both snickered and moved toward evan forcing him to back off the curb onto the street youre not a resident the other one repeated he narrowed his eyes trying to look tough hey give me a break guys evan said he tried moving to the side walking on the street to get around them but they both moved quickly to keep him from getting away maybe you could pay a toll one of them said yeah the other one quickly chimed in you could pay the nonresident toll you know to get temporary permission for walking on this block i dont have any money evan said feeling his fear grow he suddenly remembered he had eight dollars in his pocket were they going to rob him would they beat him up and then rob him you have to pay the toll one of them said leering at him lets just see what youve got they both moved quickly forward making a grab for him he backed away his legs suddenly felt heavy from fear suddenly a voice cried out from down the sidewalk hey whats going on evan raised his eyes past the two hulking boys to see andy speeding toward them on her bike along the curb evan hi she called the twins turned away from evan to greet the new arrival hi andy one of them said in a mocking tone hows it going andy the other one asked imitating his brother andy braked her bike and dropped both feet to the ground she was wearing bright pink shorts and a yellow sleeveless undershirt top her face was red her forehead beaded with perspiration from pedaling so hard you two she said and made an unpleasant face rick and tony she turned to evan were they getting on your case well evan started hesitantly we were welcoming him to the neighborhood the one named rick said grinning at his brother tony started to add something but andy interrupted well leave him alone are you his mother tony asked snickering he turned to evan and made googoo baby noises well leave him alone rick said stepping toward andy well borrow your bike and leave him alone no way andy said heatedly but before andy could move rick grabbed the handlebars let go andy cried trying to pull the bike from his grasp rick held tight tony shoved andy hard she lost her balance and fell and the bike toppled over on top of her ohhh andy uttered a low cry as she hit her head on the concrete curb she lay sprawled on the curb her hands flailing the bike on top of her before she could get up tony reached down and grabbed the bike away he swung his legs over the seat and began to pedal furiously wait up his brother called laughing as he ran alongside in seconds the twins had disappeared around the corner with andys bike andy are you okay evan cried hurrying to the curb are you okay he grabbed andys hand and pulled her to her feet she stood up groggily rubbing the back of her head i hate those creeps she said she brushed the dirt and grass off her shorts and legs ow that hurt who are they evan asked the beymer twins she answered making a disgusted face real heavyduty dudes she added sarcastically she checked her leg to see if it was cut it was just scraped they think theyre so cool but theyre total creeps what about your bike should we call the police or something evan asked no need she said quietly brushing back her dark hair ill get it back theyve done this before theyll leave it somewhere when theyre finished but shouldnt we evan started they just run wild andy interrupted theres no one home to check up on them they live with their grandmother but shes never around did they give you a hard time evan nodded i was afraid i was going to have to pound them he joked andy didnt laugh id like to pound them she said angrily just once id like to pay them back they pick on all the kids in the neighborhood they think they can do whatever they want because theyre so big and because there are two of them your knee is cut evan said pointing id better go home and clean it up she replied rolling her eyes disgustedly see you later okay i have to go somewhere this afternoon but maybe we can do something tomorrow she headed back to her house rubbing the back of her head evan returned to kathryns walking slowly thinking about the beymer twins daydreaming about fighting them imagining himself beating them to a pulp in a fight as andy watched cheering him on kathryn was dusting the front room as evan entered she didnt look up he headed quickly up the stairs to his room now what am i going to do he wondered pacing back and forth the blue container of monster blood caught his eye he walked over to the bookshelf and picked up the can from the middle shelf he pulled off the lid the can was nearly full i guess trigger didnt eat that much he thought feeling a little relieved trigger hed forgotten all about him the poor dog must be hungry putting down the monster blood evan bombed down the stairs leaning against the banister and taking the stairs three at a time then running fullout he practically flew to the dog run at the back of the yard trigger hey trigger he called halfway across the backyard evan could see that something was wrong triggers eyes were bulging his mouth was wide open his tongue flailing rapidly from side to side white spittle running down his chin hair onto the ground trigger the dog was gasping hoarsely each breath a desperate difficult struggle hes choking evan realized as evan reached the dog run triggers eyes rolled back and the dogs legs collapsed under him his stomach still heaving the air filled with his loud hideous gasps chapter trigger no evan dived to his knees beside the dog and began to tug at triggers collar the collar evan saw had become way too tight the dogs chest heaved thick white spittle flowed from his open mouth hold on boy hold on evan cried the dogs eyes rolled wildly in his head he didnt seem to see or hear evan hold on fella just hold on the collar wouldnt budge it was buried tightly under the dogs fur his hands shaking evan struggled to pull the collar over triggers head come loose come loose come loose he begged yes trigger uttered a pained whimper as evan finally managed to pull the collar away trigger its off are you okay still panting hard the dog jumped immediately to his feet he licked evans face appreciatively covering evans cheek with his thick saliva whimpering as if he understood that evan had just saved his life easy boy easy fella evan repeated but the dog continued to lick him gratefully evan hugged the excited dog this had been a close call he knew if he hadnt come along just then well he didnt want to think about it when trigger finally calmed down evan examined the collar what made this collar shrink like that boy he asked trigger the dog had walked over to the fence and was frantically slurping water from his bowl this is plain weird evan thought the collar couldnt have shrunk its made of leather there was no reason for it to shrink then why did it suddenly start choking trigger evan turned to trigger studying him as the dog lapped greedily at the water breathing hard he turned and glanced back at evan for a second then returned to his frantic water slurping hes bigger evan decided hes definitely bigger but trigger was twelve years old eightyfour in human years older than aunt kathryn trigger was too old for a late growth spurt it must be my eyes evan decided tossing the collar to the ground this place must be making me see things kathryn was at the kitchen door calling evan to lunch he poured out a bowl of dry food shouted goodbye to trigger who didnt look up from the water dish and hurried to the house the next morning an overcast morning with an autumn chill in the air evan made his way to andys house he found her huddled under a big maple tree in the neighbors front yard whats going on he called then he saw that she was leaning over something her hands working quickly come help me she cried not looking up evan came jogging over whoa he cried out when he saw that andy was struggling to free a calico cat that had been tied to the tree trunk the cat screeched and swiped its paw at andy andy dodged the claws and continued to pull at the big knots in the rope the beymer twins did this i know it she said loudly over the shrilly protesting cat this poor cat was probably tied up here all night the cat in a panic shrieked with amazingly humansounding cries stand still cat evan said as the terrified cat swiped its claws at andy again can i help no ive almost got it she replied tugging at the knot id like to tie rick and tony to this tree poor frightened cat evan said quietly there andy said triumphantly pulling the rope loose the cat gave one last cry of protest its tail standing straight up then it darted away running at full speed and disappeared under a tall hedge without looking back not very polite evan muttered andy stood up and sighed she was wearing faded denim jeans and a pale green oversized tshirt that came down nearly to her knees she lifted the bottom of the shirt to examine a hole the cat had managed to snag in it i cant believe those two creeps she said shaking her head maybe we should call the police or the aspca or something evan suggested the twins would just deny it andy said glumly shaking her head then she added and the cats not a very good witness they both laughed evan led the way back to his aunts house all the way back they talked about how theyd like to teach the beymer twins a lesson but neither of them had any good ideas they found kathryn concentrating on a jigsaw puzzle at the dining room table she looked up when they entered squinting at them you like jigsaw puzzles i like to keep my mind active you know thats why i like puzzles your mind can get flabby when you get to be my age a hundred and twelve she slapped the table gleefully at her own wit evan and andy both flashed her agreeable smiles then she returned to her puzzle without waiting for a reply shes going to drive me bananas evan exclaimed evan shell hear you andy protested cupping a hand over his mouth i told you shes completely deaf she cant hear me she doesnt want to hear anyone she hates everyone i think shes sweet andy said why does she wear a bone around her neck probably thinks its cool evan cracked lets go upstairs andy urged pushing him toward the stairs i still feel weird talking about your aunt right in front of her youre a crazy old coot evan called to kathryn a big smile on his face kathryn looked up from her puzzle pieces to cast a cold stare his way she heard you andy cried horrified dont be dumb evan said and started up the stairs nearly tripping over sarabeth up in evans room andy paced uncomfortably what do you want to do well we could read some of these great books evan said sarcastically pointing to the dusty old books that lined the walls maybe find a spell to cast on the beymer twins you know turn them into newts forget about newts andy said dryly hey wheres the monster blood before evan could answer she spotted it on one of the shelves they raced across the room for it andy got there first and grabbed the can evan look she said her eyes growing wide with surprise whats going on she held up the can the green gunk had pushed up the lid and was flowing up out of the can chapter huh did the top break or something evan asked he took the can from her and examined it sure enough the lid had popped off the gooey green substance was pushing up out of the can evan pulled out a handful of the green gunk weird he exclaimed its expanding he said squeezing it in his hand its definitely growing i guess so andy exclaimed it grew right out of the can hey its not cold anymore evan said he balled it up and tossed it to andy its really warm she agreed weird she tried to toss it back to him but it stuck to her palm its getting sticky she reported are you sure this is the same stuff of course evan replied but it wasnt sticky before remember she said he pulled another warm hunk of it from the can i guess it just changes after the can has been opened he squeezed the stuff into a ball shape and tossed it to the floor look it stuck to the floor it didnt bounce weird andy repeated maybe i should throw it in the trash evan said prying the sticky glob from the floor i mean what good is it if it doesnt bounce hey no way andy said weve got to see what it does next a soft mewing sound made them both turn toward the door evan was surprised to see sarabeth standing there her head cocked her yellow eyes staring at him or was she staring at the glob of monster blood in his hand that cat looks so intelligent andy said its as stupid as every other cat evan muttered look she wants to play ball with the monster blood sorry cat andy said it doesnt bounce as if she understood sarabeth mewed unhappily turned and padded silently from the room now where am i going to keep this stuff evan asked its too big for its can here how about this andy asked she reached down to a low shelf and came up with an empty coffee can yeah okay evan tossed his hunk into the coffee can andy squeezed hers into a flat pancake look it isnt glowing the way it used to either she said holding the pancake up for evan to see but it sure is warm almost hot its alive evan screamed playfully run for your life its alive andy laughed and began to chase evan menacing him with the flat green pancake come get your monster blood come and get it he dodged away then grabbed it from her hand he squeezed it together balling it up in one hand then tossed it into the coffee can they both peered into the can the green substance filled it up a little more than halfway go ahead taste it andy urged poking the can in his face i dare you huh no way i doubledare you evan said pushing the coffee can back to her doubledarers have to go first andy insisted grinning go ahead taste it evan made a disgusted face and shook his head then he grabbed a big hunk of it and heaved it at andy laughing she picked it up off the carpet and tossed it at his face she threw high and the green glob stuck to the wall evan reached for another hunk they had a messy hilarious monster blood battle till dinnertime then as they tried to clean up they both heard trigger through the open window he was barking loudly out in his pen evan reached the window first the sky was still gray and overcast trigger was leaning on the wooden fence standing on his hind legs barking his head off whoa trigger evan called chill out hey whats with trigger andy asked is your dog still growing he looks so big evans mouth dropped open and he uttered a silent gasp realizing that andy was right trigger had nearly doubled in size chapter trigger come back come back the big dog continued to run its giant paws thundering against the concrete come back evan screamed running with long desperate strides his heart thudding his legs aching with each step as he tried to catch up with the galloping dog the night was dark and starless the street glistened as if it had recently rained triggers paws hit the pavement each step a loud thunderclap that seemed to echo forever his giant ears flapped like wings twin pennants caught on the wind his big head bobbed up and down but he didnt look back trigger trigger evans voice seemed muffled by the gusting wind pushed back in his face he tried shouting louder but no sound came out at all he knew he had to stop the dog from running away he had to catch the dog and then get help trigger was growing so fast completely out of control he was already the size of a pony and getting larger by the minute trigger trigger stop boy trigger didnt seem to hear him evans voice didnt seem to carry beyond the gusting swirling wind and still evan ran his chest pounding every muscle aching and as he ran he suddenly realized there were others running too two large figures in front of the stampeding dog two large figures evan recognized as they fled at full speed trying to get away from the onrushing animal the beymer twins rick and tony trigger was chasing them evan suddenly realized the boys turned a corner onto an even darker street trigger followed bounding after them evan continued to run bringing up the rear of this dark mysterious parade all was silent now except for the steady rhythmic thunder of triggers enormous padded paws except for the clapclapclap of the beymer twins sneakers as they darted along the glistening pavement except for the gasp of evans breathing as he struggled to keep up suddenly as evan watched in horror the dog raised up on his hind legs he tilted his head to the sky and let out an earpiercing howl not the howl of a dog a creature howl and then triggers features began to transform his forehead burst forward and enlarged his eyes grew wide and round before sinking under the protruding forehead fangs slid from his gaping mouth and he uttered another howl to the sky louder and more chilling than the first hes a monster a monster evan cried and woke up woke up from his frightening dream and realized he was in bed in the study upstairs in kathryns house it had all been a dream a frightening wild chase of a dream a harmless dream except that something still wasnt right the bed it felt so uncomfortable so cramped evan sat up alert wide awake now and stared down at his giant feet his giant hands and realized how tiny the bed seemed beneath him because he was a giant now because he had grown so huge so monstrously huge and when he saw how big he had become he opened his mouth wide and began to scream chapter his screams woke him up this time he really woke up and realized that the first time he had only dreamed that he was awake had only dreamed that he had become a giant dreams upon dreams was he really awake now he sat up blinked rubbed his eyes struggled to focus dripping with sweat his blankets tossed to the floor his pajamas damp clinging to his prickly skin nothing seemed familiar it took awhile to shake off the dream to remember where he was that he was in his room at kathryns awake now his normal size tossed by the wind the curtains brushed over him then were noisily sucked out the window evan sat up and still feeling shaky peered out the window wisps of gray clouds floated over a pale halfmoon trees tossed and whispered in the cool night wind only a dream a frightening dream a dream on top of a dream he could see trigger sound asleep curled up on himself pressed against the fence wall trigger wasnt a monster but he was definitely bigger evan saw maybe theres something wrong with him the troubling thought pushed its way into evans mind as he stared down at the sleeping dog maybe its glands or something maybe hes eating too much or maybe evan yawned he realized he was too sleepy to think clearly maybe the next morning hed see if there was a vet in town yawning again he started to settle back into bed but something caught his eye the coffee can on the bookshelf the can where he had stored the monster blood hey he cried aloud the green gunk was bubbling quivering up over the top of the coffee can chapter your dog seems to be quite healthy for his age dr forrest scratched trigger gently under the chin look at all the white hairs he said bringing his face down close to the dogs youre a good old dog arent you trigger licked the doctors hand appreciatively dr forrest grinned pushing his black eyeglasses up on his narrow nose the ceiling light reflecting off his shiny forehead he wiped his hand on the front of his white lab coat evan and andy stood across from trigger in the small brightly lit office they had both been tense during the long examination the vet had given the dog but now hearing the doctors verdict they had relaxed expressions on their faces so you think its just a late growth spurt evan repeated dr forrest nodded returning to his desk in the corner highly unusual he said softly leaning over the desk to write a note on a pad highly unusual well get a lab report in three or four days it may tell us more but the dog seems very healthy to me i really wouldnt be alarmed but do cocker spaniels usually get this big evan asked leaning down to scratch trigger under the chin the leash looped loosely in his hand trigger wanted to leave he pulled toward the door evan stood up and tugged hard at the leash to keep the dog in place it took all of his strength trigger was not only bigger he was much stronger than he had been a few days before no not usually the vet replied thats why i took the hormone tests and the blood and glandular samples maybe the lab will have an answer for us he finished writing and tore the sheet off the pad here he said handing the paper to evan i wrote down the name of a good dog food put trigger on this and see that he cuts down on his betweenmeal snacks he chuckled at his own joke evan thanked the doctor and allowed trigger to pull him out of the office andy jogged after them in the waiting room outside a tiny chihuahua cowered behind the couch whimpering at the sight of the big cocker spaniel im glad to he out of there evan exclaimed as they stepped out to the sidewalk trigger got a very good report andy said reassuringly petting triggers head hey look his head is wider than my hand hes nearly as big as a sheepdog evan said miserably and dr forrest says hes perfectly okay dont exaggerate andy scolded she glanced at her watch oh no i dont believe it late for my piano lesson again momll kill me she waved goodbye turned and ran full speed down the sidewalk nearly colliding with an elderly couple coming slowly out of the small grocery store on the corner lets go boy evan said thinking about what dr forrest had said tugging the leash he headed out of the small threeblock town despite the vets assurances evan was still plenty worried about trigger he stopped outside the grocery maybe an ice cream pop will help cheer me up he tied triggers leash to the red fire hydrant across from the grocerys door stay he instructed trigger ignoring evan struggled to pull free ill only be a second evan said and hurried into the store there were three or four people in the store and it took a bit longer than evan had expected when he returned to the sidewalk ten minutes later he discovered the beymer twins busily untying trigger hey let go he cried angrily they both turned toward him identical grins on their beefy faces look what we found one of them teased the other one successfully untied the leash from the hydrant hand me that evan insisted holding his chocolate ice cream bar in one hand reaching for the leash handle with the other the beymer twin held the leash handle out to evan then quickly snapped it back out of his reach gotcha the brothers laughed gleefully and slapped each other a high five stop fooling around evan insisted hand me the leash finders keepers one of them said isnt that right tony yeah tony replied grinning its an ugly dog but its our ugly dog now get your own dog wimp rick said nastily he stepped forward and punched the ice cream bar out of evans hand it landed on the sidewalk with a plop the brothers started to laugh but their laughter was cut short as trigger suddenly uttered a low warning growl pulling back his lips he bared his teeth and his growl became a snarl hey rick cried dropping the leash with a loud angry roar trigger reared up and pounced on rick forcing him to stagger backward to the curb tony had already started to run his sneakers pounding the pavement noisily as he headed at full speed past the vets office past the post office and kept going wait up hey tony wait up rick stumbled stood up and took off after his brother evan grabbed for triggers leash and missed trigger whoa stop the dog took off after the fleeing twins barking angrily his enormous paws thudding loudly on the pavement picking up speed as he closed in on them no evan thought finding himself frozen there on the corner in front of the grocery no no no this cant be happening its my dream is it coming true evan shuddered remembering the rest of his dream remembering how he too grew until he was twice his size would that part of the dream also come true chapter that afternoon about an hour before dinnertime evan called andy can i come over he asked i have a small problem sounds like a big problem andy said yeah okay a big problem evan snapped impatiently im not in the mood to kid around okay okay sorry andy replied quickly any sign of rick and tony theyre not your problem are they not at the moment he told her i told you they were gone by the time i caught up with trigger disappeared vanished trigger was still barking his head off somehow i dragged him home and got him in his pen so whats your problem she asked i cant tell you i have to show you he said ill be right there bye he hung up the phone and hurried down the stairs carrying the bucket kathryn was in the kitchen her back to him chopping away at something with her big butcher knife evan hurried past and darted out the door andys house was a modern redwood ranch style with a low hedge of evergreens running along the front her dad she said was a fanatic about the lawn it was clipped a perfect inch and a half above the ground smooth as a carpet a flower garden stretched along the front of the house tall orange and yellow tiger lilies bobbing in the gentle breeze the front door was open evan knocked on the screen door whats with the bucket was andys greeting as she let him in look he said out of breath from running all the way to her house he held up the aluminum bucket he had taken from kathryns garage oh wow andy exclaimed raising her hands to her face as she stared into it wideeyed yeah wow he repeated sarcastically the monster blood its grown again look its almost filled this big bucket what are we going to do what do you mean we andy teased leading him into the den not funny he muttered you didnt want to share it she insisted ill share it now he said eagerly in fact do you want it ill give it to you for a bargain price free he held the bucket toward her huhuh andy shook her head crossing her arms in front of her chest put it down will you she pointed to the corner behind the red leather couch put it over there its giving me the creeps giving you the creeps evan cried what am i going to do every time i turn around it grows some more its growing faster than trigger hey they both cried at once both had the same thought the same frightening memory both suddenly remembered that trigger had eaten a ball of the green gunk do you think evan started maybe andy replied not waiting for him to finish his thought maybe triggers growing because he ate the monster blood what am i going to do evan wailed pacing the room nervously his hands shoved into his jeans pockets the stuff is getting bigger and bigger and so is poor trigger im all alone here theres no one who can help me no one what about your aunt andy suggested staring at the bucket on the floor in the corner maybe kathryn can think of something are you kidding she cant hear me she doesnt want to hear me she hates me she just sits at her jigsaw puzzle and argues with that horrible black cat all day okay forget the aunt andy said making a dispirited face perhaps if you told dr forrest oh yeah for sure evan snapped hed really believe that trigger is turning into a giant because i let him eat monster blood he threw himself down on the couch im all alone here andy theres no one to help me no one i can even talk to about this except me yeah he said locking his eyes on hers except you she plopped down on the other end of the couch well what can i do she asked hesitantly he jumped up and carried the bucket over take some of this lets split it up huh why dont we just toss it in the trash she asked staring down at it the green gunk was pushing up near the top of the bucket toss it we cant he said sure we can come on ill show you she reached for the bucket handle but he shoved it out of her reach what if it outgrows the trash can he asked what if it just keeps growing andy shrugged i dont know also i have to save it evan continued excitedly if its really the thing thats causing trigger to grow ill need it as proof you know to show the doctors or whatever so they can cure trigger maybe we should call the police andy said thoughtfully tugging at a strand of hair oh sure evan replied rolling his eyes theyll really believe us for sure we bought this stuff in a toy store officer and now its growing bigger and bigger and its turning my dog into a giant monster okay okay youre right andy said we cant call the police so are you going to help me evan demanded will you take some of this stuff i guess she said reluctantly but just a little she climbed to her feet carefully stepping around the bucket ill be right back she left the room then quickly returned carrying an empty coffee can fill er up she said smiling evan stared at the coffee can thats all youre going to take he complained then he immediately softened his tone okay okay its a help andy crouched down and dipped the coffee can into the middle of the bucket hey she cried out her hands flew up and she tumbled back onto the floor whats wrong evan hurried over to her it was pulling the coffee can in she said her features tight with fear and surprise sucking it look evan peered into the bucket the coffee can had disappeared under the surface huh i could feel it pulling andy said shakily she regained her perch over the bucket lets see evan said and plunged both hands into the middle of the monster blood yuck andy said this is really gross its pulling youre right evan agreed it feels like its pulling my hands down wow its so warm as if its alive dont say that andy cried with a shudder just get the can out okay evan had to tug hard but he managed to pull up the coffee can filled to the top with the quivering green substance yuck you sure i have to take this andy asked not reaching for it even though he was holding it out to her just for a little while he said till we think of a better plan maybe we could feed it to the beymer twins andy suggested finally taking the can then wed have giant beymer twins evan joked no thank you seriously youd better watch out for them andy warned if trigger scared them away this morning theyll be looking to get back at you they really think theyre tough dudes evan they can be vicious they could really hurt you thanks for trying to cheer me up evan said glumly he was still pulling tiny clinging clumps of the monster blood off his hands and tossing them into the bucket i was watching a video before you came over the first indiana jones movie want to watch it evan shook his head no id better go aunt kathryn was busy making dinner when i left chopping up some kind of meat another great dinner sitting there in silence being stared at by aunt kathryn and her cat poor evan andy said half teasing half sympathetic he picked up the bucket now only twothirds full and let her walk him to the front door call me later okay she asked he nodded and stepped outside she closed the door behind him he was halfway to the sidewalk when the beymer twins slipped out from behind the evergreen hedge their hands balled into red beefy fists chapter the brothers stepped out of the shadows of the hedge their short blond hair caught the late afternoon sunlight they were both grinning gleefully evan stood frozen in place staring from one to the other no one said a word one of the beymers grabbed the bucket from evans hand and tossed it to the ground the bucket hit with a heavy thud and its thick green contents oozed onto the grass making disgusting sucking sounds hey evan cried breaking the tense silence he didnt have a chance to say more the other twin punched him hard in the stomach evan felt the pain radiate through his body the punch took his breath away he gasped for air he didnt see the next punch it landed on his cheek just below his right eye he howled in pain and his hands flailed the air helplessly both brothers were hitting him now and then one of them gave evans shoulders a hard shove and he went sprawling onto the cool damp grass the pain swept over him blanketing him followed by a wave of nausea he closed his eyes gasping noisily waiting for the sharp ache in his stomach to fade the ground seemed to tilt he reached out and grabbed it and held on tightly so he wouldnt fall off when he finally managed to raise his head andy was standing over him her eyes wide with alarm evan he groaned and pushing with both hands tried to sit up the dizziness the spinning tilting grass forced him to lie back down are they gone he asked closing his eyes willing the dizziness away rick and tony i saw them run away andy said kneeling beside him are you okay should i call my mom he opened his eyes yeah no i dont know what happened she demanded he raised a hand to his cheek ow it was already swollen too painful to touch they beat you up either that or i was hit by a truck he groaned a few minutes later it seemed like hours he was back on his feet breathing normally rubbing his swollen cheek ive never been in a fight before he told andy shaking his head never it doesnt look like it was much of a fight she said her expression still tight with concern he started to laugh but it made his stomach hurt well pay them back andy said bitterly well find a way to pay them back the creeps oh look the monster blood evan hurried over to it the bucket lay on its side the green gunk had oozed onto the grass forming a wide thick puddle ill help you get it back in the bucket andy said leaning over to stand the bucket up hope it doesnt kill the grass my dadll have a cow if his precious lawn is hurt its so heavy evan said groaning as he tried to push the glob into the bucket it doesnt want to move lets try picking up handfuls andy suggested whoa it doesnt want to come apart evan said in surprise look it sticks together its like taffy andy said ever see them make taffy in those taffy machines the stuff just sticks together in one big glob this isnt taffy evan muttered its disgusting working together they managed to lift the entire green ball and drop it into the bucket the stuff made a sickening sucking sound as it filled the bucket and both evan and andy had trouble pulling their hands out of it its so sticky andy said making a disgusted face and warm evan added he finally managed to free his hands from it its like its trying to swallow my hands he said wiping his hands on his tshirt sucking them in take it home andy said she looked up to the house to see her mother motioning to her from the front window uhoh dinnertime ive got to go her eyes stopped at his swollen cheek wait till your aunt sees you she probably wont even notice evan said glumly he picked up the bucket by the handle what are we going to do with this stuff well take it back to the toy store tomorrow andy replied taking long strides across the lawn to the house huh thats what well do well simply take it back evan didnt think it was such a hot idea but he didnt have the strength to argue about it now he watched andy disappear into the house then he headed slowly back to kathryns his head throbbing his stomach aching creeping along the wall of the house he slipped into the garage through the side door to hide the bucket of monster blood sliding it behind an overturned wheelbarrow he realized that the bucket was full to the top but i gave andy a big hunk of it he thought the bucket had been only twothirds full ill have to find a bigger place to put it he decided tonight maybe theres a box or something in the basement he crept into the house determined to clean himself up before seeing kathryn she was still busy in the kitchen he saw leaning over the stove putting the last touches on dinner he tiptoed up the stairs and washed up unable to do much about his swollen red cheek he changed into a clean pair of baggy shorts and a fresh tshirt and carefully brushed his hair as they sat down at the dining room table kathryns eyes fell on evans swollen cheek you been in a fight she asked squinting suspiciously at him youre a little roughneck arent you just like your father chicken was always getting into scrapes always picking on boys twice his size i wasnt exactly picking on them evan muttered spearing a chunk of beef from his stew with his fork all through dinner kathryn stared at his swollen cheek but she didnt say another word she doesnt care if im hurt or not evan thought miserably she really doesnt care she didnt even ask if it hurts in a way he was grateful he didnt need her getting all upset making a fuss because he was in a fight maybe calling his parents in atlanta and telling them well she couldnt call his parents she couldnt use the phone since she couldnt hear evan downed his big plate of beef stew it was pretty good except for the vegetables the silence seemed so loud he began thinking about his problem the monster blood should he tell kathryn about it he could write down the whole problem on the yellow pad and hand it to her to read it would feel so good to tell someone to have an adult take over the problem and handle it but not his aunt kathryn he decided she was too weird she wouldnt understand she wouldnt know what to do and she wouldnt care andy was right they had to carry the stuff back to the toy store give it back just get rid of it but in the meantime he had to find something to keep it in evan waited in his room until he heard kathryn go to bed a little after ten oclock then he crept down the stairs and headed out to the garage chapter it was a cool clear night crickets sent up a relentless curtain of noise the black sky glittered with tiny specks of stars the round beam of light from the flashlight in his hand darted across the driveway leading evan to the dark garage as he entered something scuttled across the floor near the back wall maybe it was just a dead leaf blown by the wind when i opened the door he thought hopefully he moved the flashlight unsteadily beaming it onto the overturned wheelbarrow then the light darted across the garage ceiling as he bent down reached behind the wheelbarrow and pulled out the bucket of monster blood he moved the light to the center of the bucket and gasped the green substance was quivering up over the top its growing much faster than before he thought ive got to find something bigger to hide it in just for tonight the bucket was too heavy to carry with one hand tucking the flashlight into his armpit he gripped the bucket handle with both hands and hoisted the bucket off the floor struggling to keep from spilling it he made his way into the dark house he paused at the door to the basement steps silently setting the heavy bucket down on the linoleum floor he clicked the light switch on the wall somewhere downstairs a dim light flickered on casting a wash of pale yellow light over the concrete floor theres got to be something to put this stuff in down there evan thought hoisting up the bucket he made his way slowly carefully down the steep dark stairway leaning his shoulder against the wall to steady himself waiting for his eyes to adjust to the pale light he saw that the basement was one large room lowceilinged and damp it was cluttered with cartons stacks of old newspapers and magazines and old furniture and appliances covered in stained yellowed bed sheets something brushed his face as he stepped away from the stairs he uttered a silent cry and dropping the bucket raised his hands to swipe at the thick cobwebs that seemed to reach out for him they clung to his skin dry and scratchy as he frantically pulled at them he suddenly realized it wasnt the web that was moving against his cheek it was a spider with a sharp intake of breath he brushed it away but even after he saw the insect scuttle across the floor he could still feel its prickly feet moving on his face moving quickly away from the wall his heart pounding now his eyes searching the open wooden shelves hidden in shadow against the far wall he stumbled over something on the floor oh he fell headfirst over it throwing his hands forward to break his fall a human body someone lying there under him no calm down evan calm down he instructed himself he pulled himself shakily to his feet it was a dressmakers dummy he had stumbled over probably a model of kathryn when she was younger he rolled it out of the way as his eyes searched the shadowy room for a container to store the monster blood what was that long low object in front of the worktable moving closer he saw that it was an old bathtub the insides stained and peeling its big enough he realized and quickly decided to store the green gunk inside it with a loud groan he hoisted the bucket onto the side of the old tub his stomach muscles were still sore from the punch he had taken and the pain shot through his body he waited for the aching to fade then tilted the bucket the thick green substance rolled out of the bucket and hit the tub bottom with a sickening soft plop evan set the bucket aside and stared down at the monster blood watching it ooze spreading thickly over the bottom of the bathtub to his surprise the tub appeared nearly half full how fast was this stuff growing he was leaning over the tub about to make his way back upstairs when he heard the cat screech startled he let go of the side of the tub just as sarabeth leapt onto his back evan didnt have time to cry out as he toppled forward over the edge of the tub and into the thick green gunk chapter evan landed hard on his elbows but the thick monster blood softened the fall he heard the cat screech again and pad away he sank into the ooze his arms and legs flailing trying to lift himself away but the sticky substance was sucking him down pulling him with surprising force his whole body seemed to be held by it stuck as if in cement and now it was quivering up bubbling silently rising up to his face im going to suffocate he realized its trying to choke me the warmth of it spread across his body invaded his chest his legs his throat i cant move im stuck its trying to choke me no he pulled his head up just as the green gunk began to cover his face then he struggled to twist his body to twist himself around in it with great effort panting loudly hoarse cries escaping his open lips he pulled himself up into a sitting position the green substance rose up even higher as if it were reaching up to him reaching to drag him back down into it evan gripped the side of the tub with both hands held on to it tightly and began to force himself up up up from the clinging pulling ooze up from the strange force that seemed to be drawing him back with renewed power up up no he managed to scream as the warm green ooze slid over his shoulders no it was gripping his shoulders now sliding around his neck sucking him down pulling him back into its sticky depths down down its got me he realized its got me now chapter no evan screamed aloud as the green gunk bubbled up to his neck pulling him pulling him down no try again up try again up up yes gripping the sides of the tub he was moving upward pulling himself hoisting himself straining with all of his strength yes yes he was beating it he was stronger than it was one more tug and he would be free with a relieved sigh he dropped over the side of the tub onto the cool basement floor and lay there pressed against the damp concrete waiting to catch his breath when he looked up sarabeth stood a few feet away her head cocked to one side her yellow eyes peering into his an expression of supreme satisfaction on her dark feline face the next morning after a fitful restless sleep evan brought the pad of yellow lined paper and a marker to the breakfast table well well kathryn greeted him placing a bowl of shredded wheat in front of him you certainly look like something the cat dragged in she laughed shaking her head dont mention cat to me evan muttered he shoved the bowl of cereal aside and pointed to the pad in his hand dont let your cereal get soggy kathryn scolded reaching to push the bowl back to him you get more of the vitamins that way and its good roughage i dont care about your stupid roughage evan said moodily knowing she couldnt hear him he pointed to the pad again and then began to write scribbling quickly in big black letters his writing caught her interest she moved around the table and stood behind him her eyes on the pad as he wrote his desperate message i have a problem he wrote i need your help the bathtub downstairs is overflowing with green monster blood and i cant stop it he put down the marker and held the pad up close to her face looking up at her from the chair seeing her pale face in the morning sunlight as she leaned over him in her gray flannel bathrobe kathryn suddenly looked very old to him only her eyes those vibrant blue eyes running quickly over his words seemed youthful and alive her lips were pursed tightly in concentration as she read what he had written then as evan stared eagerly up at her her mouth spread into a wide smile she tossed back her head and laughed completely bewildered by her reaction evan slid his chair back and jumped up she rested a hand on his shoulder and gave him a playful shove dont kid an old woman she exclaimed shaking her head she turned and headed back to her side of the table i thought you were serious i guess youre not like your father at all he never played any dumb jokes or tricks chicken was always such a serious boy i dont care about chicken evan shouted losing control and tossed the pad angrily onto the breakfast table his aunt burst out laughing she didnt seem to notice that evan was glaring at her in frustration his hands tightened into fists at his sides monster blood what an imagination she wiped tears of laughter from her eyes with her fingers then suddenly her expression turned serious she grabbed his earlobe and squeezed it i warned you she whispered i warned you to be careful ow when he cried out in pain she let go of his ear her eyes glowing like blue jewels ive got to get out of here evan thought rubbing his tender earlobe he turned and strode quickly from the kitchen and up to his room i knew she wouldnt be any help he thought bitterly shes just a crazy old lady i should pull her down to the basement and show her the disgusting stuff he thought angrily tossing the clothes he had worn yesterday onto the floor but whats the point shed probably laugh at that too she isnt going to help me he had only one person he could rely on he knew andy he called her punching in her number with trembling fingers hi youre right he said not giving her a chance to say anything we have to take the stuff back to the store if we can carry it andy replied sounding worried that hunk of monster blood you gave me it outgrew the coffee can i put it in my parents ice bucket but its outgrowing that how about a plastic garbage bag evan suggested you know one of the really big lawn bags we can probably carry it in a couple of those its worth a try andy said this stuff is so disgusting its making all these sick noises and its really sticky tell me about it evan replied gloomily remembering the night before i took a swim in it huh you can explain later she said impatiently the toy store opens at ten i think i can meet you on the corner in twenty minutes good deal evan hung up the phone and headed to the garage to get a plastic lawn bag andy showed up with her plastic bag wrapped around the handlebars of her bmx bike once again evan had to go along beside her on foot his plastic bag was bulging and so heavy he had to drag it over the sidewalk he couldnt lift it the tub was nearly full to the top he told andy groaning as he struggled to pull the bag over the curb im afraid its going to burst out of this bag only two blocks to go she said trying to sound reassuring a car rolled by slowly the driver a teenager with long black hair stuck his head out the window grinning whats in the bag a dead body just garbage evan told him thats for sure andy muttered as the car rolled away several people stopped to stare at them as they entered town hi mrs winslow andy called to a friend of her mothers mrs winslow waved then gave andy a curious stare and headed into the grocery andy climbed off her bike and walked it evan continued to drag his bulging bag behind him they made their way to the next block then started to cross the street to the toy store but they both stopped short in the middle of the street and gaped in shock the door and window of the store were boarded up a small handprinted sign tacked to the top of the door read out of business chapter desperate to get rid of the disgusting contents of the garbage bags evan pounded on the door anyway come on somebody somebody open up no reply he pounded with both fists silence finally andy had to pull him away the store is closed a young woman called from across the street it closed a few days ago see its all boarded up and everything very helpful evan muttered under his breath he slammed his hand angrily against the door evan stop youll hurt yourself andy warned now what evan demanded got any more fantastic ideas andy she shrugged its your turn to come up with something brilliant evan sighed miserably maybe i could give it to kathryn and tell her its beef then shed chop it up with that knife shes always carrying around i dont think youre thinking too clearly right now andy said putting a sympathetic hand on his shoulder they both stared down at the garbage bags they appeared to be moving expanding and contracting as if the green globs inside were breathing lets go back to kathryns evan said his voice trembling maybe well think of something on the way somehow they managed to drag the monster blood back to kathryns house the sun had gotten high in the sky as they headed to the backyard evan was drenched with sweat his arms ached his head throbbed now what he asked weakly letting go of the bulging lawn bag andy leaned her bike against the side of the garage she pointed to the big aluminum trash can next to the garage door how about that it looks pretty sturdy she walked over to it to investigate and look the lid clamps down okay evan agreed wiping his forehead with the sleeve of his tshirt andy pulled off the lid of the big can then she dumped in the contents of her bag it hit the bottom with a sick squishy sound then she hurried to help evan its so heavy evan groaned struggling to pull the bag up we can do it andy insisted working together they managed to slide the monster blood from the plastic bag it rolled out like a tidal wave sloshing noisily against the sides of the can raising up as if trying to escape with a loud sigh of relief evan slammed the metal lid down on top of it and clamped the handles down whoa andy cried they both stared at the can for a long moment as if expecting it to explode or burst apart now what evan asked his features tight with fear before andy could reply they saw kathryn step out of the kitchen door her eyes searched the backyard until she spotted them evangood news she called glancing back at the trash can evan and andy came hurrying over kathryn was holding a yellow piece of paper in her hand a telegram your mother is coming to pick you up this afternoon kathryn said a wide smile on her face i think kathryn is glad to get rid of me was evans first thought and then dismissing that thought he leapt up and whooped for joy it was the best news hed ever received im outta here he exclaimed after his aunt had returned to the house im outta here i cant wait andy didnt appear to share his joy youre leaving your aunt a nice little surprise over there she said pointing to the trash can i dont care im outta here evan repeated raising his hand for andy to slap him a high five she didnt cooperate dont you think we have to tell someone about the monster blood or do something about it before you leave but evan was too excited to think about that now hey trigger he called running to the dogs pen at the back of the yard triggerwere going home boy evan pulled open the gate and gasped chapter trigger the dog that came bounding toward him looked like trigger but the cocker spaniel was the size of a pony he had doubled in size since the day before no evan had to hit the dirt as trigger excitedly tried to jump on him hey wait before evan could get up trigger began barking ferociously the huge dog was already past the gate and thundering across the backyard toward the street i dont believe it andy cried raising her hands to her face staring in shock as the enormous creature bounded around the side of the house and out of sight hes so big weve got to stop him he might hurt someone evan cried trigger trigger come back still off balance evan started to run calling frantically but he stumbled over andys bike and fell onto the trash can no andy shrieked looking on helplessly as the metal can toppled over with evan sprawled on top of it the can hit the driveway with a loud clang the lid popped off and rolled away the green gunk poured out it oozed away from the can then stopped and appeared to stand up quivering making loud sucking sounds it righted itself pulling itself up tall as the two kids stared in silent horror the quivering green mass appeared to come to life like a newly born creature pulling itself up stretching looking around then with a loud sucking sound it arched toward evan who was still sprawled on the toppled can get up evan andy cried get up its going to roll right over you chapter noooooo evan uttered an animal cry a sound he had never made before and rolled away as the quivering green ball bounced toward him run evan andy screamed she grabbed his hand and pulled him to his feet its alive she cried run the monster blood heaved itself against the garage wall it seemed to stick there for a brief second then it peeled off and came bouncing toward them with surprising speed help help somebody please help screaming at the top of their lungs evan and andy took off scrambling as fast as he could his legs weak and rubbery from fear evan followed andy ran down the driveway toward the front yard help oh please help us evans voice was hoarse from screaming his heart thudded in his chest his temples throbbed he turned and saw that the monster blood was right behind them picking up speed as it bounced across the yard making disgusting squishing noises with each bounce plop plop plop a robin pulling at a worm in the grass didnt look up in time the trembling green mass rolled over it oh evan moaned turning back to see the bird sucked into the green ball its wings flapping frantically the bird uttered a final cry then disappeared inside plop plop plop the monster blood changed direction still bouncing and quivering and leaving white stains on the grass like enormous round footsteps its alive andy screamed her hands pressed against her cheeks oh my god its alive what can we do what can we do evan didnt recognize his own terrified voice its catching up andy screamed pulling him by the hand run gasping loudly they made their way to the front of the house hey whats happening a voice called huh startled by the voice evan stopped short he looked to the sidewalk to see the beymer twins matching grins on their beefy faces my favorite punching bag one of them said to evan he raised his fist menacingly they took a few steps toward evan and andy then their grins faded and their mouths dropped open in horror as the gigantic green mass appeared heading down the drive rolling as fast as a bicycle look out evan screamed run andy cried but the two brothers were too startled to move their eyes bulging with fear they threw their hands up as if trying to shield themselves plop plop plop the enormous ball of monster blood picked up speed as it bounced forward evan shut his eyes as it hit the twins with a deafening smack ow no both brothers cried out flailing their arms struggling to pull themselves free help us please help us their bodies twisted and writhed as they struggled but they were stuck tight the green gunk oozed over them covering them completely then it pulled them inside with a loud sucking pop andy shielded her eyes sick she muttered oooh sick evan gasped in helpless horror as the beymer brothers finally stopped struggling their arms went limp their faces disappeared into the quivering gunk the sucking sounds grew louder as the two boys were pulled deeper and deeper inside then the monster blood bounced high turned and started back up the drive andy and evan froze unsure of which way to head split up evan cried it cant go after us both andy returned his frightened stare she opened her mouth but no sound came out split up split up evan repeated shrilly but andy started before she could say anything the front door of the house burst open and kathryn stepped out onto the stoop hey what are you kids doing whats that she cried gripping the screen door her eyes filling with horror picking up speed the giant ball bounded toward the stoop kathryn tossed up her hands in fright she stood frozen for a long moment as if trying to make sense of what she was seeing then leaving the front door wide open she spun around and fled into the house plop plop the monster blood hesitated at the front stoop it bounced in place once twice three times as if considering what to do next evan and andy gaped in horror from across the lawn trying to catch their breath a wave of nausea swept over evan as he saw the beymer twins still visible deep within the quivering glob faceless prisoners bouncing inside it then suddenly the monster blood bounced high and hurtled up the stairs of the stoop no evan screamed as it squeezed through the open doorway and disappeared into the house from the middle of the yard andy and evan heard kathryns bloodcurdling scream its got aunt kathryn evan said weakly chapter evan reached the house first he had run so fast his lungs felt as if they were about to burst what are you going to do andy called following close behind i dont know evan replied he grabbed on to the screen door and propelled himself into the house aunt kathryn evan screamed bursting into the living room the enormous glob filled the center of the small room the beymer twins were outlined in its side as it bounced and quivered oozing over the carpet leaving its sticky footprints in its path it took evan a few seconds to see his aunt the bouncing hunk of monster blood had backed her against the fireplace aunt kathryn run evan cried but even he could see that she had nowhere to run get out of here kids kathryn cried her voice shrill and trembling suddenly sounding very old but aunt kathryn get out of here now the old woman insisted her black hair wild about her head her eyes those blue penetrating eyes staring hard at the green glob as if willing it away evan turned to andy uncertain of what to do andys hands tugged at the sides of her hair her eyes wide with growing fear as the seething green glob made its way steadily closer to evans aunt get out kathryn repeated shrilly save your lives i made this thing now i must die for it evan gasped had he heard correctly what had his aunt just said the words repeated in his mind clear now so clear and so frightening i made this thing now i must die for it chapter no gaping in horror as the sickening glob of monster blood pushed toward his aunt evan felt the room tilt and begin to spin he gripped the back of kathryns armchair as pictures flooded his mind he saw the strange bone pendant kathryn always wore around her neck the mysterious books that lined the walls of his bedroom sarabeth the black cat with the glowing yellow eyes the black shawl kathryn always wrapped around her shoulders in the evening i made this thing now i must die for it evan saw it all now and it began to come clear to him evan pictured the day he and andy brought home the can of monster blood from the toy store kathryn had insisted on seeing it on studying it on touching it he remembered the way she rolled the can around in her hands examining it so carefully moving her lips silently as she read the label what had she been doing what had she been saying a thought flashed into evans mind had she been casting a spell on the can a spell to make the monster blood grow a spell to terrify evan but why she didnt even know evan why did she want to frighten him to kill him be careful she had called to him after handing the blue can back be careful it was a real warning a warning against her spell you did this evan shouted in a voice he didnt recognize the words burst out of him he had no control over them you did this you cast a spell he repeated pointing an accusing finger at his aunt he saw her blue eyes shimmer as they read his lips then her eyes filled with tears tears that overflowed onto her pale cheeks no she cried no you did something to the can you did this aunt kathryn no she cried shouting over the sickening grunts and plops of the mountainous ball that nearly hid her from view no kathryn cried her back pressed tightly against the mantelpiece i didnt do it she did and she pointed an accusing finger at andy chapter andy was aunt kathryn accusing andy evan spun around to confront andy but andy turned too and evan realized immediately that his aunt wasnt pointing at andy she was pointing past andy to sarabeth standing in the doorway to the living room the black cat hissed and arched her back her yellow eyes flaring at kathryn she did it shes the one kathryn declared pointing frantically the enormous glob of green monster blood bounced back retreated a step as if stung by kathryns words shadows shifted inside the glob as it quivered catching the light filtering in through the living room window evan stared at the cat then turned his eyes to andy she shrugged her face frozen in horror and bewilderment aunt kathryn is crazy evan thought sadly shes totally lost it she isnt making any sense none of this makes sense shes the one kathryn repeated the cat hissed in response the glob bounced in place carrying the unmoving beymer brothers inside oh look evan cried to andy as the black cat suddenly raised up on its hind legs andy gasped and squeezed evans arm her hand was as cold as ice still hissing the cat grew like a shadow against the wall it raised its claws swiping the air its eyes closed and it became consumed in darkness no one moved the only sounds evan could hear were the bubbling of the green glob and the pounding of his own heart all eyes were on the cat as it rose up stretched and grew and as it grew it changed its shape became human with shadowy arms and legs in the eerie darkness and then the shadow stepped away from the darkness and sarabeth was now a young woman with fiery red hair and pale skin and yellow eyes the same yellow cat eyes that had haunted evan since hed arrived the young woman was dressed in a swirling black gown down to her ankles she stood blocking the doorway staring accusingly at kathryn you see shes the one kathryn said quietly now and the next words were intended only for sarabeth your spell over me is broken i will do no more work for you sarabeth tossed her red hair behind a blackcloaked shoulder and laughed ill decide what you will do kathryn no kathryn insisted for twenty years you have used me sarabeth for twenty years you have imprisoned me here held me in your spell but now i will use this monster blood to escape sarabeth laughed again there is no escape fool all of you must die now all of you chapter all of you must die sarabeth repeated her smile revealed that she enjoyed saying those words kathryn turned to evan her eyes reflecting her fear twenty years ago i thought she was my friend i was all alone here i thought i could trust her but she cast a spell on me and then another her dark magic made me deaf she refused to let me lipread or learn to sign that was one way she kept me her prisoner but aunt kathryn evan started she raised a finger to her lips to silence him sarabeth forced me to cast the spell on the can of monster blood she had warned me that i was allowed no guests you see i was her slave her personal servant for all these years she wanted me all to herself to do her evil bidding when you arrived kathryn continued her back still pressed against the fireplace mantel she first decided to scare you away but that was impossible you had nowhere to go then she became desperate to get you out of the way she was terrified that you would learn her secret that you would somehow free me of her spell so sarabeth decided that you had to die kathryns eyes fell she sighed im so sorry evan i had no choice no will of my own she turned her eyes to sarabeth but no more no more no more as i plunge myself into this ghastly creation sarabeth i will end your spell i will end your hold over me the children will still die sarabeth said quietly coldly what kathryns eyes filled with fury i will be gone sarabeth you can let the children go you have no reason to do them harm they know too much sarabeth replied softly crossing her slender arms in front of her her yellow eyes aglow weve got to get out of here evan whispered to andy staring at the seething green glob but how andy whispered back sarabeth is blocking the doorway evans eyes darted around the small room searching for an escape route nothing sarabeth raised one hand and drew it toward her slowly as if summoning the green glob it quivered once twice then moved obediently in the direction of her hand no sarabeth stop kathryn pleaded ignoring kathryn sarabeth gestured with her hand again the green gunk bubbled and rolled forward kill the children sarabeth commanded the enormous glob picked up speed as it rolled across the carpet toward evan and andy lets rush the door evan suggested to andy as they backed up away from the rolling monster blood shell never let us past andy cried kill the children sarabeth repeated raising both hands high above her head maybe one of us can get by her evan cried its too late andy shrieked the bouncing pulsating green glob was just a few feet away we were going to be sucked in evan screamed kill the children sarabeth screamed triumphantly chapter the glob rolled forward evan sighed feeling all hope sink frozen in place he felt as if he weighed a thousand pounds andy grabbed his hand they both closed their eyes and held their breath and waited for the impact to their surprise the monster blood emitted a deafening roar huh evan opened his eyes andy he saw was staring at the doorway beyond sarabeth the monster blood hadnt roared trigger evan cried the huge dog bounded into the doorway its deafening bark echoing off the low ceiling sarabeth tried to get out of the dogs way but she was too late thrilled to see evan trigger enthusiastically leapt at sarabeth and pushed her from behind under the weight of the gigantic paws sarabeth staggered forward forward forward raising her hands as she collided with the monster blood there was a wet smack as sarabeth hit the surface of the green glob then loud disgusting sucking noises her hands hit first they disappeared quickly and then sarabeth was in up to her elbows and then the glob seemed to give a hard tug and her body hit the surface then her face was pulled in covered over sarabeth never uttered a sound as she was pulled inside whimpering with joy completely unaware of what he had done the dog loped into the room and headed for evan down boy down evan cried as trigger happily leapt at him and as the dog jumped he began to shrink trigger evan called in astonishment reaching out to hold the dog trigger didnt seem to notice that he was changing he licked evans face as evan held on tightly in seconds trigger was back to normal cocker spaniel size look the glob is shrinking too andy cried squeezing evans shoulder evan turned to see that the green glob was rapidly growing smaller as it shrunk the beymer brothers fell to the floor they didnt move they lay facedown in a crumpled heap their open eyes stared lifelessly they didnt appear to be breathing then one blinked the other blinked their mouths opened and closed ohhh one of them uttered a long low groan then pulling themselves up slowly they both looked around the room dazed the trapped robin had also fallen to the floor chirping furiously it flapped its wings wildly and fluttered about the room in a panic until it found the open living room window and sailed out andy held on to evan as they stared at the monster blood expecting sarabeth to reappear too but sarabeth was gone vanished the monster blood shrunk to its original size lay lifeless inert a dull green spot on the carpet no bigger than a tennis ball the beymer brothers stood up uncertainly their eyes still reflecting terror and confusion they stretched as if testing their arms and legs seeing if their muscles still worked then they scrambled out of the house slamming the screen door behind them its over kathryn said softly moving forward to put an arm around evan and andy sarabeth is gone evan said holding trigger tightly in his arms still staring at the tiny wedge of monster blood on the floor and i can hear kathryn said jubilantly hugging them both sarabeth and her spells are gone for good but as she said this the screen door swung open and a shadowy figure stepped into the living room doorway chapter mom evan cried he set down trigger and hurried to greet her throwing his arms around her in a tight hug what on earth is going on here mrs ross asked why did those two boys come bursting out like that they looked scared to death it its a little hard to explain evan told her im so glad to see you trigger was glad too when he finally had finished jumping up and down and whimpering kathryn led evans mom to the kitchen ill make some tea she said i have a rather long story to tell you i hope it isnt too long mrs ross said glancing back questioningly at evan we have a four oclock plane to catch mom i think
