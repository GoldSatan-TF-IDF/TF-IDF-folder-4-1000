scott d appleton and company new york london copyright by d appleton and company printed in the united states of america by way of introduction so much of my time is given to reading boys books that when i read books for grownups now and again i find myself saying what a bully story for boys to read latterly i have been putting down the titles of such stories when the list began to lengthen it occurred to me why not make a book for boys containing stories like that stories written for grownups but also of interest to boys in their early teens such a collection of stories could not be made however without the consent of the authors and publishers but since everybody loves a boy i didnt have much trouble in convincing them they ought to grant permission to use their stories for such a purpose and as a result i am pleased to present to the boy readers of our country the boy scouts book of stories looking over the list i find it covers pretty well the reading interests of boys there are stories about boy scouts school stories stories of the sea and wild west stories detective and mystery stories most of all though a goodly number of humorous stories and i am willing to hazard the guess there will be no regrets on the part of readers because the selections happen to abound in stories of the latter sort how about it boys contents page i the great big man owen johnson ii a

johnson the noon bell was about to ring the one glorious spring note of that inexorable gym bell that ruled the school with its iron tongue for at noon on the first liberating stroke the long winter term died and the easter vacation became a fact inside memorial hall the impatient classes stirred nervously counting off the minutes sitting gingerly on the seatedges for fear of wrinkling the carefully pressed suits or shifting solicitously the sharpened trousers in peril of a bagging at the knees heavens how interminable the hour was sitting there in a planked shirt and a fashionhigh collar and what a recitation would easter ever begin that longcoveted vacation when the growing boy according to theory goes home to rest from the fatiguing draining of his brain but in reality returns exhausted by dinners dances and theaters with perhaps a little touch of the measles to exchange with his neighbors even the masters droned through the perfunctory exercises flunking the boys by twos and threes by groups by long rows but without malice or emotion outside in the roadway by the steps waited a long incongruous line of vehicles scraped together from every stable in the countryside fortyodd a few buggies for nabobs in the upper house twoseated rigs holding eight country buckboards excursion wagons to be filled according to capacity at twentyfive cents the trip hacks from trenton and the regulation stagecoach all piled high with bags and suitcases waiting for the bell that would start them on the scramble for the trenton station five miles away at the horses heads the lazy negroes lolled drawing languid puffs from their cigarettes unconcerned suddenly the bell rang out and the supine teamsters galvanizing into life jumped to their seats the next moment down the steps pellmell scrambling and scuffling swarming over the carriages with joyful clamor the school arrived in an instant the first buggies were off with whips frantically plied disputing at a gallop the race to trenton then the air was filled with shouts wheres butsey oh you red dog wheres my bag jump in oh well never get there drive on dont wait wheres jack hurry up you loafer hurry up you butterfingers get in pile in haul him in were off hurrah wagon after wagon crammed with joyful boyhood disappeared in a cloud of dust while back returned a confused uproar of broken cheers snatches of songs with whoops and shrieks for more speed dominating the whole the last load rollicked away to join the mad race where far ahead a dozen buggies with foamflecked horses vied with one another their youthful jockeys waving their hats hurling defiance back and forth or shrieking with delight as each antagonist was caught and left behind the sounds of striving died away the campus grew still once more the few who had elected to wait until after luncheon scattered hurriedly about the circle and disappeared in the houses to fling last armfuls into the already bursting trunks on top of memorial steps the great big man remained solitary and marooned gazing over the fields down the road to trenton where still the rising dustclouds showed the struggle toward vacation he stood like a monument gazing fixedly struggling with all the might of his twelve years to conquer the awful feeling of homesickness that came to him homesickness the very word was an anomaly what home had he to go to an orphan without ever having known his father scarcely remembering his mother in the hazy reflections of years little joshua tibbets had arrived at the school at the beginning of the winter term to enter the shellb and gradually pass through the forms in six or seven years the boys of the dickinson after a glance at his funny little body and his plaintive doglike face had baptized him the great big man big man for short and had elected him the child of the house he had never known what homesickness was before he had had a premonition of it perhaps from time to time during the last week wondering a little in the classroom as each day snorky green beside him calculated the days until easter then the hours then the minutes he had watched him with an amused uncomprehending interest why was he so anxious to be off after all he the big man found it a pleasant place after the wearisome life from hotel to hotel he liked the boys they were kind to him and looked after his moral and spiritual welfare with bluff but affectionate solicitude it is true one was always hungry and only ten and a half hours sleep was a refinement of cruelty unworthy of a great institution but it was pleasant running over to the jiggershop and doing errands for giants like reiter and butcher stevens with the privileges of the commission he liked to be tumbled in the grass by the great tackle of the football eleven or thrown gently from arm to arm like a medicineball quits for the privileges of pommeling his big friends ad libitum and without fear of reprisals and then what a privilege to be allowed to run out on the field and fetch the noseguard or useless bandage thrown down haphazard with the confidence that he the big man was there to fetch and guard then he was permitted to share their studies to read slowly from handy literal translations his head cushioned on the eggheads knee while the lounging group swore genially at pius жneas or sympathized with catiline he shagged elusive balls and paraded the bats at shoulderarms he opened the mail and sorted it fetching the bag from farnums he was even allowed to stand treat to the mighty men of the house whenever the change in his pocket became too heavy for comfort in return he was taught to box to wind tennis rackets to blacken shoes to crease trousers and sew on the buttons of the house nothing was lacking to his complete happiness then lately he had begun to realize that there was something else in the school life outside it but very much a part of it vacation at first the idea of quitting such a fascinating life was quite incomprehensible to him what gorging dinnerparty could compare with the thrill of feasting at midnight on crackers and cheese deviled ham boned chicken mince pie and root beer by the light of a solitary candle with the cracks of the doors and windows smothered with rugs and blankets listening at every mouthful for the tread of the master that sometimes oh acme of delight actually passed unsuspectingly by the door still there was a joy in leaving all this he began to notice it distinctly when the trunks were hauled from the cellar and the packing began the packing what a lark that had been he had folded so many coats and trousers carefully in their creases under macnooders generous instructions and perched on the edge of the banisters like a queer little marmoset he had watched wash simmons throw great armfuls of assorted clothing into the trays and churn them into place with a baseball bat while the triumphant egghead carefully built up his structure with nicety and tenderness only he the big man sworn to secrecy knew what hickey had surreptitiously inserted in the bottom of eggheads trunk and also what from the depths of washs muddled clothing would greet the fond mother or sister who did the unpacking and every time he thought of it he laughed one of those laughs that pain then gleefully he had watched macnooder stretching a strap until it burst with consequences dire to the complete satisfaction of hickey turkey wash and the egghead who embracing fondly on the top of another trunk were assisting butcher stevens to close an impossible gap yet into all this amusement a little strain of melancholy had stolen here was a sensation of which he was not part an emotion he did not know still his imagination did not seize it he could not think of the halls quiet with no familiar figures lolling out of the windows or a campus unbrokenly green now from his lonely eerie on memorial steps looking down the road to vacation the great big man suddenly understood understood and felt it was he who had gone away not they the school he loved was not with him but roaring down to trenton no one had thought to invite him for a visit but then why should any one im only a runt after all he said angrily to himself he stuck his fists deep in his pockets and went down the steps like a soldier and across the campus chanting valorously the football slogan bill kicked dunham kicked they both kicked together but bill kicked mighty hard flash ran charlie ran then pennington lost her grip she also lost the championship siss boom ah after all he could sleep late that was something then in four days the baseball squad would return and there would be long afternoon practices to watch lolling on the turf with an occasional foul to retrieve he would read the count of monte cristo and follow the three musketeers through a thousand faroff adventures and lorna doone there was always the great john ridd bigger even than turkey or the waladoo bird he arrived resolutely at the dickinson and started up the deserted stairs for his room there was only one thing he feared he did not want mrs rogers wife of the housemaster to mother him anything but that he was glad that after luncheon he would have to take his meals at the lodge that would avert embarrassing situations for whatever his friends might think he the great big man was a runt in stature only to express fully the excessive gayety he enjoyed he tramped to his room bawling out tis a jolly life we lead care and sorrow we defy all at once a gruff voice spoke my what a lot of noise for a great big man the big man stopped thunderstruck the voice came from butcher stevens room cautiously he tiptoed down the hall and paused with his funny little nose and eyes peering around the doorjamb sure enough there was butcher and there were the butchers trunks and bags what could it mean i say he began according to etiquette is that you butcher very much so big man what are you doing here the faculty big man desire my presence said the butcher sarcastically they would like my expert advice on a few problems that are perplexing them ah said the great big man slowly then he understood the butcher had been caught two nights before returning by sawtelles window at a very late hour he did not know exactly the facts because he had been told not to be too inquisitive and he was accustomed to obeying instructions supposing the faculty should expel him to the big man such a sentence meant the end of all things something too horrible to contemplate so he said oh butcher is it serious rather youngster rather i should say what will the baseball team do said the big man overwhelmed thats whats worrying me replied the crack firstbaseman gloomily he rose and went to the window where he stood beating a tattoo you dont suppose crazy opdyke could cover the bag do you said the big man not in a lifetime how about stubby too short they might do something with the waladoo not for first he cant stop anything below his knees then i dont see how were going to beat andover butcher it does look bad do you think the faculty will will fire me pretty certain youngster oh butcher trouble is theyve got the goods on me dead to rights but does the doctor know how itll break up the nine butcher laughed loudly he doesnt appreciate that youngster no said the big man reflectively they never do do they the luncheon bell rang and they hurried down the big man was overwhelmed by the discovery if butcher didnt cover first how could they ever beat andover and the princeton freshmen even hill school and pennington might trounce them he fell into a brown melancholy until suddenly he caught the sympathetic glance of mrs rogers on him and for fear that she would think it was due to his own weakness he began to chat volubly he had always been a little in awe of the butcher not that the butcher had not been friendly but he was so blunt and rough and unbending that he rather repelled intimacy he watched him covertly admiring the bravado with which he pretended unconcern it must be awful to be threatened with expulsion and actually to be expelled to have your whole life ruined once and forever the big mans heart was stirred he said to himself that he had not been sympathetic enough and he resolved to repair the error so luncheon over he said with an appearance of carelessness i say old man come on over to the jiggershop ill set em up im pretty flush you know the butcher looked down at the funny face and saw the kindly motive under the exaggerated bluffness being touched by it he said gruffly well come on then you old billionaire the big man felt a great movement of sympathy in him for his big comrade he would have liked to slip his little fist in the great brown hand and say something appropriate only he could think of nothing appropriate then he remembered that among men there should be no letting down no sentimentality so he lounged along squinting up at the butcher and trying to copy his rolling gait at the jiggershop al lifted his eyebrows in wellinformed disapproval saying curtly what are you doing here you butcher you building up my constitution said stevens with a frown im staying because i like it of course lawrenceville is just lovely at easter spring birds and violets and that sort of thing youre a nice one said al a baseball enthusiast why couldnt you behave until after the andover game of course but you neednt rub it in replied the butcher staring at the floor give me a double strawberry and heave it over al seeing him not insensible relented he added another dab to the double jigger already delivered and said shoving over the glass its pretty hard luck on the team butcher theres no one hereabouts can hold down the bag like you heard anything definite no what do you think id hate to say is any one doing anything cap kiefer is to see the doctor tonight i say butcher said the big man in sudden fear you wont go up to andover and play against us will you against the school well rather not said the butcher indignantly then he added no if they fire me i know what ill do the big man wondered if he contemplated suicide that must be the natural thing to do when one is expelled he felt that he must keep near butcher close all the day so he made bold to wander about with him watching him with solicitude they stopped at lalos for a hot dog and lingered at bill applebys where the butcher mournfully tried the new mits and swung the bats with critical consideration then feeling hungry they trudged up to conovers for pancakes and syrup everywhere was the same feeling of dismay what would become of the baseball nine then it suddenly dawned upon the big man that no one seemed to be sorry on the butchers account he stopped with a pancake poised on his fork looked about to make sure no one could hear him and blurted out i say butcher its not only on account of first base you know im darn sorry for you honest why you profane little cuss said the butcher frowning who told you to swear dont make fun of me butcher said the great big man feeling very little i meant it conover said the butcher loudly more pancakes and brown em he too had been struck by the fact that in the general mourning there had been scant attention paid to his personal fortunes he had prided himself on the fact that he was not susceptible to feelings that he neither gave nor asked for sympathy he was older than his associates but years had never reconciled him to latin or greek or for that matter to mathematics in simple or aggravated form he had been the bully of his village out in northern iowa and when a stranger came he trounced him first and cemented the friendship afterward he liked hard knocks give and take he liked the school because there was the long football season in the autumn with the joy of battling with every sinew of the body alert and the humming of cheers indistinctly heard as he rammed through the yielding line then the spring meant long hours of romping over the smooth diamond cutting down impossible hits guarding first base like a bulldog pulling down the high ones smothering the wild throws that came ripping along the ground threatening to jump up against his eyes throws that other fellows dodged he was in the company of equals of good fighters like charley de soto hickey flash condit and turkey fellows it was a joy to fight beside also it was good to feel that four hundredodd wearers of the red and black put their trust in him and that trust became very sacred to him he played hard very hard but cleanly because combat was the joy of life to him he broke other rules not as a lark but out of the same fierce desire for battle to seek out danger wherever he could find it he had been caught fair and square and he knew that for that particular offense there was only one punishment yet he hoped against hope suddenly realizing what it would cost him to give up the great school where however he had never sought friendships or anything beyond the admiration of his mates the sympathy of the big man startled him then made him uncomfortable he had no intention of crying out and he did not like or understand the new emotion that rose in him as he wondered when his sentence would come well youngster he said gruffly had enough have another round ive had enough said the big man heaving a sigh let me treat butcher not today youngster butcher i id like to im awfully flush not today lets match for it what said the butcher fiercely dont let me hear any more of that talk youve got to grow up first the big man thus rebuked acquiesced meekly the two strolled back to the campus in silence suppose we have a catch said the big man tentatively all right said the butcher smiling intrenched behind a gigantic mit the big man strove valorously to hold the difficult balls after a long period of this mitigated pleasure they sat down to rest then cap kiefers stocky figure appeared around the dickinson and the butcher went off for a long solemn consultation the big man thus relieved of responsibility felt terribly alone he went to his room and took down volume two of the count of monte cristo and stretched out on the windowseat somehow the stupendous adventures failed to enthrall him it was still throughout the house he caught himself listening for the patter of hickeys shoes above dancing a breakdown or the rumble of eggheads laugh down the hall or a voice calling who can lend me a pair of suspenders and the window was empty it seemed so strange to look up from the printed page and find no one in the woodhull opposite shaving painfully at the window or lolling like himself over a novel all the time keeping an eye on the life below he could not jeer at two inches brown and crazy opdyke practicing curves nor assure them that the dickinson nine would just fatten on those easy ones no one halloed from house to house no voice below drawled out oh you great big man stick your head out of the window there was no one to call across for the time o day or for just a nickel to buy stamps or for the loan of a baseball glove or a sweater or a collar button scissors buttonhook or fifty and one articles that are never bought but borrowed the great big man let the count of monte cristo tumble unheeded on the floor seized a tennis ball and went across the campus to the esplanade of the upper house where for half an hour he bounced the ball against the rim of the ledge a privilege that only a fourth former may enjoy tiring of this he wandered down to the pond where he skimmed innumerable flat stones until he had exhausted the attractions of this limited amusement i im getting homesick he admitted finally i wish i had a dog something living around at suppertime he saw the butcher again and forgot his own loneliness in the concern he felt for his big friend he remembered that the butcher had said that if he were expelled he knew what he would do what had he meant by that something terrible he glanced up at the butcher and being very apprehensive made bold to ask butcher i say what does cap think he hasnt seen the doctor yet said the butcher hell see him tonight i guess ill go over myself just to leave a callingcard accordin to etiquette the big man kept his own counsel but when the butcher after dinner disappeared through the awful portal of foundation house he sat down in the dark under a distant tree to watch in a short five minutes the butcher reappeared stood a moment undecided on the steps stooped picked up a handful of gravel flung it into the air with a laugh and started along the circle butcher hello whos that its me butcher said the big man slipping his hand into the others i i wanted to know you arent going to get sentimental are you youngster said stevens disapprovingly please butcher said the great big man pleadingly dont be cross with me is there any hope the doctor wont see me young one said the butcher but the atmosphere was not encouraging im sorry honest honest they went hand in hand over to the chapel where they chose the back steps and settled down with the great walls at their back and plenty of gravel at their feet to fling aimlessly into the dusky night butcher well big man what will you do if if they fire you oh lots of things ill go hunting for gold somewhere or strike out for south america or africa oh the big man was immensely relieved but he added incredulously then youll give up football and baseball looks that way you wont mind yes said the butcher suddenly i will mind ill hate to leave the old school id like to have one chance more why dont you tell the doctor that never i dont cry out when im caught youngster i take my punishment yes said the big man reflecting thats right i suppose but then theres the team to think of you know they sat for a long time in silence broken suddenly by the butchers voice not so gruff as usual say big man feeling sort of homesick no answer just a bit still no answer the butcher looked down and saw the big man struggling desperately to hold in the sobs here none of that youngster he exclaimed in alarm brace up old man i im all right said the great big man with difficulty its nothing the butcher patted him on the shoulder and then drew his arm around the little body the big man put his head down and blubbered just as though he had been a little fellow while his companion sat perplexed wondering what to do or say in the strange situation so hes a little homesick is he he said lamely noo said the great big man not just that its its all the fellows i miss the butcher was silent he too began to understand that feeling only he in his battling pride resisted fiercely the weakness youve got an uncle somewhere havent you youngster he said gently doesnt he look after you in vacationtime i dont miss him replied the big man shaking his head then he pulled himself together and said apologetically its just being left behind that makes me such a damned crybaby youngster said the butcher sternly your language is atrocious such words do not sound well in the mouth of a suckling of your size i didnt mean to said the big man blushing you must leave something to grow up for young man said the butcher profoundly now tell me about that uncle of yours i dont fancy his silhouette the great big man thus encouraged poured out his lonely starved little heart while the butcher listened sympathetically feeling a certain comfort in sitting with his arm around a little fellowbeing not that he was sensible of giving much comfort his comments he felt were certainly inadequate nor did he measure in any way up to the situation now its better eh big man he said at last when the little fellow had stopped does you sort of good to talk things out oh yes thank you butcher all right then youngster all right i say you you dont ever feel that way do you homesick i mean not much youve got a home havent you quite too much young one if they fire me ill keep away from there strike out for myself of course then its different young one said the butcher suddenly thats not quite honest if i have to clear out of here it will cut me up considerable honest a fact i didnt know it before but it will cut me up to strike out and leave all this behind i want another chance and do you know why why id like to make friends oh i havent got any real friends youngster you neednt shake your head its my fault i know it youre the first mortal soul who cared what became of me all the rest are thinking of the team now butcher dont think im crying out said the butcher in instant alarm its all been up to me truth is ive been too darned proud but id like to get another whack at it perhaps you will butcher no no theres no reason why i should the butcher sat solemnly a moment flinging pebbles down into the dark tennis courts suddenly he said look here big man im going to give you some good advice all right butcher and i want you to tuck it away in your thinker savez youre a nice kid now a good sort but youve got a lot of chances for being spoiled dont get fresh dont get a swelled head just because a lot of the older fellows let you play around theres nothing so hateful in the sight of god or man as a fresh kid you dont think began the big man in dismay no youre all right now youre quiet and dont tag around and youre a good sort darned if you arent and thats why i dont want to see you spoiled now a straight question do you smoke why that is well butcher i did try once a puff on snookers cigarette you ought to be spanked said the butcher angrily and when i get hold of snookers ill tan him the idea of his letting you dont you monkey around tobacco yet a while first of all its fresh and second youve got to grow you want to make a team dont you while youre here ooh said the great big man with a long sigh then just stick to growing cause youve got work cut out for you there now im not preachin im saying that you want to fill out and grow up and do something harkee all right cut out snookers and that gang pick out the fellows that count as you go along and just remember this if you forget the rest if you want to put ducks in tabbys bed or nail down his desk do it because you want to do it not because some other fellow wants you to do it dye hear yes butcher remember that youngster if id stuck to it id kept out of a peck of trouble he reflected a moment and added then id study a little its not a bad thing i guess in the long run and it gets the masters on your side and now jump up and well trot home the following night the big man again under his tree waited for the result of the conference that was going on inside foundation house between the doctor and the butcher and cap kiefer it was long very long the minutes went slowly and it was very dark there with hardly a light showing in the circle of houses that ordinarily seemed like a procession of lighted ferryboats after an interminable hour the butcher and cap came out he needed no word to tell what their attitudes showed only too plainly the butcher was expelled the big man waited until the two had passed into the night and then with a sudden resolve went bravely to the doorbell and rang before he quite appreciated the audacity of his act he found himself in the sanctum facing a muchperplexed head master doctor i i the big man stopped overwhelmed by the awful majesty of the doctor on whose face still sat the grimness of the past conference well joshua whats the matter said the head master relaxing a bit before one of his favorites please sir im a little a little embarrassed im afraid said the great big man desperately am i so terrible as all that said the doctor smiling yes sir you are the big man replied frankly then he said plunging in doctor is the butcher is stevens are you going to expel him that is my painful duty joshua said the doctor frowning oh doctor said the big man all in a breath you dont know youre making a mistake i am why joshua because you dont know because the butcher wont tell you hes too proud sir because he doesnt want to cry out sir what do you mean exactly said the doctor in surprise does stevens know youre here oh heavens no sir said the big man in horror and you must never tell him sir that would be too terrible joshua said the doctor impressively i am expelling stevens because he is just the influence i dont want boys of your age to come under oh yes sir said the big man i know you think that sir but really doctor thats where you are wrong really you are sir the doctor saw there was something under the surface and he encouraged the little fellow to talk the big man forgetting all fear in the seriousness of the situation told the listening head master all the butchers conversation with him on the chapel steps the night before told it simply and eloquently with an ardor that bespoke absolute faith then suddenly he stopped thats all sir he said frightened the doctor rose and walked back and forth troubled and perplexed there was no doubting the sincerity of the recital it was a side of stevens he had not guessed finally he turned and rested his hand on the big mans shoulders thank you he said it does put another light on the question ill think it over when ten days later the school came trickling home along the road from vacation they saw against all hope the butcher holding down first base frolicking over the diamond in the old familiar way and a great shout of joy and relief went up but how it had happened no one ever knew least of all cap and the butcher who had gone from foundation house that night in settled despair to add to butchers mystification the doctor in announcing his reprieve had added ive decided to make a change stevens im going to put tibbetts in to room with you i place him in your charge im going to try a little responsibility on you footnotes a reprinted by special permission from the prodigious hickey copyright by little brown and company b the shell is the lowest class illustration ii a twilight adventurec by melville davisson post a good many boys are fortunate in their aunts and uncles such a one was martin with his uncle abner the experiences they had together down in the mountains of virginia were very remarkable and often most desperate as in the case of the following story but one of the many set down by martin grown to be a man in the book from which this was taken but its enough to make you boys wish you too lived with an uncle abner in a similar early virginia settlement with the wild forests so near at hand the editor it was a strange scene that we approached before a crossroad leading into a grove of beech trees a man sat on his horse with a rifle across his saddle he did not speak until we were before him in the road and then his words were sinister ride on he said but my uncle abner did not ride on he pulled up his big chestnut and looked calmly at the man you speak like one having authority he said the man answered with an oath ride on or youll get into trouble abners eyes traveled over the speaker with a deliberate scrutiny then he answered are the roads of virginia held by arms this one is replied the man i think not replied my uncle abner and touching his horse with his heel he turned into the crossroad the man seized his weapon and i heard the hammer click under his thumb abner must have heard it too but he did not turn his broad back he only called to me in his usual matteroffact voice go on martin i will overtake you the man brought his gun up to his middle but he did not shoot he was like all those who undertake to command obedience without having first determined precisely what they will do if their orders are disregarded he was prepared to threaten with desperate words but not to support that threat with a desperate act and he hung there uncertain cursing under his breath i would have gone on as my uncle had told me to do but now the man came to a decision no he said if he goes in you go in too and he seized my bridle and turned my horse into the crossroad then he followed there is a long twilight in these hills the sun departs but the day remains a sort of weird dim elfin day that dawns at sunset and envelops and possesses the world the land is full of light but it is the light of no heavenly sun it is a light equal everywhere as though the earth strove to illumine itself and succeeded with that labor the stars are not yet out now and then a pale moon rides in the sky but it has no power and the light is not from it the wind is usually gone the air is soft and the fragrance of the fields fills it like a perfume the noises of the day and of the creatures that go about by day cease and the noises of the night and of the creatures that haunt the night begin the bat swoops and circles in the maddest action but without a sound the eye sees him but the ear hears nothing the whippoorwill begins his plaintive cry and one hears but does not see it is a world that we do not understand for we are creatures of the sun and we are fearful lest we come upon things at work here of which we have no experience and that may be able to justify themselves against our reason and so a man falls into silence when he travels in this twilight and he looks and listens with his senses out on guard it was an old wagonroad that we entered with the grass growing between the ruts the horses traveled without a sound until we began to enter a grove of ancient beech trees then the dead leaves cracked and rustled abner did not look behind him and so he did not know that i came he knew that some one followed but he doubtless took it for the sentinel in the road and i did not speak the man with the cocked gun rode grimly behind me i did not know whither we went or to what end we might be shot down from behind a tree or murdered in our saddles it was not a land where men took desperate measures upon a triviality and i knew that abner rode into something that little men lacking courage would gladly have stayed out of presently my ear caught a sound or rather a confused mingling of sounds as of men digging in the earth it was faint and some distance beyond us in the heart of the beech woods but as we traveled the sound increased and i could distinguish the strokes of the mattock and the thrust of the shovel and the clatter of the earth on the dry leaves these sounds seemed at first to be before us and then a little later off on our righthand and finally through the gray boles of the beech trees in the lowland i saw two men at work digging a pit they had just begun their work for there was little earth thrown out but there was a great heap of leaves that they had cleared away and heavy cakes of the baked crust that the mattocks had pried up the length of the pit lay at right angles to the road and the men were working with their backs towards us they were in their shirts and trousers and the heavy mottled shadows thrown by the beech limbs hovered on their backs and shoulders like a flock of night birds the earth was baked and hard the mattock rang on it and among the noises of their work they did not hear us i saw abner look off at this strange labor his head half turned but he did not stop and we went on the old wagonroad made a turn into the low ground i heard the sound of horses and a moment later we came upon a dozen men i shall not easily forget that scene the beech trees had been deadened by some settler who had chopped a ring around them and they stood gaunt with a few tattered leaves letting the weird twilight in some of the men stood about others sat on the fallen trees and others in their saddles but upon every man of that grim company there was the air and aspect of one who waits for something to be finished an old man with a heavy irongray beard smoked a pipe puffing out great mouthfuls of smoke with a sort of deliberate energy another whittled a stick cutting a bull with horns and shaping his work with the nicest care and still another traced letters on the pommel of his saddle with his thumbnail a little to one side a great pronged beech thrust out a gray arm and under it two men sat on their horses their elbows strapped to their bodies and their mouths gagged with a saddlecloth and behind them a man in his saddle was working with a colt halter unraveling the twine that bound the headpiece and seeking thereby to get a greater length of rope illustration some of the men stood about behind them two men sat on their horses their elbows strapped to their bodies this was the scene when i caught it first but a moment later when my uncle rode into it the thing burst into furious life men sprang up caught his horse by the bit and covered him with weapons some one called for the sentinel who rode behind me and he galloped up for a moment there was confusion then the big man who had smoked with such deliberation called out my uncles name others repeated it and the panic was gone but a ring of stern determined faces were around him and before his horse and with the passing of the flash of action there passed no whit of the grim purpose upon which these men were set my uncle looked about him lemuel arnold he said nicholas vance hiram ward you here as my uncle named these men i knew them they were cattle grazers ward was the big man with the pipe the men with them were their renters and drovers their lands lay nearest to the mountains the geographical position made for feudal customs and a certain independence of action they were on the border they were accustomed to say and had to take care of themselves and it ought to be written that they did take care of themselves with courage and decision and on occasion they also took care of virginia their fathers had pushed the frontier of the dominion northward and westward and had held the land they had fought the savage singlehanded and desperately by his own methods and with his own weapons ruthless and merciless eye for eye and tooth for tooth they returned what they were given they did not send to virginia for militia when the savage came they fought him at their doors and followed him through the forest and took their toll of death they were hardier than he was and their hands were heavier and bloodier until the old men in the tribes of the ohio valley forbade these raids because they cost too much and turned the war parties south into kentucky certain historians have written severely of these men and their ruthless methods and prattled of humane warfare but they wrote nursing their soft spines in the security of a civilization which these mens hands had builded and their words are hollow abner said ward let me speak plainly we have got an account to settle with a couple of cattle thieves and we are not going to be interfered with cattle stealing and murder have got to stop in these hills weve had enough of it well replied my uncle i am the last man in virginia to interfere with that we have all had enough of it and we are all determined that it must cease but how do you propose to end it with a rope said ward it is a good way replied abner when it is done the right way what do you mean by the right way said ward i mean answered my uncle that we have all agreed to a way and we ought to stick to our agreement now i want to help you to put down cattle stealing and murder but i want also to keep my word and how have you given your word in the same way that you have given yours said abner and as every man here has given his our fathers found out that they could not manage the assassin and the thief when every man undertook to act for himself so they got together and agreed upon a certain way to do these things now we have indorsed what they agreed to and promised to obey it and i for one would like to keep my promise the big mans face was puzzled now it cleared you mean the law call it what you like replied abner it is merely the agreement of everybody to do certain things in a certain way the man made a decisive gesture with a jerk of his head well he said were going to do this thing our own way my uncles face became thoughtful then he said you will injure some innocent people you mean these two blacklegs and ward indicated the prisoners with a gesture of his thumb my uncle lifted his face and looked at the two men some distance away beneath the great beech as though he had but now observed them i was not thinking of them he answered i was thinking that if men like you and lemuel arnold and nicholas vance violate the law lesser men will follow your example and as you justify your act for security they will justify theirs for revenge and plunder and so the law will go to pieces and a lot of weak and innocent people who depend upon it for security will be left unprotected these were words that i have remembered because they put the danger of lynch law in a light i had not thought of but i saw that they would not move these determined men their blood was up and they received them coldly abner said ward we are not going to argue this thing with you there are times when men have to take the law into their own hands we live here at the foot of the mountain our cattle are stolen and run across the border into maryland we are tired of it and we intend to stop it our lives and our property are menaced by a set of reckless desperate devils that we have determined to hunt down and hang to the first tree in sight we did not send for you you pushed your way in here and now if you are afraid of breaking the law you can ride on because we are going to break it if to hang a pair of murderous devils is to break it i was astonished at my uncles decision well he said if the law must be broken i will stay and help you break it very well replied ward but dont get a wrong notion in your head abner if you choose to stay you put yourself on a footing with everybody else and that is precisely what i want to do replied abner but as matters stand now every man here has an advantage over me what advantage abner said ward the advantage answered my uncle that he has heard all the evidence against your prisoners and is convinced that they are guilty if that is all the advantage abner replied ward you shall not be denied it there has been so much cattle stealing here of late that our people living on the border finally got together and determined to stop every drove going up into the mountains that wasnt accompanied by somebody that we knew was all right this afternoon one of my men reported a little bunch of about a hundred steers on the road and i stopped it these two men were driving the cattle i inquired if the cattle belonged to them and they replied that they were not the owners but that they had been hired to take the drove over into maryland i did not know the men and as they met my inquiries with oaths and imprecations i was suspicious of them i demanded the name of the owner who had hired them to drive the cattle they said it was none of my damned business and went on i raised the county we overtook them turned their cattle into a field and brought them back until we could find out who the drove belonged to on the road we met bowers he turned and indicated the man who was working with the rope halter i knew the man he was a cattle shipper somewhat involved in debt but who managed to buy and sell and somehow keep his head above water he told us the truth yesterday evening he had gone over on the stonecoal to look at daniel coopmans cattle he had heard that some grazer from your county abner was on the way up to buy the cattle for stockers he wanted to get in ahead of your man so he left home that evening and got to coopmans place about sundown he took a short cut on foot over the hill and when he came out he saw a man on the opposite ridge where the road runs ride away the man seemed to have been sitting on his horse looking down into the little valley where coopmans house stands bowers went down to the house but coopman was not there the door was open and bowers says the house looked as though coopman had just gone out of it and might come back any moment there was no one about because coopmans wife had gone on a visit to her daughter over the mountains and the old man was alone bowers thought coopman was out showing the cattle to the man whom he had just seen ride off so he went out to the pasture field to look for him he could not find him and he could not find the cattle he came back to the house to wait until coopman should come in he sat down on the porch as he sat there he noticed that the porch had been scrubbed and was still wet he looked at it and saw that it had been scrubbed only at one place before the door this seemed to him a little peculiar and he wondered why coopman had scrubbed his porch only in one place he got up and as he went toward the door he saw that the jamb of the door was splintered at a point about halfway up he examined this splintered place and presently discovered that it was a bullet hole this alarmed him and he went out into the yard there he saw a wagon track leading away from the house toward the road in the weeds he found coopmans watch he picked it up and put it into his pocket it was a big silver watch with coopmans name on it and attached to it was a buckskin string he followed the track to the gate where it entered the road he discovered then that the cattle had also passed through this gate it was now night bowers went back got coopmans saddle horse out of the stable rode him home and followed the track of the cattle this morning but he saw no trace of the drove until we met him what did shifflet and twiggs say to this story inquired abner they did not hear it answered ward bowers did not talk before them he rode aside with us when we met him did shifflet and twiggs know bowers said abner i dont know replied ward their talk was so foul when we stopped the drove that we had to tie their mouths up is that all said abner ward swore a great oath no he said do you think we would hang men on that from what bowers told us we thought shifflet and twiggs had killed daniel coopman and driven off his cattle but we wanted to be certain of it so we set out to discover what they had done with coopmans body after they had killed him and what they had done with the wagon we followed the trail of the drove down to the valley river no wagon had crossed but on the other side we found that a wagon and a drove of cattle had turned out of the road and gone along the basin of the river for about a mile through the woods and there in a bend of the river we found where these devils had camped there had been a great fire of logs very near to the river but none of the ashes of this fire remained from a circular space some twelve feet in diameter the ashes had all been shoveled off the marks of the shovel being distinct in the center of the place where this fire had burned the ground had been scraped clean but near the edges there were some traces of cinders and the ground was blackened in the river at this point just opposite the remains of the fire was a natural washout or hole we made a raft of logs cut a pole with a fork on the end and dragged the river we found most of the wagon iron all showing the effect of fire then we fastened a tin bucket to a pole and fished the washout we brought up cinders buttons buckles and pieces of bone ward paused that settled it and we came back here to swing the devils up my uncle had listened very carefully and now he spoke what did the man pay twiggs and shifflet said my uncle did they tell you that when you stopped the drove now that answered ward was another piece of damning evidence when we searched the men we found a pocketbook on shifflet with a hundred and fifteen dollars and some odd cents it was daniel coopmans pocketbook because there was an old tax receipt in it that had slipped down between the leather and the lining we asked shifflet where he got it and he said that the fifteen dollars and the change was his own money and that the hundred had been paid to him by the man who had hired them to drive the cattle he explained his possession of the pocketbook by saying that this man had the money in it and when he went to pay them he said that they might just as well take it too who was this man said abner they will not tell who he was why not now abner cried ward why not indeed because there never was any such man the story is a lie out of the whole cloth the proof is all dead against them well replied my uncle what circumstantial evidence proves depends a good deal on how you get started it is a somewhat dangerous road to the truth because all the signboards have a curious trick of pointing in the direction that you are going now a man will never realize this unless he turns around and starts back then he will see to his amazement that the signboards have also turned but as long as his face is set one certain way it is of no use to talk to him he wont listen to you and if he sees you going the other way he will call you a fool there is only one way in this case said ward there are always two ways in every case replied abner that the suspected person is either guilty or innocent you have started upon the theory that shifflet and twiggs are guilty now suppose you had started the other way what then well said ward what then this then continued abner you stop shifflet and twiggs on the road with daniel coopmans cattle and they tell you that a man has hired them to drive this drove into maryland you believe that and start out to find the man you find bowers bowers went deadly white for gods sake abner he said but my uncle was merciless and he drove in the conclusion what then there was no answer but the faces of the men about my uncle turned toward the man whose trembling hands fingered the rope that he was preparing for another but the things we found abner said ward what do they prove continued my uncle now that the signboards are turned that somebody killed daniel coopman and drove off his cattle and afterward destroyed the body and the wagon in which it was hauled away but who did that the men who were driving daniel coopmans cattle or the man who was riding daniel coopmans horse and carrying daniel coopmans watch in his pocket wards face was a study in expression ah cried abner remember that the signboards have turned about and what do they point to if we read them on the way we are going now the man who killed coopman was afraid to be found with the cattle so he hired twiggs and shifflet to drive them into maryland for him and follows on another road but his story abner said ward and what of it replied my uncle he is taken and he must explain how he comes by the horse that he rides and the watch that he carries and he must find the criminal well he tells you a tale to fit the facts that you will find when you go back to look and he gives you shifflet and twiggs to hang i never saw a man in more mortal terror than jacob bowers he sat in his saddle like a man bewildered my god he said and again he repeated it and again and he had cause for that terror on him my uncle was stern and ruthless the pendulum had swung the other way and the lawless monster that bowers had allied was now turning on himself he saw it and his joints were unhinged with fear a voice crashed out of the ring of desperate men uttering the changed opinion by god it cried weve got the right man now and one caught the rope out of bowers hand but my uncle abner rode in on them are you sure about that he said sure they echoed you have shown it yourself abner no replied my uncle i have not shown it i have shown merely whither circumstantial evidence leads us when we go hotfoot after a theory bowers says that there was a man on the hill above daniel coopmans house and this man will know that he did not kill daniel coopman and that his story is the truth they laughed in my uncles face do you believe that there was any such person my uncle seemed to increase in stature and his voice became big and dominant i do he said because i am the man they had got their lesson and we rode out with shifflet and twiggs to a legal trial footnote c reprinted from uncle abner copyright by d appleton and company illustration iii tad sheldon secondclass scoutd by john fleming wilson a good many scout stories have been published hundreds of them surely maybe a thousand or more in the last nine years but the first scout story published in the united states was tad sheldon secondclass scout it appeared first in the saturday evening post the author has written a good many stories scout and otherwise since then but none better i think than this and i count it good fortune indeed that i am able to include it in this volume of short stories for boys the editor there is no harrm in the story though it speaks ill for us big people with misther to our names said chief engineer mickey orourke balancing his coffee cup between his two scarred hands ye remimber the lasht toime i was on leave and i wint down to yaquina bay with captain tyler on his tin gas schooner thinkin to mesilf it was a holiday and all the fun i had was insthructin the gasoline engineer in the mysteries of how to expriss ones sintimints without injurin the skippers feelins well i landed in the bay and walked about in the woods which is foine for the smell of thim which is like fresh tar and one afternoon i find two legs and small feet stickin out of a hole under a stump i pulled on the two feet and the legs came out and at the end of thim a bhoy mad with rage and dirt in his eyes ye have spoiled me fun says he lookin at me very fierce do yez dig yer fun out of the ground like coal i demands im investigating the habits of squirrels says he i must find out how a squirrel turns round in his hole does he turn a summersault or stick his tail between his ears and go over backward he turns inside out like an ould sock i informs him and he scorns me natural history on the strength of mutual language we get acquainted he is tad sheldon the eldest son of surfman no of the lifesaving crew he is fourteen years ould me bould tad has troubles of his own consisting of five other youngsters who are his gang we are preparing to inter the ranks of the bhoy scouts he tells me settin be the side of the squirrelhole we are all tenderfeet and we cant get enlisted with the rest of the bhoys in the united states because each scout must have a dollar in the bank and between the six of us we have only one dollar and six bits and thats in me mothers apron pocket and in no bank at all explain says i tis this way says me young sprig all the bhoys in the country of america have joined the scouts which is an army of felleys that know the woods and about animals and how to light a fire and know the law stop i orders no one knows the law without gold in one hand and a book in the other if ye knew the law ye would have yer dollar tis the scouts law says he it tells ye to obey yer superiors and be fair to animals and kind to people ye care little for ye must know how to take care of yourself anywhere and be ready whin the country needs ye and ye need a dollar i asks thin why not work for it and stop pokin yer nose down squirrelholes where there is neither profit nor wages because im to be the patrolleader and i must know more than me men he retorts now ye remimber i had in me pocket three pay checks besides the money of mr lof the second engineer which i had got for him and was carryin about to send to him by the first friend i saw so i took off me cap and pulled out one of the checks and said me bould boy go down to the town and get the cash for this bring it back to me and ill give ye a dollar and thin ye can become a scout the lad looked at me and then at the governmint check he shook his head till the dirt rolled into his ears for he was still full of the clods he had rubbed into himself in the hole i cant take a dollar from a man in the service he says i must earn it the governmints money is clane i rebukes him im ould and me legs ends just above me feet so that i walk with difficulty tis worth a dollar to get the coin without trampin i will earn it from somebody not in the service says me bould boy with great firmness im no surfman thank hivin i remarks im in the establishmint and look down on ye if id known ye were a lighthouse man id have taken all ye had at first he retorts but ye have made me a fair offer and i forgive ye my father works for his living well says i seein that it was poor fortune to be quarrelin with a slip of a kid do yez want the dollar or not and at that we got down to fact and he explained that this scout business was most important it appeared that the other five bhoys depinded on him to extricate thim from their difficulties and set them all up as scouts with uniforms and knives and a knowledge of wild animals and how to build a fire in a bucket of watther we debated the thing back and forth till the sun dropped behind the trees and the could air came up from the ground and stuck me with needles of rheumatism the lad was a good lad and he made plain to me why his dollar was harrd to get he had thought of savin the life of a summer visitor but the law read that he must save life anyhow without lookin for pay and we cant all save lives he mourns for some of the kids is too young but ye must earn money ye scut i says yere fourteen and whin i was that age i was me mothers support and joy i made four shillins a wake mixin plaster for a tilelayer i work he responds dolefully but it goes to me mother to put with the savings in the bank against the time me father will be drowned and leave us without support for ye must know that we lifesavers get no pensions i niver heared of a lifesaver bein drowned i remarks but it may be for i see ye are of an exthraordinary family and anything may come to such how many are there of yez there are six of us childher all gurrls but mesilf says he with rage in his voice and carson he was no broke his hip in a wreck last year and died of the bruise and left five which the crew is lookin after young carson is one of me gang and makes a dollar and four bits a week deliverin clams to the summer folks ye see he cant save a dollar for the bank and we got up and discussed the matther going down the hill toward the town before we parted tad tould me where he lived id call on yer father and mother says i if i cud be sure they would appreciate the honor tis a comedown for an officer in the lighthouse establishmint to inter the door of a surfman me father has a kind heart and is good to the ould he answers me we live beyond the station on the bluff with that we went our ways and i ate an imminse meal in the hotel with the dishes all spread out before me and a pretty gurrl behind me shoulder to point out the best of thim thin i walked out and started for the house of me bould tad i found thim all seated in the parlor excipt the missus who was mixin bread in the kitchen i introduced mesilf and sheldon who had no on his sleeve offered me a pipe which i took i came down to business houldin me cap full of checks and money on me lap yer bould bhoy wants to be a scout and lacks a dollar i says i like his looks though i discovered him in a hole under a tree he wont take me money and scorns me and the establishmint he must earn it he answers scowlin over his pipe but ill spind it i insists peerin at the bhoy out of the tail of me eye if yer town werent dhry id have given it to the saloon man for the good of the family he hasnt got so why bilge at a single dollar tis the scouts law puts in me bould tad i must make it honestly and he settled his head between his hands and gazed reproachfully at the clane floor so i saved me money and sat till eight oclock exchangin complimints with misther sheldon thin the bell rang on the hill beyond the station and he pulled his cap off the dresser kissed his wife and the five gurrls and wint out to his watch and a good sleep while he was gone i stood in the doorway and missus sheldon tould me of the little carsons and how missus carson had sworn niver to marry again excipt in the lifesaving service she says the governmint took away her husband and her support says the good lady and shell touch no money excipt governmint checks being used to thim and uncle sam owin her the livin he took away with five childher she shud look up and marry one of the men in the establishment i informs her they are good husbands and make money though a widow she has pride she responds sharply and i left with young tad follerin at me heels till i let him overtake me and whisper if yed buy some clams off of young carson it wud help the widow i am starved for clams i whispers back like a base conspirator for the hand of the lovely gurrl in the castle show me the house of me bould carson he pointed to a light through the thin woods they thought i was crazy whin i returned to the hotel with a hundred pounds of clams dripping down me back i dug thim with me own hands this night i tould the man in the office cook thim all for me breakfast yere a miracle of strength and endurance under watther says he for tis now high tide and the surf is heavy i found their tracks in the road and followed thim to their lair i retorts do i get thim for breakfast and in the morrin whin i was that full of clams that i needed a shell instead of a weskit i walked on the beach with the admirin crowds of summer tourists and lovely women it was fine weather and the little ones were barefooted and the old ones bareheaded and the wind was gentle and the lifesavers were polishin their boat in full view of the wondherin throng and i thought of this ould tub out here on the ind of a chain and pitied thim all thin i sthrolled around the point to the bay and found me bould tad dhrillin his gang in an ould skiff with homemade oars in their little fists and tad sthandin in the sternsheets with a huge steerin sweep between his arms and much loud language in his mouth when i appeared they looked at me and tad swung his boat up to the beach and invited me in we will show you a dhrill ye will remimber says he very polite and with my steppin in he thrust the skiff off and the bhoys rowed with tremenjous strength we wint along a full three knots an hour till he yelled another ordher and the bhoys dropped their oars and jumped over to one side and i found mesilf undher the boat with me mouth full of salt watther and ropes whin i saw the sun again me bould tad says to me with disapprobation ye arent experienced in capsize dhrill in the establishment we use boats to keep us out of the watther i responds hunting for the papers out of me cap the newspapers are full of rebukes for thim that rock boats to their own peril with that they all felt ashamed and picked up me papers and grunted at each other tryin to blame somebody else and when i had me checks and me papers all safe again i smiled on thim and me bould tad took heart tis not to tip the boat over says he but to get it back on an even keel after a seas capsized her that is the point of the dhrill and we pulled ashore to dhry whiles we were sittin on the sand drainin the watther out of our shoes a small brassy launch came down the bay with many men and women on her little decks me bould tad looked at her with halfshut eyes and snorted some day it will be the lifesaving crew that must bring those ninnies back to their homes he says the pacific is nothing to fool with in a gasoline launch tis betther to be safe and buy your fish and we watched the launch chug by and out on the bar and to sea i learned that she was the gladys by name and fetched tourists to the fishing grounds nine miles down the coast all the bhoys were respictful to me excipt young carson who recognized in me bould mickey the man who had asked for a hundredweight of clams he stared at me superciliously and refused to have speech with me bein ashamed if i can judge of his youthful thoughts of bein in the same company with a fool but i discovered that the gang was all bent on becomin what they called secondclass scouts which they made plain to me was betther by one than a tenderfoot but they niver mintioned the lackings of the dollar bein gintlemin they wanted to know of me whether i thought that boatmanship and knowledge of sailing would be accipted be the powers instid of wisdom as to birdtracks and intimacy with wild animals and bugs and the heart of me opened the youth of me came back and i spoke to thim as one lad to another with riference to me years in a steamer and the need of hard hands and a hard head the ind of it was that they rolled across the sand to me side and we all lay belly down over a chart which me bould tad had procured after the manner of bhoys and they explained to me how they knew the coast for twelve miles each side of yaquina bay with the tides and currents all plain in their heads and i was surprised at what the young scuts knew god save thim at noon the visitors suddenly stopped lookin at the scenery and hastened away with hunger in their eyes the crew ran the surfboat back into the station and the bhoys drew their skiff up out of harrms way and i wint back to me hotel and more clams on the steps i found young carson grinning like a cat ye dont have to eat thim shell fish says he lookin away gimme the sack of thim and ill peddle thim to the tourists and bring ye the money whisht and away with ye i commanded who are you to be dictatin the diet of yer betthers and he fled without glancin behind him there was some remarrks passed upon me wet clothes but i tould the clerk in the office that me duty often called me to get drippin soaked and went into the dininroom with a stiff neck under me proud chin there were but few in the place and the gurrl stood by me shoulder to pilot me through the various coorses inforrmed me that the most of the guests were out on the gladys fishin and the most of thim will have little appetite for their dinners she mused gently thereby rebukin me for a second helpin of the fresh meat in the afternoon i sthrolled out on the beach again but saw little a heavy fog was rowlin from the norard and the breeze before it was chill and damp as a widows bed i walked for me health for an hour and then ran to kape warrm at the ind of my spurt i was amazed to find mesilf exactly at the hotel steps i wint in and laid me down be the fire and slept i woke to hear a woman wailin whin me eyes were properly open and both pointed in the same direction i found mesilf in the midst of a crowd the sittinroom was full of people all with misery in their faces the woman whose cries had woke me was standin be the windey with one hand around a handkerchief my god she was sayin my god and me bhoy is on that boat and i knew that it was throuble and that many people would have their heads in their hands that night with aches in their throats i got up shoes in me hand at sight of me bright uniforrm ten men flung themselves on me you will help save them they cried at me i will so soon as i get me shoes on i remarrked pushing them off me toes i put on me boots and stood up now ill save thim says i where are they theyre on the gladys says three at once thirty of our people women and men and childher why wake me i demanded crosslike arent the brave lifesavers even now sitting be the fire waitin for people to come and be saved im a chief engineer in the lighthouse establishmint and we save no lives excipt whin we cant help it get the lifesaving crew and they explained to me bould mickey that the crew was gone twenty miles up the coast to rescue the men on a steam schooner that was wrecked off the siletz word of it having come down but two hours since they looked at me uniforrm and demanded their relatives at me hands i shoved them away and wint out to think in the prociss it occurred to me that the gladys might not be lost i wint back and asked thim how they knew it was time to mourn if that launch is ashore they are as close to the fire as they can get i tould thim and if she has gone down tis too late to dhry their stockings she is lost in the fog i was inforrmed she shud have been back at her wharf at four oclock twas now turned six and the bar was rough and blanketed in mist the captain of the harbor tug had stated with wise shakes of the head that the gladys cud do no more than lay outside the night and wait for sunshine and a smooth crossing i shoved thim away from me again and wint out to think it was a murrky fog that sort that slathers over the watther like thick oil beyond the hill i cud hear the surf pounding like a riveter in a boiler overhead was a sheet of gray cloud flying in curds before the wind and in me mouth was the taste of the deep sea blown in upon me with the scent of the storm two words with the skipper of the tug tould me the rest its coming on to blow a little from the southard said me bould mariner its so thick the gladys cant find her way back her passengers will be cold and hungry whin they returrn in the morrnin and will ye not go after thim i cant says he me steamer is built for the bay and one sea on the bar wud destroy the investmint the lifesaving crew is up north after a wreck is there no seagoin craft in this harbor i demands there is not says he captain tyler took his gas schooner down the coast yesterday so i sat down and thought wonderin how i cud sneak off me uniforrm and have peace for i knew me brass buttons wud keep me tongue busy all night explainin that i was not a special providence paid by the governmint to save fools from purgatry in me thoughts i heard a worrd in me ear i looked up twas me bould tad with a gang clustherin at his heels ye have followed the sea for many years says he i have followed it whin it was fair weather i responded but the most of the time the sea has chased me ahead of it me coattail is still wet from the times it caught me speak up what is it the bhoy pulled out of his jacket his ould chart and laid it before me the gladys is at anchor off these rocks says he layin a small finger on a spot and in this weather she will have to lie there as long as she can whin it blows she must up anchor and get out or go ashore here he moved his finger a mite and it rested on what meant rocks well i remarrks me father and all the bhoys fathers are gone up north to rescue the crew of a steam schooner thats wrecked before they get back it will be too late i thought what were ye thinkin ye scut says i fiercely he dropped one foot on the other and looked me between the eyes i was thinkin we wud go afther her and save her says he very bould i cast me eyes over the bunch of little felleys and laughed but me bould tad didnt wink theres people out there drownding says he weve dhrilled and we know all the ropes but we cant pull our skiff across the bar and the big boat is not for us bein the keepers orders and we havent the weight to pull it anyhow and he stared me out of me laugh theres no seagoin craft in the harbor i says to stop his nonsinse there is another launch he remarrks casually we looked at each other and he thin says can ye run a gasoline engine i have had to i inforrms him but i dislike the smell the owner of this launch is not here says me young sprig and he niver tould us not to take it if youll run the engine well be off and rescue the folks on the gladys be the saints i laughed to kill mesilf till the little brat up and remarrks to his gang these lighthouse officers wear a uniforrm and have no worrkin clothes at all not needin thim in their business so i parleyed with thim a momint to save me face and how will ye save thim thats dyin in deep watthers by tomorrow nobody can cross the bar im inforrmed and the skipper of the gladys dont know this coast well just pick him up and pilot him in but the bar i protests its too rough to cross a launch inwardbound even if ye can get out i know the soft places says the little sprig of a bhoy very proudly come on and if i dont come i inquired he leaned over and touched the brass buttons on me jacket ye have sworn to do your best says he ive not had a chance to take me oath yet as a secondclass scout but between ourselves we have done so i appeal to yez as one man to another i got up i niver expicted to serve undher so small a captain i remarks but that is neither here nor there where is that gasoline engine we stepped proudly off in the dusk me bould tad houldin himsilf very straight beside me and the gang marchin at our heels shoulder to shoulder prisintly we came to a wharf and ridin to the float below it was a big white launch cabined and decked tad jumped down and the gang folleyed thin i lowered mesilf down with dignity and intered the miserable engine room i have run every sort of engine and machine made by experts and other ignoramuses i balk at nothing the engine was new to me but i lit a lantern and examined its inwards with anxiety and superciliousness prisintly by the grace of god it started off a very small bhoy held the lantern for me while i adjusted the valves and the carbureter and this bould lad inforrmed me with pride that the leader had assigned him to me as my engineroom crew and whin the machine was revolvin with some speed that individal thrust his head in at the door to ask me if i was ready if ye are says that limb of wickedness we will start chief ye may start any time i says with great respict but whin well stop is another matther ye must keep her goin whiles we cross the bar he inforrms me with a straight look the little gong rang and i threw in the clutch and felt the launch slide away the jingle came and i opened her up twas a powerful machine and whin i felt the jerk and pull of her four cylinders i sint me assistant to find the gasoline tank and see whether we had oil enough thinks i if this machine eats up fuel like this we must een have enough and aplenty the bhoy came back with smut on his nose and sthated that the tank was full how do ye know i demanded ive helped the owner fill her up several times says the brat the leader insists that we know the insides of every boat on the bay tis part of our practice and whin we get to be scouts we will all run gasoline engines so we went along and the engines warrmed up and i trimmed the lantern and sat me down comfortable as a cat on a pan of dough thin there was a horrible rumpus on deck and some watther splashed down the back of me neck tis the bar says me proud engineroom crew balancin himsilf on the plates they are shovin dhrinks across it too fast for me i retorts as more watther simmers down oh the leader knows all the soft places he returns proudly this bould sprig and with a whoop we drove through a big felly that almost swamped us thin as far as i cud judge the worst was over prisintly we got into the trough of the sea and rowled along for an hour more then the jingle tinkled and i slowed down me bould tad stuck his head in at the little door the gladys is right inshore from us he remarks carelesslike we will signal her to up anchor and come with us he took me lantern and vanished whin i waited long enough for all the oil to have burned out of three lanterns i turned the engines over to me crew and stepped out on deck it was a weepin fog with more rowlin in all the time and the feel on me cheek was like that of a storrm i saw me bould tad on the little forad deck swingin his little lamp whats the matther with that scut of a skipper i inquires the boy was fair cryin with rage and shame he cannot undherstand the signal says he and tis dangerous to run closer to him in this sea if he dont understand yer signal says i tis useless to talk more to him with yer arrms use yer tongue and at that he raised a squeal that cud be heard a hundred feet the voice of him bein but a bhoys without noise and power let be says i ive talked me mind across the deep watthers many times and i filled me lungs and let out a blast that fetched everybody on deck on the other launch then i tould that skipper with rage in me throat that he must up anchor and folley us or be drownded with all his passengers dragging on his coattails through purgatry and he listened and prisintly we saw the gladys creep through the darkness and fog up till us when she crossed our stern me bould tad tould me to command her to folley us into port ravins and ragins were nothin to the language we traded across that watther for the five minutes necessary to knock loose the wits of that heathen mariner in the end he saw the light and the passengers that crowded his sloppy decks waved their arms and yelled with delight me bould tad went into the little pilot house and slammed the door he spoke to me sharply twill blow a gale before midnight he rang the bell for full speed ahead illustration i went to leeward and there found me bould tad launchin the little dingy an hour later i was signaled to stop me machines i dropped the clutch and sint me assistant for news he came back with big eyes the leader says the other launch cant make it across the bar he reports well i says were goin to take off her passengers and cross it oursilves says the brat with that he vanishes i folleyed him we were stopped right in the fog with roily waves towerin past us and the dull noise of the bar ahead of us the gladys was right astern of us and even in the darkness i cud catch a glimpse of white faces and hear little screams of women i went to leeward and there found me bould tad launchin the little dingy that was stowed on the roof of the cabin whin it was overside four of me bould gang drops into it and pulls away for the other launch theyll be swamped and drownded i remarrks they will not says tad i trained thim mesilf tis childs play childher play with queer toys in this counthry i continues to mesilf and i had a pain in me pit to see thim careerin on the big waves that looked nigh to breakin any minute but they came back with three women and a baby with nothin to say excipt theres thirtyone of thim leader leave the min says he real sharp tell the captain well come back for thim after weve landed the women safe i tucked the women down in the afther cabin snug and warm and wint back on deck the boat was away again swingin over the seas as easy as a bird thats good boatmanship i remarrks its young carson in command says me bould bhoy leader twas fifteen minutes before the boat came back and thin there was a man in it with two women whin it swung alongside tad helped out the ladies and thin pushed at the man with his foot back ye go he says no room on this craft for min but youre only a lot of bhoys says the man in a rage who are you to give orders ill come aboard ye will not says me bould tad and i reached into the engine room for a spanner whereby to back him up for i admired the spunk of the young sprig but the man stared into the lads face and said nothin and the boat pulled away with him still starin over his shouldher the nixt boatload was all the rest of the womenfolks and childher and tad ordered the dingy swung in and secured thin he turrned to me we will go in which way i demands he put his little hand to his ear hear it he asks calmly i listened and by the great hivins there was a whistlin buoy off in the darkness i wint down to me machines ive run me engines many a long night whin the devil was bruising his knuckles agin the plates beneath me but the nixt hour made me tin years ouldher for we hadnt moren got well started in before it was stop her and full speed ahead and ease her me assistant was excited but kept on spillin oil into the cups and feelin the bearins like an ould hand once whin the sea walloped over our little craft he grinned across at me there aint many soft places tonight says he yere a child of the ould nick says i and eat fire out of an asbestos spoon tis the scouts law not to be afraid retorrts me young demon but me attintion was distracted be a tremenjous scamperin overhead for the love of mercy what is that i yelled tis the leader puttin out the drag says me crew whin the breakers are high its safer to ride in with a drag over the stern it keeps the boat from broachin to and to the dot of his last word i felt the sudden strong pull of something on the launchs tail thin something lifted us up and laid us down with a slap like a pan of dough on a mouldin board me machines coughed and raced and thin almost stopped whin they were goin again i saw me assistant houldin to a stanchion his face was pasty white and he gulped are ye scared at last i demanded of him i am seasick he chokes back and he was be hivins so we joggled and bobbled about and i wondhered how many times we had crossed the bar from ind to ind whin suddenly it smoothed down and i saw a red light through the little windey me assistant saw it too thats the range light off the jetty says he were inside i shoved open the door to the deck and looked out the fog lay about us thick and the wind was risin i cud barely make out the lights ahead i stuck me head out and glanced astern way back of us like a match behind a curtain i saw a little light bobbing up and down in the fog i took me crew be the ear and thrust his head out beside mine what is that i demanded tis the other launch he says i guess they folleyed us in we ran up to the wharf and the gang made everything fast and then me bould tad comes to me with a sheepish face wud ye mind tellin the ladies and childher that they can go ashore and get to the hotel he says so it was me that wint in and tould the ladies they were saved and helped thim to the wharf and saw thim started for the hotel thin i came back to the launch but there was nobody there me bould gang had disappeared just thin the other launch came up limpin on one leg covered with drippin men and blasphemy they didnt wait for the lines to be put out but jumped for the float like rats out of biscuit barrels and swarmed for the hotel whiles i was watchin thim the skipper of the gladys pulls himself out of his wrecked pilot house and approaches me with heavy footfalls im toold that twas bhoys that manned this launch he remarrks if it is so i wudnt have come in and nearly lost me ship if it hadnt been for the bhoys yed now be driftin into the breakers off yer favorite fishin spot i retorrts nixt time ye try suicide leave the women and childher ashore and with the words out of me mouth the gale broke upon us like the blow of a fish we took shelter behind a warehouse and the skipper of the gladys said in me ear i suppose the owner of the launch had to get what crew he cud where is he id like to thank him if ye will come with me to the hotel ye shall see the man ye owe life to i inforrmed him as we intered the hotel a tall man with the marrk of autority on him observed me uniforrm and addressed me what do you know about this autority is always autority and i tould him what i knew and had seen not forbearin to mintion the gang and their wild ambitions and whin i had finished this man said i shall muster thim in tomorrow i happen to be in command of the scouts in this district but they havent their dollars to put in the little bank i remarked and they tell me without their dollar they cannot be secondclass scouts whativer that is at this a fat man reached for a hat off the hook and put his hand in his pocket drew it out and emptied it into the hat and passed it and while the money jingled into it my respict for the brave lads rose into me mouth they wont take it i said they have refused money before tis their oath the man with authority looked over at me the chief is right he said they have earned only a dollar apiece whose launch was that they took faith and i dont know i said they remarrked that the owner hivin bless him had niver forbidden thim to use it thin we must pay the rint of it for the night says he but the bhoys will get only a dollar apiece where are they they disappeared whin the boat was fast sir says i i think they wint home tis bedtime dye know where the patrolleader lives he demands so we walked up the hill in the darkness and wind till we reached the house of me bould tad a knock at the door brought the missus with a towel on her arrm i pushed in weve come to see yer son says i we stepped in and saw the young sprig be the fire on a chair with his feet in a bowl of watther and musthard he was for runnin whin he saw us but cudnt for the lack of clothes so he scowled at us this is the commander of the scouts i says inthroducin me tall companion and heres yer five dollars to put with yer dollar and six bits into the little bank sos yez can all of yez be secondclass scouts we cant take the money says he with a terrible growl the oath forbids us to take money for savin life dont be a hero i rebukes him yere only a small bhoy in his undherclothes with yer feet in hot watther and musthard no hero was ever in such a predicament this gintleman will inforrm ye about the money me bould companion looked at the slip of a lad and said sharply report to me tomorrow morning with yer patrol at sivin oclock to be musthered in with that we marrched out into the storrm and back to the hotel where i wint to slape like a bhoy mesilf me that was sixtyfour me last birthday and niver thought to make a fool of mesilf with a gang of bhoys and a gasoline engine and that on a holiday footnote d reprinted from tad sheldon boy scout by special permission of the macmillan company copyright by r harold paget illustration iv the redheaded league by arthur conan doyle i had called upon my friend mr sherlock holmes one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout floridfaced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair with an apology for my intrusion i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me you could not possibly have come at a better time my dear watson he said cordially i was afraid that you were engaged so i am very much so then i can wait in the next room not at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting with a quick little questioning glance from his small fatencircled eyes try the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in judicial moods i know my dear watson that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me i observed you will remember that i remarked the other day just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right now mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative i ask you not merely because my friend dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips as a rule when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat as he glanced down the advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee i took a good look at the man and endeavored after the fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance i did not gain very much however by my inspection our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman obese pompous and slow he wore rather baggy gray shepherds check trousers a not overclean black frockcoat unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament a frayed top hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him altogether look as i would there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labor that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he has been in china and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately i can deduce nothing else mr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion how in the name of good fortune did you know all that mr holmes he asked how did you know for example that i did manual labor its as true as gospel for i began as a ships carpenter your hands my dear sir you right hand is quite a size larger than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more developed well the snuff then and the freemasonry i wont insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arc and compass breastpin ah of course i forgot that but the writing what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk well but china the fish which you have tattooed immediately above your wrist could only have been done in china i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china when in addition i see a chinese coin hanging from your watchchain the matter becomes even more simple mr jabez wilson laughed heavily well i never said he i thought at first that you had done something clever but i see that there was nothing in it after all i begin to think watson said holmes that i make a mistake in explaining omne ignotum pro magnifico you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson yes i have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column here it is this is what began it all you just read it for yourself sir i took the paper from him and read as follows to the redheaded league on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pa u s a there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of four pounds a week for purely nominal services all redheaded men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twentyone years are eligible apply in person on monday at eleven oclock to duncan ross at the offices of the league popes court fleet street what on earth does this mean i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in high spirits it is a little off the beaten track isnt it said he and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes you will first make a note doctor of the paper and the date it is the morning chronicle of april just two months ago very good now mr wilson well it is just as i have been telling you mr sherlock holmes said jabez wilson mopping his forehead i have a small pawnbrokers business at coburg square near the city its not a very large affair and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living i used to be able to keep two assistants but now i only keep one and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business what is the name of this obliging youth asked sherlock holmes his name is vincent spaulding and hes not such a youth either its hard to say his age i should not wish a smarter assistant mr holmes and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him but after all if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his head why indeed you seem most fortunate in having an employee who comes under the full market price it is not a common experience among employers in this age i dont know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement oh he has his faults too said mr wilson never was such a fellow for photography snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures that is his main fault but on the whole hes a good worker theres no vice in him he is still with you i presume yes sir he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean thats all i have in the house for i am a widower and never had any family we live very quietly sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing more the first thing that put us out was that advertisement spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a redheaded man why that i asks why says he heres another vacancy on the league of the redheaded men its worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men so that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money if my hair would only change color heres a nice little crib all ready for me to step into why what is it then i asked you see mr holmes i am a very stayathome man and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the doormat in that way i didnt know much of what was going on outside and i was always glad of a bit of news have you never heard of the league of the redheaded men he asked with his eyes open never why i wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies and what are they worth i asked oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight and it need not interfere very much with ones other occupations well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears for the business has not been over good for some years and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy tell me all about it said i well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy and there is the address where you should apply for particulars as far as i can make out the league was founded by an american millionaire ezekiah hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways he was himself redheaded and he had a great sympathy for all redheaded men so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that color from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do but said i there would be millions of redheaded men who would apply not so many as you might think he answered you see it is really confined to londoners and to grown men this american had started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn then again i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but real bright blazing fiery red now if you cared to apply mr wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me he was very willing to have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement i never hope to see such a sight as that again mr holmes from north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement fleet street was choked with redheaded folk and popes court looked like a costers orange barrow i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement every shade of color they were straw lemon orange brick irishsetter liver clay but as spaulding said there were not many who had the real vivid flamecolored tint when i saw how many were waiting i would have given it up in despair but spaulding would not hear of it how he did it i could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office there was a double stream upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office your experience has been a most entertaining one remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff pray continue your very interesting statement there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine he said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all however when our turn came the little man was much more favorable to me than to any of the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he might have a private word with us this is mr jabez wilson said my assistant and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league and he is admirably suited for it the other answered he has every requirement i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine he took a step backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful then suddenly he plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my success it would be injustice to hesitate said he you will however i am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution with that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until i yelled with the pain there is water in your eyes said he as he released me i perceive that all is as it should be but we have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint i could tell you tales of cobblers wax which would disgust you with human nature he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled a groan of disappointment came up from below and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager my name said he is mr duncan ross and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor are you a married man mr wilson have you a family i answered that i had not his face fell immediately dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed i am sorry to hear you say that the fund was of course for the propagation and spread of the redheads as well as for their maintenance it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor my face lengthened at this mr holmes for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right in the case of another said he the objection might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favor of a man with such a head of hair as yours when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties well it is a little awkward for i have a business already said i oh never mind about that mr wilson said vincent spaulding i shall be able to look after that for you what would be the hours i asked ten to two now a pawnbrokers business is mostly done of an evening mr holmes especially thursday and friday evenings which is just before payday so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings besides i knew that my assistant was a good man and that he would see to anything that turned up that would suit me very well said i and the pay is four pounds a week and the work is purely nominal what do you call purely nominal well you have to be in the office or at least in the building the whole time if you leave you forfeit your whole position forever the will is very clear upon that point you dont comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time its only four hours a day and i should not think of leaving said i no excuse will avail said mr duncan ross neither sickness nor business nor anything else there you must stay or you lose your billet and the work is to copy out the encyclopжdia britannica there is the first volume of it in that press you must find your own ink pens and blottingpaper but we provide this table and chair will you be ready tomorrow certainly i answered then goodby mr jabez wilson and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do i was so pleased at my own good fortune well i thought over the matter all day and by evening i was in low spirits again for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what its object might be i could not imagine it seemed altogether past belief that any one could make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the encyclopжdia britannica vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing however in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow so i bought a penny bottle of ink and with a quill pen and seven sheets of foolscap paper i started off for popes court well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible the table was set out ready for me and mr duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work he started me off upon the letter a and then he left me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me at two oclock he bade me goodday complimented me upon the amount that i had written and locked the door of the office after me this went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my weeks work it was the same next week and the same the week after every morning i was there at ten and every afternoon i left at two by degrees mr duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning and then after a time he did not come in at all still of course i never dared to leave the room for an instant for i was not sure when he might come and the billet was such a good one and suited me so well that i would not risk the loss of it eight weeks passed away like this and i had written about abbots and archery and armor and architecture and attica and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the bs before very long it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings and then suddenly the whole business came to an end to an end yes sir and no later than this morning i went to my work as usual at ten oclock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of cardboard hammered onto the middle of the panel with a tack here it is and you can read for yourself he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of notepaper it read in this fashion the redheaded league is dissolved oct sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter i cannot see that there is anything very funny cried our client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head if you can do nothing better than laugh at me i can go elsewhere no no cried holmes shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen i really wouldnt miss your case for the world it is most refreshingly unusual but there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door i was staggered sir i did not know what to do then i called at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything about it finally i went to the landlord who is an accountant living on the ground floor and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the redheaded league he said that he had never heard of any such body then i asked him who mr duncan ross was he answered that the name was new to him well said i the gentleman at no what the redheaded man yes oh said he his name was william morris he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready he moved out yesterday where could i find him oh at big new offices he did tell me the address yes king edward street near st pauls i started off mr holmes but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial kneecaps and no one in it had ever heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross and what did you do then asked holmes i went home to saxecoburg square and i took the advice of my assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post but that was not quite good enough mr holmes i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came right away to you and you did very wisely said holmes your case is an exceedingly remarkable one and i shall be happy to look into it from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear grave enough said mr jabez wilson why i have lost four pound a week as far as you are personally concerned remarked holmes i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league on the contrary you are as i understand richer by some thirty pounds to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a you have lost nothing by them no sir but i want to find out about them and who they are and what their object was in playing this prank if it was a prank upon me it was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them twoandthirty pounds we shall endeavor to clear up these points for you and first one or two questions mr wilson this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement how long had he been with you about a month then how did he come in answer to an advertisement was he the only applicant no i had a dozen why did you pick him because he was handy and would come cheap at half wages in fact yes what is he like this vincent spaulding small stoutbuilt very quick in his ways no hair on his face though hes not short of thirty has a white splash of acid upon his forehead holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement i thought as much said he have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings yes sir he told me that a gypsy had done it for him when he was a lad hum said holmes sinking back in deep thought he is still with you oh yes sir i have only just left him and has your business been attended to in your absence nothing to complain of sir theres never very much to do of a morning that will do mr wilson i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two today is saturday and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion well watson said holmes when our visitor had left us what do you make of it all i make nothing of it i answered frankly it is a most mysterious business as a rule said holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be it is your commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify but i must be prompt over this matter what are you going to do then i asked to smoke he answered it is quite a threepipe problem and i beg that you wont speak to me for fifty minutes he curled himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his hawklike nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece sarasate plays at st james hall this afternoon he remarked what do you think watson could your patients spare you for a few hours i have nothing to do today my practice is never very absorbing then put on your hat and come i am going through the city first and we can have some lunch on the way i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than italian or french it is introspective and i want to introspect come along we traveled by the underground as far as aldersgate and a short walk took us to saxecoburg square the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning it was a poky little shabbygenteel place where four lines of dingy twostoried brick houses looked out into a small railedin inclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smokeladen and uncongenial atmosphere three gilt balls and a brown board with jabez wilson in white letters upon a corner house announced the place where our redheaded client carried on his business sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses finally he returned to the pawnbrokers and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up to the door and knocked it was instantly opened by a brightlooking cleanshaven young fellow who asked him to step in thank you said holmes i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly closing the door smart fellow that observed holmes as we walked away he is in my judgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third i have known something of him before evidently said i mr wilsons assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the redheaded league i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him not him what then the knees of his trousers and what did you see what i expected to see why did you beat the pavement my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk we are spies in an enemys country we know something of saxecoburg square let us now explore the parts which lie behind it the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxecoburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back it was one of the main arteries which convey the traffic of the city to the north and west the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians it was difficult to realize as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted let me see said holmes standing at the corner and glancing along the line i should like just to remember the order of the houses here it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london there is mortimers the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank the vegetarian restaurant and mcfarlanes carriagebuilding depot that carries us right on to the other block and now doctor weve done our work so its time we had some play a sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violinland where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no redheaded clients to vex us with their conundrums my friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuthhound holmes the relentless keenwitted readyhanded criminal agent as it was possible to conceive in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented as i have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy and as i knew well he was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his blackletter editions then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st james hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down you want to go home no doubt doctor he remarked as we emerged yes it would be as well and i have some business to do which will take some hours this business at saxecoburg square is serious why serious a considerable crime is in contemplation i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it but today being saturday rather complicates matters i shall want your help tonight at what time ten will be early enough i shall be at baker street at ten very well and i say doctor there may be some little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket he waved his hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the crowd i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbors but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes he and i had heard what he had heard i had seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all from the extraordinary story of the redheaded copier of the encyclopжdia down to the visit to saxecoburg square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me what was this nocturnal expedition and why should i go armed where were we going and what were we to do i had the hint from holmes that this smoothfaced pawnbrokers assistant was a formidable man a man who might play a deep game i tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation it was a quarterpast nine when i started from home and made my way across the park and so through oxford street to baker street two hansoms were standing at the door and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men one of whom i recognized as peter jones the official police agent while the other was a long thin sadfaced man with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frockcoat ha our party is complete said holmes buttoning up his peajacket and taking his heavy hunting coat from the rack watson i think you know mr jones of scotland yard let me introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in tonights adventure were hunting in couples again doctor you see said jones in his consequential way our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase all he wants is an old dog to help him do the running down i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase observed mr merryweather gloomily you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir said the police agent loftily he has his own little methods which are if he wont mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him it is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force oh if you say so mr jones it is all right said the stranger with deference still i confess that i miss my rubber it is the first saturday night for sevenandtwenty years that i have not had my rubber i think you will find said sherlock holmes that you will play for a higher stake tonight than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more exciting for you mr merryweather the stake will be some thirty thousand pounds and for you jones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger hes a young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london hes a remarkable man is young john clay his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to eton and oxford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself hell crack a crib in scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next ive been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight ive had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession it is past ten however and quite time that we started if you two will take the first hansom watson and i will follow in the second sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gaslit streets until we emerged into farringdon street we are close there now my friend remarked this fellow merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter i thought it as well to have jones with us also he is not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession he has one positive virtue he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon any one here we are and they are waiting for us we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate this also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate mr merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earthsmelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked looking up in surprise i must really ask you to be a little more quiet said holmes severely you have already imperiled the whole success of our expedition might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape we are at present doctor as no doubt you have divined in the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present it is our french gold whispered the director we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it your french gold yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose thirty thousand napoleons from the bank of france it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the crate upon which i sit contains two thousand napoleons packed between layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject which were very well justified observed holmes and now it is time that we arranged our little plans i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern and sit in the dark i am afraid so i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a partie carrйe you might have your rubber after all but i see that the enemys preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light and first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourself behind those then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness such an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moments notice to me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault they have but one retreat whispered holmes that is back through the house into saxecoburg square i hope that you have done what i asked you jones i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent and wait what a time it seemed from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us my limbs were weary and stiff for i feared to change my position yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions but i could distinguish the deeper heavier inbreath of the bulky jones from the thin sighing note of the bank director from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white almost womanly hand which felt about in the center of the little area of light for a minute or more the hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones its disappearance however was but momentary with a rending tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed the light of a lantern over the edge there peeped a cleancut boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulderhigh and waisthigh until one knee rested upon the edge in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of very red hair its all clear he whispered have you the chisel and the bags great scott jump archie jump and ill swing for it sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar the other dived down the hole and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver but holmes hunting crop came down on the mans wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor its no use john clay said holmes blandly you have no chance at all so i see the other answered with the utmost coolness i fancy that my pal is all right though i see you have got his coattails there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes oh indeed you seem to have done the thing very completely i must compliment you and i you holmes answered your redheaded idea was very new and effective youll see your pal again presently said jones hes quicker at climbing down holes than i am just hold out while i fix the derbies i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins have the goodness also when you address me always to say sir and please all right said jones with a stare and a snigger well would you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the police station that is better said john clay serenely he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective really mr holmes said mr merryweather as we followed them from the cellar i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr john clay said holmes i have been at some small expense over this matter which i shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the redheaded league you see watson he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league and the copying of the encyclopжdia must be to get this not overbright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day it was a curious way of managing it but really it would be difficult to suggest a better the method was no doubt suggested to clays ingenious mind by the color of his accomplices hair the four pounds a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation but how could you guess what the motive was had there been women in the house i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue that however was out of the question the mans business was a small one and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations and such an expenditure as they were at it must then be something out of the house what could it be i thought of the assistants fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the cellar the cellar there was the end of this tangled clew then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london he was doing something in the cellar something which took many hours a day for months on end what could it be once more i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind it was not in front then i rang the bell and as i hoped the assistant answered it we have had some skirmishes but we had never set eyes upon each other before i hardly looked at his face his knees were what i wished to see you must yourself have remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were they spoke of those hours of burrowing the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for i walked round the corner saw that the city and suburban bank abutted on our friends premises and felt that i had solved my problem when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors with the result that you have seen and how could you tell that they would make their attempt tonight i asked well when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr jabez wilsons presence in other words that they had completed their tunnel but it was essential that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape for all these reasons i expected them to come tonight you reasoned it out beautifully i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration it is so long a chain and yet every link rings true it saved me from ennui he answered yawning alas i already feel it closing in upon me my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence these little problems help me to do so and you are a benefactor of the race said i he shrugged his shoulders well perhaps after all it is of some little use he remarked illustration v the ransom of red chiefe by o henry it looked like a good thing but wait till i tell you we were down south in alabama bill driscoll and myself when this kidnaping idea struck us it was as bill afterward expressed it during a moment of temporary mental apparition but we didnt find that out till later there was a town down there as flat as a flannelcake and called summit of course it contained inhabitants of as undeleterious and selfsatisfied a class of peasantry as ever clustered around a maypole bill and me had a joint capital of about six hundred dollars and we needed just two thousand dollars more to pull off a fraudulent townlot scheme in western illinois with we talked it over on the front steps of the hotel philoprogenitiveness says we is strong in semirural communities therefore and for other reasons a kidnaping project ought to do better there than in the radius of newspapers that send reporters out in plain clothes to stir up talk about such things we knew that summit couldnt get after us with anything stronger than constables and maybe some lackadaisical bloodhounds and a diatribe or two in the weekly farmers budget so it looked good we selected for our victim the only child of a prominent citizen named ebenezer dorset the father was respectable and tight a mortgage fancier and a stern upright collectionplate passer and forecloser the kid was a boy of ten with basrelief freckles and hair the color of the cover of the magazine you buy at the newsstand when you want to catch a train bill and me figured that ebenezer would melt down for a ransom of two thousand dollars to a cent but wait till i tell you about two miles from summit was a little mountain covered with a dense cedar brake on the rear elevation of this mountain was a cave there we stored provisions one evening after sundown we drove in a buggy past old dorsets house the kid was in the street throwing rocks at a kitten on the opposite fence hey little boy says bill would you like to have a bag of candy and a nice ride the boy catches bill neatly in the eye with a piece of brick that will cost the old man an extra five hundred dollars says bill climbing over the wheel that boy put up a fight like a welterweight cinnamon bear but at last we got him down in the bottom of the buggy and drove away we took him up to the cave and i hitched the horse in the cedar brake after dark i drove the buggy to the little village three miles away where we had hired it and walked back to the mountain bill was pasting courtplaster over the scratches and bruises on his features there was a fire burning behind the big rock at the entrance of the cave and the boy was watching a pot of boiling coffee with two buzzard tailfeathers stuck in his red hair he points a stick at me when i come up and says ha cursed paleface do you dare to enter the camp of red chief the terror of the plains hes all right now says bill rolling up his trousers and examining some bruises on his shins were playing indian were making buffalo bills show look like magiclantern views of palestine in the town hall im old hank the trapper red chiefs captive and im to be scalped at daybreak by geronimo that kid can kick hard yes sir that boy seemed to be having the time of his life the fun of camping out in a cave had made him forget that he was a captive himself he immediately christened me snakeeye the spy and announced that when his braves returned from the warpath i was to be broiled at the stake at the rising of the sun then we had supper and he filled his mouth full of bacon and bread and gravy and began to talk he made a duringdinner speech something like this i like this fine i never camped out before but i had a pet possum once and i was nine last birthday i hate to go to school rats ate up sixteen of jimmy talbots aunts speckled hens eggs are there any real indians in these woods i want some more gravy does the trees moving make the wind blow we had five puppies what makes your nose so red hank my father has lots of money are the stars hot i whipped ed walker twice saturday i dont like girls you dassent catch toads unless with a string do oxen make any noise why are oranges round have you got beds to sleep on in this cave amos murray has got six toes a parrot can talk but a monkey or a fish cant how many does it take to make twelve every few minutes he would remember that he was a pesky redskin and pick up his stick rifle and tiptoe to the mouth of the cave to rubber for the scouts of the hated paleface now and then he would let out a warwhoop that made old hank the trapper shiver that boy had bill terrorized from the start red chief says i to the kid would you like to go home aw what for says he i dont have any fun at home i hate to go to school i like to camp out you wont take me back home again snakeeye will you not right away says i well stay here in the cave a while all right says he thatll be fine i never had such fun in all my life we went to bed about eleven oclock we spread down some wide blankets and quilts and put red chief between us we werent afraid hed run away he kept us awake for three hours jumping up and reaching for his rifle and screeching hist pard in mine and bills ears as the fancied crackle of a twig or the rustle of a leaf revealed to his young imagination the stealthy approach of the outlaw band at last i fell into a troubled sleep and dreamed that i had been kidnaped and chained to a tree by a ferocious pirate with red hair just at daybreak i was awakened by a series of awful screams from bill they werent yells or howls or shouts or whoops or yawps such as youd expect from a manly set of vocal organs they were simply indecent terrifying humiliating screams such as women emit when they see ghosts or caterpillars its an awful thing to hear a strong desperate fat man scream incontinently in a cave at daybreak i jumped up to see what the matter was red chief was sitting on bills chest with one hand twined in bills hair in the other he had the sharp caseknife we used for slicing bacon and he was industriously and realistically trying to take bills scalp according to the sentence that had been pronounced upon him the evening before i got the knife away from the kid and made him lie down again but from that moment bills spirit was broken he laid down on his side of the bed but he never closed an eye again in sleep as long as that boy was with us i dozed off for a while but along toward sunup i remembered that red chief had said i was to be burned at the stake at the rising of the sun i wasnt nervous or afraid but i sat up and lit my pipe and leaned against a rock what you getting up so soon for sam asked bill me says i oh i got a kind of a pain in my shoulder i thought sitting up would rest it youre a liar says bill youre afraid you was to be burned at sunrise and you was afraid hed do it and he would too if he could find a match aint it awful sam do you think anybody will pay out money to get a little imp like that back home sure said i a rowdy kid like that is just the kind that parents dote on now you and the chief get up and cook breakfast while i go up on the top of this mountain and reconnoiter i went up on the peak of the little mountain and ran my eye over the contiguous vicinity over toward summit i expected to see the sturdy yeomanry of the village armed with scythes and pitchforks beating the countryside for the dastardly kidnapers but what i saw was a peaceful landscape dotted with one man ploughing with a dun mule nobody was dragging the creek no couriers dashed hither and yon bringing tidings of no news to the distracted parents there was a sylvan attitude of somnolent sleepiness pervading that section of the external outward surface of alabama that lay exposed to my view perhaps says i to myself it has not yet been discovered that the wolves have borne away the tender lambkin from the fold heaven help the wolves says i and i went down the mountain to breakfast when i got to the cave i found bill backed up against the side of it breathing hard and the boy threatening to smash him with a rock half as big as a cocoanut he put a redhot boiled potato down my back explained bill and then mashed it with his foot and i boxed his ears have you got a gun about you sam i took the rock away from the boy and kind of patched up the argument ill fix you says the kid to bill no man ever yet struck the red chief but what he got paid for it you better beware after breakfast the kid takes a piece of leather with strings wrapped around it out of his pocket and goes outside the cave unwinding it whats he up to now says bill anxiously you dont think hell run away do you sam no fear of it says i he dont seem to be much of a home body but weve got to fix up some plan about the ransom there dont seem to be much excitement around summit on account of his disappearance but maybe they havent realized yet that hes gone his folks may think hes spending the night with aunt jane or one of the neighbors anyhow hell be missed today tonight we must get a message to his father demanding the two thousand dollars for his return just then we heard a kind of warwhoop such as david might have emitted when he knocked out the champion goliath it was a sling that red chief had pulled out of his pocket and he was whirling it around his head i dodged and heard a heavy thud and a kind of a sigh from bill like a horse gives out when you take his saddle off a niggerhead rock the size of an egg had caught bill just behind his left ear he loosened himself all over and fell in the fire across the frying pan of hot water for washing the dishes i dragged him out and poured cold water on his head for half an hour by and by bill sits up and feels behind his ear and says sam do you know who my favorite biblical character is take it easy says i youll come to your senses presently king herod says he you wont go away and leave me here alone will you sam i went out and caught that boy and shook him until his freckles rattled if you dont behave says i ill take you straight home now are you going to be good or not i was only funning says he sullenly i didnt mean to hurt old hank but what did he hit me for ill behave snakeeye if you wont send me home and if youll let me play the black scout today i dont know the game says i thats for you and mr bill to decide hes your playmate for the day im going away for a while on business now you come in and make friends with him and say you are sorry for hurting him or home you go at once i made him and bill shake hands and then i took bill aside and told him i was going to poplar cove a little village three miles from the cave and find out what i could about how the kidnaping had been regarded in summit also i thought it best to send a peremptory letter to old man dorset that day demanding the ransom and dictating how it should be paid you know sam says bill ive stood by you without batting an eye in earthquakes fire and flood in poker games dynamite outrages police raids train robberies and cyclones i never lost my nerve yet till we kidnaped that twolegged skyrocket of a kid hes got me going you wont leave me long with him will you sam ill be back some time this afternoon says i you must keep the boy amused and quiet till i return and now well write the letter to old dorset bill and i got paper and pencil and worked on the letter while red chief with a blanket wrapped around him strutted up and down guarding the mouth of the cave bill begged me tearfully to make the ransom fifteen hundred dollars instead of two thousand i aint attempting says he to decry the celebrated moral aspect of parental affection but were dealing with humans and it aint human for anybody to give up two thousand dollars for that fortypound chunk of freckled wildcat im willing to take a chance at fifteen hundred dollars you can charge the difference up to me so to relieve bill i acceded and we collaborated a letter that ran this way ebenezer dorset esq we have your boy concealed in a place far from summit it is useless for you or the most skillful detectives to attempt to find him absolutely the only terms on which you can have him restored to you are these we demand fifteen hundred dollars in large bills for his return the money to be left at midnight tonight at the same spot and in the same box as your reply as hereinafter described if you agree to these terms send your answer in writing by a solitary messenger tonight at halfpast eight oclock after crossing owl creek on the road to poplar cove there are three large trees about a hundred yards apart close to the fence of the wheat field on the righthand side at the bottom of the fencepost opposite the third tree will be found a small pasteboard box the messenger will place the answer in this box and return immediately to summit if you attempt any treachery or fail to comply with our demand as stated you will never see your boy again if you pay the money as demanded he will be returned to you safe and well within three hours these terms are final and if you do not accede to them no further communication will be attempted two desperate men i addressed this letter to dorset and put it in my pocket as i was about to start the kid comes up to me and says aw snakeeye you said i could play the black scout while you was gone play it of course says i mr bill will play with you what kind of a game is it im the black scout says red chief and i have to ride to the stockade to warn the settlers that the indians are coming im tired of playing indian myself i want to be the black scout all right says i it sounds harmless to me i guess mr bill will help you foil the pesky savages what am i to do asks bill looking at the kid suspiciously you are the hoss says black scout get down on your hands and knees how can i ride to the stockade without a hoss youd better keep him interested said i till we get the scheme going loosen up bill gets down on his all fours and a look comes in his eye like a rabbits when you catch it in a trap how far is it to the stockade kid he asks in a husky manner of voice ninety miles says the black scout and you have to hump yourself to get there on time whoa now the black scout jumps on bills back and digs his heels in his side for heavens sake says bill hurry back sam as soon as you can i wish we hadnt made the ransom more than a thousand say you quit kicking me or ill get up and warm you good i walked over to poplar cove and sat around the postoffice and store talking with the chawbacons that came in to trade one whiskerando says that he hears summit is all upset on account of elder ebenezer dorsets boy having been lost or stolen that was all i wanted to know i bought some smoking tobacco referred casually to the price of blackeyed peas posted my letter surreptitiously and came away the postmaster said the mailcarrier would come by in an hour to take the mail on to summit when i got back to the cave bill and the boy were not to be found i explored the vicinity of the cave and risked a yodel or two but there was no response illustration the black scout jumps on bills back and digs his heels in his side so i lighted my pipe and sat down on a mossy bank to await developments in about half an hour i heard the bushes rustle and bill wabbled out into the little glade in front of the cave behind him was the kid stepping softly like a scout with a broad grin on his face bill stopped took off his hat and wiped his face with a red handkerchief the kid stopped about eight feet behind him sam says bill i suppose youll think im a renegade but i couldnt help it im a grown person with masculine proclivities and habits of selfdefense but there is a time when all systems of egotism and predominance fail the boy is gone i have sent him home all is off there was martyrs in old times goes on bill that suffered death rather than give up the particular graft they enjoyed none of em ever was subjugated to such supernatural tortures as i have been i tried to be faithful to our articles of depredation but there came a limit whats the trouble bill i asks him i was rode says bill the ninety miles to the stockade not barring an inch then when the settlers was rescued i was given oats sand aint a palatable substitute and then for an hour i had to try to explain to him why there was nothin in holes how a road can run both ways and what makes the grass green i tell you sam a human can only stand so much i takes him by the neck of his clothes and drags him down the mountain on the way he kicks my legs blackandblue from the knees down and ive got to have two or three bites on my thumb and hand cauterized but hes gone continues bill gone home i showed him the road to summit and kicked him about eight feet nearer there at one kick im sorry we lose the ransom but it was either that or bill driscoll to the madhouse bill is puffing and blowing but there is a look of ineffable peace and growing content on his rosepink features bill says i there isnt any heart disease in your family is there no says bill nothing chronic except malaria and accidents why then you might turn around says i and have a look behind you bill turns and sees the boy and loses his complexion and sits down plump on the ground and begins to pluck aimlessly at grass and little sticks for an hour i was afraid for his mind and then i told him that my scheme was to put the whole job through immediately and that we would get the ransom and be off with it by midnight if old dorset fell in with our proposition so bill braced up enough to give the kid a weak sort of a smile and a promise to play the russian in a japanese war with him as soon as he felt a little better i had a scheme for collecting that ransom without danger of being caught by counterplots that ought to commend itself to professional kidnapers the tree under which the answer was to be left and the money later on was close to the road fence with big bare fields on all sides if a gang of constables should be watching for any one to come for the note they could see him a long way off crossing the fields or in the road but no siree at halfpast eight i was up in that tree as well hidden as a tree toad waiting for the messenger to arrive exactly on time a halfgrown boy rides up the road on a bicycle locates the pasteboard box at the foot of the fencepost slips a folded piece of paper into it and pedals away again back toward summit i waited an hour and then concluded the thing was square i slid down the tree got the note slipped along the fence till i struck the woods and was back at the cave in another half an hour i opened the note got near the lantern and read it to bill it was written with a pen in a crabbed hand and the sum and substance of it was this two desperate men gentlemen i received your letter today by post in regard to the ransom you ask for the return of my son i think you are a little high in your demands and i hereby make you a counterproposition which i am inclined to believe you will accept you bring johnny home and pay me two hundred and fifty dollars in cash and i agree to take him off your hands you had better come at night for the neighbors believe he is lost and i couldnt be responsible for what they would do to anybody they saw bringing him back very respectfully ebenezer dorset great pirates of penzance says i of all the impudent but i glanced at bill and hesitated he had the most appealing look in his eyes i ever saw on the face of a dumb or a talking brute sam says he whats two hundred and fifty dollars after all weve got the money one more night of this kid will send me to a bed in bedlam besides being a thorough gentleman i think mr dorset is a spendthrift for making us such a liberal offer you aint going to let the chance go are you tell you the truth bill says i this little he ewe lamb has somewhat got on my nerves too well take him home pay the ransom and make our getaway we took him home that night we got him to go by telling him that his father had bought a silvermounted rifle and a pair of moccasins for him and we were going to hunt bears the next day it was just twelve oclock when we knocked at ebenezers front door just at the moment when i should have been abstracting the fifteen hundred dollars from the box under the tree according to the original proposition bill was counting out two hundred and fifty dollars into dorsets hand when the kid found out we were going to leave him at home he started up a howl like a calliope and fastened himself as tight as a leech to bills leg his father peeled him away gradually like a porous plaster how long can you hold him asks bill im not as strong as i used to be says old dorset but i think i can promise you ten minutes enough says bill in ten minutes i shall cross the central southern and middle western states and be legging it trippingly for the canadian border and as dark as it was and as fat as bill was and as good a runner as i am he was a good mile and a half out of summit before i could catch up with him footnote e reprinted by special permission from whirligigs copyright by doubleday

incidental pounds of chile con baked beans soda biscuits airtights and other delicacies then we adjourned with our pipes to the shady side of the blacksmiths shop where we could watch the ravens on

the greatgranddaddy of all the bullsnakes up at lead in the black hills i was only a kid then this wasnt no such turble long a snake but he was moren a foot thick looked just like a sahuaro stalk man name of terwilliger smith catched it he named this yere bullsnake clarence and got it so plumb gentle it followed him everywhere one day old p t barnum come along and wanted to buy this clarence snake offered terwilliger a thousand cold but smith wouldnt part with the snake nohow so finally they fixed up a deal so smith could go along with the show they shoved clarence in a box in the baggage car

wall ive see things and ive heerd things some of them ornery and some youd love to believe they was that gorgeous and improbable natral history was always my hobby and sportin events my special pleasure and this yarn of windys reminds me of the only chanst i ever had to ring in business and pleasure and hobby all in one grand merrygoround of joy it come about like this one day a few year back i was sittin on the beach at santa barbara watchin the sky stay up and wonderin what to do with my years wages when a little squincheye roundface with big bow spectacles came and plumped down beside me did you ever stop to think says he shovin back his hat that if the horsepower delivered by them waves on this beach in one single hour could be concentrated behind washin machines it would be enough to wash all the shirts for a city of four hundred and fiftyone thousand one hundred and thirtysix people cant say i ever did says i squintin at him sideways fact says he and did it ever occur to you that if all the food a man eats in the course of a natural life could be gathered together at one time it would fill a wagontrain twelve miles long you make me hungry says i and aint it interestin to reflect he goes on that if all the fingernail parins of the human race for one year was to be collected and subjected to hydraulic pressure it would equal in size the pyramid of cheops look here says i sittin up did you ever pause to excogitate that if all the hot air you is dispensin was to be collected together it would fill a balloon big enough to waft you and me over that bullyvard of palms to yonder gin mill on the corner he didnt say nothin to that just yanked me to my feet faced me towards the gin mill above mentioned and exerted considerable pressure on my arm in urgin of me forward you aint so much of a dreamer after all thinks i in important matters you are plumb decisive we sat down at little tables and my friend ordered a beer and a chicken sandwich chickens says he gazin at the sandwich is a dollar apiece in this country and plumb scarce did you ever pause to ponder over the returns chickens would give on a small investment say you start with ten hens each hatches out thirteen aigs of which allow a loss of say six for childish accidents at the end of two years that flock has increased to six hundred and twenty at the end of the third year he had the medicine tongue ten days later him and me was occupyin of an old ranch fifty mile from anywhere when they run stagecoaches this joint used to be a roadhouse the outlook was on about a thousand little brown foothills a road two miles four rods two foot eleven inches in sight run by in front of us it come over one foothill and disappeared over another i know just how long it was for later in the game i measured it out back was about a hundred little wire chicken corrals filled with chickens we had two kinds that was the doins of tuscarora my pardner called himself tuscarora maxillary i asked him once if that was his real name its the realest little old name you ever heerd tell of says he i know for i made it myself liked the sound of her parents aint got no rights to name their children parents dont have to be called them names well these chickens as i said was of two kinds the first was these lowset heavyweight propositions with feathers on their laigs and not much laigs at that called cochin chinys the other was a tall ridiculous outfit made up entire of bulgin breast and gangle laigs they stood about two foot and a half tall and when they went to peck the ground their tail feathers stuck straight up to the sky tusky called em japanese games which the chief advantage of them chickens is says he that in weight about ninety per cent of em is breast meat now my idee is that if we can cross em with these cochin chiny fowls well have a lowhung heavyweight chicken runnin strong on breast meat these jap games is too small but if we can bring em up in size and shorten their laigs well shore have a winner that looked good to me so we started in on that idee the theery was bully but she didnt work out the first broods we hatched growed up with big husky cochin chiny bodies and little short necks perched up on laigs three foot long them chickens couldnt reach ground nohow we had to build a table for em to eat off and when they went out rustlin for themselves they had to confine themselves to sidehills or flyin insects their breasts was all right though and think of them drumsticks for the boardinhouse trade says tusky so far things wasnt so bad we had a good grubstake tusky and me used to feed them chickens twict a day and then used to set around watchin the playful critters chase grasshoppers up and down the wire corrals while tusky figgered out whatd happen if somebody was dumfool enough to gather up somethin and fix it in baskets or wagons or such that was where we showed our ignorance of chickens one day in the spring i hitched up rustled a dozen of the youngsters into coops and druv over to the railroad to make our first sale i couldnt fold them chickens up into them coops at first but then i stuck the coops up on aidge and they worked all right though i will admit they was a comical sight at the railroad one of them towerist trains had just slowed down to a halt as i come up and the towerists was paradin up and down allowin they was particular enjoyin of the warm californy sunshine one old terrapin with gray chin whiskers projected over with his wife and took a peek through the slats of my coop he straightened up like some one had touched him off with a redhot poker stranger said he in a scared kind of whisper whats them thems chickens says i he took another long look marthy says he to the old woman this will be about all we come out from ioway to see the wonders of californy but i cant go nothin stronger than this if these is chickens i dont want to see no big trees well i sold them chickens all right for a dollar and two bits which was better than i expected and got an order for more about ten days later i got a letter from the commission house we are returnin a sample of your arts and crafts chickens with the lovin marks of the teeth still onto him says they dont send any more till they stops pursuin of the nimble grasshopper dentist bill will foller with the letter came the remains of one of the chickens tusky and i very indignant cooked her for supper she was tough all right we thought she might do better biled so we put her in the pot over night nary bit well then we got interested tusky kep the fire goin and i rustled greasewood we cooked her three days and three nights at the end of that time she was sort of pale and frazzled but still givin points to threeyearold jerky on cohesion and other uncompromisin forces of nature we buried her then and went out back to recuperate there we could gaze on the smilin landscape dotted by about four hundred longlaigged chickens swoopin here and there after grasshoppers we got to stop that says i we cant murmured tusky inspired we cant its born in em its primal instinct like the love of a mother for her young and it cant be eradicated them chickens is constructed by a divine providence for the express purpose of chasin grasshoppers just as the beaver is made for building dams and the cowpuncher is made for whisky and farogames we cant keep em from it if we was to shut em in a dark cellar theyd flop after imaginary grasshoppers in their dreams and die emaciated in the midst of plenty jimmy were up agin the cosmos the oversoul oh he had the medicine tongue tusky had and risin on the wings of eloquence that way he had me faded in ten minutes in fifteen i was wedded solid to the notion that the bottom had dropped out of the chicken business i think now that if wed shut them hens up we might have still i dont know they was a good deal in what tusky said tuscarora maxillary says i did you ever stop to entertain that beautiful thought that if all the dumfoolishness possessed now by the human race could be gathered together and lined up alongside of us the first feller to come along would say to it why hello solomon we quit the notion of chickens for profit right then and there but we couldnt quit the place we hadnt much money for one thing and then we kind of liked loafin around and raisin a little garden truck and oh well i might as well say so we had a notion about placers in the dry wash back of the house you know how it is so we stayed on and kept araisin these longlaigs for the fun of it i used to like to watch em projectin around and i fed em twict a day about as usual so tusky and i lived alone there together happy as ducks in arizona about onct in a month somebodyd pike along the road she wasnt much of a road generally more chuckholes than bumps though sometimes it was the other way around unless it happened to be a man horseback or maybe a freighter without the fear of god in his soul we didnt have no words with them they was too busy cussin the highways and generally too mad for social discourses one day early in the year when the dobe mud made ruts to add to the bumps one of these automobeels went past it was the first tusky and me had seen in them parts so we run out to view her which them folks dont seem to be enjoyin of the scenery says i to tusky do you reckon that there blue trail is smoke from the machine or remarks from the inhabitants thereof tusky raised his head and sniffed long and inquirin its langwidge says he did you ever stop to think that all the words in the dictionary hitched end to end would reach but at that minute i catched sight of somethin brass lyin in the road it proved to be a curledup sort of horn with a rubber bulb on the end i squoze the bulb and jumped twenty foot over the remark she made jarred off the machine says tusky oh did it says i my nerves still wrong i thought maybe it had growed up from the soil like a toadstool about this time we abolished the wire chicken corrals because we needed some of the wire them longlaigs thereupon scattered all over the flat searchin out their prey when feed time come i had to screech my lungs out gettin of em in and then sometimes they didnt all hear it was plumb discouragin and i mighty nigh made up my mind to quit em but they had come to be sort of pets and i hated to turn em down it used to tickle tusky almost to death to see me out there hollerin away like an old bullfrog he used to come out regla with his pipe lit just to enjoy me finally i got mad and opened up on him oh he explains it just plumb amuses me to see the dumfool at his childish work why dont you teach em to come to that brass horn and save your voice tusky says i with feelin sometimes you do seem to get a glimmer of real sense well first off them chickens used to throw backsummersets over that horn you have no idee how slow chickens is to learn things i could tell you things about chickens say this yere bluff about roosters bein gallant is all wrong ive watched em when one finds a nice feed he gobbles it so fast that the pieces foller down his throat like yearlins through a hole in the fence its only when he scratches up a measly onegrain quicklunch that he calls up the hens and stands noble and selfsacrificin to one side that aint the point which is that after two months i had them longlaigs so theyd drop everythin and come kitin at the honkhonk of that horn it was a purty sight to see em sailin in from all directions twenty foot at a stride i was proud of em and named em the honkhonk breed we didnt have no others for by now the coyotes and bobcats had nailed the straightbreds there wasnt no wild cat or coyote could catch one of my honkhonks no sir we made a little on our placer just enough to keep interested then the supervisors decided to fix our road and whats more they done it thats the only part in this yarn thats hard to believe but boys youll have to take it on faith they plowed her and crowned her and scraped her and rolled her and when they moved on we had the fanciest highway in the state of californy that noon the day they called her a job tusky and i sat smokin our pipes as per usual when way over the foothills we seen a cloud of dust and faint to our ears was bore a whizzin sound the chickens was gathered under the cottonwood for the heat of the day but they didnt pay no attention then faint but clear we heard another of them brass horns honk honk says it and every one of them chickens woke up and stood at attention honk honk it hollered clearer and nearer then over the hill come an automobeel blowin vigorous at every jump stop em stop em i yells to tusky kickin over my chair as i springs to my feet but it was too late out the gate sprinted them poor devoted chickens and up the road they trailed in vain pursuit the last we seen of em was a minglin of dust and dim figgers goin thirty mile an hour after a disappearin automobeel that was all we seen for the moment about three oclock the first straggler came limpin in his wings hangin his mouth open his eyes glazed with the heat by sundown fourteen had returned all the rest had disappeared utter we never seen em again i reckon they just naturally run themselves into a sunstroke and died on the road it takes a long time to learn a chicken a thing but a heap longer to unlearn him after that two or three of these yere automobeels went by every day all ablowin of their horns and every time them fourteen honkhonks of mine took along after em just as id taught em to do layin to get to their corn when they caught up no more of em died but that fourteen did get into elegant trainin after a while they got plumb to enjoyin it when you come right down to it a chicken dont have many amusements and relaxations in this life searchin for worms chasin grasshoppers and wallerin in the dust is about the limits of joys for chickens it was sure a fine sight to see em after they got well into the game about nine oclock every mornin they would saunter down to the rise of the road where they would wait patient until a machine came along then it would warm your heart to see the enthusiasm of them with exultant cackles of joy theyd trail in reachin out like quarterhorses their wings half spread out their eyes beamin with delight at the lower turn theyd quit then after talkin it over excitedlike for a few minutes theyd calm down and wait for another after a few months of this sort of trainin they got purty good at it i had one twoyearold rooster that made fiftyfour mile an hour behind one of those sixtyhorsepower panhandles when cars didnt come along often enough theyd all turn out and chase jackrabbits they wasnt much fun at that after a short brief sprint the rabbit would crouch down plumb terrified while the honkhonks pulled off triumphal dances around his shrinkin form our ranch got to be purty well known them days among automobeelists the strength of their cars was horsepower of course but the speed of them they got to ratin by chickenpower some of them used to come way up from los angeles just to try out a new car along our road with the honkhonks for pacemakers we charged them a little somethin and then too we opened up the roadhouse and the bar so we did purty well it wasnt necessary to work any longer at that bogus placer evenins we sat around outside and swapped yarns and i bragged on my chickens the chickens would gather round close to listen they liked to hear their praises sung all right you bet they sabe the only reason a chicken or any other critter isnt intelligent is because he hasnt no chance to expand why we used to run races with em some of us would hold two or more chickens back of a chalk line and the starterd blow the horn from a hundred yards to a mile away dependin on whether it was a sprint or for distance we had pools on the results gave odds made books and kept records after the thing got knowed we made money hand over fist the stranger broke off abruptly and began to roll a cigarette what did you quit it for then ventured charley out of the hushed silence pride replied the stranger solemnly haughtiness of spirit how so urged charley after a pause them chickens continued the stranger after a moment stood around listenin to me abraggin of what superior fowls they was until they got all puffed up they wouldnt have nothin whatever to do with the ordinary chickens we brought in for eatin purposes but stood around lookin bored when there wasnt no sport doin they got to be just like that four hundred you read about in the papers it was one continual round of grasshopper balls race meets and afternoon henparties they got idle and haughty just like folks they got to feelin so aristocratic the hens wouldnt have no eggs nobody dared say a word windy bills snake began the narrator genially stranger broke in windy bill with great emphasis as to that snake i want you to understand this yereafter in my estimation that snake is nothin but an ornery angleworm footnote f reprinted by special permission from arizona nights copyright by doubleday page and company illustration vii the devilfishg by norman duncan when the minister of justice for the colony of newfoundland went away from ruddy cove by the bay steamer he chanced to leave an american magazine at the home of billy topsails father where he had passed the night the magazine contained an illustrated article on the gigantic species of cephalopods popularly known as devilfish illustration tis the devilfish screamed bobby billy topsail did not know what a cephalopod was but he did know a squid when he saw its picture for ruddy cove is a fishing harbor and he had caught many a thousand for bait so when he found that to the lay mind a squid and a cephalopod were one and the same save in size he read the long article from beginning to end doing the best he could with the strange long words so interested was he that he read it again and by that time he had learned enough to surprise him even to terrify him notwithstanding the writers assurance that the power and ferocity of the creatures had generally been exaggerated he was a lad of sound common sense he had never wholly doubted the tales of desperate encounters with devilfish told in the harbor these many years for the various descriptions of how the long slimy arms had curled about the punts had rung too true to be quite disbelieved but he had considered them somewhat less credible than certain wild yarns of shipwreck and somewhat more credible than the bedtime stories of mermaids which the grandmothers told the children of the place here however in plain print was described the capture of a giant squid in a bay which lay beyond a point of land that billy could see from the window that afternoon billy put out in his leaky old punt to jig squid for bait he was so disgusted with the punt so ashamed of the squat weatherworn rotten castoff that he wished heartily for a new one all the way to the grounds the loss of the never give up had brought him to humiliating depths but when he had once joined the little fleet of boats he cheerfully threw his grapnel into bobby lots punt and beckoned bobby aboard then as together they drew the writhingarmed squirting little squids from the water he told of the big squids which lurked in the deep water beyond the harbor and all the time bobby opened his eyes wider and wider is they just like squids bobby asked but bigger answered billy their bodies is so big as hogsheads their arms is thirtyfive feet long bobby picked a squid from the heap in the bottom of the boat it had instinctively turned from a reddishbrown to a livid green the color of seawater indeed had it been in the water its enemy would have had hard work to see it he handled it gingerly but the ugly little creature managed somehow to twine its slender arms about his hand and swiftly to take hold with a dozen cuplike suckers the boy uttered an exclamation of disgust and shook it off then he shuddered laughed at himself shuddered again a moment later he chose a dead squid for examination leave us look at it close said he then well know what a real devilfish is like sure ive been wantin to know that for a long long time they observed the long cylindrical body flabby and cold with the broad flaplike tail attached the head was repulsively ugly perhaps because of the eyes which were disproportionately large brilliant and in the live squid ferocious a group of arms two long slender tentacular arms and eight shorter thicker ones projected from the region of the mouth which indeed was set in the center of the ring they formed at the roots they were equipped with innumerable little suckers were flexible and active and as long as the head body and tail put together closer examination revealed that there was a horny beak like a parrots in the mouth and that on the under side of the head was a curious tubelike structure oh thats his squirter billy explained when he wants to back up he points that forward and squirts out water so hard as he can and when he wants to go ahead he points it backward and does the same thing thats where his ink comes from too when he wants to make the water so dirty nobody can see him what does he do with his beak when he gets his food in his arms he bites out pieces with his beak he hasnt any teeth but hes got something just as good a tongue like a rasp i wouldnt like to be cotched by a squid as big as a hogshead bobby remarked timidly huh said billy grimly hed make short work o you why by they weighs half a tone apiece i isnt much afraid though he added theyre only squid afore i read about them in the book i used to think they was worse than they is terrible ghostlike things but theyre no worse than squids only bigger and theyre bad enough for me bobby interrupted and billy concluded they only comes up in the night or when theyre sore wounded and dyin im not goin out at night if i can help it said bobby with a canny shake of the head if they was a big squid come up the harbor to your house said billy after a pause and got close to the rock he could put one o they two long arms in your bedroom window and tis in the attic never mind that he could put it in the window and feel around for your bed and twist that arm around you and id cut it off anyhow thats how long they is and if he knowed you was there and wanted you he could get you but im not so sure that he would want you he couldnt see you anyhow and if he could hed rather have a good fat salmon bobby shuddered as he looked at the tiny squid in his hand and thought of the dreadful possibilities in one a thousand times as big you leave them alone and theyll leave you alone billy went on but if you once make them mad they can dart their arms out like lightning tis time to get then im goin to keep an ax in my punt after this said bobby and if i sees an arm slippin out of the water tis as big as your thigh cried billy never mind if i sees it ill be able to cut it off if i sees one said billy im goin to cotch it it said in the book that they was worth a lot to some people and if i can sell mine im goin to have a new punt but although bobby lot and billy topsail kept a sharp lookout for giant squids wherever they went they were not rewarded there was not so much as a sign of one by and by so bold did they become they hunted for one in the twilight of summer days even daring to pry into the deepest coves and holes in the ruddy cove rocks notwithstanding the ridicule he had to meet bobby never ventured out in the punt without a sharp ax he could not tell what time he would need it he said and thus he formed the habit of making sure that it was in its place before casting off from the wharf as autumn drew near they found other things to think of the big squids passed out of mind altogether wonderful queer billy said long afterwards how things happen when you isnt expectin them one day late in september it was near evening of a gray day billy topsail and bobby lot were returning in bobbys punt from birds nest islands whither they had gone to hunt a group of seals reported to have taken up a temporary residence there they had a mighty muzzleloading flintlock gun and they were so delighted with the noise it made that they had exhausted their scanty provision of powder and lead long before the seals were in sight they had taken the shortest way home it lay past chain hole a small landlocked basin very deep with a narrow entrance which was shallow at low tide the entrance opened into a broad bay and was called chain tickle whats that in the tickle billy exclaimed as they were rowing past it was a black object apparently floating quietly on the surface of the water the boys gazed at it for a long time but could make nothing of it they were completely puzzled tis a small bit o wreck im thinkin said bobby leave us row close and see maybe tis a capsized punt when they were within about thirty yards of the object they lay on their oars for some unaccountable reason they did not care to venture nearer twilight was then fast approaching the light was already beginning to fail tis a wonderful queer thing billy muttered his curiosity getting the better of him row ahead bobby well go alongside theys something movin on it bobby whispered as he let his oars fall in the water look theys two queer big round spots on it big as plates billy thought he saw the whole object move he watched it closely it did stir it was some living thing then but what a whale a long snakelike arm was lifted out of the water it swayed this way and that darted here and there and fell back with a splash the moving spots now plainly gigantic eyes glittered tis the devilfish screamed bobby another arm was lifted up then a third and a fourth and a fifth the monster began to lash the water faster and yet more furiously until the tickle was heaving and frothy and the whole neighborhood was in an uproar pull pull cried bobby billy too was in a panic they turned the head of the punt and pulled with all their might the water swirled in the wake of the boat perceiving however that the squid made no effort to follow they got the better of their fright then they lay on their oars to watch the monster they wondered why it still lay in the tickle why it so furiously lashed the water with its arms and great tail it was bobby who solved the mystery tis aground said he that was evidently the situation the squid had been caught in the shallow tickle when the tide which ran swiftly at that point was on the ebb the boys took courage their curiosity still further emboldened them so once more they turned the punt about and pulled cautiously towards the tickle there was less light than before but still sufficient to disclose the baleful eyes and writhing arms of the squid when the boat was yet a safe distance away one by one the arms fell back into the water as if from exhaustion slowly the beating of the tail subsided after a time all sound and motion ceased the boys waited for some further sign of life but none came the squid was still as if dead sure hes dead now said billy leave us pull close up oh no by hes but makin believe but billy thought otherwise i wants that squid he said in a dogged way and im goin to have him ill sell him and get a new punt bobby protested in vain nothing would content billy topsail but the possession of the big squids body bobby pointed out that if the long powerful arms were once laid on the boat there would be no escape he recalled to billy the harbor story of the horrible death of zachariah north who as report said had been pursued captured and pulled under water by a devilfish in gander bay it was all to no purpose however for billy obstinately declared that he would make sure of the squid before the tide turned he admitted a slight risk but he wanted a new punt and he was willing to risk something to obtain it he proposed to put bobby ashore and approach the squid alone but bobby would not listen two hands might be needed in the boat he said what if the squid were alive after all what if it laid hold of the punt in that event two hands would surely be needed ill go he said but leave us pull slow and if we sees so much as a wink of his eye well pull away they rowed nearer with great caution billy was in the bow of the boat it was he who had the ax bobby seated amidships faced the bow it was he who did the rowing the squid was quiet there was not a sign of life about it billy estimated the length of its body from the beak to the point of the tail as twenty feet the circumference as the size of a hogshead its tentacular arms he determined must be at least thirtyfive feet long and when the boat came within that distance he shuddered is you sure hes dead bobby whispered weakly i dont know billy answered in a gasp i thinks so bobby dropped the oars and stepped to the bow of the punt the boat lost way and came to a stop within twenty feet of the squid still there was no sign of life the boys stared at the great still body lying quiet in the gathering dusk and haze neither seemed to feel the slight trembling of the boat that might have warned them not a word was spoken until billy in a whisper directed bobby to pull the boat a few feet nearer but were movin already he added in a puzzled way the boat was very slowly approaching the squid the motion was hardly perceptible but it was real tis queer said bobby he turned to take up the oars what he saw lying over the port gunwale of the boat made him gasp grip billys wrist and utter a scream of terror were cotched the squid had fastened one of its tentacles to the punt the other was poised above the stern ready to fall and fix its suckers the onward movement of the punt was explained billy knew the danger but he was not so terrified as to be incapable of action he was about to spring to the stern to strike off the tentacle that already lay over the gunwale but as he looked down to choose his step he saw that one of the eight powerful arms was slowly creeping over the starboard bow he struck at that arm with all his might missed wrenched the ax from the gunwale and struck true the mutilated arm was withdrawn billy leaped to the stern vaguely conscious in passing that another arm was creeping from the water he severed the first tentacle with one blow when he turned to strike the second it had disappeared so too had the second arm the boat seemed to be free but it was still within grasp in the meantime the squid had awakened to furious activity it was lashing the water with arms and tail angrily snapping its great beak and ejecting streams of black water from its siphontube the water was violently agitated and covered with a black froth in this the creature manifested fear and distress had it not been aground it would have backed swiftly into the deep water of the basin but as if finding itself at bay it lifted its uninjured tentacle high above the boat billy made ready to strike by this time bobby had mastered his terror while billy stood with uplifted ax his eyes fixed on the waving tentacle overhead bobby heaved mightily on the oars the boat slowly drew away from that highly dangerous neighborhood in a moment it was beyond reach of the arms but still apparently within reach of the tentacle the tentacle was withdrawn a short distance then like a flash it shot towards the boat writhing as it came billy struck blindly and struck nothing the tentacle had fallen short the boat was out of danger but still billy topsail was determined to have the body of the squid notwithstanding bobbys pleading and protestation he would not abandon his purpose he was only the more grimly bent on achieving it bobby would not hear of again approaching nearer than the boat then floated nor did billy think it advisable but it occurred to bobby that they might land and approach the squid from behind if they could draw near enough he said they could cast the grapnel on the squids back and moor it to a tree ashore sure he said excitedly you can pick up a squid from behind and it cant touch you with its arms it wont be able to see us and it wont be able to reach us so they landed billy carried the grapnel which was attached to twelve fathoms of line it had six prongs and each prong was barbed a low cliff at the edge of the tickle favored the plan the squid lay below and some twenty feet out from the rock it was merely a question of whether or not billy was strong enough to throw the grapnel so far they tied the end of the line to a stout shrub billy cast the grapnel and it was a strong true cast the iron fell fair on the squids back it was a capture that means a new punt for me said billy quietly the tidell not carry that devilfish away and now bobby pleaded leave us make haste home for tis growin wonderful dark and and there might be another somewhere so that is how one of the largest specimens of architeuthis princeps enumerated in prof john adam wrights latest monograph on the cephalopods of north america as the chain tickle specimen was captured and that is how billy topsail fairly won a new punt for when doctor marvey the curator of the public museum at st johns who is deeply interested in the study of the giant squids came to ruddy cove to make photographs and take measurements in response to a message from billys father he rewarded the lad footnotes g reprinted by special permission from the adventures of billy topsail copyright by fleming h revell company the early literature of natural history has from very remote times contained allusions to huge species of cephalopods often accompanied by more or less fabulous and usually exaggerated descriptions of the creatures the description of the poulpe or devilfish by victor hugo in toilers of the sea with which so many readers are familiar is quite as fabulous and unreal as any of the earlier accounts and even more bizarre special attention has only recently been called to the frequent occurrence of these big squids as our fishermen call them in the waters of newfoundland and the adjacent coasts i have been informed by many other fishermen that the big squids are occasionally taken on the grand banks and used for bait nearly all the specimens hitherto taken appear to have been more or less disabled when first observed otherwise they probably would not appear at the surface in the daytime from the fact that they have mostly come ashore in the night i infer that they inhabit chiefly the very deep and cold fiords of newfoundland and come to the surface only in the night from the report on the cephalopods of the northeastern coast of america by a e verrill extracted from a report of the commissioner of fish and fisheries issued by the government printing office at washington in this report twentyfive specimens of the large species taken in newfoundland are described in detail stories of this kind of which there are many are doubted by the authorities who have found it impossible to authenticate a single instance of unprovoked attack illustration viii the jumping frogh by mark twain in compliance with the request of a friend of mine who wrote me from the east i called on goodnatured garrulous old simon wheeler and inquired after my friends friend leonidas w smiley as requested to do and i hereunto append the result i have a lurking suspicion that leonidas w smiley is a myth that my friend never knew such a personage and that he only conjectured that if i asked old wheeler about him it would remind him of his infamous jim smiley and he would go to work and bore me to death with some exasperating reminiscence of him as long and as tedious as it should be useless to me if that was the design it succeeded i found simon wheeler dozing comfortably by the barroom stove of the dilapidated tavern in the decaying mining camp of angels and i noticed that he was fat and baldheaded and had an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance he roused up and gave me goodday i told him a friend of mine had commissioned me to make some inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood named leonidas w smiley rev leonidas w smiley a young minister of the gospel who he had heard was at one time a resident of angels camp i added that if mr wheeler could tell me anything about this rev leonidas w smiley i would feel under many obligations to him simon wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his chair and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph he never smiled he never frowned he never changed his voice from the gentleflowing key to which he tuned his initial sentence he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm but all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and sincerity which showed me plainly that so far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny about his story he regarded it as a really important matter and admired its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in finesse i let him go on in his own way and never interrupted him once rev leonidas w hm reverend le well there was a feller here once by the name of jim smiley in the winter of or maybe it was the spring of i dont recollect exactly somehow though what makes me think it was one or the other is because i remember the big flume warnt finished when he first came to the camp but anyway he was the curiosest man about always betting on anything that turned up you ever see if he could get anybody to bet on the other side and if he couldnt hed change sides any way what suited the other man would suit him any way just sos he got a bet he was satisfied but still he was lucky uncommon lucky he most always come out winner he was always ready and laying for a chance there couldnt be no solitry thing mentioned but that fellerd offer to bet on it and take ary side you please as i was just telling you if there was a horserace youd find him flush or youd find him busted at the end of it if there was a dogfight hed bet on it if there was a catfight hed bet on it if there was a chickenfight hed bet on it why if there was two birds sitting on a fence he would bet you which one would fly first or if there was a campmeeting he would be there reglar to bet on parson walker which he judged to be the best exhorter about here and so he was too and a good man if he even see a straddlebug start to go anywheres he would bet you how long it would take him to get to to wherever he was going to and if you took him up he would foller that straddlebug to mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and how long he was on the road lots of the boys here has seen that smiley and can tell you about him why it never made no difference to him hed bet on any thing the dangdest feller parson walkers wife laid very sick once for a good while and it seemed as if they warnt going to save her but one morning he came in and smiley up and asked him how she was and he said she was considable better thank the lord for his infnite mercy and coming on so smart that with the blessing of provdence shed get well yet and smiley before he thought says well ill resk twoandahalf she dont anyway thishyer smiley had a mare the boys called her the fifteenminute nag but that was only in fun you know because of course she was faster than that and he used to win money on that horse for all she was so slow and always had the asthma or the distemper or the consumption or something of that kind they used to give her two or three hundred yards start and then pass her under way but always at the fag end of the race shed get excited and desperate like and come cavorting and straddling up and scattering her legs around limber sometimes in the air and sometimes out to one side among the fences and kicking up more dust and raising more racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead as near as you could cipher it down and he had a little small bullpup that to look at him youd think he warnt worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for a chance to steal something but as soon as money was up on him he was a different dog his underjawd begin to stick out like the focastle of a steamboat and his teeth would uncover and shine like the furnaces and a dog might tackle him and bullyrag him and bite him and throw him over his shoulder two or three times and andrew jackson which was the name of the pup andrew jackson would never let on but what he was satisfied and hadnt expected nothing else and the bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time till the money was all up and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the jint of his hind leg and freeze to it not chaw you understand but only just grip and hang on till they throwed up the sponge if it was a year smiley always come out winner on that pup till he harnessed a dog once that didnt have no hind legs because theyd been sawed off in a circular saw and when the thing had gone alone far enough and the money was all up and he come to make a snatch for his pet holt he see in a minute how hed been imposed on and how the other dog had him in the door so to speak and he peared surprised and then he looked sorter discouragedlike and didnt try no more to win the fight and so he got shucked out bad he give smiley a look as much as to say his heart was broke and it was his fault for putting up a dog that hadnt no hind legs for him to take holt of which was his main dependence in a fight and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died it was a good pup was that andrew jackson and would have made a name for hisself if hed lived for the stuff was in him and he had genius i know it because he hadnt no opportunities to speak of and it dont stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under them circumstances if he hadnt no talent it always makes me feel sorry when i think of that last fight of hisn and the way it turned out well thishyer smiley had rattarriers and chicken cocks and tomcats and all them kind of things till you couldnt rest and you couldnt fetch nothing for him to bet on but hed match you he ketched a frog one day and took him home and said he callated to educate him and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn that frog to jump and you bet you he did learn him too hed give him a little punch behind and the next minute youd see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut see him turn one summerset or maybe a couple if he got a good start and come down flatfooted and all right like a cat he got him up so in the matter of ketching flies and kep him in practice so constant that hed nail a fly every time as fur as he could see him smiley said all a frog wanted was education and he could do most anything and i believe him why ive seen him set danl webster down here on this floor danl webster was the name of the frog and sing out flies danl flies and quickern you could wink hed spring straight up and snake a fly offn the counter there and flop down on the floor agin as solid as a gob of mud and fall to scratching the side of his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadnt no idea hed been doin any moren any frog might do you never see a frog so modest and straightforard as he was for all he was so gifted and when it come to fair and square jumping on a dead level he could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see jumping on a dead level was his strong suit you understand and when it come to that smiley would ante up money on him as long as he had a red smiley was monstrous proud of his frog and well he might be for fellers that had traveled and been everywheres all said he laid over any frog that ever they see well smiley kep the beast in a little lattice box and he used to fetch him downtown sometimes and lay for a bet one day a feller a stranger in the camp he was come acrost him with his box and says what might it be that youve got in the box and smiley says sorter indifferentlike it might be a parrot or it might be a canary maybe but it aint its only just a frog and the feller took it and looked at it careful and turned it round this way and that and says hm so tis well whats he good for well smiley says easy and careless hes good enough for one thing i should judge he can outjump any frog in calaveras county the feller took the box again and took another long particular look and give it back to smiley and says very deliberate well he says i dont see no pints about that frog thats any bettern any other frog maybe you dont smiley says maybe you understand frogs and maybe you dont understand em maybe youve had experience and maybe you aint only a amature as it were anyways ive got my opinion and ill resk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in calaveras county and the feller studied a minute and then says kinder sad like well im only a stranger here and i aint got no frog but if i had a frog id bet you and then smiley says thats all right thats all right if you hold my box a minute ill go and get you a frog and so the feller took the box and put up his forty dollars along with smileys and set down to wait so he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon and filled him full of quail shot filled him pretty near up to his chin and set him on the floor smiley he went to the swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long time and finally he ketched a frog and fetched him in and give him to this feller and says now if youre ready set him alongside of danl with his forepaws just even with danls and ill give the word then he says one two three git and him and the feller touched up the frogs from behind and the new frog hopped off lively but danl give a heave and hysted up his shoulders so like a frenchman but it warnt no use he couldnt budge he was planted as solid as a church and he couldnt no more stir than if he was anchored out smiley was a good deal surprised and he was disgusted too but he didnt have no idea what the matter was of course the feller took the money and started away and when he was going out at the door he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder so at danl and says again very deliberate well he says i dont see no pints about that frog thats any bettern any other frog smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at danl a long time and at last he says i do wonder what in the nation that frog throwd off for i wonder if there aint something the matter with him he pears to look mighty baggy somehow and he ketched danl by the nap of the neck and hefted him and says why blame my cats if he dont weigh five pound and turned him upside down and he belched out a double handful of shot and then he see how it was and he was the maddest man he set the frog down and took out after that feller but he never ketched him and here simon wheeler heard his name called from the front yard and got up to see what was wanted and turning to me as he moved away he said just set where you are stranger and rest easy i aint going to be gone a second but by your leave i did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising vagabond jim smiley would be likely to afford me much information concerning the rev leonidas w smiley and so i started away at the door i met the sociable wheeler returning and he buttonholed me and recommenced well thishyer smiley had a yeller oneeyed cow that didnt have no tail only just a short stump like a bananner and however lacking both time and inclination i did not wait to hear about the afflicted cow but took my leave footnote h published by express permission of the mark twain company as well as the trustees of the estate of samuel l clemens and harper and brothers publishers illustration ix bingismi by booth tarkington penrod schofield having been kept in for that unjust period of twenty minutes after school emerged to a deserted street that is the street was deserted so far as penrod was concerned here and there people were to be seen upon the sidewalks but they were adults and they and the shade trees had about the same quality of significance in penrods consciousness usually he saw grown people in the mass which is to say they were virtually invisible to him though exceptions must be taken in favor of policemen firemen streetcar conductors motormen and all other men in any sort of uniform or regalia but this afternoon none of these met the roving eye and penrod set out upon his homeward way wholly dependent upon his own resources to one of penrods inner texture a mere unadorned walk from one point to another was intolerable and he had not gone a block without achieving some slight remedy for the tameness of life an electriclight pole at the corner invested with powers of observation might have been surprised to find itself suddenly enacting a rфle of dubious honor in improvised melodrama penrod approaching gave the pole a look of sharp suspicion then one of conviction slapped it lightly and contemptuously with his open hand passed on a few paces but turned abruptly and pointing his right forefinger uttered the symbolic word bing the plot was somewhat indefinite yet nothing is more certain than that the electriclight pole had first attempted something against him then growing bitter when slapped and stealing after him to take him treacherously in the back had got itself shot through and through by one too old in such warfare to be caught off his guard leaving the body to lie where it was he placed the smoking pistol in a holster at his saddlebow he had decided that he was mounted and proceeded up the street at intervals he indulged himself in other encounters reining in at first suspicion of ambush with a muttered whoa charlie or whoa mike or even whoa washington for preoccupation with the enemy outweighed attention to the details of theatrical consistency though the steeds varying names were at least harmoniously masculine since a boy in these creative moments never rides a mare and having brought charlie or mike or washington to a standstill penrod would draw the sure weapon from its holster and bing bing bing let them have it it is not to be understood that this was a noisy performance or even an obvious one it attracted no attention from any pedestrian and it was to be perceived only that a boy was proceeding up the street at a somewhat irregular gait three or four years earlier when penrod was seven or eight he would have shouted bing at the top of his voice he would have galloped openly all the world might have seen that he bestrode a charger but a change had come upon him with advancing years although the grown people in sight were indeed to him as walking trees his dramas were accomplished principally by suggestion and symbol his whoas and bings were delivered in a husky whisper and his equestrianism was established by action mostly of the mind the accompanying artistry of the feet being unintelligible to the passerby and yet though he concealed from observation the stirring little scenes he thus enacted a love of realism was increasing within him early childhood is not fastidious about the accessories of its drama a cane is vividly a gun which may instantly as vividly become a horse but at penrods time of life the lath sword is no longer satisfactory indeed he now had a vague sense that weapons of wood were unworthy to the point of being contemptible and ridiculous and he employed them only when he was alone and unseen for months a yearning had grown more and more poignant in his vitals and this yearning was symbolized by one of his most profound secrets in the inner pocket of his jacket he carried a bit of wood whittled into the distant likeness of a pistol but not even sam williams had seen it the wooden pistol never knew the light of day save when penrod was in solitude and yet it never left his side except at night when it was placed under his pillow still it did not satisfy it was but the token of his yearning and his dream with all his might and main penrod longed for one thing beyond all others he wanted a real pistol that was natural pictures of real pistols being used to magnificently romantic effect were upon almost all the billboards in town the year round and as for the movie shows they could not have lived an hour unpistoled in the drug store where penrod bought his candy and soda when he was in funds he would linger to turn the pages of periodicals whose illustrations were fascinatingly pistolic some of the magazines upon the very library table at home were sprinkled with pictures of people usually in evening clothes pointing pistols at other people nay the library board of the town had emitted a selected list of fifteen books for boys and penrod had read fourteen of them with pleasure but as the fifteenth contained no weapons in the earlier chapters and held forth little prospect of any shooting at all he abandoned it halfway and read the most sanguinary of the other fourteen over again so the daily food of his imagination being gun what wonder that he thirsted for the real he passed from the sidewalk into his own yard with a subdued bing inflicted upon the stolid person of a gatepost and entering the house through the kitchen ceased to bing for a time however driven back from the fore part of the house by a dismal sound of callers he returned to the kitchen and sat down della he said to the cook do you know what id do if you was a crook and i had my ottomatic with me della was industrious and preoccupied if i was a cook she repeated ignorantly and with no cordiality well i am a cook im acookin right now either gwan in the house where yblong or git out in th yard penrod chose the latter and betook himself slowly to the back fence where he was greeted in a boisterous manner by his wistful little old dog duke returning from some affair of his own in the alley get down said penrod coldly and bestowed a spiritless bing upon him at this moment a shout was heard from the alley yay penrod and the sandy head of comrade sam williams appeared above the fence come on over said penrod as sam obediently climbed the fence the little old dog duke moved slowly away but presently glancing back over his shoulder and seeing the two boys standing together he broke into a trot and disappeared round a corner of the house he was a dog of long and enlightening experience and he made it clear that the conjunction of penrod and sam portended events which from his point of view might be unfortunate duke had a forgiving disposition but he also possessed a melancholy wisdom in the company of either penrod or sam alone affection often caused him to linger albeit with a little pessimism but when he saw them together he invariably withdrew in as unobtrusive a manner as haste would allow what you doin sam asked nothin what you ill show you if youll come over to our house said sam who was wearing an important and secretive expression what for penrod showed little interest well i said id show you if you came on over didnt i but you havent got anything i havent got said penrod indifferently i know everything thats in your yard and in your stable and there isnt a thing i didnt say it was in the yard or in the stable did i well there aint anything in your house returned penrod frankly that id walk two feet to look at not a thing oh no sam assumed mockery oh no you wouldnt you know what it is dont you yes you do penrods curiosity stirred somewhat well all right he said i got nothin to do i just as soon go what is it you wait and see said sam as they climbed the fence i bet your ole eyesll open pretty far in about a minute or so i bet they dont it takes a good deal to get me excited unless its sumpthing mighty youll see sam promised he opened an alley gate and stepped into his own yard in a manner signaling caution though the exploit thus far certainly required none and penrod began to be impressed and hopeful they entered the house silently encountering no one and sam led the way upstairs tiptoeing implying unusual and increasing peril turning in the upper hall they went into sams fathers bedroom and sam closed the door with a caution so genuine that already penrods eyes began to fulfill his hosts prediction adventures in another boys house are trying to the nerves and another boys fathers bedroom when invaded has a violated sanctity that is almost appalling penrod felt that something was about to happen something much more important than he had anticipated sam tiptoed across the room to a chest of drawers and kneeling carefully pulled out the lowest drawer until the surface of its contents mr williams winter underwear lay exposed then he fumbled beneath the garments and drew forth a large object displaying it triumphantly to the satisfactorily dumbfounded penrod it was a bluesteel colts revolver of the heaviest pattern made in the seventies mr williams had inherited it from sams grandfather a small man a deacon and dyspeptic and it was larger and more horrible than any revolver either of the boys had ever seen in any picture moving or stationary moreover greenish bullets of great size were to be seen in the chambers of the cylinder suggesting massacre rather than mere murder this revolver was real and it was loaded both boys lived breathlessly through a magnificent moment leave me have it gasped penrod leave me have hold of it you wait a minute sam protested in a whisper i want to show you how i do no you let me show you how i do penrod insisted and they scuffled for possession look out sam whispered warningly it might go off then you better leave me have it and penrod victorious and flushed stepped back the weapon in his grasp here he said this is the way i do you be a crook and suppose you got a dagger and i i dont want any dagger sam protested advancing i want that revolaver its my fathers revolaver aint it well wait a minute cant you i got a right to show you the way i do first havent i penrod began an improvization on the spot say im comin along after dark like this look sam and say you try to make a jump at me i wont sam declined this rфle impatiently i guess it aint your fathers revolaver is it well it may be your fathers but it aint yours penrod argued becoming logical it aint eithers of us revolaver so i got as much right you havent either its my fath watch cant you just a minute penrod urged vehemently im not goin to keep it am i you can have it when i get through cant you heres how i do im comin along after dark just walkin along this way like this look sam penrod suiting the action to the word walked to the other end of the room swinging the revolver at his side with affected carelessness im just walkin along like this and first i dont see you continued the actor then i kind of get a notion sumpthing wrongs liable to happen so i no he interrupted himself abruptly no that isnt it you wouldnt notice that i had my good ole revolaver with me you wouldnt think i had one because itd be under my coat like this and you wouldnt see it penrod stuck the muzzle of the pistol into the waistband of his knickerbockers at the left side and buttoning his jacket sustained the weapon in concealment by pressure of his elbow so you think i havent got any you think im just a man comin along and so you sam advanced well youve had your turn he said now its mine im goin to show you how i watch me cant you penrod wailed i havent showed you how i do have i my goodness cant you watch me a minute i have been you said yourself itd be my turn soon as you my goodness let me have a chance cant you penrod retreated to the wall turning his right side toward sam and keeping the revolver still protected under his coat i got to have my turn first havent i well yours is over long ago it isnt either i anyway said sam decidedly clutching him by the right shoulder and endeavoring to reach his left side anyway im goin to have it now you said i could have my turn out penrod carried away by indignation raised his voice i did not sam likewise lost to caution asserted his denial loudly you did too you said i never said anything you said quit that boys mrs williams sams mother opened the door of the room and stood upon the threshold the scuffling of sam and penrod ceased instantly and they stood hushed and stricken while fear fell upon them boys you werent quarreling were you maam said sam were you quarreling with penrod no maam answered sam in a small voice it sounded like it what was the matter both boys returned her curious glance with meekness they were summoning their faculties which were needed indeed these are the crises which prepare a boy for the business difficulties of his later life penrod with the huge weapon beneath his jacket insecurely supported by an elbow and by a waistband which he instantly began to distrust experienced distressful sensations similar to those of the owner of too heavily insured property carrying a gasoline can under his overcoat and detained for conversation by a policeman and if in the coming years it was to be penrods lot to find himself in that precise situation no doubt he would be the better prepared for it on account of this present afternoons experience under the scalding eye of mrs williams it should be added that mrs williamss eye was awful to the imagination only it was a gentle eye and but mildly curious having no remote suspicion of the dreadful truth for sam had backed upon the chest of drawers and closed the damnatory open one with the calves of his legs sam not bearing the fatal evidence upon his person was in a better state than penrod though when boys fall into the stillness now assumed by these two it should be understood that they are suffering penrod in fact was the prey to apprehension so keen that the actual pit of his stomach was cold being the actual custodian of the crime he understood that his case was several degrees more serious than that of sam who in the event of detection would be convicted as only an accessory it was a lesson and penrod already repented his selfishness in not allowing sam to show how he did first youre sure you werent quarreling sam said mrs williams no maam we were just talking still she seemed dimly uneasy and her eyes swung to penrod what were you and sam talking about penrod maam what were you talking about penrod gulped invisibly well he murmured it wasnt much different things what things oh just sumpthing different things im glad you werent quarreling said mrs williams reassured by this reply which though somewhat baffling was thoroughly familiar to her ear now if youll come downstairs ill give you each one cookie and no more so your appetites wont be spoiled for your dinners she stood evidently expecting them to precede her to linger might renew vague suspicion causing it to become more definite and boys preserve themselves from moment to moment not often attempting to secure the future consequently the apprehensive sam and the unfortunate penrod with the monstrous implement bulking against his ribs walked out of the room and down the stairs their countenances indicating an interior condition of solemnity and a curious shade of behavior might have here interested a criminologist penrod endeavored to keep as close to sam as possible like a lonely person seeking company while on the other hand sam kept moving away from penrod seeming to desire an appearance of aloofness go into the library boys said mrs williams as the three reached the foot of the stairs ill bring you your cookies papas in there under her eye the two entered the library to find mr williams reading his evening paper he looked up pleasantly but it seemed to penrod that he had an ominous and penetrating expression what have you been up to you boys inquired this enemy nothing said sam different things what like oh just different things mr williams nodded then his glance rested casually upon penrod whats the matter with your arm penrod penrod became paler and sam withdrew from him almost conspicuously sir i said whats the matter with your arm which one penrod quavered your left you seem to be holding it in an unnatural position have you hurt it penrod swallowed yes sir a boy bit me i mean a dog a dog bit me mr williams murmured sympathetically thats too bad where did he bite you on the right on the elbow good gracious perhaps you ought to have it cauterized sir did you have a doctor look at it no sir my mother put some stuff from the drug store on it oh i see probably its all right then yes sir penrod drew breath more freely and accepted the warm cookie mrs williams brought him he ate it without relish you can have only one apiece she said its too near dinnertime you neednt beg for any more because you cant have em they were good about that they were in no frame of digestion for cookies was it your own dog that bit you mr williams inquired sir no sir it wasnt duke penrod mrs williams exclaimed when did it happen i dont remember just when he answered feebly i guess it was day before yesterday gracious how did it he he just came up and bit me why thats terrible it might be dangerous for other children said mrs williams with a solicitous glance at sam dont you know whom he belongs to nom it was just a dog you poor boy your mother must have been dreadfully frightened when you came home and she saw she was interrupted by the entrance of a middleaged colored woman miz williams she began and then as she caught sight of penrod she addressed him directly you ma telefoam if you here send you home right away cause they waitin dinner on you run along then said mrs williams patting the visitor lightly upon his shoulder and she accompanied him to the front door tell your mother im so sorry about your getting bitten and you must take good care of it penrod yesm penrod lingered helplessly outside the doorway looking at sam who stood partially obscured in the hall behind mrs williams penrods eyes with a veiled anguish conveyed a pleading for help as well as a horror of the position in which he found himself sam however pale and determined seemed to have assumed a stony attitude of detachment as if it were well understood between them that his own comparative innocence was established and that whatever catastrophe ensued penrod had brought it on and must bear the brunt of it alone well youd better run along since theyre waiting for you at home said mrs williams closing the door goodnight penrod ten minutes later penrod took his place at his own dinnertable somewhat breathless but with an expression of perfect composure cant you ever come home without being telephoned for demanded his father yes sir and penrod added reproachfully placing the blame upon members of mr schofields own class sams mother and father kept me or id been home long ago they would keep on talkin and i guess i had to be polite didnt i his left arm was as free as his right there was no dreadful bulk beneath his jacket and at penrods age the future is too far away to be worried about the difference between temporary security and permanent security is left for grown people to penrod security was security and before his dinner was half eaten his spirit had become fairly serene nevertheless when he entered the empty carriagehouse of the stable on his return from school the next afternoon his expression was not altogether without apprehension and he stood in the doorway looking well about him before he lifted a loosened plank in the flooring and took from beneath it the grand old weapon of the williams family nor did his eye lighten with any pleasurable excitement as he sat himself down in a shadowy corner and began some sketchy experiments with the mechanism the allure of first sight was gone in mr williams bedchamber with sam clamoring for possession it had seemed to penrod that nothing in the world was so desirable as to have that revolver in his own hands it was his dream come true but for reasons not definitely known to him the charm had departed he turned the cylinder gingerly almost with distaste and slowly there stole over him a feeling that there was something repellent and threatening in the heavy blue steel thus does the longdreamed real misbehave not only for penrod more out of a sense of duty to bingism in general than for any other reason he pointed the revolver at the lawnmower and gloomingly murmured bing simultaneously a low and cautious voice sounded from the yard outside yay penrod and sam williams darkened the doorway his eye falling instantly upon the weapon in his friends hand sam seemed relieved to see it you didnt get caught with it did you he said hastily penrod shook his head rising i guess not i guess i got some brains around me he added inspired by sams presence to assume a slight swagger theyd have to get up pretty early to find any good ole revolaver once i got my hands on it i guess we can keep it all right sam said confidentially because this morning papa was putting on his winter underclothes and he found it wasnt there and they looked all over and everywhere and he was pretty mad and said he knew it was those cheap plumbers stole it that mamma got instead of the regular plumbers he always used to have and he said there wasnt any chance ever gettin it back because you couldnt tell which one took it and theyd all swear it wasnt them so it looks like we could keep it for our revolaver penrod dont it ill give you half of it penrod affected some enthusiasm sam well keep it out here in the stable yes and well go huntin with it well do lots of things with it but sam made no effort to take it and neither boy seemed to feel yesterdays necessity to show the other how he did wait till next fourth o july sam continued oh oh look out this incited a genuine spark from penrod fourth o july i guess shell be a little better than any firecrackers just a little bing bing bing shell be goin bing bing bing the suggestion of noise stirred his comrade ill bet shell go off loudern that time the gasworks blew up i wouldnt be afraid to shoot her off any time i bet you would said penrod you arent used to revolavers the way i you arent either sam exclaimed promptly i wouldnt be any more afraid to shoot her off than you would you would too i would not well lets see you then you talk so much and penrod handed the weapon scornfully to sam who at once became less selfassertive id shoot her off in a minute sam said only it might break sumpthing if it hit it hold her up in the air then it cant hurt the roof can it sam with a desperate expression lifted the revolver at arms length both boys turned away their heads and penrod put his fingers in his ears but nothing happened whats the matter he demanded why dont you go on if youre goin to sam lowered his arm i guess i didnt have her cocked he said apologetically whereupon penrod loudly jeered tryin to shoot a revolaver and didnt know enough to cock her if i didnt know any more about revolavers than that id there sam exclaimed managing to draw back the hammer until two chilling clicks warranted his opinion that the pistol was now ready to perform its office i guess shell do all right to suit you this time well whynt you go ahead then you know so much and as sam raised his arm penrod again turned away his head and placed his forefingers in his ears a pause followed whynt you go ahead penrod after waiting in keen suspense turned to behold his friend standing with his right arm above his head his left hand over his left ear and both eyes closed i cant pull the trigger said sam indistinctly his face convulsed as in sympathy with the great muscular efforts of other parts of his body she wont pull she wont penrod remarked with scorn ill bet i could pull her sam promptly opened his eyes and handed the weapon to penrod all right he said with surprising and unusual mildness you try her then inwardly discomfited to a disagreeable extent penrod attempted to talk his own misgivings out of countenance poor ittle baby he said swinging the pistol at his side with a fair pretense of careless ease aint even strong enough to pull a trigger poor ittle baby well if you cant even do that much you better watch me while i well said sam reasonably why dont you go on and do it then well i am goin to aint i well then why dont you oh ill do it fast enough to suit you i guess penrod retorted swinging the big revolver up a little higher than his shoulder and pointing it in the direction of the double doors which opened upon the alley you better run sam he jeered youll be pretty scared when i shoot her off i guess well why dont you see if i will i bet youre afraid yourself oh i am am i said penrod in a reckless voice and his finger touched the trigger it seemed to him that his finger no more than touched it perhaps he had been reassured by sams assertion that the trigger was difficult his intentions must remain in doubt and probably penrod himself was not certain of them but one thing comes to the surface as entirely definite that trigger was not so hard to pull as sam said it was bang whaaack a shattering report split the air of the stable and there was an orifice of remarkable diameter in the alley door with these phenomena three yells expressing excitement of different kinds were almost simultaneous two from within the stable and the third from a point in the alley about eleven inches lower than the orifice just constructed in the planking of the door this third point roughly speaking was the open mouth of a gayly dressed young colored man whose attention as he strolled had been thus violently distracted from some mental computations he was making in numbers including particularly those symbols of ecstasy or woe as the case might be seven and eleven his eye at once perceived the orifice on a line enervatingly little above the top of his head and although he had not supposed himself so well known in this neighborhood he was aware that he did here and there possess acquaintances of whom some such uncomplimentary action might be expected as natural and characteristic his immediate procedure was to prostrate himself flat upon the ground against the stable doors in so doing his shoulders came brusquely in contact with one of them which happened to be unfastened and it swung open revealing to his gaze two starkwhite white boys one of them holding an enormous pistol and both staring at him in stupor of ultimate horror for to the glassy eyes of penrod and sam the stratagem of the young colored man thus dropping to earth disclosed with awful certainty a slaughtered body this dreadful thing raised itself upon its elbows and looked at them and there followed a motionless moment a tableau of brief duration for both boys turned and would have fled shrieking but the body spoke ats a nice business it said reproachfully nice business tryin blow a mans head off penrod was unable to speak but sam managed to summon the tremulous semblance of a voice where where did it hit you he gasped nemmine anything bout where it hit me the young colored man returned dusting his breast and knees as he rose i want to know what kine o white boys you think you is man cant walk long street thout you blowin his head off he entered the stable and with an indignation surely justified took the pistol from the limp cold hand of penrod whose gun you playin with where you git at gun its ours quavered sam it belongs to us then you pa ought to be rested said the young colored man lettin boys play with gun he examined the revolver with an interest in which there began to appear symptoms of a pleasurable appreciation my gooness gun like iss blow a team o steers thew a brick house look at at gun with his right hand he twirled it in a manner most dexterous and surprising then suddenly he became severe you white boy listen me he said ef i went an did what i ought to did id march straight out iss stable git a policeman an tell him rest you an take you off to jail ats what you need blowin mans head off listen me im goin take iss gun an thow her away where you cant do no mo harm with her im goin take her way off in the woods an thow her away where cant nobody find her an go blowin mans head off with her ats what im goin do and placing the revolver inside his coat as inconspicuously as possible he proceeded to the open door and into the alley where he turned for a final word i let you off iss one time he said but listen me you listen white boy you bet not tell you pa i ain goin tell him an you ain goin tell him he want know where gun gone you tell him you los her he disappeared rapidly sam williams swallowing continuously presently walked to the alley door and remarked in a weak voice im sick at my stummick he paused then added more decidedly im goin home i guess ive stood about enough around here for one day and bestowing a last glance upon his friend who was now sitting dumbly upon the floor in the exact spot where he had stood to fire the dreadful shot sam moved slowly away the early shades of autumn evening were falling when penrod emerged from the stable and a better light might have disclosed to a shrewd eye some indications that here was a boy who had been extremely if temporarily ill he went to the cistern and after a cautious glance round the reassuring horizon lifted the iron cover then he took from the inner pocket of his jacket an object which he dropped listlessly into the water it was a bit of wood whittled to the likeness of a pistol and though his lips moved not nor any sound issued from his vocal organs yet were words formed they were so deep in the person of penrod they came almost from the slowly convalescing profundities of his stomach these words concerned firearms and they were wish id never seen one never want to see one again footnote

nigh three weeks wages to git to ante an come in an no tellin what raises hed have to stand after drawin cards however allowin id take a chance i skinned off five fives from my little ol bankroll and passes em over to mr holdup an then he picks up an shuffles a deck of little cards an deals me off six of them course i didnt know whatever his game was makin me a dead foul deal deliberate thataway but knowin she spelled trouble i shoves one of th cards back to him an says mr holdup i dont know jest what liberties a gentleman is allowed to take with a deck back here but out west whar i come from a feller caught in a pot with moren five cards in his hand is generally buried th next day an bein as all his business in this world aint quite settled yet five cards will do your uncle stonewall couldnt make out anyway what he give me all them dociments for unless one o th coons down to th hotel had tipped him off my bunch of lobstereaters was liable to drop in an want to set with me wall then i dropped into th stream o folks flowin in thro th door all jammin an crowdin like a bunch of wild steers an drifted inside was you ever to that opra theater ol man by cripes but she was shore a honeycooler for big honest th main corral would hold a full trail herd of three thousand head easy wall when i gits in a young feller in more soldierbuttons axes to see my cards an then he steers me down thro a narrow chute runnin along one side of th big corral to a little closepen with a low fence in front right down to one end of where they was playactin an right atop of th band dead opposite was a high stack of little pens like mine all full of folks same i reckon above me an then back further three or four big pens one above the other over where you come in an mebbe so them pens want packed none dont believe thar was a empty corner anywhere except mine jest packed everywhere with men and women th men all looked alike an most of th women stonewall could a liked th men all had on black clothes with baldfaced shirts to match their bald heads th women wall the feller that couldnt get suited in that bunch neednt wear out no leather huntin round outside an thar was a lot of them honeycoolers settin close round me that kept lookin up my way an laughin so sorta friendly like that it shore got to be real sociable wall sir that band was playin to beat any band you ever heard horns an fiddles an drums horns that worked like a accordeon pullin in an out ol mossback hefiddles that must a been moren a hundred years old to git to grow so big drums with bellies big an round as your mammys soap kettle an th boss musicmaker on a perch in th middle of th bunch shakin a little carajo pole to beat the brains out any of th outfit that want workin to suit him some of th tunes was sweet an slow enough so you could follow em afoot but most of em was so fast a fellerd need to be runnin em on his topcutting horse to git close enough to tell if they was real music or jest a hullabaloo big noise but what srprised me most ol man was to find that that thar theater was built up round one of the roughest rockiest wildest pieces of country i ever saw outside th black hills it layin in th end whar they was playactin it shore looked like a side caсon up nigh th headwaters of rapid creek big boulders an pines an cliffs an a fall carryin as much water as deadman creek an weather say that little ol theater caсon could put up a worse storm than you or me ever see in the rockies she was thunderin and lightenin till i was dead sure we was all in for a waterspout an i reckon one must a come after i left i always thought theaters was built to be funny in but that one was jest nachally full o hells own grief as long as i got to stay in her nothin doin but sufferin an murderin meanness plumb alone an lost in th caсon i reckon was a pore little gal bout sixteen year old leanin on a stump close up to whar i was settin an sobbin fit to kill herself she had bout next to nothin on an was that ganted up an lean peared like she was nigh starved to death an thar she hung an cried an cried till it peared to me some o th women folks ought to a gone to her but theyall never noticed none an went right on gassin with their fellers finally when she got so weak i thought she was goin to drop out from behind a boulder slips a great big feller all hair an whiskers but his laigs for he had on nothin but a fur huntinshirt comin halfway to his knees an in his hand he carries a long bilduque skelpingknife fore i realized he meant trouble he makes a jump an grabs th gal by th shoulder an shakes her scandalous an while hes shakin hes sorta halftalkin an halfsingin to her in some kind of talk so near like spanish i thought i could ketch some of it by cripes but that feller was hot good an plenty over something he claimed shed did an when halfsobbin an singin she peared to be tellin him she hadnt an to go off an let her alone he shook an abused her moren ever till it struck me it was about time for neighborin men folks to hop in an take a hand for it was plumb plain she was a pore sweetfaced innercent little crittur that couldnt done no harm to a hummin bird illustration but before he could lite on her with his knife i hopped out of my closepen into the caсon bout that time mr hairyman he hops back a step or two stands an scowls an grits his teeth at th gal for a minute an then he raises his knife sorta crouches for a jump an sings out near as i could make it out maudite folle folle say fini but before he could lite on her with his knife i hopped out of my closepen into the caсon jammed my in his ear an observes mr hairyman youre a liar an its stonewall kip of concho tellin you little maudy thar aint full an she dont have to say airy a thing she dont want to an if you dont pull your freight sudden for th brush ill shore shoot six different kinds of meanness outen your lowdown murderin carcass th way his whiskers skipped over boulders makin his getaway was some active while th pore little gal she jest drops off in a dead faint an lays thar till some folks comes down the gulch an carries her off then i takes th kink outen th hammer of my gun sticks her in my waistband an climbs back an gits my hat havin had moren enough of such blasted opra theaters an while i was driftin through the chute toward the main gate of th big pen to git out there was th blamedest cheerin yellin an handclappin you ever heard away from a stumpspeakin but whatever she was all about stonewall didnt stop to ax footnote j reprinted by special permission from reminiscences of a ranchman copyright by george h doran company illustration xi the liek by hermann hagedorn did you prepare this lesson burton burton big athletic handsome as a movie hero hesitated a second before he answered he was busy picking up a pad which lay under his seat he deposited the pad on the wide armrest and looked up inquiringly as though he had not fully comprehended the question mr beaver the algebra teacher was smiling his friendly and slightly irritating smile i asked you burton he repeated gently whether you had prepared did you yes sir answered burton thank you said mr beaver he opened a certain terrifying little black book and made a dot in the lower lefthand corner of a certain square opposite the name of burton perhaps he added you had better go over it again and smiled the same smile which would have been sardonic but for the mildness of his tone burton sank glumly back in his seat mr beaver regarded his little book studiously for a moment then he looked up the smile was gone the alert face adequately adorned by a reddish beard fading into gray was now solicitous harrington he said a fourth former in the middle row stood up he was slight and rather pallid and it was evident that he should begin shaving without further delay for there was already a shadow of fuzz on his cheeks and chin that made him look unwashed and rather weak his mother who was vain had insisted that he postpone shaving she could not bear to think that she was the mother of a son who was almost a man she always said it made her feel so old harrington sallow and unshorn was not an inspiring sight mr beaver evidently thought so his eyes were unquestionably serious harrington he said it seems that you are another of our weak brethren this morning did you prepare your lesson again the seconds hesitation harrington turned a shade paler if possible then with an effort he spoke no sir i was afraid not said mr beaver making another cryptic dot then he smiled harrington writhed and the rest of the class except burton laughed why not i i was ill mr beaver was at once sympathetic though serious did you report to dr stevens no sir why not i knew he had already gone you were ill after ten oclock yes sir again mr beaver smiled but surely you might have done your algebra before ten oclock i was busy sir with other lessons harrington hesitated with other lessons mr beaver repeated no sir well i had a spread there was a roar from the other boys quiet said mr beaver now harrington as i understand the situation he continued mildly you failed to prepare your lesson because you were ill in consequence of a spread which it was against the rules to indulge in is that it y yes sir professor is very much opposed to illicit spreads as you know professor was the headmaster i am afraid this will mean about thirty demerits therefore you have other demerits yes sir how many twenty mr beaver closed his little book and stood a moment by his desk looking quietly over at harrington his face was serious but even his victim could not help feeling that there was a certain affectionate sympathy behind the quiet sternness look out harrington he said at last with a return of that curious smile of his broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and the milestones are always spreads of one sort or another you may sit down the boy sat down and the work of the class proceeded two boys for widely divergent reasons heard the other boys go through their paces as though it were all a bad dream of wriggling xs and ys like snakes darting in and out of the placid waters of mr beavers endless questioning the bell clanged at last indicating the end of the period three or four boys went forward to confer with mr beaver about certain vexing algebraic problems needless to say neither burton nor harrington was among these they drifted out into the cloister with the rest of the class having certain problems of their own not algebraic one or two boys addressed burton and were rebuffed with a curt word which was unusual as burton was almost painstakingly friendly to everybody say whispered one to the other burtons got a grouch on hes sour at beaver i guess beaver is awfully fresh sometimes after all bill burtons captain of the football team hes a good deal more important to the school than beaverll ever be thats no joke either the two boys parted neither ventured to intrude again upon burtons sacred resentment for burton was a very great man at the towers no one spoke to harrington no one cared whether he had a grouch or not for harrington was a new boy who had as yet failed to fit in he was emphatically not an athlete but he was not a sissy either he was quite as emphatically not a student nor a literary light but he was as quick as a jack rabbit in his physics lab work and not to be scorned as a guesser in reading cжsar at sight he was not openly religious which kept him out of the y m c a but on the other hand in a quiet way he deeply loved the out of doors and that love like all love is a kind of worship of god harrington was unquestionably hard to place the boys as well as the masters when they spoke about him at all agreed on that the only pigeonhole into which he seemed to fit was the pigeonhole of the queer dicks his first name happened to be richard which helped to settle the classification burton passed through the west wing being a sixth former with a room on the top floor of the new building and chewing his lips crossed the wide level lawn with its strip of bright green grass that showed where the hot water pipes ran and disappeared through a door in the western end harrington did not go to his room young men who get demerits were not privileged at the towers to study in their own rooms they spent periods not occupied with recitations in the school room a long room containing some two hundred desks with a raised platform and an organ at the southern end the place had once been used as the school chapel and was still used for the morning songservice which enlivened the daily grind plaster busts of the great of all ages from homer to longfellow peered from their plaster brackets there was a verse also on the southern walls so nigh is grandeur to our dust so near is god to man when duty whispers low thou must the youth replies i can dick harrington didnt like that verse in fact he thought it was rot he disliked even more the black tablets on the opposite wall containing in gilt letters at least four inches high the names of the exemplary youths who in their time had been heads of school and in this place surrounded by models of good conduct he was supposed to study four five and sometimes six hours a day two hundred bent forms and mr watrous the days jailkeeper wandering aimlessly about pretending not to be the spy that he was altogether the schoolroom was a horror harrington bent over his desk like the rest and pretended to study french but he did not study he did a little mathematical problem instead twenty demerits and thirty demerits made fifty demerits and fifty demerits meant probation and probation meant that he could not go to chancellors hill to see the big game tomorrow afternoon that was a tragedy all the autumn the game with chancellors hill had been held before him by the old boys as the last word in thrills for a week there had been talk of nothing else you would have thought that the final whistle of that game was going to bring the heavens crashing down on creation no one seemed to be planning anything beyond that saturday afternoon the general notion seemed to be that if the towers won the rapture of that victory would make any trial thereafter bearable and if the towers lost well torture and death would in comparison be sweet and now he dick harrington who loved thrills as much as any man was not to see the game for days his nerves had been at a sharp tension of anticipation now suddenly they relaxed leaving him weak and despairing life had lost its meaning of course the game would be held anyway and there would be the excitement of getting the telegraphic reports at the end of the periods but the real thrills would all be at chancellors hill and he would be at the towers he luxuriated in misery he reveled in despair just because of a bit of a spread with sammy oakes and chet burrowes just because of one unprepared lesson of course there had been other spreads before this fatal one and of course there had been one or two unprepared lessons also therefore the original twenty demerits but why ruin a boys happiness forever because of a missed recitation dick harrington was exceedingly sorry for himself his indignation was violent while it lasted but it did not last long for there was sharp regret of another sort hovering all the while at the rim of his consciousness it was a regret not so pleasant to indulge as the other he had been made the butt the laughing stock of the algebra class he tingled and flushed at the memory of it bill burton had also flunked his lesson but burton had been able to say that he had at least prepared it and the whole proceeding had been dignified and everybody loved and admired burton all the more because with all his greatness he was just like other boys about lessons but he dick harrington had been disgraced and in the presence of william burton that after all was the hardest thing to swallow that was worse than missing the game with chancellors hill for dick harrington worshiped bill burton because he was physically and socially everything that dick never could hope to be he was the schools crack athlete the president of the sixth form the chairman of the student council the president of the y m c a he was the one great hero of the boys and the headmaster himself consulted him whenever he had a knotty problem of boynature to solve before dick had been at school a week he knew that he would rather find favor with colonel burton than see his name in gold letters in the schoolroom or for that matter on the common room tablets where the athletic records are kept the colonel was rather used to adoration and being human liked it but he was no more attentive to this particular adorer than to any one else which intensified dick harringtons case dick did not study much french on that morning in late october for suddenly a new insidious question jumped into the forefront of his thoughts why had he blurted out everything to mr beaver why hadnt he just lied that question thrust at the very roots of life and dick harrington knew it he went cold and hot by turns somehow it had never occurred to him to lie he did not know why it was possibly because his father was such a shining figure of truthfulness personified he remembered something he had overheard his mother say to his father a long time ago i never realized until i married you that it is really awful to lie was it really so awful a lie in time certainly simplified life a lot and as long as it did not hurt anybody else what was really the difference a goodygoody sundayschool teacher had told him when he was five that the lightning would smite him if he told a lie whereupon he had told a lie deliberately during the course of the next thunderstorm to test mr goodygoodys veracity and proved him a liar first thing staring at french irregular verbs dick clenched his hands trying to figure it all out suddenly forgetting where he was he pounded the desktop with his left fist then he gave a yowl which rang through the schoolroom providing exhilarating diversion to two hundred lifted heads for in his cogitations his right hand had clutched the edge of the desk on which the top closed he explained the accident to mr watrous who proved skeptical though the spy was forced to admit that the hand looked red enough to hurt the schoolroom settled again into quiet the excitement from start to finish had covered about ninety seconds no one suspected that the unshaven disheveled boy was in that studious quiet place having his first great wrestle with life the football team accompanied by the coaches the headmaster brewster and his wife a halfdozen masters and the fourth fifth and sixth forms almost in a body in autohacks and horsehacks on foot and by trolley departed for the railroad station and chancellors hill next morning at eight to the sound of cheers dick harrington stood in the great archway with the lower school and a handful of other boys like himself on probation or just broke cheering the school the team the colonel the manager the school the team and again and again the colonel until the last boy was out of sight the team was hopeful of victory the school was confident of it but the colonels face was curiously grave he smiled and joked now and then he tossed some gay piece of derision into the crowd of woebegone stayathomes but the gravity remained in the eyes all the while harrington saw it and it occurred to him that it was natural that the captain of the towers football team should feel the weight of a great responsibility he was quite sure that colonel burton had never seemed to him so heroic as today there was no question about it there was an unusual nobility in bill burtons eyes and in the carriage of his head but there was also a curious impression of suffering there and about the lips dick saw mrs brewster look at burton with a friendly somewhat quizzical smile then in two minutes the fortunate ones were gone and the towers became a st helena where a chill wind played shrilly all day long around corners of buildings and in and out the cloisters lessons that morning were a gloom and dinner in the huge half empty diningroom offered an opportunity to satisfy the boys hunger and that was all as a social function it was a flat failure everybody talked of the game as wrecked sailors drifting in an open boat talked of shore life was unreal somehow everything so empty so quiet if as some one had once remarked the towers was a very furnace of flaming life and energy some one had certainly dumped the grate the game was to be called at chancellors hill at onethirty and at onethirty the first stragglers appeared in the chilly archway to take their position at the bulletin board where the score was to be posted as it came along the wire dick harrington in sweater and cap arrived at onefortyfive the first score had just been posted chancellors hill the towers the headmasters secretary a studious but otherwise attractive young man who posted the notice volunteered the information that the chancellors hill left end had turned the trick with a fiftyfive yard run when the towers eleven had tied itself into a knot through a jumbled signal thats an awful beginning said runt woods who was standing next to dick harrington he was a little flatfaced brownie sort of boy whom everybody loved must have been in the first five minutes of play they wont get any more dick answered confidently its too bad they scored but they wont get any more his optimism was unwarranted there was a long wait without news then mr tuttle the secretary reappeared from the main building wearing a rueful smile he picked up the eraser under the bulletin board but he did not disturb the zero which stood to the credit or debit of the towers he rubbed out the that followed chancellors hill and set down somethings happened cried dick two touchdowns and a goal have happened said runt woods gloomily i dont mean that i mean that somethings happened to the team lost their heads or something he wondered whether the colonel had been taken ill the colonel was so completely the heart and soul of the team if for some reason he were out of it they must be playing the second period by now there was another long wait then at last mr tuttle looking grave reappeared at the edge of the archway he stopped dont mob me now he said trying to grin whats the score score cried a hundred voices end of the second period he said striding toward the board score to groans loud and prolonged the wind whistled through the archway the boys stuck their hands in their pockets and danced shivering but not one deserted the bulletin board they stared at the dismal figures and a dozen versions of how it must have happened were launched by imaginative spectators attacked ruthlessly and torpedoed as improbable the trouble with the whole matter of explaining chancellors hills two touchdowns was that the very fact of the touchdowns would an hour ago have seemed the last word in improbabilities they talked and shivered and bantered and sang and cheered just to keep warm for a solid hour mr tuttle reappeared at last the boys surged out of the archway into the quadrangle to meet him score whats the score get back you wild indians cried the studious secretary to some importunate first formers who were tugging at his arms there is no news and i cant get chancellors hill on the telephone there were murmurs of bewilderment the senior master tall genial and conspicuous for his good sense came out of the main building and suggested a run for healths sake he tagged runt woods lightly and was off with a shout the crowd followed him at a jogtrot past the music house past the cottage out on to the cinder track they jogged a quartermile as they reached the cottage on the return trip they saw mr tuttle dancing toward them wildly waving his arms the senior master halted his band fifteen to eleven shouted mr tuttle ecstatically we win the roar that followed was memorable eppie the confectionery man picking his teeth in his empty shop at the foot of the hill threw away his toothpick and went to the kitchen to tell his wife that the towers had won and business for the rest of the afternoon would be brisk two minutes later the jubilant invasion began dick harrington was not one of the crowd that rushed cheering down the hill he was on probation and eppies was out of bounds he stood in the archway lonely and miserable why hadnt he lied the team was due back at hainesburg the railroad station for the towers at eightthirty one or two sixth formers flushed and almost incoherent with excitement had asked the senior master for permission to organize a torchlight parade sure enough good idea exclaimed the senior master go to it dont burn yourselves up dont get lost dont get in the way of the train and dont all have apoplectic fits as my friend andrew here is promising to do shortly if some one doesnt put an ice compress on his enthusiasm but go on give em a good time thank you ever so much sir cried andrew and ill promise to cool off go way cried the senior master cheerfully you dont know how youre a perpetual human roman candle ill hold him down sir said the other boy pshaw cried the senior master youre a whizbang yourself go long shoo the boys went at eight dick harrington made his way to the study to ask the senior master whether boys on probe could join the triumphal procession the senior master was kindly but firm sorry old man he said probe rules hold that was all but dick harrington without a word went to his room on the third floor of the east wing stumbling on the stairs because of the tears why he asked himself bitterly again and again why hadnt he lied he crept out of his room an hour later hearing the cheers of the returning revelers his hallway was utterly deserted the school was deserted if he needed any further evidence that virtue did not pay here it was be good and youll be lonesome there was one aphorism proved at least suddenly standing in the quadrangle he heard singing then through the bare branches he saw the glow of many torches it was all magical and mysterious for the wild cheering which had brought him down from his room had given way to a solemn exaltation of triumph if he had had a hat on his head he would have pulled it off hearing the school song sung that way he felt a tug at his heart and again the dimness covered his eyes because he should be fated to have no active part in that thrilling chorus of victory he stood quite still swallowing hard at the end of the first stanza there was a regular yell for the towers as the procession turned sharply with torches flaring up the steep drive he could see now that they were dragging a haywagon with ropes the team was on the haywagon the second stanza of the school song floated up to him it seemed a chant drifting over from fairyland the procession came nearer now the hill and the haywagon together proved too much for the singers and the song died off in breathless laughter and another cheer then somebody started to call off the score one two three four to a climactic burst fifteen the procession disappeared behind the main building only to reappear a minute or two later around the corner of the office on the other side of the archway dick harrington wished that he had enough manly pride to scorn it all and go back to his room but he didnt so he rushed to where the crowd was gathered and listened in rapture to the cheers and the speeches and the songs and all the wonderful stories of a wonderful game colonel burton was there smiling embarrassed appreciation he had won the game for the towers when it seemed hopelessly lost every one agreed to that he made a speech thanking everybody for everything why oh why dick cried to himself as he climbed three flights after creams a halfhour later why hadnt he had the sense to lie dick harrington crept into bed and his roommate crept into bed the roommate slept and dick harrington tried to sleep but sleep eluded him it seemed for hours perhaps it was only for fifteen or twenty minutes then he too slept dreaming of torchlit chariots he woke and gave a low cry some one was sitting on his bed he started to jump up scared through but a strong hand touched his shoulder and a friendly voice whispered its all right harrie dont be scared illustration he woke and gave a low cry some one was sitting on his bed dick was still half asleep and dazed who are you he cried in an unnatural voice its bill burton who he asked amazed bill burton youre somebody trying to fool me dick whispered after a pause no im not harrie said the others deep rich voice i wanted to talk to you i couldnt wait until tomorrow so i got permission from prof and here i am what makes you want to see me asked dick softly i guess i dont understand at all i didnt think you knew me you remember yesterday in the algebra class you bet i remember whispered dick emphatically there was a moments utter quiet from away over in the direction of chicken hill came the sound of a rumpus in the black belt of hainesburg then again quiet burton spoke at last slowly and rather more softly than before beaver asked you and me the same question you remember yes murmured dick breathlessly you told him the truth i just blurted out a lot of well i lied somehow the shock of those words was to dick harrington like the impact of a terrible fist he literally saw stars the idea that the colonel should tell a lie was inconceivable sneaks and cowards lied his reeling standards straightened suddenly his bitter regret that he hadnt had the sense to lie evaporated in the glow of an overwhelming gratitude he could not speak harrie burton went on with a quiet depth of feeling which was not lost on dick for dick had deep capabilities of sympathy himself if any one bothered to find it out you told the truth and i know what it cost you i lied and it took all the stuffins out of me harrie as soon as the lie was out i felt id have given my head to have it back you see harrie quite apart from the right or wrong of it it wouldnt have mattered if i had told the truth it wouldnt no ive had a fairly good record in class lately but why did you do it thats just it old man it was habit i guess it was just the line of least resistance it was the quickest way out of a box i didnt think and bang first thing i knew id gone and done it im a good deal older than you harrie im twentyone i was a pretty bad kid until prof and mrs brewster got hold of me ive managed to get most of the worst devils under and i thought i had the liedevil under i havent told a lie for two years but i didnt have him under harrie when i least expected him there he was i guess i havent been as unhappy for a good many years as i was yesterday and today dick harrington floundered helplessly for words i never thought i was getting pretty cocky about my own goodness i guess burton went on quietly thats why i got it in the neck this way but it took the sand right out of me it seemed that all the years of tussle were in vain and i wasnt worth a little yaller dogs respect and here the school was looking to me to do big things it took it right out of me harrie do you know what was the trouble with the first two periods of the game today the team lost their heads and then you bucked em up and won the game the fellows told me that sounds good old man but the trouble was that i couldnt get my mind down on the game i was all the time thinking of that algebra class and that lie i thought of it out on the field and mixed up the plays that was the reason for those two first periods dick harrington sat bolt upright really really he exclaimed instead of trying to win the game i was all the time trying to puzzle out what i could do to wipe out that lie it wasnt square to the team it wasnt square to the school but there it was there was that lie i tried to laugh at myself but that didnt do any good there was that lie i tried to curse myself out but that didnt do any good there was that lie sitting in my heart dick stared at him through the darkness with burning eyes then what happened he cried in a low voice i dunno exactly harrie burton answered speaking very slowly suddenly i just found that i was thinking of you of me there was awe in the exclamation and then it was all clear i had to square myself with you suddenly i knew that that was what would wipe out that lie and give me a fresh start it was like a sort of revelation you see harrie i knew that you thought i was pretty fine and you just had to be set straight i i havent changed my mind at all about you said dick harrington timidly and you won the game after all bill burton leaned over the younger boy his hand groped for dicks shoulder and clutched it i didnt win the game he whispered tensely the game wasnt really played at chancellors hill at all it was played in the algebra class it was lost when i lied and it was won a minute later when you told the truth and i guess im pretty glad you told the truth so am i murmured dick very softly they both breathed deeply it had been a notable victory next morning between breakfast and sunday service dick harrington surreptitiously borrowed his roommates safety razor and shaved with shining eyes footnote k reprinted from the boy scouts year book copyright by d appleton and company illustration xii story of the bandbox by robert louis stevenson up to the age of sixteen at a private school and afterward at one of those great institutions for which england is justly famous mr harry hartley had received the ordinary education of a gentleman at that period he manifested a remarkable distaste for study and his only surviving parent being both weak and ignorant he was permitted thenceforward to spend his time in the attainment of petty and purely elegant accomplishments two years later he was left an orphan and almost a beggar for all active and industrious pursuits harry was unfitted alike by nature and training he could sing romantic ditties and accompany himself with discretion on the piano he was a graceful although a timid cavalier he had a pronounced taste for chess and nature had sent him into the world with one of the most engaging exteriors than can well be fancied a fortunate chance and some influence obtained for harry at the time of his bereavement the position of private secretary to majorgeneral sir thomas vandeleur c b sir thomas was a man of sixty loudspoken boisterous and domineering for some reason some service the nature of which had been often whispered and repeatedly denied the rajah of kashgar had presented this officer with the sixth largest known diamond of the world the gift transformed general vandeleur from a poor into a wealthy man from an obscure and unpopular soldier into one of the lions of london society the possessor of the rajahs diamond was welcome in the most exclusive circles and he had found a lady young beautiful and wellborn who was willing to call the diamond hers even at the price of marriage with sir thomas vandeleur it was commonly said at the time that as like draws to like one jewel had attracted another certainly lady vandeleur was not only a gem of the finest water in her own person but she showed herself to the world in a very costly setting and she was considered by many respectable authorities as one among the three or four bestdressed women in england harrys duty as secretary was not particularly onerous but he had a dislike for all prolonged work it gave him pain to ink his fingers and the charms of lady vandeleur and her toilets drew him often from the library to the boudoir he had the prettiest ways among women could talk fashions with enjoyment and was never more happy than when criticizing a shade of ribbon or running on an errand to the milliners in short sir thomas correspondence fell into pitiful arrears and my lady had another ladys maid at last the general who was one of the least patient of military commanders arose from his place in a violent excess of passion and indicated to his secretary that he had no further use for his services with one of those explanatory gestures which are most rarely employed between gentlemen the door being unfortunately open mr hartley fell downstairs head foremost he arose somewhat hurt and very deeply aggrieved the life in the generals house precisely suited him he moved on a more or less doubtful footing in very genteel company he did little he ate of the best and he had a lukewarm satisfaction in the presence of lady vandeleur immediately after he had been outraged by the military foot he hurried to the boudoir and recounted his sorrows you know very well my dear harry replied lady vandeleur for she called him by name like a child or a domestic servant that you never by any chance do what the general tells you i shall be sorry to lose you but since you cannot stay longer in a house where you have been insulted i shall wish you goodbye and i promise you to make the general smart for his behavior my lady said he what is an insult i should think little indeed of any one who could not forgive them by the score but to leave ones friends to tear up the bonds of affection he was unable to continue for his emotion choked him and he began to weep lady vandeleur looked at him with a curious expression this little fool she thought why should he not become my servant instead of the generals he is goodnatured obliging and understands dress and besides it will keep him out of mischief that night she talked over the general who was already somewhat ashamed of his vivacity and harry was transferred to the feminine department where his life was little short of heavenly he was always dressed with uncommon nicety wore delicate flowers in his buttonhole and could entertain a visitor with tact and pleasantry one fine morning he came into the drawingroom and began to arrange some music on the top of the piano lady vandeleur at the other end of the apartment was speaking somewhat eagerly with her brother charlie pendragon an elderly young man much broken with dissipation and very lame of one foot the private secretary to whose entrance they paid no regard could not avoid overhearing a part of their conversation today or never said the lady once and for all it shall be done today today it must be replied the brother with a sigh but it is a false step a ruinous step clara and we shall live to repent it dismally lady vandeleur looked her brother steadily and somewhat strangely in the face you forget she said the man must die at last upon my word clara said pendragon i believe you are the most heartless rascal in england you men she returned are so coarsely built that you can never appreciate a shade of meaning you are yourselves rapacious violent immodest careless of distinction and yet the least thought for the future shocks you in a woman i have no patience with such stuff you would despise in a common banker the imbecility that you expect to find in us you are very likely right replied her brother you were always cleverer than i and anyway you know my motto the family before all yes charlie she returned taking his hand in hers i know your motto better than you know it yourself and clara before the family is not that the second part of it indeed you are the best of brothers and i love you dearly mr pendragon got up looking a little confused by these family endearments i had better not be seen said he i understand my part to a miracle and ill keep an eye on the tame cat do she replied he is an abject creature and might ruin all she kissed the tips of her fingers to him daintily and the brother withdrew by the boudoir and the backstair harry said lady vandeleur turning toward the secretary as soon as they were alone i have a commission for you this morning but you shall take a cab i cannot have my secretary freckled she spoke the last words with emphasis and a look of halfmotherly pride that caused great contentment to poor harry and he professed himself charmed to find an opportunity of serving her it is another of our great secrets she went on archly and no one must know of it but my secretary and me sir thomas would make the saddest disturbance and if you only knew how weary i am with these scenes oh harry harry can you explain to me what makes you men so violent and unjust but indeed i know you cannot you are the only man in the world who knows nothing of these shameful passions you are so good harry and so kind you at least can be a womans friend and do you know i think you make the others more ugly by comparison it is you said harry gallantly who are so kind to me you treat me like like a mother interposed lady vandeleur i try to be a mother to you or at least she corrected herself with a smile almost a mother i am afraid i am too young to be your mother really let us say a friend a dear friend but all this is beside our purpose she resumed you will find a bandbox in the lefthand side of the oak wardrobe it is underneath the pink slip that i wore on wednesday with my mechlin you will take it immediately to this address and she gave him a slip of paper but do not on any account let it out of your hands until you have received a receipt written by myself do you understand answer if you please answer this is extremely important and i must ask you to pay some attention harry pacified her by repeating her instructions perfectly and she was just going to tell him more when general vandeleur flung into the apartment scarlet with anger and holding a long and elaborate milliners bill in his hand will you look at this madam cried he will you have the goodness to look at this document i know well enough you married me for my money and i hope i can make as great allowance as any other man in the service but as sure as god made me i mean to put a period to this disreputable prodigality mr hartley said lady vandeleur i think you understand what you have to do may i ask you to see to it at once stop said the general addressing harry one word before you go and then turning again to lady vandeleur what is this precious fellows errand he demanded i trust him no further than i do yourself let me tell you if he had as much as the rudiments of honesty he would scorn to stay in this house and what he does for his wages is a mystery to all the world what is his errand madam and why are you hurrying him away i supposed you had something to say to me in private replied the lady you spoke about an errand insisted the general do not attempt to deceive me in my present state of temper you certainly spoke about an errand if you insist on making your servants privy to our humiliating dissensions replied lady vandeleur perhaps i had better ask mr hartley to sit down no she continued then you may go mr hartley i trust you may remember all that you have heard in this room it may be useful to you harry at once made his escape from the drawingroom and as he ran upstairs he could hear the generals voice upraised in declamation and the thin tones of lady vandeleur planting icy repartees at every opening how cordially he admired the wife how skillfully she could evade an awkward question with what secure effrontery she repeated her instructions under the very guns of the enemy and on the other hand how he detested the husband there had been nothing unfamiliar in the mornings events for he was continually in the habit of serving lady vandeleur on secret missions principally connected with millinery there was a skeleton in the house as he well knew the bottomless extravagance and the unknown liabilities of the wife had long since swallowed her own fortune and threatened day by day to ingulf that of the husband once or twice in every year exposure and ruin seemed imminent and harry kept trotting round to all sorts of furnishers shops telling small fibs and paying small advances on the gross amount until another term was tided over and the lady and her faithful secretary breathed again for harry in a double capacity was heart and soul upon that side of the war not only did he adore lady vandeleur and fear and dislike her husband but he naturally sympathized with the love of finery and his own single extravagance was at the tailors he found the bandbox where it had been described arranged his toilet with care and left the house the sun shone brightly the distance he had to travel was considerable and he remembered with dismay that the generals sudden interruption had prevented lady vandeleur from giving him money for a cab on this sultry day there was every chance that his complexion would suffer severely and to walk through so much of london with a bandbox on his arm was a humiliation almost insupportable to a youth of his character he paused and took counsel with himself the vandeleurs lived in eaton place his destination was near notting hill plainly he might cross the park by keeping well in the open and avoiding populous alleys and he thanked his stars when he reflected that it was still comparatively early in the day anxious to be rid of his incubus he walked somewhat faster than his ordinary and he was already some way through kensington gardens when in a solitary spot among trees he found himself confronted by the general i beg your pardon sir thomas observed harry politely falling on one side for the other stood directly in his path where are you going sir asked the general i am taking a little walk among the trees replied the lad the general struck the bandbox with his cane with that thing he cried you lie sir and you know you lie indeed sir thomas returned harry i am not accustomed to be questioned in so high a key you do not understand your position said the general you are my servant and a servant of whom i have conceived the most serious suspicions how do i know but that your box is full of teaspoons it contains a silk hat belonging to a friend said harry very well replied general vandeleur then i want to see your friends silk hat i have he added grimly a singular curiosity for hats and i believe you know me to be somewhat positive i beg your pardon sir thomas i am exceedingly grieved harry apologized but indeed this is a private affair the general caught him roughly by the shoulder with one hand while he raised his cane in the most menacing manner with the other harry gave himself up for lost but at the same moment heaven vouchsafed him an unexpected defender in the person of charlie pendragon who now strode forward from behind the trees come come general hold your hand said he this is neither courteous nor manly aha cried the general wheeling round upon his new antagonist mr pendragon and do you suppose mr pendragon that because i have had the misfortune to marry your sister i shall suffer myself to be dogged and thwarted by a discredited and bankrupt libertine like you my acquaintance with lady vandeleur sir has taken away all my appetite for the other members of her family and do you fancy general vandeleur retorted charlie that because my sister has had the misfortune to marry you she there and then forfeited her rights and privileges as a lady i own sir that by that action she did as much as anybody could to derogate from her position but to me she is still a pendragon i make it my business to protect her from ungentlemanly outrage and if you were ten times her husband i would not permit her liberty to be restrained nor her private messenger to be violently arrested how is that mr hartley interrogated the general mr pendragon is of my opinion it appears he too suspects that lady vandeleur has something to do with your friends silk hat charlie saw that he had committed an unpardonable blunder which he hastened to repair how sir he cried i suspect do you say i suspect nothing only where i find strength abused and a man brutalizing his inferiors i take the liberty to interfere as he said these words he made a sign to harry which the latter was too dull or too much troubled to understand in what way am i to construe your attitude sir demanded vandeleur why sir as you please returned pendragon the general once more raised his cane and made a cut for charlies head but the latter lame foot and all evaded the blow with his umbrella ran in and immediately closed with his formidable adversary run harry run he cried run you dolt harry stood petrified for a moment watching the two men sway together in this fierce embrace then he turned and took to his heels when he cast a glance over his shoulder he saw the general prostrate under charlies knee but still making desperate efforts to reverse the situation and the gardens seemed to have filled with people who were running from all directions toward the scene of the fight this spectacle lent the secretary wings and he did not relax his pace until he had gained the bayswater road and plunged at random into an unfrequented bystreet to see two gentlemen of his acquaintance thus brutally mauling each other was deeply shocking to harry he desired to forget the sight he desired above all to put as great a distance as possible between himself and general vandeleur and in his eagerness for this he forgot everything about his destination and hurried before him headlong and trembling when he remembered that lady vandeleur was the wife of one and sister of the other of these gladiators his heart was touched with sympathy for a woman so distressingly misplaced in life even his own situation in the generals house looked hardly so pleasing as usual in the light of these violent transactions he had walked some little distance busied with these meditations before a slight collision with another passenger reminded him of the bandbox on his arm heavens cried he where was my head and whither have i wandered thereupon he consulted the envelope which lady vandeleur had given him the address was there but without a name harry was simply directed to ask for the gentleman who accepted a parcel from lady vandeleur and if he were not at home to await his return the gentleman added the note should present a receipt in the handwriting of the lady herself all this seemed mighty mysterious and harry was above all astonished at the omission of the name and the formality of the receipt he had thought little of this last when he heard it dropped in conversation but reading it in cold blood and taking it in connection with the other strange particulars he became convinced that he was engaged in perilous affairs for half a moment he had a doubt of lady vandeleur herself for he found these obscure proceedings somewhat unworthy of so high a lady and became more critical when her secrets were preserved against himself but her empire over his spirit was too complete he dismissed his suspicions and blamed himself roundly for having so much as entertained them in one thing however his duty and interest his generosity and his terrors coincided to get rid of the bandbox with the greatest possible dispatch he accosted the first policeman and courteously inquired his way it turned out that he was already not far from his destination and a walk of a few minutes brought him to a small house in a lane freshly painted and kept with the most scrupulous attention the knocker and bellpull were highly polished flowering potherbs garnished the sills of the different windows and curtains of some rich material concealed the interior from the eyes of curious passengers the place had an air of repose and secrecy and harry was so far caught with this spirit that he knocked with more than usual discretion and was more than usually careful to remove all impurity from his boots a servantmaid of some personal attractions immediately opened the door and seemed to regard the secretary with no unkind eyes this is the parcel from lady vandeleur said harry i know replied the maid with a nod but the gentleman is from home will you leave it with me i cannot answered harry i am directed not to part with it but upon a certain condition and i must ask you i am afraid to let me wait well said she i suppose i may let you wait i am lonely enough i can tell you and you do not look as though you would eat a girl but be sure and do not ask the gentlemans name for that i am not to tell you do you say so cried harry why how strange but indeed for some time back i walk among surprises one question i think i may surely ask without indiscretion is he the master of this house he is a lodger and not eight days old at that returned the maid and now a question for a question do you know lady vandeleur i am her private secretary replied harry with a glow of modest pride she is pretty is she not pursued the servant oh beautiful cried harry wonderfully lovely and not less good and kind you look kind enough yourself she retorted and i wager you are worth a dozen lady vandeleurs harry was properly scandalized i he cried i am only a secretary do you mean that for me said the girl because i am only a housemaid if you please and then relenting at the sight of harrys obvious confusion i know you mean nothing of the sort she added and i like your looks but i think nothing of your lady vandeleur oh these mistresses she cried to send out a real gentleman like you with a bandbox in broad day during this talk they had remained in their original positions she on the doorstep he on the sidewalk bareheaded for the sake of coolness and with the bandbox on his arm but upon this last speech harry who was unable to support such pointblank compliments to his appearance nor the encouraging look with which they were accompanied began to change his attitude and glance from left to right in perturbation in so doing he turned his face toward the lower end of the lane and there to his indescribable dismay his eyes encountered those of general vandeleur the general in a prodigious fluster of heat hurry and indignation had been scouring the streets in chase of his brotherinlaw but so soon as he caught a glimpse of the delinquent secretary his purpose changed his anger flowed into a new channel and he turned on his heel and came tearing up the lane with truculent gestures and vociferations harry made but one bolt of it into the house driving the maid before him and the door was slammed in his pursuers countenance is there a bar will it lock asked harry while a salvo on the knocker made the house echo from wall to wall why what is wrong with you asked the maid is it this old gentleman if he gets hold of me whispered harry i am as good as dead he has been pursuing me all day carries a swordstick and is an indian military officer these are fine manners cried the maid and what if you please may be his name it is the general my master answered harry he is after this bandbox did not i tell you cried the maid in triumph i told you i thought worse than nothing of your lady vandeleur and if you had an eye in your head you might see what she is for yourself an ungrateful minx i will be bound for that the general renewed his attack upon the knocker and his passion growing with delay began to kick and beat upon the panels of the door it is lucky observed the girl that i am alone in the house your general may hammer until he is weary and there is none to open for him follow me so saying she led harry into the kitchen where she made him sit down and stood by him herself in an affectionate attitude with a hand upon his shoulder the din at the door so far from abating continued to increase in volume and at each blow the unhappy secretary was shaken to the heart what is your name asked the girl harry hartley he replied mine she went on is prudence do you like it very much said harry but hear for a moment how the general beats upon the door he will certainly break it in and then in heavens name what have i to look for but death you put yourself very much about with no occasion answered prudence let your general knock he will do no more than blister his hands do you think i would keep you here if i were not sure to save you oh no i am a good friend to those that please me and we have a back door upon another lane but she added checking him for he had got upon his feet immediately on this welcome news but i will not show where it is unless you kiss me will you harry that i will he cried remembering his gallantry not for your back door but because you are good and pretty and he administered two or three cordial salutes which were returned to him in kind then prudence led him to the back gate and put her hand upon the key will you come and see me she asked i will indeed said harry do not i owe you my life and now she added opening the door run as hard as you can for i shall let in the general harry scarcely required this advice fear had him by the forelock and he addressed himself diligently to flight a few steps and he believed he would return to lady vandeleur in honor and safety but these few steps had not been taken before he heard a mans voice hailing him by name with many execrations and looking over his shoulder he beheld charlie pendragon waving him with both arms to return the shock of this new incident was so sudden and profound and harry was already worked into so high a state of nervous tension that he could think of nothing better than to accelerate his pace and continue running he should certainly have remembered the scene in kensington gardens he should certainly have concluded that where the general was his enemy charlie pendragon could be no other than a friend but such was the fever and perturbation of his mind that he was struck by none of these considerations and only continued to run the faster up the lane charlie by the sound of his voice and the vile terms that he hurled after the secretary was obviously beside himself with rage he too ran his very best but try as he might the physical advantages were not upon his side and his outcries and the fall of his lame foot on the macadam began to fall further and further into the wake harrys hopes began once more to arise the lane was both steep and narrow but it was exceedingly solitary bordered on either hand by garden walls overhung with foliage and for as far as the fugitive could see in front of him there was neither a creature moving nor an open door providence weary of persecution was now offering him an open field for his escape alas as he came abreast of a garden door under a tuft of chestnuts it was suddenly drawn back and he could see inside upon a garden path the figure of a butchers boy with his tray upon his arm he had hardly recognized the fact before he was some steps beyond upon the other side but the fellow had had time to observe him he was evidently much surprised to see a gentleman go by at so unusual a pace and he came out into the lane and began to call after harry with shouts of ironical encouragement his appearance gave a new idea to charlie pendragon who although he was now sadly out of breath once more upraised his voice stop thief he cried and immediately the butchers boy had taken up the cry and joined in the pursuit this was a bitter moment for the hunted secretary it is true that his terror enabled him once more to improve his pace and gain with every step on his pursuers but he was well aware that he was near the end of his resources and should he meet any one coming the other way his predicament in the narrow lane would be desperate indeed i must find a place of concealment he thought and that within the next few seconds or all is over with me in this world scarcely had the thought crossed his mind than the lane took a sudden turning and he found himself hidden from his enemies there are circumstances in which even the least energetic of mankind learn to behave with vigor and decision and the more cautious forget their prudence and embrace foolhardy resolutions this was one of those occasions for harry hartley and those who knew him best would have been the most astonished at the lads audacity he stopped dead flung the bandbox over a garden wall and leaping upward with incredible agility and seizing the copestone with his hands he tumbled headlong after it into the garden he came to himself a moment afterward seated in a border of small rosebushes his hands and knees were cut and bleeding for the wall had been protected against such an escalade by a liberal provision of old bottles and he was conscious of a general dislocation and a painful swimming in the head facing him across the garden which was in admirable order and set with flowers of the most delicious perfume he beheld the back of a house it was of considerable extent and plainly habitable but in odd contrast to the grounds it was crazy illkept and of a mean appearance on all other sides the circuit of the garden wall appeared unbroken he took in these features of the scene with mechanical glances but his mind was still unable to piece together or draw a rational conclusion from what he saw and when he heard footsteps advancing on the gravel although he turned his eyes in that direction it was with no thought either for defense or flight the newcomer was a large coarse and very sordid personage in gardening clothes and with a wateringpot in his left hand one less confused would have been affected with some alarm at the sight of this mans huge proportions and black and lowering eyes but harry was too gravely shaken by his fall to be so much as terrified and if he was unable to divert his glances from the gardener he remained absolutely passive and suffered him to draw near to take him by the shoulder and to plant him roughly on his feet without a motion of resistance for a moment the two stared into each others eyes harry fascinated the man filled with wrath and a cruel sneering humor who are you he demanded at last who are you to come flying over my wall and break my gloire de dijons what is your name he added shaking him and what may be your business here harry could not as much as proffer a word in explanation but just at that moment pendragon and the butchers boy went clumping past and the sound of their feet and their hoarse cries echoed loudly in the narrow lane the gardener had received his answer and he looked down into harrys face with an obnoxious smile a thief he said upon my word and a very good thing you must make of it for i see you dressed like a gentleman from top to toe are you not ashamed to go about the world in such a trim with honest folk i dare say glad to buy your castoff finery secondhand speak up you dog the man went on you can understand english i suppose and i mean to have a bit of talk with you before i march you to the station indeed sir said harry this is all a dreadful misconception and if you will go with me to sir thomas vandeleurs in eaton place i can promise that all will be made plain the most upright person as i now perceive can be led into suspicious positions my little man replied the gardener i will go with you no further than the stationhouse in the next street the inspector no doubt will be glad to take a stroll with you as far as eaton place and have a bit of afternoon tea with your great acquaintances or would you prefer to go direct to the home secretary sir thomas vandeleur indeed perhaps you think i dont know a gentleman when i see one from a common runthehedge like you clothes or no clothes i can read you like a book here is a shirt that maybe cost as much as my sunday hat and that coat i take it has never seen the inside of ragfair and then your boots the man whose eyes had fallen upon the ground stopped short in his insulting commentary and remained for a moment looking intently upon something at his feet when he spoke his voice was strangely altered what in gods name said he is all this harry following the direction of the mans eyes beheld a spectacle that struck him dumb with terror and amazement in his fall he had descended vertically upon the bandbox and burst it open from end to end thence a great treasure of diamonds had poured forth and now lay abroad part trodden in the soil part scattered on the surface in regal and glittering profusion there was a magnificent coronet which he had often admired on lady vandeleur there were rings and brooches eardrops and bracelets and even unset brilliants rolling here and there among the rosebushes like drops of morning dew a princely fortune lay between the two men upon the ground a fortune in the most inviting solid and durable form capable of being carried in an apron beautiful in itself and scattering the sunlight in a million rainbow flashes good heavens said harry i am lost his mind raced backward into the past with the incalculable velocity of thought and he began to comprehend his days adventures to conceive them as a whole and to recognize the sad imbroglio in which his own character and fortunes had become involved he looked round him as if for help but he was alone in the garden with his scattered diamonds and his redoubtable interlocutor and when he gave ear there was no sound but the rustle of the leaves and the hurried pulsation of his heart it was little wonder if the young man felt himself a little deserted by his spirits and with a broken voice repeated his last ejaculation i am lost the gardener peered in all directions with an air of guilt but there was no face at any of the windows and he seemed to breathe again pick up a heart he said you fool the worst of it is done why could you not say at first there was enough for two two he repeated ay and for two hundred but come away from here where we may be observed and for the love of wisdom straighten out your hat and brush your clothes you could not travel two steps the figure of fun you look just now while harry mechanically adopted these suggestions the gardener getting upon his knees hastily drew together the scattered jewels and returned them to the bandbox the touch of these costly crystals sent a shiver of emotion through the mans stalwart frame his face was transfigured and his eyes shone with concupiscence indeed it seemed as if he luxuriously prolonged his occupation and dallied with every diamond that he handled at last however it was done and concealing the bandbox in his smock the gardener beckoned to harry and preceded him in the direction of the house near the door they were met by a young man evidently in holy orders dark and strikingly handsome with a look of mingled weakness and resolution and very neatly attired after the manner of his caste the gardener was plainly annoyed by this encounter but he put as good a face upon it as he could and accosted the clergyman with an obsequious and smiling air here is a fine afternoon mr rolles said he a fine afternoon as sure as god made it and here is a young friend of mine who had a fancy to look at my roses i took the liberty to bring him in for i thought none of the lodgers would object speaking for myself replied the reverend mr rolles i do not nor do i fancy any of the rest of us would be more difficult upon so small a matter the garden is your own mr raeburn we must none of us forget that and because you give us liberty to walk there we should be indeed ungracious if we so far presumed upon your politeness as to interfere with the convenience of your friends but on second thoughts he added i believe that this gentleman and i have met before mr hartley i think i regret to observe that you have had a fall and he offered his hand a sort of maiden dignity and a desire to delay as long as possible the necessity for explanation moved harry to refuse this chance of help and to deny his own identity he chose the tender mercies of the gardener who was at least unknown to him rather than the curiosity and perhaps the doubts of an acquaintance i fear there is some mistake said he my name is thomlinson and i am a friend of mr raeburns indeed said mr rolles the likeness is amazing mr raeburn who had been upon thorns throughout this colloquy now felt it high time to bring it to a period i wish you a pleasant saunter sir said he and with that he dragged harry after him into the house and then into a chamber on the garden his first care was to draw down the blind for mr rolles still remained where they had left him in an attitude of perplexity and thought then he emptied the broken bandbox on the table and stood before the treasure thus fully displayed with an expression of rapturous greed and rubbing his hand upon his thighs for harry the sight of the mans face under the influence of this base emotion added another pang to those he was already suffering it seemed incredible that from his life of pure and delicate trifling he should be plunged in a breath among sordid and criminal relations he could reproach his conscience with no sinful act and yet he was now suffering the punishment of sin in its most acute and cruel forms the dread of punishment the suspicions of the good and the companionship and contamination of vile and brutal natures he felt he could lay his life down with gladness to escape from the room and the society of mr raeburn and now said the latter after he had separated the jewels into two nearly equal parts and drawn one of them nearer to himself and now said he everything in this world has to be paid for and some things sweetly you must know mr hartley if such be your name that i am a man of a very easy temper and good nature has been my stumbling block from first to last i could pocket the whole of these pretty pebbles if i chose and i should like to see you dare to say a word but i think i must have taken a liking to you for i declare i have not the heart to shave you so close so do you see in pure kind feeling i propose that we divide and these indicating the two heaps are the proportions that seem to me just and friendly do you see any objection mr hartley may i ask i am not the man to stick upon a brooch but sir cried harry what you propose to me is impossible the jewels are not mine and i cannot share what is anothers no matter with whom nor in what proportions they are not yours are they not returned raeburn and you could not share them with anybody couldnt you well now that is what i call a pity for here i am obliged to take you to the station the police think of that he continued think of the disgrace for your respectable parents think he went on taking harry by the wrist think of the colonies and the day of judgment i cannot help it wailed harry it is not my fault you will not come with me to eaton place no replied the man i will not that is certain and i mean to divide these playthings with you here and so saying he applied a sudden and severe torsion to the lads wrist harry could not suppress a scream and the perspiration burst forth upon his face perhaps pain and terror quickened his intelligence but certainly at that moment the whole business flashed across him in another light and he saw that there was nothing for it but to accede to the ruffians proposal and trust to find the house and force him to disgorge under more favorable circumstances and when he himself was clear from all suspicion i agree he said there is a lamb sneered the gardener i thought you would recognize your interests at last this bandbox he continued i shall burn with my rubbish it is a thing that curious folk might recognize and as for you scrape up your gayeties and put them in your pocket harry proceeded to obey raeburn watching him and every now and again his greed rekindled by some bright scintillation abstracting another jewel from the secretarys share and adding it to his own when this was finished both proceeded to the front door which raeburn cautiously opened to observe the street this was apparently clear of passengers for he suddenly seized harry by the nape of the neck and holding his face downward so that he could see nothing but the roadway and the doorsteps of the houses pushed him violently before him down one street and up another for the space of perhaps a minute and a half harry had counted three corners before the bully relaxed his grasp and crying now be off with you sent the lad flying headforemost with a welldirected and athletic kick when harry gathered himself up halfstunned and bleeding freely at the nose mr raeburn had entirely disappeared for the first time anger and pain so completely overcame the lads spirits that he burst into a fit of tears and remained sobbing in the middle of the road after he had thus somewhat assuaged his emotion he began to look about him and read the names of the streets at whose intersection he had been deserted by the gardener he was still in an unfrequented portion of west london among villas and large gardens but he could see some persons at a window who had evidently witnessed his misfortune and almost immediately after a servant came running from the house and offered him a glass of water at the same time a dirty rogue who had been slouching somewhere in the neighborhood drew near him from the other side poor fellow said the maid how vilely you have been handled to be sure why your knees are all cut and your clothes ruined do you know the wretch who used you so that i do cried harry who was somewhat refreshed by the water and shall run him home in spite of his precautions he shall pay dearly for this days work i promise you you had better come into the house and have yourself washed and brushed continued the maid my mistress will make you welcome never fear and see i will pick up your hat why love of mercy she screamed if you have not dropped diamonds all over the street such was the case a good half of what remained to him after the depredations of mr raeburn had been shaken out of his pockets by the somersault and once more lay glittering on the ground he blessed his fortune that the maid had been so quick of eye there is nothing so bad but it might be worse thought he and the recovery of these few seemed to him almost as great an affair as the loss of all the rest but alas as he stooped to pick up his treasures the loiterer made a rapid onslaught overset both harry and the maid with a movement of his arms swept up a double handful of the diamonds and made off along the street with an amazing swiftness harry as soon as he could get upon his feet gave chase to the miscreant with many cries but the latter was too fleet of foot and probably too well acquainted with the locality for turn where the pursuer would he could find no traces of the fugitive in the deepest despondency harry revisited the scene of his mishap where the maid who was still waiting very honestly returned to him his hat and the remainder of the fallen diamonds harry thanked her from his heart and being now in no humor for economy made his way to the nearest cab stand and set off for eaton place by coach the house on his arrival seemed in some confusion as if a catastrophe had happened in the family and the servants clustered together in the hall and were unable or perhaps not altogether anxious to suppress their merriment at the tatterdemalion figure of the secretary he passed them with as good an air of dignity as he could assume and made directly for the boudoir when he opened the door an astonishing and even menacing spectacle presented itself to his eyes for he beheld the general and his wife and of all people charlie pendragon closeted together and speaking with earnestness and gravity on some important subject harry saw at once that there was little left for him to explain plenary confession had plainly been made to the general of the intended fraud upon his pocket and the unfortunate miscarriage of the scheme and they had all made common cause against a common danger thank heaven cried lady vandeleur here he is the bandbox harry the bandbox but harry stood before them silent and downcast speak she cried speak where is the bandbox and the men with threatening gestures repeated the demand harry drew a handful of jewels from his pocket he was very white this is all that remains said he i declare before heaven it was through no fault of mine and if you will have patience although some are lost i am afraid forever others i am sure may be still recovered alas cried lady vandeleur all our diamonds are gone and i owe ninety thousand pounds for dress madam said the general you might have paved the gutter with your own trash you might have made debts to fifty times the sum you mention you might have robbed me of my mothers coronet and rings and nature might have still so far prevailed that i could have forgiven you at last but madam you have taken the rajahs diamond the eye of light as the orientals poetically termed it the pride of kashgar you have taken from me the rajahs diamond he cried raising his hands and all madam all is at an end between us believe me general vandeleur she replied that is one of the most agreeable speeches that ever i heard from your lips and since we are to be ruined i could almost welcome the change if it delivers me from you you have told me often enough that i married you for your money let me tell you now that i always bitterly repented the bargain and if you were still marriageable and had a diamond bigger than your head i should counsel even my maid against a union so uninviting and disastrous as for you mr hartley she continued turning on the secretary you have sufficiently exhibited your valuable qualities in this house we are now persuaded that you equally lack manhood sense and selfrespect and i can see only one course open for you to withdraw instanter and if possible return no more for your wages you may rank as a creditor in my late husbands bankruptcy harry had scarcely comprehended this insulting address before the general was down upon him with another and in the meantime said that personage follow me before the nearest inspector of police you may impose upon a simpleminded soldier sir but the eye of the law will read your disreputable secret if i must spend my old age in poverty through your underhand intriguing with my wife i mean at least that you shall not remain unpunished for your pains and god sir will deny me a very considerable satisfaction if you do not pick oakum from now until your dying day with that the general dragged harry from the apartment and hurried him downstairs and along the street to the policestation of the district here says my arabian author ended this deplorable business of the bandbox but to the unfortunate secretary the whole affair was the beginning of a new and manlier life the police were easily persuaded of his innocence and after he had given what help he could in the subsequent investigation he was even complimented by one of the chiefs of the detective department on the probity and simplicity of his behavior several persons interested themselves in one so unfortunate and soon after he inherited a sum of money from a maiden aunt in worcestershire with this he married prudence and set sail for bendigo or according to another account for trincomalee exceedingly content and with the best of prospects illustration xiii the hero and the cowboyl by joseph c lincoln not every boy is permitted to spend a vacation down cape cod way in

coughed like a horse with the heaves started up some sort of buzzplaner underneath and then we begun to move from the time we left my shanty at south orham till we passed the pines at herrin neck i laid back in that stuffed cockpit feelin as grand and tainted as old john d himself the automobile rolled along smooth but swift and it seemed to me i had never known what easy travlin was afore as we rounded the bend by the pines and opened up the twelvemile narrow white stretch of setuckit beach ahead of us with the ocean on one side and the bay on tother i looked at my watch wed come that fur in thirteen minutes land sakes i says this is what i call movin right along he turned round and sized me up again like he was surprised movin says he movin why pard weve been settin down to rest out our way if a lynchin party didnt move faster than weve done so fur the center of attraction would die on the road of old age now my heroic college chum he goes on callin me out of my name as usual will

cause theres more hard sand there and hold on dont do that stop it i tell you them was the last rememberable words said by me durin the next quarter of an hour that shover man let out a hairraisin yell hauled the nickel marlinespike over in its rack and squeezed a rubber bag that was spliced to the steerinwheel there was a half dozen toots or howls or honks from under our bows somewheres and then that automobile hopped off the ground and commenced to fly the fust hop landed me on my knees in the cockpit and there i stayed twas the most fittin position fur my frame of mind and chimed in fustrate with the general religious drift of my thoughts the cutthrough is two mile or more from herrin neck cording to my count we hit terra cotta just three times in them two miles the fust hit knocked my hat off the second one chucked me up so high i looked back for the hat and though we was a half mile away from it it hadnt had time to git to the ground and all the while the horn was a honkin and billings was a screechin and the sand was a flyin sand why say do you see that extra bald place on the back of my head yes well there was a twoinch thatch of hair there afore that sandblast ground it off when i went up on the third jounce i noticed the cutthrough just ahead billings see it too and would you blieve it the lunatic stood up let go of the wheel with one hand takes off his hat and waves it and we charge down across them wet tide flats like death on the woolly horse in scriptur hi yah yip whoops billings come on in fellers the waters fine yow yeee yip illustration for a second it left off rainin sand and there was a typhoon of mud and spray for a second it left off rainin sand and there was a typhoon of mud and spray i see a million of the prettiest rainbows that is i callated there was a million its awful hard to count when youre bouncin and prayin and drowndin all to once then we sizzed out of the channel over the flats on tother side and on towards setuckit never mind the rest of the ride twas all a sort of constant changin sameness i remember passin a blurred lifesavin station with three or maybe thirty blurred men jumpin and laughin and hollerin i found out afterwards that theyd been on the lookout for the bombshell for half an hour billings had told around town what he was goin to do to me and some kind friend had telephoned it to the station so the lifesavers was full of anticipations i hope they were satisfied i hadnt rehearsed my part of the show none but i feel what the parson calls a consciousness of havin done my best woa gal says billings calm and easy puttin the helm hard down the auto was standin still at last part of me was hangin over the lee rail i could see out of the part so i know twas my head and there alongside was my fishshanty at the pint goin round and round in circles i undid the hatch of the cockpit and fell out on the sand then i scrambled up and caught hold of the shanty as it went past me that fool shover watched me seeminly interested why pard says he whats the matter do you feel pale are you nervous it aint possible that youre scared honest now pard if it werent that i knew you were a genuine

mates hove in and that shover he put his head back and laughed and laughed and laughed ii i tell you i had to take it that evenin all the time i was cookin and while he was eatin supper billings was rubbin it into me about my bein scared called me all the saltwaterhero names he could think of hobson and dewey and the like of that usin em sourcastic of course finally he said he remembered readin in school when he was little about a girl hero name of grace darlin said he callated if i didnt mind hed call me grace cause it was heroic and yet kind of fitted in with my particlar brand of bravery i didnt answer much he had me down and i knew it likewise i judged he was more or less out of his head no sane man would yell the way he done aboard that automobile then he commenced to spin yarns about himself and his doins and pretty soon it come out that hed been a cowboy afore young stumpton give up ranchin and took to automobilin that cleared the skyline some of course id read considerble about cowboys in the tencent books my nephew fetched home when he was away to school i see right off that billings was the livin image of deadwood dick and wild bill and the rest in them books they yelled and howled and hadnt no regard for life and property any moren he had no sir he want no craziern they was it was in the breed i judged i sure wish i had you on the ranch grace says he why dont

automobile of yours and st peter himself couldnt coax me into that again not if twas fur a cruise plumb up the middle of the golden street i meant it too and the next afternoon when it come time to start for home he found out that i meant it wed shot a lot of ducks and billings was havin such a good time that i had to coax and tease him as if he was a young one afore hed think of quittin it was quarter of six when he backed the gascart out of the shed i was uneasy cause twas past lowwater time and there was fog comin on brace up dewey says he get in no mr billings says i i aint goin to get

that the dory want big enough and shes carried five easy afore now we had an argument that lasted twenty minutes more and the fog driftin in nigher all the time at last he got sick of arguin ripped out something brisk and personal and got his tinshop to movin you want to cross over to the ocean side i called after him the cutthroughs been dredged at the bay end remember be hanged he yells or more emphatic and off he whizzed i see him go and fetched a long breath thanks to a merciful providence id come so fur without bein buttered on the undercrust of that automobile or scalped with its crazy shovers bowieknife ten minutes later i was beatin out into the bay in my dory all around was the fog thin as poorhouse gruel so fur but thickenin every minute i was worried not for myself you understand but for that cowboy shover i was afraid he wouldnt fetch tother side of the cutthrough there want much wind and i had to make long tacks i took the inshore channel and kept listenin all the time and at last when twas pretty dark and i was callatin to be about abreast of the bay end of the cutthrough i heard from somewheres ashore a dismal honkin kind of noise same as a wild goose might make if twas chokin to death and not resigned to the worst my land says i its happened and i come about and headed straight in for the beach i struck it just alongside the govment shanty the engineers had knocked off work for the week waitin for supplies but they hadnt took away their dunnage hi i yells as i hauled up the dory hiii billings where be you the honkin stopped and back comes the answer there was joy in it what is that captain stitt yes i sings out where be you im stuck out here in the middle of the crick and theres a flood on help me cant you next minute i was aboard the dory rowin her against the tide up the channel pretty quick i got where i could see him through the fog and dark the auto was on the flat in the middle of the cutthrough and the water was hub high already billings was standin up on the forard thwart makin wet footmarks all over them expensive cushions lord says he i sure am glad to see you pard can we get to land do you think land says i makin the dory fast alongside and hoppin out into the drink course we can land whats the matter with your old derelict sprung a leak has it he went on to explain that the automobile had broke down when he struck the flat and he couldnt get no further hed been honkin and howlin for ten year at least so he reckoned why in time says i didnt you mind me and go up the ocean side and why in nation didnt you go ashore and but never mind that now let me think here you set where you be as i shoved off in the dory again he turned loose a distress signal where you goin he yells say pard you aint goin to leave me here are you ill be back in a shake says i layin to my oars dont holler so youll have the lifesavers down here and then the jokell be on us hush cant you ill be right back iii i rowed up channel a little ways and then i sighted the place i was bound for them govment folks had another shanty further up the cutthrough moored out in front of it was a couple of big floats for their stonesloops to tie up to at highwater the floats were made of empty kerosenebarrels and planks and theyd have held up a house easy i run alongside the fust one cut the anchorcable with my jackknife and next minute i was navigatin that float down channel steerin it with my oar and towin the dory astern twas no slouch of a job pilotin that big float but part by steerin and part by polin i managed to land her broadside on to the auto i made her fast with the cable ends and went back after the other float this one was a bigger job than the fust but by and by that gaswagon with planks under her and cable lashins holdin her firm was restin easy as a settin hen between them two floats i unshipped my mast fetched it aboard the nighest float and spread the sail over the biggest part of the brasswork and upholstery there says i if it rains durin the night shell keep pretty dry now ill take the dory and row back to the shanty after some spare anchors there is there but whats it fur pard asks billings for the nine hundred and ninetyninth time why dont we go where its dry the floods risin all the time let it rise i says i callate when it gets high enough them floatsll rise with it and lift the automobile up too if shes anchored bow and stern shell hold unless it comes on to blow a gale and tomorrow mornin at low tide maybe you can tinker her up so shell go go says he like he was astonished do you mean to say youre reckonin to save the car good land i says starin at him what else dyou spose think id let seventyfive hundred dollars wuth of giltedged extravagance go to the bottom what did you callate i was tryin to save the clamflat give me that doryrope im goin after them anchors sufferin snakes where is the dory what have you done with it hed been holdin the bight of the doryrodin i handed it to him sos hed have somethin to take up his mind and by time hed forgot all about it and let it drop and the dory had gone adrift and was out of sight gosh says he astonishedlike pard the son of a gun has slipped his halter i was pretty mad dories dont grow on every beachplum bush but there want nothin to say that fitted the case so i didnt try humph says i well ill have to swim ashore thats all and go up to the station inlet after another boat you stand by the ship if she gets afloat afore i come back you honk and holler and ill row after you ill fetch the anchors and well moor her wherever she happens to be if she shouldnt float on an even keel or goes to capsize you jump overboard and swim ashore ill swim says he with a shake in his voice why pard i cant swim i turned and looked at him shover of a twomileaminute goldplated butchercart like that a cowboy murderer that et his friends for breakfast and couldnt swim i fetched a kind of combination groan and sigh turned back the sail climbed aboard the automobile and lit up my pipe what are you settin there for says he what are you goin to do do says i wait thats all wait and smoke we wont have to wait long my prophesyin was good we didnt have to wait very long it was pitch dark foggy as ever and the tide a risin fast the floats got to be awash i shinned out on to em picked up the oar that had been left there and took my seat again billings climbed in too only and it kind of shows the change sence the previous evenin he was in the passengercockpit astern and i was forard in the pilot house for a reckless daredevil he was actin mighty fidgety and at last one of the floats swung off the sand the automobile tipped scandalous it looked as if we was goin on our beamends billings let out an awful yell then tother float bobbed up and the whole shebang car and all drifted out and down the channel my lashins held i callated they would soons i was sure of that i grabbed up the oar and shoved it over the stern between the floats i hoped i could round her to after we passed the mouth of the cutthrough and make port on the inside beach but not in that tide inside of five minutes i see twas no use we was bound across the bay and now commenced a vyage that beat any ever took sence noahs time i callate and even noah never went to sea in an automobile though the one animal i had along was as much trouble as his whole menagerie billings was howlin blue murder stop that bellerin i ordered quit it dyou hear youll have the station crew out after us and theyll guy me till i cant rest shut up if you dont ill ill swim ashore and leave you i was takin big chances as i look at it now he might have drawed a bowieknife or a lasso on me cordin to his yarns hed butchered folks for a good sight lessn that but he kept quiet this time only gurglin some when the ark tilted i had time to think of another idee you remember the dorysail mast and all was alongside that cart i clewed up the canvas well as i could and managed to lash the mast up straight over the autos bows then i shook out the sail here says i turnin to billings you hang on to that sheet no you neednt nuther make it fast to that cleat alongside i couldnt see his face plain but his voice had a funny tremble to it reminded me of my own when i climbed out of that very cart after hed jounced me down to setuckit the day before what he says whwhat what sheet i dont see any sheet what do you want me to do tie this line to that cleat that cleat there cleat you lubber cleat that knob make it fast oh my gosh tmighty get out of my way the critter had tied the sheet to the handle of the door instead of the one i meant and the pull of the sail hauled the door open and pretty nigh ripped it off the hinges i had to climb into the cockpit and straighten out the mess i was losin my temper i do hate bunglin seamanship aboard a craft of mine but whatll become of us begs billings will we drown what in tunket do we want to drown for aint we got a good sailin breeze and the whole bay to stay on top of fifty foot of water and more fifty foot he yells is there fifty foot of water underneath us now pard you dont mean it course i mean it good thing too but fifty foot its enough to drown in ten times over cant drown but once can you and id just as soon drown in fifty foot as four ruther cause twouldnt take so long he didnt answer out loud but i heard him talkin to himself pretty constant iv we was well out in the bay by now and the seas was a little mite more rugged nothin to hurt you understand but the floats was all foam and once in a while wed ship a little spray and every time that happened billings would jump and grab for somethin solid sometimes twas the upholstery and sometimes twas me he want on the thwart but down in a heap on the cockpit floor let go of my leg i sings out after wed hit a high wave and that shover had made a moren ordinary savage claw at my underpinnin you make me nervous drat this everlastin fog somethin ll bump into us if we dont look out here you go forard and light them cruisinlights they aint colored cordin to regulations but theyll have to do go forard what you waitin for well it turned out that he didnt like to leave that cockpit i was mad go forard there and light them lights i yelled hangin to the steerin oar and keepin the ark runnin afore the wind i wont he says loud and emphatic think im a blame fool i sure would be a jackrabbit to climb over them seats the way theyre buckin and light them lamps youre talkin through your hat well i hadnt no business to do it but you see i was on salt water and skipper as you might say of the junk we was afloat in and if theres one thing i never would stand its mutiny i hauled in the oar jumped over the cockpitrail and went for him he see me comin stood up tried to get out of the way and fell overboard backwards part of him lit on one of the floats but the biggest part trailed in the water between the two he clawed with his hands but the planks was slippery and he slid astern fast just as he reached the last plank and slid off and under i jumped after him and got him by the scruff of the neck i had hold of the lashinend with one hand and we tailed out behind the ark which was sloppin along graceful as an elephant on skates i was pretty well beat out when i yanked him into that cockpit again neither of us said anything for a spell breath bein scurce as dimonds but when hed collected some of his he spoke pard he says puffin im much obleeged to you i reckon i sure aint treated you right if it hadnt been for you that time id but i was bilin over i whirled on him like a teetotum drat your hide i says when you speak to your officer you say sir and now you go forard and light them lights dont you answer back if you do ill fix you sos youll never ship aboard another vessel forard there lively you lubber lively he went forard takin considerable time and hangin on for dear life but somehow or nuther he got the lights to goin and all the time i hazed him terrible i was mate on an australian packet afore i went fishin to the banks and i can haze some i blackguarded that shover awful rippertyrip your everlastin blankertyblanked doughhead i roared at him you aint wuth the weight to sink you forard there and get that foghorn to goin and keep it goin lively you sculpin dont you open your mouth to me well all night we sloshed along straight acrost the bay we must have been a curious sight to look at the floats was awash so that the automobile looked like she was ridin the waves all by her lonesome the lamps was blazin at either side of the bow billings was a tootin the rubber foghorn as if he was wound up and i was standin on the cushions amidships keepin the whole calabash afore the wind we never met another craft the whole night through yes we did meet one old ezra cahoon of harnis was out in his dory stealin quahaugs from seth andrewss bed over nigh the wapatomac shore ezra stayed long enough to get one good glimpse of us as we bust through the fog then he cut his rodin and laid to his oars bound for home and mother we could hear him screech for half an hour after he left us ez told next day that the devil had come ridin acrost the bay after him in a chariot of fire said he could smell the brimstone and hear the trumpet callin him to judgment likewise he hove in a lot of particulars concernin the personal appearance of the old boy himself who he said was standin up wavin a redhot pitchfork some folks might have been flattered at bein took for such a famous character but i want im retirin by nature and besides ezs description want callated to bust a bodys vanitybiler i was prouder of the consequences the same bein that ezra signed the good templars pledge that afternoon and kept it for three whole months just sixtynine days longer than any previous attack within the memory of man had lasted and finally just as mornin was breakin the bows of the floats slid easy and slick up on a hard sandy beach then the sun riz and the fog lifted and there we was within sight of the south ostable meetinhouse wed sailed eighteen miles in that ark and made a better landin blindfold than we ever could have made on purpose i hauled down the sail unshipped the mast and jumped ashore to find a rock big enough to use for a makeshift anchor it want moren three minutes after we fust struck afore my boots hit dry ground but billings beat me one hundred and seventy seconds at that when i had time to look at that shover man he was a cableslength from hightide mark settin down and grippin a bunch of beachgrass as if he was afeard the sand was goin to slide from under him and you never seen a yallerer more upset critter in your born days well i got the ark anchored after a fashion and then we walked up to the south ostable tavern sim small who runs the place he knows me so he let me have a room and i turned in for a nap i slept about three hours when i woke up i started out to hunt the automobile and billings both of em looked considerble better than they had when i see em last the shover had got a gang of men and theyd got the gascart ashore and billings and a blacksmith was workin over or rather under the clockwork hello i hails comin alongside billings sticks his head out from under the tinware hi pard says he i noticed he hadnt called me grace nor dewey for a long spell hi pard he says gettin to his feet the old gal aint hurt a hair shell be good as ever in a couple of hours then you and me can start for orham in her says i sure he says not by a jugful says i emphatic ill borrer a boat to get to orham in when im ready to go you wont ketch me in that mankiller again and you can call me a coward all you want to a coward says he you a coward and why you was in that car all night oh i says last night was diffrent the thing was on the water then and when ive got enough water underneath me i know im safe safe he sings out safe well by gosh pard i hate to say it but its the lords truth you had me doin my now i lay mes for a minute we looked at each other then says i sort of thinkin out loud i callate i says that whether a mans brave or not depends considerble on whether hes used to his latitude its all accordin it lays in the bringin up as the duck said when the hen tried to swim he nodded solemn pard says he i sure reckon youve called the turn lets shake hands on it footnote l reprinted from the depot master copyright by d appleton and company illustration xiv the dollarm by morgan robertson his name was angus macpherson pronounced macphairson but he was so intensely scotch that in every ship he had sailed in men called him scotty he had a face like a harvestmoon with a sorrowful expression of the eyes a frame like a gladiators a brogue modified from its original consistency to an understandable dialect and the soul of a scotchman which means that he was possessed by two dominant and conflicting passions love of god and love of mammon add to these attributes a masterful knowledge of seamanship and an acquaintance with navigation and you have a rough sketch of him as he stood at the wheel of a towbarge just out of new york her name was the anita and she was the second barge in a tow of two ahead of her at the end of a ninetyfathom steel towline was the sister barge champion and at an equal distance farther ahead was the steamer proserpine each barge carried stump spars and muttonleg canvas which was why scotty weary of the endless work in the deepwater windjammers had gone towbarging and the three craft belonged to one owner the skipper a young man with a humorous face and democratic manner as became a lowly barge skipper appeared before the scotsman jingling in his hand a number of bright silver dollars scotty eyed them hungrily fine arent they scotty he said how many of these plunkers does the devil need to buy your soul more than you can count cappen bolt answered scotty gravely my soul no belongs to me but to my maker nonsense laughed the captain a scot loves the siller first his maker next why a jew cant make a living in your country scotty possibly not cappen but its no because scotchmen are dishonest the lord has given us wits thats all dead broke scotty asked captain bolt idly i banked the most o my pay sir ay im what you might call broke too bad ought to have held some out therell be no money at philadelphia owners kickin wants to save the interest and he wont pay off till we get back scottys face assumed a rueful expression and captain bolt watched it from the tail of his eye then before scotty could speak the prolonged clatter of the stewards dinnerbell began and the captain moved towards the companion pocketing the coins as he went one fell on the deck the noise of the bell preventing its fall being heard and the captain did not see it but scotty did and he watched it roll back towards the taffrail assume a spiral motion and lie down just aft of the quarterbitt the captain was now down in the cabin but scotty picked up the coin to hold for him until he came up he should have let it lie for it was bright and beautiful to look at hard and slippery to the touch as he held it in his trousers pocket a pleasing contrast to the coming emptiness of that pocket in philadelphia scottys soul went through the usual conflict in such cases and when captain bolt came up rubbing his mouth love of mammon had won over love of god and he said nothing about it shortly after he was relieved and he went forward on the way a revulsion set in and he turned back resolved to hand it over as though he had forgotten but the captain had stepped below again and with the memory of his boasted honesty and the certainty of the captains skepticism and ridicule in his mind he turned again and went to the forecastle when he had eaten his dinner and slept four hours he found on waking that his inclination to return it was stronger than at noon but the certainty of being disbelieved had gained equally in strength and the dollar remained in his pocket a source of guilty joy and expectant misgiving he longed for the day when it would be spent and off his mind and calculated the days and hours before the tow would reach philadelphia but scotty did not reach philadelphia he fell overboard just within the delaware capes and though he bawled lustily as the black side of the barge slipped by him in the darkness and was answered in kind by his watchmates above the noise did not reach the relentless power eleven hundred feet away and he was left behind but one had thrown him a lifebuoy and on this he floated until daylight when an outbound tug picked him up the tug was bound to boston ill een make the best o it said scotty as he wrung out his wet clothing in the tugs small forecastle and ill regard the dollar as a special deespensation of an allwise providence for what would i do in boston wioot a bit o money in my clothes but he did not reach boston the tug had a full crew scant accommodations and a hardhearted captain who decreed that scotty should be put aboard the first craft that would take him this happened to be a threeskysailyard american ship the baltimore two days out from new york for shanghai whose skipper backed his yard in answer to the tugcaptains offer to give him a sailor and whose thirdmate received scotty not with open arms but clinched fists as he dropped swearing to the deck in a bosuns chair you ought to be glad youre alive said her skipper harshly when scotty had later come aft to protest against his abduction he pulled you out of a lifebuoy where youd ha drowned fore the next craft came along and puts you aboard a big safe ship where you couldnt fall overboard if you tried get forward now and stop this talk and am i to be put on the articles demanded scotty i expect to wark whereer i be but do i get pay im askin no my articles are full youll wark your passage four months sleevery in a hellship growled scotty as he went forward this comes o backsleedin lord forgi me for it but the punishment is hard howeer ill just hang on to the dollar ill ha earned it long this side o the cape he did and continued to earn it until the ship had neared the yangtsekiang marked for the officers attentions by his initial profane and irreverent comment on his transferral by the tugcaptain he was assaulted on the slightest provocation by the mates no bigger than he or more skillful of fist but justified by the law and though easily the best sailorman of the mixed crew was put at distasteful tasks while inferior men worked at sailorly work on ropes and rigging there was nothing of this in the watch below for scotty could thrash the best two men forward and led them all in forecastle discourse but as it was a mixed crew none too honest in his opinion he made a monkbag a leather pocket for his dollar and hung it around his neck and to further protect the precious coin forswore his religion called himself a catholic and the monkbag a phylactery with a saints relic within this brought him to the notice of a gentlesouled portuguese of the crew a true believer who made friends with the scot and earned his confidence before he learned of the shamness of the phylactery scotty on lookout one night told him this in a burst of confidence that also included a confession of his peculation his friend horrified not at the theft but at the sacrilegious fraud informed him that the coin was accursed that his soul was accursed and that the only salvation for him in this life and the next was first that he return the stolen dollar by hand to its rightful owner next that he become a real believer in the only true church instead of an impostor if you do not he said you have alla time badda luck till you die then purgatory and the flame perhaps the flames of sheol could not have turned scotty from his faith but he was certainly impressed with the first clause of the obligation ye maun be right manuel he said for though i thought it a deespensation i find that all my hard luck came after it ill gie it back when i may whos on lookout here demanded the burly third mate as he climbed the forecastle steps hey whos on lookout i am sir answered scotty as manuel drew out of the way get down on the maindeck you dago son of a thief bellowed the officer aiming a kick at the retreating portuguese d ye see that light he said to scotty with a man to help you keep lookout d ye see it scotty derelict in his duty did not see it for some moments in fact not until the third mate was through with him then he looked through closing eyes to where the third mate pointed dead ahead where a white light shone faintly in the darkness ay ay sir he said thickly i see it and ill een remember this night when i meet ye on shore mr smart im no shipped in the craft and its a matter for the underwriters to know puttin me on lookout as it is i doot id meet trouble should i pull yer head off the noo im no a shipped man d ye hear the last was like the roar of an angry bull and the officer backed away from the enraged scotchman then he descended the steps and in a minute a man came up and relieved him the light did not move and the wind being gentle the day broke before the ship had come up to it then they saw a black tramp steamer rolling easily in the trough with a string of small flags flying from aloft and the english ensign from the flagstaff at the taffrail there was an exchange of signals between the two crafts until eight bells struck and then scotty just about to sit down to his breakfast was called aft and told to get his belongings ready for another transshipment scottys belongings the few rags he had collected by various methods from his shipmates were hardly worth taking but he regretted his breakfast though glad to quit the ship as he slid down the davittackle he surmised the meaning of the change by the expression on the third mates face as he peered over the rail and some words uttered by the captain among which he only made out one underwriters im told said the semiuniformed captain of the tramp that you are a castaway picked up on the american coast and are discontented with the ship i dinna ken what the sleevedrivers telt ye cappen answered scotty his brogue a little thicker from his emotions but i agree that im discontented whats wrong with your face ran foul o the third mates fist for no seem your light i were no one o the crew yet they put me on lookout and i strongly suspect cappen that im bundled off mair on account o that than because of my discontent possibly but im a man short and will sign you at shanghai wages three pounds a month you will not be struck here and will be well treated while you do your work were bound for boston and will go on when the engine is mended im obleeged to ye sir said scotty radiantly and bostons the port for me sir ive strong reasons for strikin that coast he still had his dollar secure in its leather casing hung to his neck but in this ship he said nothing about it nothing unpleasant happened to him on this passage homeward and he fondly believed that his sincere intent to return the dollar to captain bolt had changed his luck that his painful friction with mr smarts fist was a providential happening but providence had ordered otherwise and in this manner the steamer captain ahead of his reckoning while approaching the coast in thick fog ran his ship at full speed onto the sands of cape cod he was unable to back off a rising wind and sea threw the steamer broadside to the beach and here she churned a hole for herself from which a wrecking tug could hardly pull her but a wrecking tug was sent for by signals to the shore when the fog lifted and in time one arrived with a lifeboat in tow which was a lucky forethought of some one for the rising wind and sea had developed into a storm that was breaking the ship in pieces anchored well out and steaming with full power into the teeth of the gale the tug slacked down the lifeboat and one by one the crew sprang into the sea and was pulled in six trips in and out completed the rescue and scotty came out on the last with the frantic captain who never ceased his bitter selfreproach but scotty irresponsible had troubles of his own he was wet and cold for it was midwinter and once aboard the wrecking tug he fled the captains inward objurgations and sought the warmth of the firehold here he burrowed far along beside the boilers and being utterly exhausted as well as chilled and drenched and far from the captains voice fell into a sleep which lasted until the tug had tied up at boston then he came out to find his shipmates gone ashore are you the missing man o that crew asked the mate of the tug your skipper says to stay here and hell bring you your pay thats gude answered scotty cheerfully but ill just stretch my legs on the dock a wee bit for its a long time since ive been ashore the tug was moored outside of a small schooner whose crew as he crossed her deck were loosing sails singling lines and making other obvious preparations to getting away as he mounted her rail to climb to the dock he saw his captain looking sadly down on him its just as well my man he said that you couldnt be found for i didnt sign you before the consul and want no complications however ill pay you here just sign this receipt an even two months at three pounds a month ay ay sir and thank you cappen he reached up and secured the slip of paper and a pencil handed down then first examining the document with scottish caution knelt down and signed his name to a receipt for six pounds passing it up he received a cylindrical roll of coins from the captain and thanked him again then he turned to drop to the deck but his foot slipping on the hard painted rail he came down on all fours and the roll of coin left his grasp catch it quick called the captain from above look out for that scupper its rolling right into it scotty made a frantic scramble towards his treasure and just missed closing his fingers on it before it rolled into the scupper then he heard the tinkling sound as it struck the water over the side domnation he roared as he rose to his feet twa months pay gone to the deil and i never een laid eyes on it im very sorry my man said the captain there were six gold sovereigns and i have your receipt i cant pay you again na na cappen answered scotty as sadly as the captain tis na fault o yourn nor mine its my luck and itll neer change till i git to new york and find my old skipper im under a curse i am but the captain had gone want to get to new york asked a voice behind him that i do said scotty shortly as he faced the speaker it was the captain of the schooner im a man short he said wheres your clos on my back cappen i lost twa months pay the noo and cant repleenish my wardrobe its fine weather and you wont need any i pay twenty a month turn to scotty went to new york in this schooner that is he went as far as the sandy hook lightship where the skipper a man of poor judgment mistakingly put about under the bow of an outwardbound steamer which had slowed down to discharge her pilot and which went ahead too soon for the welfare of that schooner the impact was not dead on it was a glancing blow that the schooner received and it only carried away the weather main rigging and the davit on the stern but scotty was at work in this weather main rigging and foreseeing disaster to the frail spider web to which he clung he leaped for the big stockless anchor of the steamer just before it caught the shrouds on this he sat perched while wire rope snapped over and around him and as the steamer forged ahead managed to make himself heard over the shouts and curses with which the two skippers paid their parting compliments he was lifted up and taken to the captain a man black in the face from rage and overstrained vocabulary the captain greeted scotty with inarticulate snorts and can ye put me on some craft bound in cappen asked scotty anxiously naow roared the irate man put you board nothing nor will i put you on the articles curse you ill put you to work and if you dont work your hands off ill charge you for your passage to melbourne get out o this i tell ye roared scotty in return equally enraged at the prospect of another trip to the antipodes if ye dont get rid of me yell no reach melbourne im a jonah a jonah from the curse that has come to me put me ashore ye poor unfortunate fule scotty was led away after the gentle manner of the sea and in spite of his loud protestations that he was a competent able seaman placed at the degrading labor of coal passing when the cooler atmosphere of the stokehole had lowered his temperature somewhat he again went to the captain and earnestly told his story of his theft his bad luck and the bad luck he had brought to others the curse is awarkin and agrowin on me cappen he concluded sorrowfully im the lineeal desceendent o the flyin dutchman sir and ill wrack your ship wioot meanin to ive read the bible said the captain calmly i know what to do with jonahs i always throw them overboard scotty shoveled and wheeled coal for three months then his prediction was fulfilled within a days run to melbourne the screw slipped off the tailshaft and as it went to the bottom of the indian ocean the racing engine went to pieces this might not have prevented the steamers reaching port under sail or tow but the forward crankpin broke and the piston drove up with nothing to stop it fetched up with a mighty jolt against the cylinder head which held and disconnected most of the bolts which bound the cylinder to its bed as the steamer fell off in the hollow of the sea she rolled and at the third roll the halfton of metal toppled over crashed down through the bottom of the ship and sought the company of the screw she was a compartmentless steamer and in half an hour had followed leaving her crew afloat in boats and on liferafts scotty found himself in the boat with the captain and wisely anticipating rebuke had brought his shovel the captain glared unspeakable things at him itll do ye no good the noo cappen said scotty anticipating the captains outburst and if you or a man o your crew lay the weight o your finger upon me ill brain ye wi my staff of office he elevated the shovel i warned ye in time ye should ha heeded me put down your shovel and take an oar commanded the captain id shoot you dead if it wasnt for the law but youll get out o this boat onto the first craft we meet bound in or bound out itll be bound out cappen said scotty gravely ha no fear o that it was an italian bark and as scotty had predicted she was bound out to rio janeiro as scotty learned later when the flotilla of boats swarmed into her path she backed her main yards with much chattering and yelling of her crew and scottys boat approached her side where a jacobsladder hung invitingly get up there you miserable sawnee said the skipper i wouldnt put you aboard a white mans vessel for youll wreck her as you did mine it is very impolite and sometimes inexpedient to call a scot a sawnee scotty climbed the ladder with his shovel and when he stood upon the rail turned and let it fly towards the captain in the sternsheets had it struck edge first it would have cut him in two as it happened the handle merely flattened his nose the captain sank down then rising fired a revolver at scotty but missed and forthwith ordered his men to give way and then amid the excited cries and orders of the italian captain scotty was pulled down from the rail mobbed around the deck a little though he fought furiously by the three mates of the bark and bundled into a hatchhouse and long after he was locked in he could hear the excited and puzzled accents of the italian captain calling to the misguided castaways who would not be rescued then he heard the yards braced and knew that he was homeward bound if the bloody hooker dont sink on the way he growled howeer ill no revile the craft that carries me for its lang odds she gits the warst o it shipboard etiquette is international scotty in throwing the shovel had violated the strictest clause in the code and the italian captain though understanding nothing of the circumstances had sensed the enormity of his offense and punished him but he was not confined long the door was soon opened and from the jabbering and gestures of the three mates he understood that he was to go forward he went and with a bucket of salt water and a piece of old canvas so improved his personal appearance as to partly overrule the prejudice against him seamanship like nautical etiquette is international and though he understood not one word of what was said to him and though not a man aboard understood him yet he knew what to do without orders and soon proved himself superior to any of the officers the rather impulsive but generous captain noticed this and made as much of him as was possible without a common means of communication but scotty ascribed it to the influence of the unblessed but jealously guarded leather pendant often visible on his hairy chest he made the most of this influence among the men forward and even went to the blasphemous extent of making the sign of the cross on occasions and repeating certain words picked up from his devout shipmates of the roman catholic ritual but when he prayed alone and in the silence of the night he prayed for forgiveness for the removal of the curse for opportunity to redeem himself for the test of a tenmile swim or a thousandmile walk to the end that he might place that stolen dollar in the hand of captain bolt but his prayers availed not he became a man without a country the italian bark caught fire in the south atlantic and in the confusion of abandoning the charred and sinking hulk scotty found himself alone in a small quarterboat which like himself had been left behind and which he had lowered and unhooked unaided but he had been unable to find the oars and the other boats were far away so he spent seven days and nights in the cockleshell freezing by night roasting by day with the horrors of hunger and thirst for company and was then rescued in a delirious state of mind by a norwegian barkentine bound for cape town there is no need of recounting his further adventures in detail he had now been a year without touching land and he spent four more at sea before there came to him even a gleam of hope no matter what the craft or what the port bound for something occurred to destroy the ship or prevent him finishing the passage at times when an alleged advance of pay was worked off he drew clothing from the ships slop chest and always left it behind when the curse closed down upon him and removed him from that ship once he was abandoned with a boy third mate and three others on a derelict which they had been sent to inspect and from the neighborhood of which a furious gale drove their own vessel they were rescued just before the derelict sank again in manila bay he swam to a nearby ship which he had heard was bound to new york and secreted himself only to find when at sea that she was bound for liverpool he made the stormy passage of the horn in midwinter with the clothing he stood in too eager to touch dry land at liverpool he quit the ship in a runners boat before docking and the boat getting in the way of an outbound oceantug he went to sea on the tug and was again put aboard the first craft met an english fourmaster bound for calcutta and it was in this ship that there came to him the gleam of hope mentioned in her forecastle he found the quondam third mate of the big skysailyarder the mr smart who backed by the law had thrashed him on the forecastle deck and later arranged his transfer to the tramp scotty had long since forgiven him regarding him as but an instrument of the lord but the instrument down on his luck and forethemast in a limejuicer must needs refer to it again and again until the sorely tried man gave way then occurred one of the shortest and fiercest fights that ever delighted the souls of english sailors scotty did the fighting and he struck out twice but each blow was like the kick of a mule and smart was carried aft to have his broken ribs and jawbone reset while scotty went in irons for murderous assault but the captain released him on learning that the war began in an american ship there was no further trouble between these two but scotty drew comfort and hope from the incident because it seemed his first victory over the forces that opposed him cholera was rampant in calcutta and not a man but the skipper left the ship while there then she sailed for new york and scottys hope increased he carefully guarded the black and grimy talisman of evil that hung to his neck and prayed fervently for the final test that would redeem him and he prayed too for his great trouble had softened and spiritualized him that this big ship and large company should not suffer disaster on his account but as the ship reached soundings it seemed that the prayer was to be unanswered for she came driving up to the lightship before a southerly gale and sea that prevented any sail holding but the foresail and three lower topsails all lighter canvas was blown away and lower topsails and a lee shore are a bad combination the captain could not conceal his anxiety there had been no sign of a pilot and though the holding ground was good his anchors were small too small for his big ship to add to the danger the spume and spindrift from the combers were thickened by a mist that seemed to descend from above blotting out the distant lightship but this mist was ahead astern the horizon was visible and far this side of the horizon not half a mile on the port quarter was a sight that sent the blood coursing through poor scottys veins and a prayer of thanksgiving to his lips coming along before the storm but on a convergent course which would soon bring her in the big ships wake was the steamer proserpine towing her barges scotty knew them every detail was pictured on his brain he knew that big funnel and big niggerhead in the bow he knew the stump bowsprit of the champion with its onechain bobstay and he knew the anita behind her straightstemmed black and dingy and as he looked there came to him the conviction that here was the test required of him that if he the jonah of many ships should remain where he was there would be one more catastrophe on the list while some maneuvering of fate would again send him to sea but that if he rid the ship of his presence there was a chance not only for the ship but for himself mounting the forecastle deck where he had a right to be he watched and waited until the three crafts astern were as one in the wake then shedding his oilskins and boots he sprang overboard he heard the shouts of a shipmate and as he came to the surface saw men on the rail looking and waving he saw the second mate heave over a lifebuoy but it fell short and he did not swim for it the ship went on for a squarerigged craft may not round to in a gale scotty swam shoreward at first for he knew that the steamer and tow would make leeway on the tops of the seas he took his bearings and then swam or paddled according to the inclination of the steamers bow in the hollows he swam towards her nearer and nearer she came and at last he began hailing but not a man could be seen on her deck and the bridge was empty the captain or mate on duty was in the warm pilothouse no doubt after the manner of tugmen hailing frantically he met the wash of her bow wave and went under when he came up she was past him with her whitepainted name staring at him no one had seen or heard him the champion was coming and he swam into her path barely missing a clutch at the steel towline whizzing past him he hailed her but there was no response how could they hear in the teeth of that furious wind realizing this he saved his breath the barge rolling along before the sea was making good weather of it yet she lifted and plunged heavily as the big billows passed beneath her the chain bobstay often rising six feet out of water and again sinking as far below to catch this chain was all that he could hope for to miss it meant death for even should he be seen or heard as he passed astern no power on earth could bring that tug back to windward in such a sea when but twenty feet away from him the bow lifted dripping water from the hawsepipes and to the agonized man beneath it this bow and dripping hawsepipes bore a harrowing resemblance to a large implacable yet weeping face a face that expressed sorrow and condemnation then it fell upon him and the heavy iron chain struck his head then glanced to his shoulder and bore him under but the downward blow gave him his grip upon it had it struck him while lifting he might not have held clinging for dear life unable to move himself an inch against the rush of water with head swimming from the impact of the chain and lungs bursting from lack of air he waited for the rise and when it came moved upward a foot then he was borne under again this time with his lungs full of air and he suffered less and when he was lifted out he gained another foot four times he was plunged under before he had climbed high enough to avoid it and then he rested until his head cleared and the awful pain of fatigue left his arms when strength came back he mounted to the bowsprit crept in to the topgallant forecastle and sprang down on the maindeck to the consternation of two men at the weather forerigging these were foremast hands and scotty had no present use for them he ran past them in his stockingfeet and they gave room to the wildeyed apparition and aft to the poop where besides the helmsman was a man who might be captain or mate but who could certainly inform him is cappen bolt in charge o the anita the neo he asked hoarsely as he halted before him yes who are you asked the astounded man god be thankit exclaimed scotty and he mounted the taffrail not for a swim this time there was no need of it stretching back to the anita was a steel trolley which was all he wanted before the man could do more than yell at him scotty had hitched himself out on the towline beyond reach then for faster progress he swung beneath it head aft and downward and in this position hand over hand and leg over leg he made his way along until the water took him filling his lungs with air and locking arms and legs around the rope he let himself go and he slid at the speed of the tug down the trolley and up again traversing half of the length of the towline beneath the surface he was nearly dead and fully blind when he felt air on his face and had only time to take a breath when a following sea immersed him again but with another breath he began to climb captain bolt aft on the poop saw men on the champion waving arms and pointing a megaphone his way he could not hear nor could he hope to from the bow yet he ran forward as he reached the forecastle steps an unkempt figure came in over the bow a big rawboned man in dripping rags with blood streaming from arms and legs with a red round and sorrowful face bordered by long matted gray hairwith the gleam of incipient insanity in the eyes he sprang off the forecastle and faced the captain cappen bolt he stammered as he tore at a small leather bag with fingers and teeth cappen cappen here it is ive fetched it t ye i never spent it from the bag came a stained and oxidized coin which he forced into the amazed captains hand then sinking to his knees he lifted his eyes to heaven muttered a few inarticulate words and fell over in a swoon here called the captain sharply to two of his men who had drawn near take him below and strip him put him to bed and ill get some brandy lord knows who he is or where he came from but hes in a bad way scotty was carried down the forecastle stairs and cared for but he did not waken to drink the captains brandy the swoon took on the form of childlike sleep and the sleep continued until the barges had made port and moored to the dock here amid the confusion of making fast opening hatches and rigging cargo gear captain bolt had about forgotten the mysterious stranger in his forecastle and was only reminded of him when the captain of the champion came aboard to inquire he climbed up my bobstays no doubt he must have fallen overboard from that big englishman that anchored in the horseshoe went crazy in the water i suppose he went out on your towline like a monkey i wouldnt ha believed a man could stand it he was three minutes under water i cant make it out said captain bolt he put this in my hand he held out the blackened dollar and then went daffy hes down below now no here he comes scotty had climbed to the deck he stood near the hatch looking about with a doubtful bewildered air at the docks and shipping then his face cleared a little and like a cat in a strange street he moved slowly and hesitatingly along the rail towards the fore rigging then with one bound he swung himself to the top of the rail and a mighty upward jump landed him on the stringpiece of the dock here he paused long enough to sink to his knees and elevate his clasped hands then he rose walked hurriedly and breaking into a run disappeared from sight behind the crowd of horses and trucks on the dock by the lord exclaimed captain bolt i know him its scotty i lost him overboard off the delaware capes five years ago howd he get picked up i wonder wheres he been and this he produced the dollar i wonder if why very likely a scotchman has a conscience say cappen this seems funny i put up a job on scotty i pretended to lose a dollar to see if hed keep it and he did and ill bet this is the one he opened his knife and cut into the dingy coin yes it was a counterfeit footnote m reprinted by special permission from land ho copyright by harper and brothers illustration xv the mascot of troop n by stephen chalmers the troop was just about scared to death when the scoutmaster announced at the close of the meeting that the visitor would remain for an informal talk with the boys the visitor was a big man in more than height he was a state commissioner the kind you spell with a big c a commissioner of forests or weights or something like that and he happened too to have an official position with boy scout headquarters he was so to speak a heap big scout and troop saranac lake which is away back in the adirondacks felt uneasy there arent many of you said the commissioner to the group of scouts gathered about him but youre all good stuff you have a chance most boy scouts dont get you were all born in the big north woods you have inherited instincts that cant be driven into a boy with teaching you dont have to be taught trailing or woodcraft except maybe for an organized way of handling them you can open old trails as a good turn to the public you can patrol the woods report forest fires and you can fight forest fires too as i hear you have been doing i hear too that the municipal board picked this troop to select a christmas tree that you felled that tree in a neat way and brought it to the village helped set it up and then patrolled the crowd with your staffs so the little kids crowding around santa clauss municipal wagon wouldnt get hurt in the crush this made the scouts breathe a little easier but there is more than that to this scout game the scouts began to fidget again they knew they were not going to be let down as easy as all that especially by a big scout like this who knew conditions all over the country the thing that comes easy for you to do is good but like bravery the best form of it is doing what you are afraid to do or doing what isnt second nature for you to do you belong to the second generation of the wilderness there are towns now and you live in them and it is in the towns the big man suddenly hesitated he was looking at a small black face that emerged from a khaki collar between two first class scouts in the front row the commissioner pointed at him and said abruptly breaking off his remarks by the way whats your name the small black face went into strange contortions of embarrassment it tried to hide like the ostrich but the scouts in front parted and revealed a little negro boy in scout uniform with a tenderfoot badge pinned where it should be im smokey said a faint voice then remembering he stiffened up saluted the big man and amplified dey calls me smokey sir dats all de name i ever has ise just a lil nigger sir but dey alls a moughty good bunch and dey dont mek no difference cause i aint white there was a little applause and much grinning the commissioner of forests or weights i forget just what he was stared in a queer way then went on with his address from where he had left off i remember he laid particular stress on the fact that doing ones simple everyday duty was all right but not just what was called a good turn but all the time he was watching smokey who stood there drinking in every word and nudging his neighbor a thin pallid boy who also wore a tenderfoot badge whats your name the speaker broke off again to ask pointing at smokeys neighbor im jimmy said he smokeys me pal he added scrambling to his feet with a belated salute we we likes bein scouts sir smokey wriggled in absolute approval of jimmys loyalty and comment again the commissioner looked puzzled he went on with his talk however and when he had finished and the scouts had left he went into the scoutmasters office to compare notes with him but he dismissed the notes pretty swiftly and suddenly said to the scoutmaster where did you pick up those two kids smokey and his his pal jimmy oh thats quite a yarn said the scoutmaster both of them were new york newsboys they got sick down there illfeeding lack of care and so on and drifted up here we have a lot of invalids who come here for their health rich mostly but jimmy and smokey werent rich in fact if a couple of our boys hadnt heard about them and done one of the best turns ever pulled off i the commissioner leaned forward and tapped the scoutmaster on the knee tell me the whole story said he his eyes sparkling and the scoutmaster did the story the scoutmaster told smokey and jimmy were newsboys in the big city smokey was much littler i expect when he invested his first pennies in papers and tried to hold his own with the newsboy gang at the grand central station jimmy was cock of the walk and had licked every newsboy on the stand he looked little smokey over he resented the smokiness but hated to wallop him there was so little to wallop and because the other newsboys tried to jimmy walloped the whole lot of them all over again after that he felt sort of responsible for smokeys welfare by and by jimmy found out that smokey never had had any parents he came out of a colored orphan asylum ran away i expect jimmy didnt know anything about his parents either he came out of a foundling hospital ran away too perhaps anyway jimmy says he felt he didnt have much on smokey they became close friends smokey thought jimmy was gods little brother and jimmy proved it by taking absolute charge of smokeys destiny they saved their pennies their living didnt cost much they fed mostly at the back door of an east side quicklunch place for domicile they shared a basement with a drunken janitor an italian organgrinder and a monkey the monkey got shoved off a secondstory window ledge by some christian person who probably resented the darwin theory and died several days later of internal injuries smokey nursed him while jimmy and the organgrinder worked harder and raised enough money to get a doctor the doctor was indignant when he found that his patient was of the simian persuasion but thats a story by itself you ought to hear jimmy tell it youd find yourself laughing on only one side of your face about a week after the monkey died smokey fell ill he hated to get up in the morning he was just as deadtired in the morning as when he lay down his smokiness turned from a soft coal to an anthracite hue and he went off his feed jimmy thought maybe smokey needed a little christian science and walloped him as an experiment smokey took it as he would have taken anything from jimmy but he said and his eyes were probably as big and solemn as an owls jimmy said he dey aint no usen youall wallopin me hones jimmy ah tinks ahs a moughty sick lil nigger that stuck in jimmys mind he was sorry he had applied what he thought was practical christian science he tried smokey with therapeutic treatment he gave him a cone of strawberry icecream when smokey ate only half of it jimmy knew it was a grave case and that something ought to be done about it that night after smokey had crawled into the packing case where he was in the habit of sleeping usually with the lid on jimmy talked over the crisis with the organgrinder and the janitor the janitor thought corn whiskey was good and went out to get some he didnt come back that night and brought no whiskey when he turned up two days later the organgrinder embittered by the loss of his monkey had little faith in the medical profession and in this jimmy concurred the newsboy however read the papers he sold and was under the impression that jimmy ought to get out into the country also he wasnt sure that it was the best thing for smokey to sleep in that packingcase with the lid on lacking funds however they were compelled to table the motion that smokey be sent to the woods meanwhile smokey got thinner and weaker and finally he hadnt the strength to push the lid off when he needed more air it was then that the lord provided one of smokeys patrons was pat mulcahy who drives the engine of the montreal express out of grand central every evening at smokey had been in the habit of taking a latest evening edition through to pat in his engine cab mulcahy didnt get his paper one night but next evening jimmy turned up alongside the big locomotive and said heres yer paper mister mulcahy smokeys down an out i tink hes got de ol con he worried hisself near stiff last night cos he fergot t tell me youse was particlar bout gettin de final but dont youse worry mister im runnin the whole biz till smokeys to rights again see mulcahy was a good fellow hed bought from smokey because well perhaps he liked the little fellow he questioned jimmy and next night he crossquestioned him about smokey and on the third night when jimmy reported the patient in a bad way the engineer said now lookee here jimmy can smokey walk do you think he can stand a trip it couldnt make him no wuss anyhow says jimmy all right said mulcahy you get his things together well just as he is then and bring him along here about sharp tomorrow night hear i get yuh said jimmy youse gonna give smoky a free ride up to the country you betcher life jimmy smokey when informed of this new turn of his destiny didnt care much whether he went or stayed in his box but jimmy said he was to go and of course that was all there was to it next evening when smokey the most washedout little nigger that ever wobbled on weak knees turned up at the station with jimmy the whole gang was there to give him a sendoff the guards let them all through the gates after the conductor of the adirondack section had passed a wink and the group of youngsters escorted smokey to the big wheezing engine jimmy first presented mulcahy with his final refusing the usual cent for it dats on de house dis time said jimmy here you beat it said he do you want to make me trouble smokeys eyes were full of tears as he said so long fellahs youalls a moughty good bunch then he whispered something to jimmy who said aw fudge and went away much embarrassed the engineer turned smokey over to the conductor of the adirondack section and when the montreal express got under way he was comfortable on a pile of straw in a corner of the baggage car at poughkeepsie the conductor bought him a bottle of pop at albany he fell heir to an orange and a chicken sandwich at utica he was sound asleep and a colored porter came through and spread a perfectly good pullman blanket over the boy the train was wheezing at tupper lake when smokey opened his eyes next morning the baggage car door was opened and smokey looked out it was a big country covered with trees and surrounded with great mountains the sun was just rising and smokey felt sure that this was the place where they made the movies the golden east reminded him of his orange and he ate it the orange the colored porter came through and told the boy to stay where he was until ordered to get out smokey was disappointed to learn that his friend mulcahy had gone off duty at utica where his wife lived ten minutes later the porter came back again he had a glass tumbler in his hand and it was half full of quarters and fiftycent pieces you is shuah a lucky kid said the porter some o de gents in de lake placid smoker heerd bout you an chipped in all dis deys shuahall a good bunch folks is said smokey his eyes big as he totaled three dollars and twentyfive cents the adirondacks section was switched off the main line at lake clear junction and less than half an hour later smokey found himself in the main street of saranac lake he made straight for the belt of woods that fringes the river below the falls of the power station and sat down beneath a big pine he felt that he could sit there forever and listen to the gossipy river and the whispering trees it was very restful he ate some of his accumulated grub and went to sleep his last thought a wish that jimmy could be there mr commissioner the scoutmaster continued that little nigger was in town about six weeks before our boys got on to him he was lucky enough to get a job delivering newspapers for tom daley and luckier still the little fellow began to get well so long as the nights were still summery he slept beneath that same pine below the falls but when the autumn snap set in he had to find shelter it was tolman the undertaker a good sort good as they make em who picked him up asked a few questions and got him the loft of fred smiths paintshop a ladder ascended to a trap door and the garret was full of old truck but smokey thought it was a mansion with a marble staircase he fixed up a couple of boxes for seats and there was an old twolegged sofa that he propped up for a couch he scurried around town got hold of several burlap bags stuffed them with hay and made himself a comfortable bed between this and improving health and the delivery business smokey felt that he was prospering in the world then he got a letter it was from jimmy to whom he had sent picturepostcards without getting a word in reply but jimmys misspelled letter now explained everything dere smoke it ran or something like that i read it i hate tu tell ya for i dident think it was annything but i got the old con too an im awful sick and duno whatin bleazes im gone do say is there anny chanst up there where yu ar but don you worry bout me jimmy it was a terrible blow to smokey but right away the optimism that seems to breed itself in these woods bolstered him to action he promptly sent a picturepostcard and on it he wrote yu se the injiner mr milcay an come on up its fine an i got a swel plaze to liv and lots ov work no selin jist deliverin smokey but that was only the beginning of smokeys discharge of obligation he interviewed the pullman conductor the conductor passed the word to mulcahy at utica and two days later the porter brought back word to the tense waiting little figure at the saranac lake station that it was all fixed and jimmy was coming on by next nights train all that evening and all next day smokey was mighty busy he bolted the delivery of the new york papers but at every house he stopped long enough to gasp please lady has youall got any ole pitcher supplements in the evening he had a pile of them he had begged leave of mat munn the grocer to extract nails from discarded boxes with these and a brick for a hammer he covered the sloping roof walls of the garret mansion with stage beauties art supplements buster browns happy hooligans baseball giants and magazine covers this art paneling covered every draughty hole or crack flour sacks draped jimmys sofacouch all that last night while the montreal express brought jimmy into the hills there sounded the persistent taptapping of smokeys brick hammer but in the morning when jimmy pale and sickly climbed down from the baggagecar there was no smokey to meet or greet him jimmy wandered around weakness of body conspiring with disappointment to sap his courage he had no idea where smokey lived and being a new yorker with a metropolitan turn of thought in that circumstance he felt himself and smokey completely lost to each other presently as jimmy sat disconsolate on a baggage truck an individual in shirt sleeves and savoring of paint halted before him after a moments study he said hallo jimmy jimmy started hope returning but neither the man nor the savor of paint conveyed anything profitable aw can the bunk stuff said he wearily im fm fortysecond street see fred the painter was able to extricate himself from suspicion however at the words smokeys all to the bad jimmy forgot everything particularly himself and his own illness where izze he asked breathlessly i wanna seem right away dyuh get me aw dont you tell me that lil niggers gone an croaked naw he aint croaked said fred smith the painter but hes awful bad and he sent me to meet you jimmy and tell you to come right on just the same cause everythings ready hes up there said fred when they got to the shack jimmy short of breath as he was went up that ladder like a streak at first he could see little the garret was so dark but a faint voice said from some burlap bags in the corner is dat youse chimmy whats de matter smoke jimmys voice was shaky and a short sharp cough punctuated his question bles if ah knows said smokey ah was hammerin a nail in christy matewson when sometin esploded in ma chiss but say chimmy light de canle an pipe de livin room some swell chimmy an ah done it aall masef jimmy found the candle and lighted it he surveyed smokey lying in the corner his eyes and head seeming a misfit for his frail body the candle illumined the comic supplements and art sections on the sloping roof walls and the sofa with its floursack bedding turned down as for a guest lastly jimmys eyes encountered several dark red spots on the floor swell aint it chimmy said smokey why dont youall say something for answer jimmy blew out the candle somewhat hastily and fred at the foot of the ladder heard some one sobbing in the mansion above the scoutmaster turned to fumble with some papers on his desk the commissioner sat silent his eyes wide and a bit shiny he said nothing for at least half a minute then clearing his throat and what then oh the rest is simple enough said the scoutmaster one of our scouts got wind of it and told his patrol leader and they investigated then they got the other scouts of the patrol together went into the woods and cut some fuel got a basket of grub and provisions from their mothers and a delegation of two called on dr trudeau youve heard of him died just the other day the grenfell of the hills and the doctor sent a nurse and then moved jimmy and smokey to a hospital and the scoutmaster broke off chuckling funny thing he said when the great doctor climbed the ladder to where the two boys were lying sick jimmy remembering the doctor who wouldnt attend the monkey got suspicious and he said to dr trudeau theres just wan thing you got to unstand right away doc smokey may be a lil nigger but he aint no monk dyuh get me they both got well and they got work too then one evening they came down to look over this scout business that had helped them for not so much as a thank you and well jimmys a good little scout as for smokey hes the troop mascot but he still thinks jimmy is gods little brother and i dont know that i blame him fine said the commissioner and a few seconds later he repeated with even more emphasis fine footnote n reprinted from the boy scouts year book copyright by d appleton and company illustration xvi the lions smileo by thomas w hanshew cleek the master detective of scotland yard or the man of forty faces as he was sometimes called solved the riddles that proved too much for his friend mr maverick narkom superintendent of police i am confident boys will enjoy meeting cleek and will with keen delight follow him as he unravels the threads of the great mystery of the lions smile the editor it was on the very stroke of five when cleek answering an urgent message from headquarters strolled into the bar parlor of the fiddle and horseshoe which as you may possibly know stands near to the green in a somewhat picturesque bypath between shepherds bush and acton and found narkom in the very act of hanging up his hat and withdrawing his gloves preparatory to ordering tea my dear cleek what a model of punctuality you are said the superintendent as he came forward and shook hands with him you would put father time himself to the blush with your abnormal promptness do make yourself comfortable for a moment or two while i go and order tea ive only just arrived shant be long old chap pray dont hurry yourself upon my account mr narkom replied cleek as he tossed his hat and gloves upon a convenient

smallest degree when he returned a few minutes later however the idealist seemed to have simmered down into the materialist the extraordinary to have become merged in the ordinary for he found his famous ally no longer studying the beauties of nature but giving his whole attention to the sordid commonplaces of man he was standing before a glaringly printed bill one of many that were tacked upon the walls which set forth in amazing pictures and doubleleaded type the wonders that were to be seen daily and nightly at olympia where for a month past van zants royal belgian circus and worldfamed menagerie had been holding forth to crowded and delighted audiences much was made of two star turns upon this lurid bill mademoiselle marie de zanoni the beautiful and peerless bareback equestrienne the most daring lady rider in the universe for the one and for the other chevalier adrian di roma king of the animal world with his great aggregation of savage and ferocious wild beasts including the famous maneating african lion nero the largest and most ferocious animal of its species in captivity and under this latter announcement there was a picture of a young and handsome man literally smothered with medals lying at full length with his arms crossed and his head in the wideopen jaws of a snarling wildeyed lion my dear chap you really do make me believe that there actually is such a thing as instinct said narkom as he came in fancy your selecting that particular bill out of all the others in the room what an abnormal individual you are why has it anything to do with the case you have in hand anything to do with it my dear fellow it is the case i cant imagine what drew your attention to it cant you said cleek with a half smile then he stretched forth his hand and touched the word nero with the tip of his forefinger that did things awaken a mans memory occasionally mr narkom and tell me isnt that the beast there was such a stir about in the newspapers a fortnight or so ago the lion that crushed the head of a man in full view of the audience yes replied narkom with a slight shudder awful thing wasnt it gave me the creeps to read about it the chap who was killed poor beggar was a mere boy not twenty son of the chevalier di roma himself there was a great stir about it talk of the authorities forbidding the performance and all that sort of thing they never did however for on investigation ah the tea at last thank fortune come sit down my dear fellow and well talk whilst we refresh ourselves landlady see that we are not disturbed will you and that nobody is admitted but the parties i mentioned clients queried cleek as the door closed and they were alone together yes one mlle zelie the chevaliers only daughter a slackwire artist the other signor scarmelli a trapeze performer who is the ladys fiancй ah then our friend the chevalier is not so young as the picture on the bill would have us believe he is no he is not as a matter of fact he is considerably past forty and is or rather was up to six months ago a widower with three children two sons and a daughter i suppose said cleek helping himself to a buttered scone i am to infer from what you say that at the period mentioned six months ago the intrepid gentleman showed his courage yet more forcibly by taking a second wife young or old young said narkom in reply very young not yet fourandtwenty in fact and very very beautiful that is she who is featured on the bill as the star of the equestrian part of the program mlle marie de zanoni so far as i have been able to gather the affair was a love match the lady it appears had no end of suitors both in and out of the profession it has even been hinted that she could had she been so minded have married an impressionable young austrian nobleman of independent means who was madly in love with her but she appears to have considered it preferable to become an old mans darling so to speak and to have selected the middleaged chevalier rather than some one whose age is nearer her own nothing new in that mr narkom young women before mlle marie de zanonis day have been known to love elderly men sincerely young mrs bawdrey in the case of the ninefingered skeleton is an example of that still such marriages are not common i admit so when they occur one naturally looks to see if there may not be other considerations at the bottom of the attachment is the chevalier welltodo has he expectations of any kind to the contrary he has nothing but the salary he earns which is by no means so large as the public imagines and as he comes of a long line of circus performers all of whom died early and poor expectations as you put it do not enter into the affair at all apparently the lady did marry him for love of him as she professes and as he imagines although if what i hear is true it would appear that she has lately outgrown that love it seems that a romeo more suitable to her age has recently joined the show in the person of a rider called signor antonio martinelli that he has fallen desperately in love with her and that he bit off his words short and rose to his feet the door had opened suddenly to admit a young man and a young woman who entered in a state of nervous excitement ah my dear mr scarmelli you and miss zelie are most welcome continued the superintendent my friend and i were this moment talking about you cleek glanced across the room and as was customary with him made up his mind instantly the girl despite her association with the arena was a modest unaffected little thing of about eighteen the man was a straightlooking cleareyed boyishfaced young fellow of about eightandtwenty well but by no means flashily dressed and carrying himself with the air of one who respects himself and demands the respect of others he was evidently an englishman despite his italian nom de thйвtre and cleek decided out of hand that he liked him we can shelve george headland in this instance mr narkom he said as the superintendent led forward the pair for the purpose of introducing them and suffered himself to be presented in the name of cleek the effect of this was electrical would in fact had he been a vain man have been sufficient to gratify him to the fullest for the girl with a little oh of amazement drew back and stood looking at him with a sort of awe that rounded her eyes and parted her lips while the man leaned heavily upon the back of a convenient chair and looked and acted as one utterly overcome cleek he repeated after a moments despairful silence you sir are that great man this is a misfortune indeed a misfortune my friend why a misfortune pray do you think the riddle you have brought is beyond my powers oh no not that never that he made reply if there is any one man in the world who could get at the bottom of it could solve the mystery of the lions change the lions smile you are that man sir you that is the misfortune that you could do it and yet i cannot expect it cannot avail myself of this great opportunity look i am doing it all on my own initiative sir for the sake of zelie and that dear lovable old chap her father i have saved fiftyeight pounds mr cleek i had hoped that that might tempt a clever detective to take up the case but what is such a sum to such a man as you if that is all that stands in the way dont let it worry you my good fellow said cleek with a smile put your fiftyeight pounds in your pocket against your weddingday and good luck to you ill take the case for nothing now then what is it what the dickens did you mean just now when you spoke about the lions change and the lions smile what lion nero here sit down and tell me all about it there is little enough to tell heavens knows said young scarmelli with a sigh accepting the invitation after he had gratefully wrung cleeks hand and his fiancйe with a burst of happy tears had caught it up as it slipped from his and had covered it with thankful kisses that mr cleek is where the greatest difficulty lies there is so little to explain that has any bearing upon the matter at all it is only that the lion nero that is the chevaliers special pride and special pet seems to have undergone some great and inexplicable change as though he is at times under some evil spell which lasts but a moment and yet makes that moment a tragical one it began no one knows why nor how two weeks ago when without hint or warning he killed the person he loved best in all the world the chevaliers eldest son doubtless you have heard of that yes said cleek but what you are now telling me sheds a new light upon the matter am i to understand then that all that talk on the bills and in the newspapers about the lion being savage and a dangerous one is not true and that he really is attached to his owner and his owners family yes said scarmelli he is indeed the gentlest most docile most intelligent beast of his kind living in short sir theres not a bite in him and added to that he is over thirty years old zelie miss di roma will tell you that he was born in captivity that from his earliest moment he has been the pet of her family that he was so to speak raised with her and her brothers that as children they often slept with him and that he will follow those he loves like any dog fight for them protect them let them tweak his ears and pull his tail without showing the slightest resentment even though they may actually hurt him indeed he is so general a favorite mr cleek that there isnt an attendant connected with the show who would not and indeed has not at some time put his head in the beasts mouth just as the chevalier does in public certain that no harm could possibly come of the act you may judge then sir what a shock what a horrible surprise it was when the tragedy of two weeks ago occurred often to add zest to the performance the chevalier varies it by allowing his children to put their heads into neros mouth instead of doing so himself merely making a fake of it that he has the lion under such control that he will respect any command given by him that is what happened on that night young henri was chosen to put his head into neros mouth and did so without fear or hesitation he took the beasts jaws and pulled them apart and laid his head within them as he had done a hundred times before but of a sudden an appalling an uncanny thing happened it was as though some supernatural power laid hold of the beast and made a thing of horror of what a moment before had been a noblelooking animal suddenly a strange hissing noise issued from its jaws its lips curled upward until it smiled smiled mr cleek oh the ghastliest most awful most bloodcurdling smile imaginable and then with a sort of mingled snarl and bark it clamped its jaws together and crushed the boys head as though it were an eggshell he put up his hands and covered his eyes as if to shut out some appalling vision and for a moment or two nothing was heard but the low sobbing of the victims sister as suddenly as that change had come over the beast mr cleek scarmelli went on presently just so suddenly it passed and it was the docile affectionate animal it had been for years it seemed to understand that some harm had befallen its favorite for henri was its favorite and curling itself up beside his body it licked his hands and moaned disconsolately in a manner almost human thats all there is to tell sir save that at times the horrid change the appalling smile repeat themselves when either the chevalier or his son bend to put a head within its jaws and but for their watchfulness and quickness the tragedy of that other awful night would surely be repeated sir it is not natural i know now as surely as if the lion itself had spoken that some one is at the bottom of this ghastly thing that some human agency is at work some unknown enemy of the chevaliers is doing something god alone knows what or why to bring about his death as his sons was brought about and here for the first time the chevaliers daughter spoke ah tell him all jim tell him all she said in her pretty broken english monsieur may the good god in heaven forgive me if i wrong her but but ah monsieur cleek sometimes i feel that she my stepmother and that man that rider who knows not how to ride as the artist should monsieur i cannot help it but i feel that they are at the bottom of it yes but why queried cleek i have heard of your fathers second marriage mademoiselle and of this signor antonio martinelli to whom you allude mr narkom has told me but why should you connect these two persons with this inexplicable thing does your father do so too oh no oh no she answered excitedly he does not even know that we suspect jim and i he loves her monsieur it would kill him to doubt her then why should you because i cannot help it monsieur god knows i would if i could for i care for her dearly i am grateful to her for making my father happy my brothers too cared for her we believed she loved him we believed it was because of that that she married him and yet and yet ah monsieur how can i fail to feel as i do when this change in the lion came with that mans coming and she ah monsieur why is she always with him why does she curry favor of him and his rich friend he has a rich friend then yes monsieur the company was in difficulties monsieur van zant the proprietor could not make it pay and it was upon the point of disbanding but suddenly this indifferent performer this rider who is after all but a poor amateur and not fit to appear with a company of trained artists suddenly this signor martinelli comes to monsieur van zant to say that if he will engage him he has a rich friend one seсor sperati a brazilian coffee planter who will back the show with his money and buy a partnership in it of course m van zant accepted and since then this seсor sperati has traveled everywhere with us has had the entrйe like one of us and his friend the bad rider has fairly bewitched my stepmother for she is ever with him ever with them both and and ah mon dieu the lion smiles and my people die why does it smile for no others why is it only they my father my brother they alone is that a fact said cleek turning to young scarmelli you say that all connected with the circus have so little fear of the beast that even attendants sometimes do this foolhardy trick does the lion never smile for any of those never mr cleek never under any circumstances nor does it always smile for the chevalier and his son that is the mystery of it one never knows when it is going to happen one never knows why it does happen but if you could see that uncanny smile i should like to interposed cleek that is if it might happen without any tragical result hummm nobody but the chevalier and the chevaliers son and when does it happen in their case during the course of the show or when there is nobody about but those connected with it oh always during the course of the entertainment sir indeed it has never happened at any other time never at all oho said cleek then it is only when they are dressed and made up for the performance eh hummm i see then he lapsed into silence for a moment and sat tracing circles on the floor with the toe of his boot but of a sudden you came here directly after the matinйe i suppose he queried glancing up at young scarmelli yes in fact before it was wholly over i see then it is just possible that all the performers have not yet got into their civilian clothes couldnt manage to take me round behind the scenes so to speak if mr narkom will lend us his motor to hurry us there could eh thats good i think id like to have a look at that lion and if you dont mind an introduction to the parties concerned no dont fear we wont startle anybody by revealing my identity or the cause of the visit let us say that im a vet to whom you have appealed for an opinion regarding neros queer conduct all ready mr narkom then lets be off two minutes later the red limousine was at the door and stepping into it with his two companions he was whizzed away to olympia and the first step toward the solution of the riddle ii as it is the custom of those connected with the world of the circus to eat sleep have their whole being as it were within the environment of the show to the total exclusion of hotels boardinghouses or outside lodgings of any sort he found on his arrival at his destination the entire company assembled in what was known as the livingtent chatting laughing reading playing games and killing time generally whilst waiting for the call to the diningtent and this gave him an opportunity to meet all the persons connected with the case from the chevalier himself to the brazilian coffee planter who was backing the show he found this latter individual a somewhat sullen and taciturn man of middle age who had more the appearance of an austrian than a brazilian and with a swinging gait and an uprightness of bearing which were not to be misunderstood humph known military training was cleeks mental comment as soon as he saw the man walk got it in germany too i know that peculiar swing whats his little game i wonder and whats a brazilian doing in the army of the kaiser and having been in it whats he doing dropping into this line backing a circus and traveling with it like a bohemian but although these thoughts interested him he did not put them into words nor take anybody into his confidence regarding them as for the other members of the company he found the indifferent rider known as signor antonio martinelli an undoubted irishman of about thirty years of age extremely handsome but with a certain shiftiness of the eye which was far from inspiring confidence and with a trick of the tongue which suggested that his baptismal certificate probably bore the name of anthony martin he found too that all he had heard regarding the youth and beauty of the chevaliers second wife was quite correct and although she devoted herself a great deal to the brazilian coffee planter and the irishitalian martinelli she had a way of looking over at her middleaged spouse without his knowledge that left no doubt in cleeks mind regarding the real state of her feelings toward the man and last but not least by any means he found the chevalier himself a frank openminded openhearted lovable man who ought not in the natural order of things to have an enemy in the world despite his highfalutin nom de thйвtre he was a belgian a big softhearted easygoing unsuspicious fellow who worshiped his wife adored his children and loved every creature of the animal world how well that love was returned cleek saw when he went with him to that part of the building where his animals were kept and watched them nose his hand or lick his cheek whenever the opportunity offered but nero the lion was perhaps the greatest surprise of all for so tame so docile so little feared was the animal that its cage door was open and they found one of the attendants squatting crosslegged inside and playing with it as though it were a kitten there he is doctor said the chevalier waving his hand toward the beast ah i will not believe that it was anything but an accident sir he loved my boy he would hurt no one that is kind to him fetch him out tom and let the doctor see him at close quarters despite all these assurances of the animals docility cleek could not but remember what the creature had done and in consequence did not feel quite at ease when it came lumbering out of the cage with the attendant and ranged up alongside of him rubbing its huge head against the chevaliers arm after the manner of an affectionate cat dont be frightened sir said tom noticing this nothing moren a big dog sir had the care of him for eight years i have havent i chevalier and never a growl or scratch out of him no smile for your old tom is there nero boy eh no fear aint a thing as anybody does with him sir that i wouldnt do offhand and feel quite safe even to putting your head in his mouth queried cleek lor yes returned the man with a laugh thats nothing done it many a day look here with that he pulled the massive jaws apart and bending down laid his head within them the lion stood perfectly passive and did not offer to close his mouth until it was again empty it was then that cleek remembered and glanced round at young scarmelli he never smiles for any but the chevalier and his son i believe you said he remarked i wonder if the chevalier himself would be as safe if he were to make a feint of doing that for the chevalier like most of the other performers had not changed his dress after the matinйe since the evening performance was so soon to begin and if as cleek had an idea the matter of costume and makeup had anything to do with the mystery of the thing here surely was a chance to learn make a feint of it certainly i will doctor the chevalier replied but why a feint why not the actual thing no please at least not until i have seen how the beast is likely to take it just put your head down close to his muzzle chevalier go slow please and keep your head at a safe distance the chevalier obeyed bringing his head down until it was on a level with the animals own he opened the ponderous jaws the beast was as passive as before and finding no trace of the coming of the mysterious and dreaded smile he laid his face between the double row of gleaming teeth held it there a moment and then withdrew it uninjured cleek took his chin between his thumb and forefinger and pinched it hard what he had just witnessed would seem to refute the idea of either costume or makeup having any bearing upon the case did you do that today at the matinйe performance chevalier he hazarded after a moments thoughtfulness oh yes he replied it was not my plan to do so however i alter my performance constantly to give variety today i had arranged for my little son to do the trick but somehow ah i am a foolish man monsieur i have odd fancies odd whims sometimes odd fears since since that awful night something came over me at the last moment and just as my boy came into the cage to perform the trick i changed my mind i would not let him do it i thrust him aside and did the trick myself oho said cleek will the boy do it tonight then chevalier perhaps he made reply he is still dressed for it look here he comes now monsieur and my wife and some of our good friends with him ah they are so interested they are anxious to hear what report you make upon neros condition cleek glanced round several members of the company were advancing toward them from the livingtent in the lead was the boy a little fellow of about twelve years of age fancifully dressed in tights and tunic by his side was his stepmother looking pale and anxious but although both signor martinelli and the brazilian coffee planter came to the edge of the tent and looked out it was observable that they immediately withdrew and allowed the rest of the party to proceed without them dearest i have just heard from tom that you and the doctor are experimenting with nero said the chevaliers wife as she came up with the others and joined him oh do be careful do much as i like the animal doctor i shall never feel safe until my husband parts with it or gives up that ghastly trick my dearest my dearest how absurdly you talk interrupted her husband you know well that without that my act would be commonplace that no manager would want either it or me and how pray should we live if that were to happen there would always be my salary we could make that do as if i would consent to live upon your earnings and add nothing myself no no i shall never do that never it is not as though that foolish dream of long ago had come true and i might hope one day to retire i am of the circus and of it i shall always remain i wish you might not i wish the dream might come true even yet she made reply why shouldnt it wilder ones have come true for other people why should they not for you before her husband could make any response to this the whole trend of the conversation was altered by the boy father he said am i to do the trick tonight seсor sperati says it is silly of me to sit about all dressed and ready if i am to do nothing like a little super instead of a performer and an artist oh but that is not kind of the seсor to say that his father replied soothing his ruffled feelings you are an artist of course never super no never but if you shall do the trick or not i cannot say it will depend as it did at the matinйe if i feel it is right you shall do it but if i feel it is wrong then it must be no you see doctor catching cleeks eye what a little enthusiast he is and with how little fear yes i do see chevalier but i wonder if he would be willing to humor me in something as he is not afraid ive an odd fancy to see how hed go about the thing would you mind letting him make the feint you yourself made a few minutes ago only i must insist that in this instance it be nothing more than a feint chevalier dont let him go too near at the time of doing it dont let him open the lions jaws with his own hands you do that do you mind of a certainty not monsieur gustave show the good doctor how you go about it when papa lets you do the trick but you are not really to do it just yet only to bend the head near to neros mouth now then come see as he spoke he divided the lions jaws and signaled the child to bend he obeyed very slowly the little head drooped nearer to the gaping fullfanged mouth very slowly and very carefully for cleeks hand was on the boys shoulder cleeks eyes were on the lions face the huge brute was as meek and as undisturbed as before and there was actual kindness in its fixed eyes but of a sudden when the childs head was on a level with those gaping jaws the lips curled backward in a ghastly parody of a smile a weird uncanny sound whizzed through the bared teeth the passive body bulked as with a shock and cleek had just time to snatch the boy back when the great jaws struck together with a snap that would have splintered a skull of iron had they closed upon it the hideous and mysterious smile had come again and brief though it was its passing found the boys sister lying on the ground in a dead faint the boys stepmother cowering back with covered eyes and shrill affrighted screams and the boys father leaning shaken and white against the empty cage and nursing a bleeding hand in an instant the whole place was in an uproar it smiled again it smiled again ran in broken gasps from lip to lip but through it all cleek stood there clutching the frightened child close to him but not saying one word not making one sound across the dark arena came a rush of running footsteps and presently seсor sperati came panting up breathless and pale with excitement whats the matter whats wrong he cried is it the lion again is the boy killed speak up no said cleek very quietly nor will he be the father will do the trick tonight not the son weve had a fright and a lesson thats all and putting the sobbing child from him he caught young scarmellis arm and hurried him away take me somewhere that we can talk in safety he said we are on the threshold of the end scarmelli and i want your help oh mr cleek have you any idea any clue yes more than a clue i know how but i have not yet discovered why now if you know tell me what did the chevalier mean what did his wife mean when they spoke of a dream that might have come true but didnt do you know have you any idea or if you have not do you think your fiancйe has why yes he made reply zelie has told me about it often it is of a fortune that was promised and never materialized oh such a long time ago when he was quite a young man the chevalier saved the life of a very great man a prussian nobleman of great wealth he was profuse in his thanks and his promises that nobleman swore that he would make him independent for life and all that sort of thing and didnt no he didnt after a dozen letters promising the chevalier things that almost turned his head the man dropped him entirely in the midst of his dreams of wealth a letter came from the old skinflints steward enclosing him the sum of six hundred marks and telling him that as his master had come to the conclusion that wealth would be more of a curse than a blessing to a man of his class and station he had thought better of his rash promise he begged to tender the enclosed as a proper and sufficient reward for the service rendered and should not trouble the young man any further of course the chevalier didnt reply who would after having been promised wealth education everything one had confessed that one most desired being young highspirited and bitterly bitterly disappointed the chevalier bundled the six hundred marks back without a single word and that was the last he ever heard of the baron von steinheid from that day to this the baron von steinheid repeated cleek pulling himself up as though he had trodden upon something do you mean to say that the man whose life he saved scarmelli tell me something does it happen by any chance that the chevalier di romas real name is peter janssen pullaine yes said scarmelli in reply that is his name why nothing but that it solves the riddle and the lion has smiled for the last time no dont ask me any questions there isnt time to explain get me as quickly as you can to the place where we left mr narkoms motor will this way lead me out thanks get back to the others and look for me again in two hours time and scarmelli yes sir one last word dont let that boy get out of your sight for one instant and dont no matter at what cost let the chevalier do his turn tonight before i get back goodbye for a time im off then he moved like a fleetly passing shadow round the angle of the building and two minutes later was with narkom in the red limousine to the german embassy as fast as we can fly he said as he scrambled in ive something to tell you about that lions smile mr narkom and ill tell it while were on the wing iii it was nine oclock and after the great show at olympia was at its height the packed house was roaring with delight over the daring equestrianship of mademoiselle marie de zanoni and the sound of the cheers rolled in to the huge dressingtent where the artists awaited their several turns and the chevalier in spangled trunks and tights all ready for his call sat hugging his child and shivering like a man with the ague come come buck up man and dont funk it like this said seсor sperati who had graciously consented to assist him with his dressing because of the injury to his hand the idea of you losing your nerve you of all men and because of a little affair like that you know very well that nero is as safe as a kitten tonight that he never has two smiling turns in the same week much less the same day your acts the next on the program buck up and go at it like a man i cant seсor i cant almost wailed the chevalier my nerve is gone never if i live to be a thousand shall i forget that awful moment that appalling smile i tell you there is wizardry in the thing the beast is bewitched my work in the arena is done done forever seсor i shall never have courage to look into the beasts jaws again rot youre not going to ruin the show are you and after all the money ive put into it if you have no care for yourself its your duty to think about me you can at least try i tell you you must try here take a sip of brandy and see if that wont put a bit of courage into you hallo as a burst of applause and the thud of a horses hoofs down the passage to the stables came rolling in theres your wifes turn over at last and there listen the ringmaster is announcing yours get up man get up and go out i cant seсor i cant i cant but i tell you you must and just here an interruption came bad advice my dear captain said a voice cleeks voice from the other end of the tent and with a twist and a snarl the seсor screwed round on his heel in time to see that other intruders were putting in an appearance as well as this unwelcome one who the deuce asked you for your opinion rapped out the seсor savagely and what are you doing in here anyhow if we want the service of a vet were quite capable of getting one for ourselves without having him shove his presence upon us unasked you are quite capable of doing a great many things my dear captain even making lions smile said cleek serenely it would appear that the gallant captain von gossler nephew and in the absence of one who has a better claim heir to the late baron von steinheid thats it nab the beggar played sir played hustle him out and into the cab with his precious confederate the irishitalian signor and make a clean sweep of the pair of them youll find it a neckstretching game captain im afraid when the jury comes to hear of that poor boys death and your beastly part in it by this time the tent was in an uproar for the chevaliers wife had come hurrying in the chevaliers daughter was on the verge of hysterics and the chevaliers prospective soninlaw was alternately hugging the great beasttamer and then shaking his hand and generally deporting himself like a respectable young man who had suddenly gone daft governor he cried half laughing half sobbing bully old governor its over its over never any more danger never any more bad times never any more lions smiles no never said cleek come here madame pullaine and hear the good news with the rest you married for love and youve proved a brick the dreams come true and the life of ease and of luxury is yours at last mr pullaine but sir i i do not understand stammered the chevalier what has happened why have you arrested the seсor sperati what has he done i cannot comprehend cant you well it so happens chevalier that the baron von steinheid died something like two months ago leaving the sum of sixty thousand pounds sterling to one peter janssen pullaine and the heirs of his body and that a certain captain von gossler son of the barons only sister meant to make sure that there was no peter janssen pullaine and no heirs of his body to inherit one farthing of it sir dear god can this be true perfectly true chevalier the late barons solicitors have been advertising for some time for news regarding the whereabouts of peter janssen pullaine and if you had not so successfully hidden your real name under that of your professional one no doubt some of your colleagues would have put you in the way of finding it out long ago the baron did not go back on his word and did not act ungratefully his will dated twentynine years ago was never altered in a single particular i rather suspect that that letter and that gift of money which came to you in the name of his steward and was supposed to close the affair entirely was the work of his nephew the gentleman whose exit has just been made a crafty individual that chevalier and he laid his plans cleverly and well who would be likely to connect him with the death of a beasttamer in a circus who had perished in what would appear an accident of his calling ah yes the lions smile was a clever idea he was a sharp rascal to think of it sir you you do not mean to tell me that he caused that he never went near the beast never even once not necessary chevalier he kept near you and your children that was all that he needed to do to carry out his plan the lion was as much his victim as anybody else what it did it could not help doing the very simplicity of the plan was its passport to success all that was required was the unsuspected sifting of snuff on the hair of the person whose head was to be put in the beasts mouth the lions smile was not properly speaking a smile at all chevalier it was the torture which came of snuff getting into its nostrils and when the beast made that uncanny noise and snapped its jaws together it was simply the outcome of a sneeze the thing would be farcical if it were not that tragedy hangs on the thread of it and that a life a useful human life was destroyed by means of it yes it was clever it was diabolically clever but you know what bobby burns says about the bestlaid schemes of mice and men theres always a power higher up that works the ruin of them with that he walked by and going to young scarmelli put out his hand youre a good chap and youve got a good girl so i expect you will be happy he said and then lowered his voice so that the rest might not reach the chevaliers ears you were wrong to suspect the little stepmother he added shes true blue scarmelli she was only playing up to those fellows because she was afraid the seсor would drop out and close the show if she didnt and that she and her husband and the children would be thrown out of work she loves her husband thats certain and shes a good little woman and scarmelli yes mr cleek theres nothing better than a good woman on this earth my lad always remember that i think you too have got one i hope you have i hope you will be happy whats that owe me not a rap my boy or if you feel that you must give me something give me your prayers for equal luck when my time comes and send me a slice of the wedding cake the riddles solved old chap goodnight footnote o reprinted by special permission from cleek the master detective copyright by doubleday page and company illustration xvii the rollcall of the reefp by a t quillercouch yes sir said my host the quarryman reaching down the relics from their hook in the wall over the chimneypiece theyve hung there all my time and most of my fathers the women wont touch em theyre afraid of the story so here theyll dangle and gather dust and smoke till another tenant comes and tosses em out o doors for rubbish whew tis coarse weather surely he went to the door opened it and stood studying the gale that beat upon his cottagefront straight from the manacle reef the rain drove past him into the kitchen aslant like threads of gold silk in the shine of the wreckwood fire meanwhile by the same firelight i examined the relics on my knee the metal of each was tarnished out of knowledge but the trumpet was evidently an old cavalry trumpet and the threads of its particolored sling though fretted and dusty still hung together around the sidedrum beneath its cracked brown varnish i could hardly trace a royal coatofarms and a legend running per mare per terram the motto of the marines its parchment though black and scented with woodsmoke was limp and mildewed and i began to tighten up the straps under which the drumsticks had been loosely thrust with the idle purpose of seeing if some music might be got out of the old drum yet but as i turned it on my knee i found the drum attached to the trumpetsling by a curious barrelshaped padlock and paused to examine this the body of the lock was composed of half a dozen brass rings set accurately edge to edge and rubbing the brass with my thumb i saw that each of the six had a series of letters engraved around it i knew the trick of it i thought here was one of those word padlocks once so common only to be opened by getting the rings to spell a certain word which the dealer confides to you my host shut and barred the door and came back to the hearth twas just such a wind east by south that brought in what youve got between your hands back in the year nine it was my father has told me the tale a score o times youre twisting round the rings i see but youll never guess the word parson kendall he made the word and he locked down a couple o ghosts in their graves with it and when his time came he went to his own grave and took the word with him whose ghosts matthew you want the story i see sir my father could tell it better than i can he was a young man in the year nine unmarried at the time and living in this very cottage just as i be thats how he came to get mixed up with the tale he took a chair lighted a short pipe and went on with his eyes fixed on the dancing violet flames yes hed ha been about thirty year old in january eighteen nine the storm got up in the night o the twentyfirst o that month my father was dressed and out long before daylight he never was one to bide in bed let be that the gale by this time was pretty near lifting the thatch over his head besides which hed fenced a small tatypatch that winter down by lowland point and he wanted to see if it stood the nights work he took the path across gunners meadow where they buried most of the bodies afterward the wind was right in his teeth at the time and once on the way hes told me this often a great strip of oarweed came flying through the darkness and fetched him a slap on the cheek like a cold hand he made shift pretty well till he got to lowland and then had to drop upon hands and knees and crawl digging his fingers every now and then into a shingle to hold on for he declared to me that the stones some of them as big as a mans head kept rolling and driving past till it seemed the whole foreshore was moving westward under him the fence was gone of course not a stick left to show where it stood so that when first he came to the place he thought he must have missed his bearings my father sir was a very religious man and if he reckoned the end of the world was at hand there in the great wind and night among the moving stones you may believe he was certain of it when he heard a gun fired and with the same saw a flame shoot up out of the darkness to windward making a sudden fierce light in all the place about all he could find to think or say was the second coming the second coming the bridegroom cometh and the wicked he will toss like a ball into a large country and being already upon his knees he just bowed his head and bided saying this over and over but bym by between two squalls he made bold to lift his head and look and then by the light a bluish color twas he saw all the coast clear away to manacle point and off the manacles in the thick of the weather a sloopofwar with topgallants housed driving stern foremost toward the reef it was she of course that was burning the fire my father could see the white streak and the ports of her quite plain as she rose to it a little outside the breakers and he guessed easy enough that her captain had just managed to wear ship and was trying to force her nose to the sea with the help of her small bower anchor and the scrap or two of canvas that hadnt yet been blown out of her but while he looked she fell off giving her broadside to it foot by foot and drifting back on the breakers around carn du and the varses the rocks lie so thick thereabout that twas a toss up which she struck first at any rate my father couldnt tell at the time for just then the flare died down and went out well sir he turned then in the dark and started back for coverack to cry the dismal tidings though well knowing ship and crew to be past any hope and as he turned the wind lifted him and tossed him forward like a ball as hed been saying and homeward along the foreshore as you know tis ugly work even by daylight picking your way among the stones there and my father was prettily knocked about at first in the dark but by this twas nearer seven than six oclock and the day spreading by the time he reached north corner a man could see to read print howsever he looked neither out to sea nor toward coverack but headed straight for the first cottage the same that stands above north corner today a man named billy ede lived there then and when my father burst into the kitchen bawling wreck wreck he saw billy edes wife ann standing there in her clogs with a shawl over her head and her clothes wringing wet save the chap says billy edes wife ann what dee mean by crying stale fish at that rate but tis a wreck i tell e iv azeedn too and so has every one with an eye in his head and with that she pointed straight over my fathers shoulder and he turned and there close under dolor point at the end of coverack town he saw another wreck washing and the point black with people like emmets running to and fro in the morning light while he stood staring at her he heard a trumpet sounded on board the notes coming in little jerks like a bird rising against the wind but faintly of course because of the distance and the gale blowing though this had dropped a little shes a transport said billy edes wife ann and full of horsesoldiers fine long men when she struck they must ha pitched the horses over first to lighten the ship for a score of dead horses had washed in afore i left half an hour back an three or four soldiers too fine long corpses in white breeches and jackets of blue and gold i held the lantern to one such a straight young man my father asked her about the trumpeting thats the queerest bit of all she was burnin a light when me an my man joined the crowd down there all her masts had gone whether they carried away or were cut away to ease her i dont rightly know her keelson was broke under her and her bottom sagged and stove and she had just settled down like a setting hen just the leastest list to starboard but a man could stand there easy they had rigged up ropes across her from bulwark to bulwark an beside these the men were mustered holding on like grim death whenever the sea made a clean breach over them an standing up like heroes as soon as it passed the captain an the officers were clinging to the rail of the quarterdeck all in their golden uniforms waiting for the end as if twas king george they expected there was no way to help for she lay right beyond cast of line though our folk tried it fifty times and beside them clung a trumpeter a whacking big man an between the heavy seas he would lift his trumpet with one hand and blow a call and every time he blew the men gave a cheer there she says hark ee now there he goes agen but you wont hear no cheering any more for few are left to cheer and their voices weak bitter cold the wind is and i reckon it numbs their grip o the ropes for they were dropping off fast with every sea when my man sent me home to get his breakfast another wreck you say well theres no hope for the tender dears if tis the manacles youd better run down and help yonder though tis little help any man can give not one came in alive while i was there the tides flowing an she wont hold together another hour they say well sure enough the end was coming fast when my father got down to the point six men had been cast up alive or just breathing a seaman and five troopers the seaman was the only one that had breath to speak and while they were carrying him into the town the word went round that the ships name was the despatch transport homeward bound from corunna with a detachment of the seventh hussars that had been fighting out there with sir john moore the seas had rolled her further over by this time and given her decks a pretty sharp slope but a dozen men still held on seven by the ropes near the ships waist a couple near the break of the poop and three on the quarterdeck of these three my father made out one to be the skipper close to him clung an officer in full regimentals his name they heard after was captain duncanfield and last came the tall trumpeter and if youll believe me the fellow was making shift there at the very last to blow god save the king whats more he got to send us victorious before an extra big sea came bursting across and washed them off the deck every man but one of the pair beneath the poop and he dropped his hold before the next wave being stunned i reckon the others went out of sight at once but the trumpeter being as i said a powerful man as well as a tough swimmer rose like a duck rode out a couple of breakers and came in on the crest of the third the folks looked to see him broke like an egg at their very feet but when the smother cleared there he was lying face downward on a ledge below them and one of the men that happened to have a rope round him i forget the fellows name if i ever heard it jumped down and grabbed him by the ankle as he began to slip back before the next big sea the pair were hauled high enough to be out of harm and another heave brought them up to grass quick work but master trumpeter wasnt quite dead nothing worse than a cracked head and three staved ribs in twenty minutes or so they had him in bed with the doctor to tend him now was the time nothing being left alive upon the transport for my father to tell of the sloop hed seen driving upon the manacles and when he got a hearing though the most were set upon salvage and believed a wreck in the hand so to say to be worth half a dozen they couldnt see a good few volunteered to start off with him and have a look they crossed lowland point no ship to be seen on the manacles nor anywhere upon the sea one or two was for calling my father a liar wait till we come to dean point said he sure enough on the far side of dean point they found the sloops mainmast washing about with half a dozen men lashed to it men in red jackets every mothers son drowned and staring and a little further on just under the dean three or four bodies cast up on the shore one of them a small drummerboy sidedrum and all and nearby part of a ships gig with hms primrose cut on the sternboard from this point on the shore was littered thick with wreckage and dead bodies the most of them marines in uniform and in godrevy cove in particular a heap of furniture from the captains cabin and among it a watertight box not much damaged and full of papers by which when it came to be examined next day the wreck was easily made out to be the primrose of eighteen guns outward bound from portsmouth with a fleet of transports for the spanish war thirty sail ive heard but ive never heard what became of them being handled by merchant skippers no doubt they rode out the gale and reached the tagus safe and sound not but what the captain of the primrose mein was his name did quite right to try and clubhaul his vessel when he found himself under the land only he never ought to have got there if he took proper soundings but its easy talking the primrose sir was a handsome vessel for her size one of the handsomest in the kings service and newly fitted out at plymouth dock so the boys had brave pickings from her in the way of brasswork ships instruments and the like let alone some barrels of stores not much spoiled they loaded themselves with as much as they could carry and started for home meaning to make a second journey before the preventive men got wind of their doings and came to spoil the fun hullo says my father and dropped his gear i do believe theres a leg moving and running fore he stooped over the small drummerboy that i told you about the poor little chap was lying there with his face a mass of bruises and his eyes closed but he had shifted one leg an inch or two and was still breathing so my father pulled out a knife and cut him free from his drum that was lashed on to him with a double turn of manila rope and took him up and carried him along here to this very room that were sitting in he lost a good deal by this for when he went back to fetch the bundle hed dropped the preventive men had got hold of it and were thick as thieves along the foreshore so that twas only by paying one or two to look the other way that he picked up anything worth carrying off which youll allow to be hard seeing that he was the first man to give news of the wreck well the inquiry was held of course and my father gave evidence and for the rest they had to trust to the sloops papers for not a soul was saved besides the drummerboy and he was raving in a fever brought on by the cold and the fright and the seaman and the five troopers gave evidence about the loss of the despatch the tall trumpeter too whose ribs were healing came forward and kissed the book but somehow his head had been hurt in coming ashore and he talked foolishlike and twas easy seen he would never be a proper man again the others were taken up to plymouth and so went their ways but the trumpeter stayed on in coverack and king george finding he was fit for nothing sent him down a trifle of a pension after a while enough to keep him in board and lodging with a bit of tobacco over now the first time that this man william tallifer he called himself met with the drummerboy was about a fortnight after the little chap had bettered enough to be allowed a short walk out of doors which he took if you please in full regimentals there never was a soldier so proud of his dress his own suit had shrunk a brave bit with the salt water but into ordinary frock an corduroy he declared he would not get not if he had to go naked the rest of his life so my father being a goodnatured man and handy with the needle turned to and repaired damages with a piece or two of scarlet cloth cut from the jacket of one of the drowned marines well the poor little chap chanced to be standing in this rig out down by the gate of gunners meadow where they had buried two score and over of his comrades the morning was a fine one early in march month and along came the cracked trumpeter likewise taking a stroll hullo says he good mornin and what might you be doin here i was awishin says the boy i had a pair o drumsticks our lads were buried yonder without so much as a drum tapped or a musket fired and thats not christian burial for british soldiers phut says the trumpeter and spat on the ground a parcel of marines the boy eyed him a second or so and answered up if id a tav of turf handy id bung it at your mouth you greasy cavalryman and learn you to speak respectful of your betters the marines are the handiest body o men in the service the trumpeter looked down on him from the height of sixfoottwo and asked did they die well they died very well there was a lot of running to and fro at first and some of the men began to cry and a few to strip off their clothes but when the ship fell off for the last time captain mein turned and said something to major griffiths the commanding officer on board and the major called out to me to beat to quarters it might have been for a wedding he sang it out so cheerful wed had word already that twas to be parade order and the men fell in as trim and decent as if they were going to church one or two even tried to shave at the last moment the major wore his medals one of the seamen seeing i had work to keep the drum steady the sling being a bit loose for me and the wind what you remember lashed it tight with a piece of rope and that saved my life afterward a drum being as good as cork until its stove i kept beating away until every man was on deck and then the major formed them up and told them to die like british soldiers and the chaplain was in the middle of a prayer when she struck in ten minutes she was gone that was how they died cavalryman and that was very well done drummer of the marines whats your name john christian mines william george tallifer trumpeter of the seventh light dragoons the queens own i played god save the king while our men were drowning captain duncanfield told me to sound a call or two to put them in heart but that matter of god save the king was a notion of my own i wont say anything to hurt the feelings of a marine even if hes not much over fivefoot tall but the queens own hussars is a tearin fine regiment as between horse and foot tis a question o which gets a chance all the way from sahagun to corunna twas we that took and gave the knocks at mayorga and rueda and bennyventy the reason sir i can speak the names so pat is that my father learnt them by heart afterward from the trumpeter who was always talking about mayorga and rueda and bennyventy we made the rearguard after general paget and drove the french every time and all the infantry did was to sit about in wineshops till we whipped em out an steal an straggle an play the tomfool in general and when it came to a standup fight at corunna twas we that had to stay seasick aboard the transports an watch the infantry in the thick o the caper very well they behaved too specially the fourth regiment an the fortysecond highlanders and the dirty halfhundred oh ay theyre decent regiments all three but the queens own hussars is a tearin fine regiment so you played on your drum when the ship was goin down drummer john christian ill have to get you a new pair of sticks the very next day the trumpeter marched into helston and got a carpenter there to turn him a pair of boxwood drumsticks for the boy and this was the beginning of one of the most curious friendships you ever heard tell of nothing delighted the pair more than to borrow a boat off my father and pull out to the rocks where the primrose and the despatch had struck and sunk and on still days twas pretty to hear them out there off the manacles the drummer playing his tattoo for they always took their music with them and the trumpeter practicing calls and making his trumpet speak like an angel but if the weather turned roughish theyd be walking together and talking leastwise the youngster listened while the other discoursed about sir johns campaign in spain and portugal telling how each little skirmish befell and of sir john himself and general baird and general paget and colonel vivian his own commanding officer and what kind of men they were and of the last bloody standup at corunna and so forth as if neither could have enough but all this had to come to an end in the late summer for the boy john christian being now well and strong again must go up to plymouth to report himself twas his own wish for i believe king george had forgotten all about him but his friend wouldnt hold him back as for the trumpeter my father had made an arrangement to take him on as lodger as soon as the boy left and on the morning fixed for the start he was up at the door here by five oclock with his trumpet slung by his side and all the rest of his belongings in a small valise a monday morning it was and after breakfast he had fixed to walk with the boy some way on the road toward helston where the coach started my father left them at breakfast together and went out to meat the pig and do a few odd morning jobs of that sort when he came back the boy was still at table and the trumpeter sat with the rings in his hands hitched together just as they be at this moment look at this he says to my father showing him the lock i picked it up off a starving brassworker in lisbon and it is not one of your common locks that one word of six letters will open at any time theres janius in this lock for youve only to make the rings spell any sixletter word you please and snap down the lock upon that and never a soul can open it not the maker even until somebody comes along that knows the word you snapped it on now johnny heres goin and he leaves his drum behind him for though he can make pretty music on it the parchment sags in wet weather by reason of the seawater gettin at it an if he carries it to plymouth theyll only condemn it and give him another and as for me i shant have the heart to put lip to the trumpet any more when johnnys gone so weve chosen a word together and locked em together upon that and by your leave ill hang em here together on the hook over your fireplace maybe johnnyll come back maybe not maybe if he comes ill be dead an gone an hell take em apart an try their music for old sakes sake but if he never comes nobody can separate em for nobody beside knows the word and if you marry and have sons you can tell em that here are tied together the souls of johnny christian drummer of the marines and william george tallifer once trumpeter of the queens own hussars amen with that he hung the two instruments pon the hook there and the boy stood up and thanked my father and shook hands and the pair went out of the door toward helston somewhere on the road they took leave of one another but nobody saw the parting nor heard what was said between them about three in the afternoon the trumpeter came walking back over the hill and by the time my father came home from the fishing the cottage was tidied up and the tea ready and the whole place shining like a new pin from that time for five years he lodged here with my father looking after the house and tilling the garden and all the time he was steadily failing the hurt in his head spreading in a manner to his limbs my father watched the feebleness growing on him but said nothing and from first to last neither spake a word about the drummer john christian nor did any letter reach them nor word of his doings the rest of the tale youre free to believe sir or not as you please it stands upon my fathers words and he always declared he was ready to kiss the book upon it before judge and jury he said too that he never had the wit to make up such a yarn and he defied any one to explain about the lock in particular by any other tale but you shall judge for yourself my father said that about three oclock in the morning april fourteenth of the year fourteen he and william tallifer were sitting here just as you and i sir are sitting now my father had put on his clothes a few minutes before and was mending his spiller by the light of the horn lantern meaning to set off before daylight to haul the trammel the trumpeter hadnt been to bed at all toward the last he mostly spent his nights and his days too dozing in the elbowchair where you sit at this minute he was dozing then my father said with his chin dropped forward on his chest when a knock sounded upon the door and the door opened and in walked an upright young man in scarlet regimentals he had grown a brave bit and his face the color of woodashes but it was the drummer john christian only his uniform was different from the one he used to wear and the figures shone in brass upon his collar the drummer walked past my father as if he never saw him and stood by the elbowchair and said trumpeter trumpeter are you one with me and the trumpeter just lifted the lids of his eyes and answered how should i not be one with you drummer johnny johnny boy if you come i count if you march i mark time until the discharge comes the discharge has come tonight said the drummer and the word is corunna no longer and stepping to the chimneyplace he unhooked the drum and trumpet and began to twist the brass rings of the lock spelling the word aloud so coruna when he had fixed the last letter the padlock opened in his hand did you know trumpeter that when i came to plymouth they put me into a line regiment the th is a good regiment answered the old hussar still in his dull voice i went back with them from sahagun to corunna at corunna they stood in general frasers division on the right they behaved well but id fain see the marines again says the drummer handing him the trumpet and you you shall call once more for the queens own matthew he says suddenly turning on my father and when he turned my father saw for the first time that his scarlet jacket had a round hole by the breastbone and that the blood was welling there matthew we shall want your boat then my father rose on his legs like a man in a dream while the two slung on the one his drum and tother his trumpet he took the lantern and went quaking before them down to the shore and they breathed heavily behind him and they stepped into his boat and my father pushed off row you first for dolor point says the drummer so my father rowed them past the white houses of coverack to dolor point and there at a word lay on his oars and the trumpeter william tallifer put his trumpet to his mouth and sounded the reveille the music of it was like rivers running they will follow said the drummer matthew pull you now for the manacles so my father pulled for the manacles and came to an easy close outside carn du and the drummer took his sticks and beat a tattoo there by the edge of the reef and the music of it was like a rolling chariot that will do says he breaking off they will follow pull now for the shore under gunners meadow then my father pulled for the shore and ran his boat in under gunners meadow and they stepped out all three and walked up to the meadow by the gate the drummer halted and began his tattoo again looking outward the darkness over the sea and while the drum beat and my father held his breath there came up out of the sea and the darkness a troop of many men horse and foot and formed up among the graves and others rose out of the graves and formed up drowned marines with bleached faces and pale hussars riding their horses all lean and shadowy there was no clatter of hoofs or accouterments my father said but a soft sound all the while like the beating of a birds wing and a black shadow lay like a pool about the feet of all the drummer stood upon a little knoll just inside the gate and beside him the tall trumpeter with hand on hip watching them gather and behind them both my father clinging to the gate when no more came the drummer stopped playing and said call the roll then the trumpeter stepped toward the end man of the rank and called troop sergeantmajor thomas irons and the man answered in a thin voice here troop sergeantmajor thomas irons how is it with you the man answered how should it be with me when i was young i betrayed a girl and when i was grown i betrayed a friend and for these i must pay but i died as a man ought god save the king the trumpeter called to the next man trooper henry buckingham and the next man answered here trooper henry buckingham how it is with you how should it be with me i was a drunkard and i stole and in lugo in a wineshop i killed a man but i died as a man should god save the king so the trumpeter went down the line and when he had finished the drummer took it up hailing the dead marines in their order each man answered to his name and each man ended with god save the king when all were hailed the drummer stepped backward to his mound and called it is well you are content and we are content to join you wait now a little while with this he turned and ordered my father to pick up the lantern and lead the way back as my father picked it up he heard the ranks of the dead men cheer and call god save the king all together and saw them waver and fade back into the dark like a breath fading off a pane but when they came back here to the kitchen and my father set the lantern down it seemed theyd both forgot about him for the drummer turned in the lanternlight and my father could see the blood still welling out of the hole in his breast and took the trumpetsling from around the others neck and locked drum and trumpet together again choosing the letters on the lock very carefully while he did this he said the word is no more corunna but bayonne as you left out an n in corunna so must i leave out an n in bayonne and before snapping the padlock he spelt out the word slowly bayone after that he used no more speech but turned and hung the two instruments back on the hook and then took the trumpeter by the arm and the pair walked out into the darkness glancing neither to right nor left my father was on the point of following when he heard a sort of sigh behind him and there sitting in the elbowchair was the very trumpeter he had just seen walk out by the door if my fathers heart jumped before you may believe it jumped quicker now but after a bit he went up to the man asleep in the chair and put a hand upon him it was the trumpeter in flesh and blood that he touched but though the flesh was warm the trumpeter was dead well sir they buried him three days after and at first my father was minded to say nothing about his dream as he thought it but the day after the funeral he met parson kendall coming from helston market and the parson called out have ee heard the news the coach brought down this mornin what news says my father why that peace is agreed upon none too soon says my father not soon enough for our poor lads at bayonne the parson answered bayonne cries my father with a jump why yes and the parson told him all about a great sally the french had made on the night of april th do you happen to know if the th regiment was engaged my father asked come now said parson kendall i didnt know you was so well up in the campaign but as it happens i do know that the th was engaged for twas they that held a cottage and stopped the french advance still my father held his tongue and when a week later he walked into helston and bought a mercury off the sherborne rider and got the landlord of the angel to spell out the list of killed and wounded sure enough there among the killed was drummer john christian of the th foot after this there was nothing for a religious man but to make a clean breast so my father went up to parson kendall and told the whole story the parson listened and put a question or two and then asked have you tried to open the lock since that night i havent dared to touch it says my father then come along and try when the parson came to the cottage here he took the things off the hook and tried the lock did he say bayonne the word has seven letters not if you spell it with one n as he did says my father the parson spelt it out bayone whew says he for the lock had fallen open in his hand he stood considering it a moment and then he says i tell you what i shouldnt blab this all round the parish if i was you you wont get no credit for truthtelling and a miracles wasted on a set of fools but if you like ill shut down the lock again upon a holy word that no one but me shall know and neither drummer nor trumpeter dead or alive shall frighten the secret out of me i wish to heaven you would parson said my father the parson chose the holy word there and then and shut the lock upon it and hung the drum and trumpet back in their place he is gone long since taking the word with him and till the lock is broken by force nobody will ever separate those two footnote p reprinted by special permission from great ghost stories copyright by dodd mead and company illustration xviii the house and the brainq by lord edward bulwerlytton a friend of mine who is a man of letters and a philosopher said to me one day as if between jest and earnest fancy since we last met i have discovered a haunted house in the midst of london really haunted and by what ghosts well i cant answer that question all i know is this six weeks ago my wife and i were in search of a furnished apartment passing a quiet street we saw on the window of one of the houses a bill apartments furnished the situation suited us we entered the house liked the rooms engaged them by the week and left them the third day no power on earth could have reconciled my wife to stay longer and i dont wonder at it what did you see it was not so much what we saw or heard that drove us away as it was an undefinable terror which seized both of us whenever we passed by the door of a certain unfurnished room in which we neither saw nor heard anything accordingly on the fourth morning i summoned the woman who kept the house and attended on us and told her that the rooms did not quite suit us and we would not stay out our week she said dryly i know why you have stayed longer than any other lodger few ever stayed a second night none before you a third but i take it they have been very kind to you they who i asked affecting to smile why they who haunt the house whoever they are i dont mind them i remember them many years ago when i lived in this house not as a servant but i know they will be the death of me some day i dont care im old and must die soon anyhow and then i shall be with them and in this house still the woman spoke with so dreary a calmness that really it was a sort of awe that prevented my conversing with her further i paid for my week and too happy were my wife and i to get off so cheaply you excite my curiosity said i nothing i should like better than to sleep in a haunted house pray give me the address of the one which you left so ignominiously my friend gave me the address and when we parted i walked straight toward the house thus indicated it is situated on the north side of oxford street in a dull but respectable thoroughfare i found the house shut up no bill at the window and no response to my knock as i was turning away a beerboy collecting pewter pots at the neighboring areas said to me do you want any one at that house sir yes i heard it was to be let let mr j offered mother who chars for him a pound a week just to open and shut the windows and she would not would not and why the house is haunted and the old woman who kept it was found dead in her bed with her eyes wide open they say the devil strangled her pooh you speak of mr j is he the owner of the house yes where does he live in g street no i gave the potboy the gratuity earned by his liberal information and i was lucky enough to find mr j at home an elderly man with intelligent countenance and prepossessing manners i communicated my name and my business frankly i said i heard the house was considered to be haunted that i had a strong desire to examine a house with so equivocal a reputation that i should be greatly obliged if he would allow me to hire it though only for a night i was willing to pay for that privilege whatever he might be inclined to ask sir said mr j with great courtesy the house is at your service for as short or as long a time as you please rent is out of the question the poor old woman who died in it three weeks ago was a pauper whom i took out of a workhouse for in her childhood she had been known to some of my family and had once been in such good circumstances that she had rented that house of my uncle she was a woman of superior education and strong mind and was the only person i could ever induce to remain in the house indeed since her death which was sudden and the coroners inquest which gave it a notoriety in the neighborhood i have so despaired of finding any person to take charge of the house much more a tenant that i would willingly let it rent free for a year to any one who would pay its rates and taxes how long is it since the house acquired this sinister character that i can scarcely tell you but very many years since the old woman i spoke of said it was haunted when she rented it between thirty and forty years ago i never had one lodger who stayed more than three days i do not tell you their stories to no two lodgers have there been exactly the same phenomena repeated it is better that you should judge for yourself than enter the house with an imagination influenced by previous narratives only be prepared to see and to hear something or other and take whatever precautions you yourself please have you never had a curiosity yourself to pass a night in that house yes i passed not a night but three hours in broad daylight alone in that house my curiosity is not satisfied but it is quenched i have no desire to renew the experiment you can not complain you see sir that i am not sufficiently candid and unless your interest be exceedingly eager and your nerves unusually strong i honestly add that i advise you not to pass a night in that house my interest is exceedingly keen said i and though only a coward will boast of his nerves in situations wholly unfamiliar to him yet my nerves have been seasoned in such variety of danger that i have the right to rely on them even in a haunted house mr j said very little more he took the keys of his house out of his bureau gave them to me and thanking him cordially for his frankness and his urbane concession to my wish i carried off my prize impatient for the experiment as soon as i reached home i summoned my confidential servant a young man of gay spirits fearless temper and as free from superstitious prejudice as any one i could think of f said i you remember in germany how disappointed we were at not finding a ghost in that old castle which was said to be haunted by a headless apparition well i have heard of a house in london which i have reason to hope is decidedly haunted i mean to sleep there tonight from what i hear there is no doubt that something will allow itself to be seen or to be heard something perhaps excessively horrible do you think if i take you with me i may rely on your presence of mind whatever may happen oh sir pray trust me answered f grinning with delight very well then here are the keys of the house this is the address go now select for me any bedroom you please and since the house has not been inhabited for weeks make up a good fire air the bed well see of course that there are candles as well as fuel take with you my revolver and my dagger so much for my weapons arm yourself equally well and if we are not a match for a dozen ghosts we shall be but a sorry couple of englishmen i was engaged for the rest of the day on business so urgent that i had not leisure to think much on the nocturnal adventure to which i had plighted my honor i dined alone and very late and while dining read as is my habit i selected one of the volumes of macaulays essays i thought to myself that i would take the book with me there was so much of healthfulness in the style and practical life in the subjects that it would serve as an antidote against the influence of superstitious fancy accordingly about halfpast nine i put the book into my pocket and strolled leisurely toward the haunted house i took with me a favorite dog an exceedingly sharp bold and vigilant bullterrier a dog fond of prowling about strange ghostly corners and passages at night in search of rats a dog of dogs for a ghost it was a summer night but chilly the sky somewhat gloomy and overcast still there was a moon faint and sickly but still a moon and if the clouds permitted after midnight it would be brighter i reached the house knocked and my servant opened the door with a cheerful smile all right sir and very comfortable oh said i rather disappointed have you not seen nor heard anything remarkable well sir i must own i have heard something queer what what the sound of feet pattering behind me and once or twice small noises like whispers close at my ear nothing more you are not at all frightened i not a bit of it sir and the mans bold look reassured me on one point viz that happen what might he would not desert me we were in the hall the street door closed and my attention was now drawn to my dog he had at first run in eagerly enough but had sneaked back to the door and was scratching and whining to get out after patting him on the head and encouraging him gently the dog seemed to reconcile himself to the situation and followed me and f through the house but keeping close to my heels instead of hurrying inquisitively in advance which was his usual and normal habit in all strange places we first visited the subterranean apartments the kitchen and other offices and especially the cellars in which last there were two or three bottles of wine still left in a bin covered with cobwebs and evidently by their appearance undisturbed for many years it was clear that the ghosts were not winebibbers for the rest we discovered nothing of interest there was a gloomy little backyard with very high walls the stones of this yard were very damp and what with the damp and what with the dust and smokegrime on the pavement our feet left a slight impression where we passed and now appeared the first strange phenomenon witnessed by myself in this strange abode i saw just before me the print of a foot suddenly form itself as it were i stopped caught hold of my servant and pointed to it in advance of that footprint as suddenly dropped another we both saw it i advanced quickly to the place the footprint kept advancing before me a small footprint the foot of a child the impression was too faint thoroughly to distinguish the shape but it seemed to us both that it was the print of a naked foot this phenomenon ceased when we arrived at the opposite wall nor did it repeat itself on returning we remounted the stairs and entered the rooms on the ground floor a diningparlor a small backparlor and a still smaller third room that had been probably appropriated to a footman all still as death we then visited the drawingrooms which seemed fresh and new in the front room i seated myself in an armchair f placed on the table the candlestick with which he had lighted us i told him to shut the door as he turned to do so a chair opposite to me moved from the wall quickly and noiselessly and dropped itself about a yard from my own immediately fronting it why this is better than the turningtables said i with a halflaugh and as i laughed my dog put back his head and howled f coming back had not observed the movement of the chair he employed himself now in stilling the dog i continued to gaze on the chair and fancied i saw on it a pale blue misty outline of a human figure but an outline so indistinct that i could only distrust my own vision the dog was now quiet put back that chair opposite to me said i to f put it back to the wall f obeyed was that you sir said he turning abruptly i what why something struck me i felt it sharply on the shoulder just here no said i but we have jugglers present and though we may not discover their tricks we shall catch them before they frighten us we did not stay long in the drawingrooms in fact they felt so damp and so chilly that i was glad to get to the fire upstairs we locked the doors of the drawingrooms a precaution which i should observe we had taken with all the rooms we had searched below the bedroom my servant had selected for me was the best on the floor a large one with two windows fronting the street the fourposted bed which took up no inconsiderable space was opposite to the fire which burnt clear and bright a door in the wall to the left between the bed and the window communicated with the room which my servant appropriated to himself this last was a small room with a sofabed and had no communication with the landingplace no other door but that which conducted to the bedroom i was to occupy on either side of my fireplace was a cupboard without locks flush with the wall and covered with the same dullbrown paper we examined these cupboards only hooks to suspend female dresses nothing else we sounded the walls evidently solid the outer walls of the building having finished the survey of these apartments warmed myself a few moments and lighted my cigar i then still accompanied by f went forth to complete my reconnoiter in the landingplace there was another door it was closed firmly sir said my servant in surprise i unlocked this door with all the others when i first came it can not have got locked from the inside for before he had finished his sentence the door which neither of us then was touching opened quietly of itself we looked at each other a single instant the same thought seized both some human agency might be detected here i rushed in first my servant followed a small blank dreary room without furniture a few empty boxes and hampers in a corner a small window the shutters closed not even a fireplace no other door but that by which we had entered no carpet on the floor and the floor seemed very old uneven wormeaten mended here and there as was shown by the whiter patches on the wood but no living being and no visible place in which a living being could have hidden as we stood gazing around the door by which we had entered closed as quietly as it had before opened we were imprisoned for the first time i felt a creep of undefinable horror not so my servant why they dont think to trap us sir i could break that trumpery door with a kick of my foot try first if it will open to your hand said i shaking off the vague apprehension that had seized me while i unclose the shutters and see what is without i unbarred the shutters the window looked on the little backyard i have before described there was no ledge without nothing to break the sheer descent of the wall no man getting out of that window would have found any footing till he had fallen on the stones below f meanwhile was vainly attempting to open the door he now turned round to me and asked my permission to use force and i should here state in justice to the servant that far from evincing any superstitious terrors his nerve composure and even gayety amid circumstances so extraordinary compelled my admiration and made me congratulate myself on having secured a companion in every way fitted to the occasion i willingly gave him the permission he required but though he was a remarkably strong man his force was as idle as his milder efforts the door did not even shake to his stoutest kick breathless and panting he desisted i then tried the door myself equally in vain as i ceased from the effort again that creep of horror came over me but this time it was more cold and stubborn i felt as if some strange and ghastly exhalation were rising up from the chinks of that rugged floor and filling the atmosphere with a venomous influence hostile to human life the door now very slowly and quietly opened as of its own accord we precipitated ourselves into the landingplace we both saw a large pale light as large as the human figure but shapeless and unsubstantial move before us and ascend the stairs that led from the landing into the attic i followed the light and my servant followed me it entered to the right of the landing a small garret of which the door stood open i entered in the same instant the light then collapsed into a small globule exceedingly brilliant and vivid rested a moment on a bed in the corner quivered and vanished we approached the bed and examined it a halftester such as is commonly found in attics devoted to servants on the drawers that stood near it we perceived an old faded silk handkerchief with the needle still left in a rent half repaired the kerchief was covered with dust probably it had belonged to the old woman who had last died in that house and this might have been her sleepingroom i had sufficient curiosity to open the drawers there were a few odds and ends of female dress and two letters tied round with a narrow ribbon of faded yellow i took the liberty to possess myself of the letters we found nothing else in the room worth noticing nor did the light reappear but we distinctly heard as we turned to go a pattering footfall on the floor just before us we went through the other attics in all four the footfall still preceding us nothing to be seen nothing but the footfall heard i had the letters in my hand just as i was descending the stairs i distinctly felt my wrist seized and a faint soft effort made to draw the letters from my clasp i only held them the more tightly and the effort ceased we regained the bedchamber appropriated to myself and i then remarked that my dog had not followed us when we had left it he was thrusting himself close to the fire and trembling i was impatient to examine the letters and while i read them my servant opened a little box in which he had deposited the weapons i had ordered him to bring took them out placed them on a table close at my bedhead and he occupied himself in soothing the dog who however seemed to heed him very little the letters were short they were dated the dates exactly thirtyfive years ago they were evidently from a lover to his mistress or a husband to some young wife not only the terms of expression but a distinct reference to a former voyage indicated the writer to have been a seafarer the spelling and handwriting were those of a man imperfectly educated but still the language itself was forcible in the expressions of endearment there was a kind of rough wild love but here and there were dark unintelligible hints at some secret not of love some secret that seemed of crime we ought to love each other was one of the sentences i remember for how every one else would execrate us if all was known again dont let any one be in the same room with you at night you talk in your sleep and again whats done cant be undone and i tell you theres nothing against us unless the dead could come to life here there was underlined in a better handwriting a females they do at the end of the letter latest in date the same female hand had written these words lost at sea the th of june the same day as i put down the letters and began to muse over their contents fearing however that the train of thought into which i fell might unsteady my nerves i fully determined to keep my mind in a fit state to cope with whatever of marvelous the advancing night might bring forth i roused myself laid the letters on the table stirred up the fire which was still bright and cheering and opened my volume of macaulay i read quietly enough till about halfpast eleven i then threw myself dressed upon the bed and told my servant he might retire to his own room but must keep himself awake i bade him leave open the door between the two rooms thus alone i kept two candles burning on the table by my bedhead i placed my watch beside the weapons and calmly resumed my macaulay opposite to me the fire burned clear and on the hearthrug seemingly asleep lay the dog in about twenty minutes i felt an exceedingly cold air pass by my cheek like a sudden draft i fancied the door to my right communicating with the landingplace must have got open but no it was closed i then turned my glance to my left and saw the flame of the candles violently swayed as by a wind at the same moment the watch beside the revolver softly slid from the table softly softly no visible hand it was gone i sprang up seizing the revolver with one hand the dagger with the other i was not willing that my weapons should share the fate of the watch thus armed i looked round the floor no sign of the watch three slow loud distinct knocks were now heard at the bedhead my servant called out is that you sir no be on your guard the dog now roused himself and sat on his haunches his ears moving quickly backward and forward he kept his eyes fixed on me with a look so strange that he concentrated all my attention on himself slowly he rose up all his hair bristling and stood perfectly rigid and with the same wild stare i had not time however to examine the dog presently my servant emerged from his room and if ever i saw horror in the human face it was then i should not have recognized him had we met in the street so altered was every lineament he passed by me quickly saying in a whisper that seemed scarcely to come from his lips run run it is after me he gained the door to the landing pulled it open and rushed forth i followed him into the landing involuntarily calling him to stop but without heeding me he bounded down the stairs clinging to the balusters and taking several steps at a time i heard where i stood the streetdoor open heard it again clap to i was left alone in the haunted house it was but for a moment that i remained undecided whether or not to follow my servant pride and curiosity alike forbade so dastardly a flight i reentered my room closing the door after me and proceeded cautiously into the interior chamber i encountered nothing to justify my servants terror i again carefully examined the walls to see if there were any concealed door i could find no trace of one not even a seam in the dullbrown paper with which the room was hung how then had the thing whatever it was which had so scared him obtained ingress except through my own chamber i returned to my room shut and locked the door that opened upon the interior one and stood on the hearth expectant and prepared i now perceived that the dog had slunk into an angle of the wall and was pressing himself close against it as if literally striving to force his way into it i approached the animal and spoke to it the poor brute was evidently beside itself with terror it showed all its teeth the slaver dropping from its jaws and would certainly have bitten me if i had touched it it did not seem to recognize me whoever has seen at the zoological gardens a rabbit fascinated by a serpent cowering in a corner may form some idea of the anguish which the dog exhibited finding all efforts to soothe the animal in vain and fearing that his bite might be as venomous in that state as in the madness of hydrophobia i left him alone placed my weapons on the table beside the fire seated myself and recommenced my macaulay i now became aware that something interposed between the page and the light the page was overshadowed i looked up and i saw what i shall find it very difficult perhaps impossible to describe it was a darkness shaping itself forth from the air in very undefined outline i can not say it was of a human form and yet it had more resemblance to a human form or rather shadow than to anything else as it stood wholly apart and distinct from the air and the light around it its dimensions seemed gigantic the summit nearly touching the ceiling while i gazed a feeling of intense cold seized me an iceberg before me could not more have chilled me nor could the cold of an iceberg have been more purely physical i feel convinced that it was not the cold caused by fear as i continued to gaze i thought but this i can not say with precision that i distinguished two eyes looking down on me from the height one moment i fancied that i distinguished them clearly the next they seemed gone but still two rays of a paleblue light frequently shot through the darkness as from the height on which i halfbelieved halfdoubted that i had encountered the eyes i strove to speak my voice utterly failed me i could only think to myself is this fear it is not fear i strove to rise in vain i felt as if weighed down by an irresistible force indeed my impression was that of an immense and overwhelming power opposed to my volition that sense of utter inadequacy to cope with a force beyond mans which one may feel physically in a storm at sea in a conflagration or when confronting some terrible wild beast or rather perhaps the shark of the ocean i felt morally opposed to my will was another will as far superior to its strength as storm fire and shark are superior in material force to the force of man and now as this impression grew on me now came at last horror horror to a degree that no words can convey still i retained pride if not courage and in my own mind i said this is horror but it is not fear unless i fear i can not be harmed my reason rejects this thing it is an illusion i do not fear with a violent effort i succeeded at last in stretching out my hand toward the weapon on the table as i did so on the arm and shoulder i received a strange shock and my arm fell to my side powerless and now to add to my horror the light began slowly to wane from the candles they were not as it were extinguished but their flame seemed very gradually withdrawn it was the same with the fire the light was extracted from the fuel in a few minutes the room was in utter darkness the dread that came over me to be thus in the dark with that dark thing whose power was so intensely felt brought a reaction of nerve in fact terror had reached that climax that either my senses must have deserted me or i must have burst through the spell i did burst through it i found voice though the voice was a shriek i remember that i broke forth with words like these i do not fear my soul does not fear and at the same time i found strength to rise still in that profound gloom i rushed to one of the windows tore aside the curtain flung open the shutters my first thought was light and when i saw the moon high clear and calm i felt a joy that almost compensated for the previous terror there was the moon there was also the light from the gaslamps in the deserted slumberous street i turned to look back into the room the moon penetrated its shadow very palely and partially but still there was light the dark thing whatever it might be was gone except that i could yet see a dim shadow which seemed the shadow of that shade against the opposite wall my eye now rested on the table and from under the table which was without cloth or cover an old mahogany round table there rose a hand visible as far as the wrist it was a hand seemingly as much of flesh and blood as my own but the hand of an aged person lean wrinkled small too a womans hand that hand very softly closed on the two letters that lay on the table the hand and letters both vanished then there came the same three loud measured knocks i had heard at the bedhead before this extraordinary drama had commenced as those sounds slowly ceased i felt the whole room vibrate sensibly and at the far end there rose as from the floor sparks or globules like bubbles of light many colored green yellow firered azure up and down to and fro hither thither as tiny willothewisps the sparks moved slow or swift each at its own caprice a chair as in the drawingroom below was now advanced from the wall without apparent agency and placed at the opposite side of the table suddenly as forth from the chair there grew a shape a womans shape it was distinct as a shape of life ghastly as a shape of death the face was that of youth with a strange mournful beauty the throat and shoulders were bare the rest of the form in a loose robe of cloudy white it began sleeking its long yellow hair which fell over its shoulders its eyes were not turned toward me but to the door it seemed listening watching waiting the shadow of the shade in the background grew darker and again i thought i beheld the eyes gleaming out from the summit of the shadow eyes fixed upon that shape as if from the door though it did not open there grew out another shape equally distinct equally ghastly a mans shape a young mans it was in the dress of the last century or rather in a likeness of such dress for both the male shape and the female though defined were evidently unsubstantial impalpable simulacra phantasms and there was something incongruous grotesque yet fearful in the contrast between the elaborate finery the courtly precision of that oldfashioned garb with its ruffles and lace and buckles and the corpselike stillness of the flitting wearer just as the male shape approached the female the dark shadow started from the wall all three for a moment wrapped in darkness when the pale light returned the two phantoms were as if in the grasp of the shadow that towered between them and there was a bloodstain on the breast of the female and the phantom male was leaning on its phantom sword and blood seemed trickling fast from the ruffles from the lace and the darkness of the intermediate shadow swallowed them up they were gone and again the bubbles of light shot and sailed and undulated growing thicker and thicker and more wildly confused in their movements the closet door to the right of the fireplace now opened and from the aperture there came forth the form of an aged woman in her hand she held letters the very letters over which i had seen the hand close and behind her i heard a footstep she turned round as if to listen and then she opened the letters and seemed to read and over her shoulder i saw a livid face the face as of a man long drowned bloated bleached seaweed tangled in his dripping hair and at her feet lay a form as of a corpse and beside the corpse there cowered a child a miserable squalid child with famine in its cheeks and fear in its eyes and as i looked in the old womans face the wrinkles and lines vanished and it became a face of youth hardeyed stony but still youth and the shadow darted forth and darkened over those phantoms as it had darkened over the last nothing now was left but the shadow and on that my eyes were intently fixed till again eyes grew out of the shadow malignant serpent eyes and the bubbles of light again rose and fell and in their disordered irregular turbulent maze mingled with the wan moonlight and now from these globules themselves as from the shell of an egg monstrous things burst out the air grew filled with them larvж so bloodless and so hideous that i can in no way describe them except to remind the reader of the swarming life which the solar microscope brings before his eyes in a drop of water things transparent supple agile chasing each other devouring each other forms like naught ever beheld by the naked eye as the shapes were without symmetry so their movements were without order in their very vagrancies there was no sport they came round me and round thicker and faster and swifter swarming over my head crawling over my right arm which was outstretched in involuntary command against all evil beings sometimes i felt myself touched but not by them invisible hands touched me once i felt the clutch as of cold soft fingers at my throat i was still equally conscious that if i gave way to fear i should be in bodily peril and i concentrated all my faculties in the single focus of resisting stubborn will and i turned my sight from the shadow above all from those strange serpent eyes eyes that had now become distinctly visible for there though in naught else around me i was aware that there was a will and a will of intense creative working evil which might crush down my own the pale atmosphere in the room began now to redden as if in the air of some near conflagration the larvж grew lurid as things that live in fire again the moon vibrated again were heard the three measured knocks and again all things were swallowed up in the darkness of the dark shadow as if out of that darkness all had come into that darkness all returned as the gloom receded the shadow was wholly gone slowly as it had been withdrawn the flame grew again into the candles on the table again into the fuel in the grate the whole room came once more calmly healthfully into sight the two doors were still closed the door communicating with the servants room still locked in the corner of the wall into which he had so convulsively niched himself lay the dog i called to him no movement i approached the animal was dead his eyes protruded his tongue out of his mouth the froth gathered round his jaws i took him in my arms i brought him to the fire i felt acute grief for the loss of my poor favorite acute selfreproach i accused myself of his death i imagined he had died of fright but what was my surprise on finding that his neck was actually broken had this been done in the dark must it not have been by a hand human as mine must there not have been a human agency all the while in that room good cause to suspect it i can not tell i can not do more than state the fact fairly the reader may draw his own inference another surprising circumstance my watch was restored to the table from which it had been so mysteriously withdrawn but it had stopped at the very moment it was so withdrawn nor despite all the skill of the watchmaker has it ever gone since that is it will go in a strange erratic way for a few hours and then come to a dead stop it is worthless nothing more chanced for the rest of the night nor indeed had i long to wait before the dawn broke nor till it was broad daylight did i quit the haunted house before i did so i revisited the little blind room in which my servant and myself had been for a time imprisoned i had a strong impression for which i could not account that from that room had originated the mechanism of the phenomena if i may use the term which had been experienced in my chamber and though i entered it now in the clear day with the sun peering through the filmy window i still felt as i stood on its floors the creep of the horror which i had first there experienced the night before and which had been so aggravated by what had passed in my own chamber i could not indeed bear to stay more than half a minute within those walls i descended the stairs and again i heard the footfall before me and when i opened the street door i thought i could distinguish a very low laugh i gained my own house expecting to find my runaway servant there but he had not presented himself nor did i hear more of him for three days when i received a letter from him dated from liverpool to this effect honored sir i humbly entreat your pardon though i can scarcely hope that you will think that i deserve it unless which heaven forbid you saw what i did i feel that it will be years before i can recover myself and as to being fit for service it is out of the question i am therefore going to my brotherinlaw at melbourne the ship sails tomorrow perhaps the long voyage may set me up i do nothing now but start and tremble and fancy it is behind me i humbly beg you honored sir to order my clothes and whatever wages are due to me to be sent to my mothers at walworth john knows her address the letter ended with additional apologies somewhat incoherent and explanatory details as to effects that had been under the writers charge this flight may perhaps warrant a suspicion that the man wished to go to australia and had been somehow or other fraudulently mixed up with the events of the night i say nothing in refutation of that conjecture rather i suggest it as one that would seem to many persons the most probable solution of improbable occurrences my belief in my own theory remained unshaken i returned in the evening to the house to bring away in a hack cab the things i had left there with my poor dogs body in this task i was not disturbed nor did any incident worth note befall me except that still on ascending and descending the stairs i heard the same footfall in advance on leaving the house i went to mr js he was at home i returned him the keys told him that my curiosity was sufficiently gratified and was about to relate quickly what had passed when he stopped me and said though with much politeness that he had no longer any interest in a mystery which none had ever solved i determined at least to tell him of the two letters i had read as well as of the extraordinary manner in which they had disappeared and i then inquired if he thought they had been addressed to the woman who had died in the house and if there were anything in her early history which could possibly confirm the dark suspicions to which the letters gave rise mr j seemed startled and after musing a few moments answered i am but little acquainted with the womans earlier history except as i before told you that her family were known to mine but you revive some vague reminiscences to her prejudice i will make inquiries and inform you of their result still even if we could admit the popular superstition that a person who had been either the perpetrator or the victim of dark crimes in life could revisit as a restless spirit the scene in which those crimes had been committed i should observe that the house was infested by strange sights and sounds before the old woman died you smile what would you say i would say this that i am convinced if we could get to the bottom of these mysteries we should find a living human agency what you believe it is all an imposture for what object not an imposture in the ordinary sense of the word if suddenly i were to sink into a deep sleep from which you could not awake me but in that sleep could answer questions with an accuracy which i could not pretend to when awake tell you what money you had in your pocket nay describe your very thoughts it is not necessarily an imposture any more than it is necessarily supernatural i should be unconsciously to myself under a mesmeric influence conveyed to me from a distance by a human being who had acquired power over me by previous rapport but if a mesmerizer could so affect another living being can you suppose that a mesmerizer could also affect inanimate objects move chairs open and shut doors or impress our senses with the belief in such effects we never having been en rapport with the person acting on us no what is commonly called mesmerism could not do this but there may be a power akin to mesmerism and superior to it the power that in the old days was called magic that such a power may extend to all inanimate objects of matter i do not say but if so it would not be against nature it would only be a rare power in nature which might be given to constitutions with certain peculiarities and cultivated by practice to an extraordinary degree that such a power might extend over the dead that is over certain thoughts and memories that the dead may still retain and compel not that which ought properly to be called the soul and which is far beyond human reach but rather a phantom of what has been most earthstained on earth to make itself apparent to our senses is a very ancient though obsolete theory upon which i will hazard no opinion but i do not conceive the power to be supernatural let me illustrate what i mean from an experiment which paracelsus describes as not difficult and which the author of the curiosities of literature cites as credible a flower perishes you burn it whatever were the elements of that flower while it lived are gone dispersed you know not whither you can never discover nor recollect them but you can by chemistry out of the burned dust of that flower raise a spectrum of the flower just as it seemed in life it may be the same with the human being the soul has as much escaped you as the essence or elements of the flower still you may make a spectrum of it and this phantom though in the popular superstition it is held to be the soul of the departed must not be confounded with the true soul it is but the eidolon of the dead form hence like the best attested stories of ghosts or spirits the thing that most strikes us is the absence of what we hold to be the soul that is of superior emancipated intelligence these apparitions come for little or no object they seldom speak when they do come if they speak they utter no ideas above those of an ordinary person on earth wonderful therefore as such phenomena may be granting them to be truthful i see much that philosophy may question nothing that it is incumbent on philosophy to deny viz nothing supernatural they are but ideas conveyed somehow or other we have not yet discovered the means from one mortal brain to another whether in so doing tables walk by their own accord or fiendlike shapes appear in a magic circle or bodyless hands rise and remove material objects or a thing of darkness such as presented itself to me freeze our blood still am i persuaded that these are but agencies conveyed as by electric wires to my own brain from the brain of another in some constitutions there is a natural chemistry and those constitutions may produce chemic wonders in others a natural fluid call it electricity and these may produce electric wonders but the wonders differ from natural science in this they are alike objectless purposeless puerile frivolous they lead on to no grand results and therefore the world does not heed and true sages have not cultivated them but sure i am that of all i saw or heard a man human as myself was the remote originator and i believe unconsciously to himself as to the exact effects produced for this reason no two persons you say have ever experienced exactly the same thing well observe no two persons ever experience exactly the same dream if this were an ordinary imposture the machinery would be arranged for results that would but little vary if it were a supernatural agency permitted by the almighty it would surely be for some definite end these phenomena belong to neither class my persuasion is that they originated in some brain now far distant that that brain had no distinct volition in anything that occurred that what does occur reflects but its devious motley evershifting halfformed thoughts in short that it has been but the dreams of such a brain put in action and invested with a semisubstance that this brain is of immense power that it can set matter into movement that it is malignant and destructive i believe some material force must have killed my dog the same force might for aught i know have sufficed to kill myself had i been as subjugated by terror as the dog had my intellect or my spirit given me no countervailing resistance in my will it killed your dog that is fearful indeed it is strange that no animal can be induced to stay in that house not even a cat rats and mice are never found in it the instincts of the brute creation detect influences deadly to their existence mans reason has a sense less subtle because it has a resisting power more supreme but enough do you comprehend my theory yes though imperfectly and i accept any crotchet pardon the word however odd rather than embrace at once the notion of ghosts and hobgoblins we imbibed in our nurseries still to my unfortunate house the evil is the same what on earth can i do with the house i will tell you what i would do i am convinced from my own internal feelings that the small unfurnished room at right angles to the door of the bedroom which i occupied forms a startingpoint or receptacle for the influences which haunt the house and i strongly advise you to have the walls opened the floor removed nay the whole room pulled down i observe that it is detached from the body of the house built over the small backyard and could be removed without injury to the rest of the building and you think if i did that you would cut off the telegraph wires try it i am so persuaded that i am right that i will pay half the expense if you will allow me to direct the operations nay i am well able to afford the cost for the rest allow me to write to you about ten days after i received a letter from mr j telling me that he had visited the house since i had seen him that he had found the two letters i had described replaced in the drawer from which i had taken them that he had read them with misgivings like my own that he had instituted a cautious inquiry about the woman to whom i rightly conjectured they had been written it seemed that thirtysix years ago a year before the date of the letters she had married against the wish of her relations an american of very suspicious character in fact he was generally believed to have been a pirate she herself was the daughter of very respectable tradespeople and had served in the capacity of a nursery governess before her marriage she had a brother a widower who was considered wealthy and who had one child of about six years old a month after the marriage the body of this brother was found in the thames near london bridge there seemed some marks of violence about his throat but they were not deemed sufficient to warrant the inquest in any other verdict than that of found drowned the american and his wife took charge of the little boy the deceased brother having by his will left his sister the guardianship of his only child and in the event of the childs death the sister inherited the child died about six months afterward it was supposed to have been neglected and illtreated the neighbors deposed to having heard it shriek at night the surgeon who had examined it after death said that it was emaciated as if from want of nourishment and the body was covered with livid bruises it seemed that one winter night the child had sought to escape crept out into the backyard tried to scale the wall fallen back exhausted and had been found at morning on the stones in a dying state but though there was some evidence of cruelty there was none of murder and the aunt and her husband had sought to palliate cruelty by alleging the exceeding stubbornness and perversity of the child who was declared to be halfwitted be that as it may at the orphans death the aunt inherited her brothers fortune before the first wedded year was out the american quitted england abruptly and never returned to it he obtained a cruising vessel which was lost in the atlantic two years afterward the widow was left in affluence but reverses of various kinds had befallen her a bank broke an investment failed she went into a small business and became insolvent then she entered into service sinking lower and lower from housekeeper down to maidofallwork never long retaining a place though nothing decided against her character was ever alleged she was considered sober honest and peculiarly quiet in her ways still nothing prospered with her and so she had dropped into the workhouse from which mr j had taken her to be placed in charge of the very house which she had rented as mistress in the first year of her wedded life mr j added that he had passed an hour alone in the unfurnished room which i had urged him to destroy and that his impressions of dread while there were so great though he had neither heard nor seen anything that he was eager to have the walls bared and the floors removed as i had suggested he had engaged persons for the work and would commence any day i would name the day was accordingly fixed i repaired to the haunted house we went into the blind dreary room took up the skirting and then the floors under the rafters covered with rubbish was found a trapdoor quite large enough to admit a man it was closely nailed down with clamps and rivets of iron on removing these we descended into a room below the existence of which had never been suspected in this room there had been a window and a flue but they had been bricked over evidently for many years by the help of candles we examined this place it still retained some moldering furniture three chairs an oak settle a table all of the fashion of about eighty years ago there was a chest of drawers against the wall in which we found halfrotted away oldfashioned articles of a mans dress such as might have been worn eighty or a hundred years ago by a gentleman of some rank costly steel buttons and buckles like those yet worn in courtdresses a handsome court sword in a waistcoat which had once been rich with gold lace but which was now blackened and foul with damp we found five guineas a few silver coins and an ivory ticket probably for some place of entertainment long since passed away but our main discovery was in a kind of iron safe fixed to the wall the lock of which it cost us much trouble to get picked in this safe were three shelves and two small drawers ranged on the shelves were several small bottles of crystal hermetically stoppered they contained colorless volatile essences of the nature of which i shall only say that they were not poisonous phosphor and ammonia entered into some of them there were also some very curious glass tubes and a small pointed rod of iron with a large lump of rock crystal and another of amber also a loadstone of great power in one of the drawers we found a miniature portrait set in gold and retaining the freshness of its colors most remarkably considering the length of time it had probably been there the portrait was that of a man who might be somewhat advanced in middle life perhaps fortyseven or fortyeight it was a remarkable face a most impressive face if you could fancy some mighty serpent transformed into a man preserving in the human lineaments the old serpent type you would have a better idea of that countenance than long descriptions can convey the width and flatness of frontal the tapering elegance of contour disguising the strength of the deadly jaw the long large terrible eye glittering and green as the emerald and withal a certain ruthless calm as if from the consciousness of an immense power mechanically i turned round the miniature to examine the back of it and on the back was engraved a pentacle in the middle of the pentacle a ladder and the third step of the ladder was formed by the date examining still more minutely i detected a spring this on being pressed opened the back of the miniature as a lid withinside the lid was engraved marianna to thee be faithful in life and in death to here follows a name that i will not mention but it was not unfamiliar to me i had heard it spoken of by old men in my childhood as the name borne by a dazzling charlatan who had made a great sensation in london for a year or so and had fled the country on the charge of a double murder within his own house that of his mistress and his rival i said nothing of this to mr j to whom reluctantly i resigned the miniature we had found no difficulty in opening the first drawer within the iron safe we found great difficulty in opening the second it was not locked but it resisted all efforts till we inserted in the chinks the edge of a chisel when we had thus drawn it forth we found a very singular apparatus in the nicest order upon a small thin book or rather tablet was placed a saucer of crystal this saucer was filled with a clear liquid on that liquid floated a kind of compass with a needle shifting rapidly round but instead of the usual points of the compass were seven strange characters not very unlike those used by astrologers to denote the planets a peculiar but not strong nor displeasing odor came from this drawer which was lined with a wood that we afterward discovered to be hazel whatever the cause of this odor it produced a material effect on the nerves we all felt it even the two workmen who were in the room a creeping tingling sensation from the tips of the fingers to the roots of the hair impatient to examine the tablet i removed the saucer as i did so the needle of the compass went round and round with exceeding swiftness and i felt a shock that ran through my whole frame so that i dropped the saucer on the floor the liquid was spilled the saucer was broken the compass rolled to the end of the room and at that instant the walls shook to and fro as if a giant had swayed and rocked them the two workmen were so frightened that they ran up the ladder by which we had descended from the trapdoor but seeing that nothing more happened they were easily induced to return meanwhile i had opened the tablet it was bound in plain red leather with a silver clasp it contained but one sheet of thick vellum and on that sheet were inscribed within a double pentacle words in old monkish latin which are literally to be translated thus on all that it can reach within these walls sentient or inanimate living or dead as moves the needle so work my will accursed be the house and restless be the dwellers therein we found no more mr j burned the tablet and its anathema he razed to the foundations the part of the building containing the secret room with the chamber over it he had then the courage to inhabit the house himself for a month and a quieter betterconditioned house could not be found in all london subsequently he let it to advantage and his tenant has made no complaints footnote q reprinted by special permission from great ghost stories copyright by dodd mead and company transcribers notes obvious punctuation errors repaired page by
