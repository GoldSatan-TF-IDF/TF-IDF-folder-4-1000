shall turkey live or die the european war now impending differs from the last in every important feature in its theatre its origin and its issues never was a contest more mysterious and unexpected in its rise more unwelcome to the majority of those engaged in it and more pregnant with grave yet uncertain consequences there are three classes of men whose minds it especially occupies while the religious eschatologist expects a new phase of predicted fulfilment and the speculative politician a new distribution of territory and influence the practical man seeks a fuller explication and enforcement of existing interests and obligations although they who see in all things the guiding hand of god are warranted to expect that in the communion of the faithful there shall be a divine presentiment of his holy procedure yet the attempt to map out the future is in too many very idle and in some most presumptuous on the other hand those who try every fresh event by the mere letter of protocols fail to apprehend its true moral importance and would bind the god of providence by the impotent will of man he that would rightly estimate or improve the present juncture must avoid both of these errors and while he regards it in its highest aspects he must not be hurried into foregone conclusions as to its issues destiny is the watchword of the day one horn of the crescent has long rested on christendom by destiny a child of destiny now rules for a second time in the west and scarcely has he by assuming in professed zeal for divine reminiscences the protectorate of holy places excited mens fears lest he should swell the number of those places and convert protectorate into possession when a new protector of things sacred arises in the north also pleading the call of destiny why these two protectors have not yet come forth to assert their rights in single combat and why the pope whose throne is upheld and whose claims are asserted by the former has acted in silence when he might have been expected to utter in encyclical letters the jeremiad of insulted authority are questions yet to be solved the religious and political champion of the papacy is now allied to other powers on grounds with which papal claims religious or political have nothing ostensibly at least exclusively to do and we now see the northern protector opposed by all the great powers of europe by the open protest of those who will and can withstand him by the tacit resistance of those who fear to be his friends yet dare not be his foes recent disclosures however warrant the conclusion that the pope has although covertly been the prime mover in the present troubles using france as a catspaw he has revived in a stronger form his almost obsolete claims to such a protectorate of the latin interest in the holy places as shall at jerusalem as elsewhere swallow up every other and the aggression of russia against turkey derives considerable excuse from the consideration that the czar in aiming a fleshly blow at the sultan is really aiming a spiritual blow at the pope if the catholic church or the christian nations are not in a condition to lift one united testimony against this new assertion of papal supremacy we are hardly entitled to complain that one champion throws down the gauntlet of denial provided he does not at the same time assert a graecosclavonic supremacy equally unjust and from its novelty more pregnant with danger while gentlemen on change or in downing street have their minds filled with the merely material aspects of the affair the man who yields the first place to the interests of christs kingdom cannot fail to mark that we are apparently on the eve of that great war of principles which canning foresaw of a religious and european war the issues of which derive from their very doubtfulness only the greater solemnity while the subsistence of turkey apparently bars the fulfilment of many christian hopes its destruction may by the means which bring that to pass greatly endanger the true interests of christendom and frustrate the grace of god and we may yet see the day when the still blinded and impenitent jew may make greater profit of this new crusade than he did of the former may step in between the combatants now on both sides alas christian and may settle the dispute by establishing his own claim to the land of promise in a way which although disowned of god till he confess our messiah may force or as a pisaller steal recognition from man leaving to others to decide with the pen those technical questions which the sword if drawn will decide without regard to their paper verdict let us contemplate the attitude of the chief actors in this opening drama and first of turkey we pray on good friday that god would have mercy upon all jews turks infidels and heretics and fetch them home to his fold as turks are herein classed with those who have been unfaithful under a divine covenant the old or the new it has become customary to regard them as apostates from the faith who deserve to be abhorred and treated as such this is however a total misconception some apostates have indeed become mahomedans and it is very questionable whether the talent or experience of such men justifies christian men and christian governments in using their services it may be that the once frequent perversion of christians to mahomedanism under the pressure of persecution in the days when our prayers were composed may have dictated this petition but whatever ravages the false religion of mahomet may have wrought among oriental churches and blinded jews at the first that religion took its rise among heathen and the present turks although converts to that faith which desolated eastern christendom are well known to have issued from a country where the christian faith was all but unknown the conquest of a part of christendom by the turks was not an act of apostacy in mahomedans but the judgment of god religious and political on the unfaithfulness of the christian church and state so that instead of directing our abhorrence against the rod by which god then smote his people we should rather humble ourselves because we provoked him to use it although the superstitious and credulous reverence for the theatre of christs life on earth has too often like the blessing of the womb that bare him been substituted for the hearing and keeping of his word yet no devout mind can fail to regard the scenes of his earthly sojourn with awful interest but the fact that our holy faith went forth from jerusalem gave us no right to possess that city the christian church has as a church no possession on earth rights of property belong to christian men not as christians but as men the jew not the christian forfeited judea no people but the jews have an original divine right to judea and while they remain impenitent their right passes over not to us but to their conquerors it is therefore more than questionable whether the crusaders had any right to attempt the ejection of mahomedans from the holy land they were more like usurpers than their opponents were and their conduct was alas often too good an argument against their cause on the other hand there never was a nobler heathen than the leader of the mahomedans against the crusaders when the turks long after took constantinople they did no more than many a heathen conqueror has done before and many a christian conqueror since a living tree was planted where the tree of an effete government had withered away a christian conqueror may use his conquest better just as he has more grace to reign than a heathen but his right does not lie in his grace the good sword by which most christian kings have won and kept their lands is in itself no better than the good scimitar of the turk and the conduct of the conqueror of byzantium towards the faith of his new subjects has often been regarded especially when we consider the stem tenets which he held as a model of justice and moderation there has seldom been a conquest by a people whose religion was their political charter over a people of a different faith which bore fewer marks of cruelty we are indeed pointed to the subsequent history of turkish rule as a proof of its unparalleled wickedness it is even argued that the turk having been during four hundred years put to the proof if he was fit to rule or capable of conveying any blessing to the conquered and having been found wanting has thus forfeited his right and it is hence concluded that the time is come when he should be dismissed from office not even by the subjects whom he has oppressed but by others who have none but a quixotic right to interfere men forget however that the form of turkish oppression has in great part arisen from the circumstance that religious principle and secular law are in turkey identified and as to those cruelties and wrongs which are not the offspring of law but the fruits of its absence or breach a comparison between turkish administration and that of many christian governors would not fall out much to the credit of the latter we need look no farther than to the country which now acts the champion of christian wrongs for a corruption of justice a cruelty of punishment and a smothering of true liberty which turkey could hardly outdo and it is well known that for many centuries even down to the most recent times in egypt in syria nay in jerusalem itself while rival parties of christians have broken the peace of society and disgraced the name of christ by their bitter animosities their dishonest intrigues and even their bloody strifes the disciple of the false prophet has often so used his power to maintain good order so counselled to mutual forbearance and as an umpire so laboured to restore harmony by the adjustment of differences as to make one blush at the relative positions of the crescent and the cross while it cannot be denied that the passions of the turk too often trample down all law the christians on whom he has trampled either have not yet been tried with power or where they have have abused it almost as much against their own brethren at this very day the turk bad as he is is a nobler animal than either the treacherous greek or the busy armenian nay the armenians are too often the most efficient instigators of mahomedan injustice it will not therefore do for us like children to beat the object on which we have wounded ourselves or bite the rod with which we are chastised but it may be asked are we to forget the zeal of sobieski and treat the turk not as an enemy and a persecutor but as a brother the answer is plain not as a brother christian but as a brother man the fact that god has used the turk to chastise christendom and suffered him to plant his temple of falsehood on the sites of the jewish and the christian fanes ought indeed to make us search into the reason of the punishment but does not alter the position or rights of the instrument employed we dare not treat the turk as an apostate because he has been the scourge of backsliders or as a man without rights because his power has been used against us we may lament the rise of a new heathen delusion but we have no right to exclude the deluded from the rights of man we may lament that a territory redeemed from the ocean of paganism has been again submerged but if the right of conquest is admitted in the law of christendom we cannot disown it in the law of the world the eastern empire itself gained its place by conquest and granting the validity of its territorial rights so acquired it alone was entitled and if it could rise again would be entitled to vindicate these supposing that the turk had no title to turkey surely england france russia and austria have as little right to expel him as he to be there and the fact that they are christian nations invests them with no new rights or political privilege the providence of god has indeed so ordered that a knot of states in one quarter of the globe have in common embraced christianity and thereby risen to the head of the nations and in many points of view christendom as a collective whole does form and can act as a corporate unity or commonwealth it may well be questioned however whether the boasted balance of power in europe and even the holy alliance have not tended to impair national integrity by unwarranted interference each christian monarch has none over him hut christ all others are but his brethren their totality has no authority over him in his own kingdom and although each nation may justly protest as each householder may against those acts of another which affect its just interests and ought to do its best by remonstrance in the cause of truth yet no nation derives a right from its imagined spirituality or orthodoxy to dictate the internal administration of another and as with individuals so no aggregate of nations has as a european peace society a right to prescribe to any one nation terms which it shall observe on pain of war unless that nation has consented to such arbitration but be this as it may if the christian commonwealth is to exhibit its corporate action either by waging quixotic war on the heathen or by the united repulse of an inroad on that part of its sacred territory which any one state may own and can forfeit or by creating itself a premature arbiter over the possession of the earth or by so trampling on the integrity of heathen nations as to violate the rights of men in order to maintain the integrity of the church and vindicate the rights of god it had better never have existed than perpetrate such a confusion of things heavenly and earthly and thus build up religion on the ruins of justice christ came not to destroy but to fulfil this applies to the law of nature as truly as to the law of moses fallen though man be and prone to evil there is a conscience of right and wrong as between man and man in every clime and creed and the first duty of those who would enlighten the consciences of men by heavenly truth is to see that they do not claim or take license to outrage the first principles of natural justice the rights of heathen men and states nay of apostates in things pertaining to this world are as sacred as those of christians faith in christ is save by special covenant the condition of no monarchs tenure of no states existence and if the turk as a man has as good a right as a christian to breathe the air turkey as a state has as good a claim to subsist and be recognised by other states as england or china has its right would not be strengthened by its conversion and is not impaired by its infidelity the spiritual although superior to the natural does not abolish or despise it the domination of turkey may injure christendom but the right way to be rid of this is not to deny or violate its national rights but to confess and renounce the moral and spiritual declension the heresy schism demoralization and other sins in the early eastern church of which that domination is the condign punishment in this light the crusades by whatever zeal for god called forth exhibited apart from all their attendant moral evils an evident obliteration of moral duty by fancied religious obligation and a trampling on natural rights in search of a spiritual object wrongly apprehended and wrongly pursued the deliverances of europe by martel on the one hand and sobieski on the other from subjection to mahomedan rule although they effected so signal a rescue for the faith derived their justification as political events not from the fact that the oppressive power was mahomedan but from the simple fact that it was an oppressive power the anomalous situation of the pope as being at once a claimant of oecumenic supremacy and one of the temporal heads of europe has shown itself in the anomalous attitude which he has assumed towards the turk as long as he was true to his own principles he never consented to stand in diplomatic relations to the porte in assuming to act as the sole spiritual and temporal head of all christendom he refused to acknowledge a heathen intruder into his supposed domain but the wrong way in which he expressed this refusal was by withholding as a temporal sovereign that diplomatic recognition to which the sultan as another temporal sovereign no longer at war with him was entitled and the recognition which he has lately given was the result not of true insight into the distinction between his own spiritual and temporal characters but of decaying zeal for god his former motive was a right one but the conduct which it dictated was mistaken with the failure of the motive his conduct has changed but his insight is not improved the christian nations of europe even those that acknowledge the supremacy of the pope withheld their diplomatic recognition of turkey not on purely religious grounds but because turkey remained as it were habitually a politically inimical power gradually the enmity subsided and in consequence although the religious obligation if true remains in its full force every christian government now finds itself in diplomatic relations with the porte on the simple ground of secular parity among civilized nations be they english russian chinese persians or turks yet while the political recognition of turkey is right there may be wrong grounds for doing a right thing a right thing may be overdone and the diplomatic relations of a christian with a heathen nation ought from the nature of things never to be so intimate as those with a christian government in these respects england does seem to have erred we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the almost unbroken amity of england with turkey has arisen from our commercial and territorial jealousy of other powers that selfinterest has reconciled us to intimate contact with those who count all christians dogs and that to talk continually of our good friend and staunch ally the turk argues either a blunting of our spiritual aversion to a blasphemous form of paganism or a lulling of conscience for mammons sake nor is it an uninstructive example of the truth that brethren at strife are the most irreconcileable of all men prov xviii that the same nation which shrinks with sacred horror and blind alarm from diplomatic relations with rome not on the ground that rome should not be or is not an european state but on the ground that the head of that state is at the same time usurping a false spiritual place should without any qualm of conscience give the hand of political brotherhood to a government the whole code of which is based upon the words of an impostor who has superseded christ at the same time we cannot accuse england of securing the favour of turkey at the expense of the christians who are subjected to mahomedan rule there never was a more unjust reproach than that raised by certain religionists against england that she appears at the court of the sultan as a christian power taking the side of the oppressor against his christian subjects navarino is a witness to the reverse be the cause of the greek nation good or bad none have been its warmer or more sincere supporters than the english so powerful an element in our motives for the support of greece was the desire to emancipate christianity from a mahomedan yoke that in order to attain this end england ran the risk of weakening by the emancipation of greece the bulwark which she found in turkey against the advances of russia and for a long series of years no part of the policy of england has been more unvarying than her resolution expressed by deeds to employ her just influence at the porte in the most unwearied and enlightened disinterestedness by embracing often at great sacrifices and risks and with singular success every opportunity to plead the cause of the christian population in the east although belonging to a different section of the church from her own in this respect she may well bear comparison with any other power especially with one which although it seeks to wind the pious by vaunting itself the protector of oriental christianity has done little or nothing for the coreligionists of its own subjects save to entice them through a proposed ecclesiastical union into a political subjugation which they abhor but this leads us to speak of russia the new protector of oriental christians if the other european governments had in due time either independently or in concert with england lifted as constant and sincere a protest as hers at the court of turkey against the wrongs of these christians and had required with one voice that the government should administer its laws impartially to all its subjects irrespective of their creed we might have heard less of this new protectorate and should by an act of justice and mercy have foreclosed the present flimsy pretexts of russia but the weakness of christian zeal our indifference between christ and belial and the absence of christian concord have prevented this and by our laches we have furnished the pretexts against which we now exclaim but let us consider for a moment who the helper and helped are even granting that the professions of russia were true in the letter there is surely no one so blindly charitable as to believe that however sincere the illinformed masses in russia may be in the fanatical excitement to which they have been goaded the czar or his advisers have either tears of compassion on their eyelids or indignation in their hearts at the wrongs of oriental christians without entering into the maze of diplomacy or attempting to interpret treaties intentionally delphic it may suffice to observe that the general plea now urged by russia formed no part of her original demands but was resorted to lest those should be satisfied the czar has two characters he is in the first place the spiritual head of the russian church but he is not and knows that he is not the spiritual head of the whole greek church still less of the armenians nestorians or any other oriental body of christians and least of all of those united to rome each oriental church has its own proper patriarch or other supreme head and the czar has no more right on any religious ground to throw down the gauntlet as the champion of those other churches than the pope or the archbishop of canterbury that they are neither romanist nor protestant is no ground provided they are not russian that their faith or rites are more akin to nay even identical with his own is no ground he has no authority human or divine for taking such a place as the universal champion of the east he never pretends that members of the russian church are among the persecuted save a few pilgrims yet he does not limit his care to these he is indeed in the second place the autocrat of all the russias but there is no pretence that any part of his dominions has been seized or invaded therefore neither as temporal nor as spiritual head has he a vestige of claim to interfere individually on the abstract ground of right all that he could do would be to unite with other christian powers in representations to the porte to the necessity of making these the other christian powers are now awakened too late indeed to prevent the solitary aggressions of russia but assuredly not too late to bring out the utter groundlessness of her pretensions it has always been the artful endeavour of the czar to place his opponents at a disadvantage by bringing them at each step into a position in which they shall appear aggressors he crosses the pruth professing not to declare war thereby but merely to take a precautionary pledge for the fulfilment of treaties and because turkey justly regarded his act as a declaration of war he calls turkey the aggressor he insists on fighting out with turkey alone a quarrel in which all european powers have by his acts become interested and because they act on this conviction he calls them aggressors for interfering in a private quarrel he has forced the fleets of europe to occupy the euxine as he the proviuces and after seeing them where they would not be if neutral and being told how far their defence of the weaker part would go he seeks by the question of a simpleton to throw on us the stigma of being the first to declare war but the cloven foot has been unmistakeably revealed by his rejection of the proposal of the four powers to insist on and obtain a protectorate for all christians under turkish sway and in assigning as the ground of that rejection that he will not suffer any interference with his sole right of protection he virtually arrogates to himself a right which they who are its objects disallow which no treaty ever did or could confer upon him and which the other powers of europe cannot permit him to plead in fact his claim of protectorate would cover almost every class but the only one of which he is protector he cannot be claiming from turkey a right to protect the russian church that right is not interfered with by turkey or any one else and of those whom he does claim to protect every class however hostile to turkey would infinitely prefer the rule of turkey mollified by christian diplomacy to the temporal rule of the czar to this last his religious protectorate would infallibly lead for if the two characters of spiritual and temporal head are inseparable in his person in russia who shall separate them in turkey whenever he has the power to exhibit both moreover why rest in the mere protectorate of christians what if the jew also should become an object of pity to the czar and he should extort syria from the turk for the jew who has certainly a better claim to palestine than the greek to turkey it may however be argued that all speculations as to abstract rights are superseded by treaties the terms of which must be kept and by which turkey and other powers have recognised the right of russia to insist in such as her present demands and to occupy the provinces as she does to this it must be replied that one of the very questions at issue is whether such compacts as those alleged exist whether they are capable of the interpretation put upon them by russia and whether they justify the occupation of the provinces as to the latter russia pleads the precedent of her previous occupation unquestioned by the european powers but instead of justifying the one by the other we should rather deny the justice of both on the former occasion the cause of russia may have been good but the goodness of the motive can never legalise an illegal act the former occupation should not have been allowed by not being awake we let in the wedge and we are now suffering the penalty of having listened to the dangerous doctrine that the end sanctifies the means let us disown so bad a precedent the thing which russia seeks to do is singlehanded to extort from turkey pledges or the fulfilment of alleged pledges as to her own internal administration the giving or fulfilling of which would be a surrender of her national integrity in order virtually though not yet nominally to use her as a province and thoroughfare this must not be if the administration of turkey becomes a public nuisance it must be abated by the public verdict of nations but it may not be corrected by a single nation which while it has no peculiar right to interfere has a peculiar interest in spoiling the offender if russia has already injured turkey and stolen a march on europe by treaty now is the time when the operation of treaties is suspended to see that the evil is not repeated or prolonged but repaired and if having not yet done it she now attempts it every lover of fair play must forbid her let us not forget while treaties are talked of and in so far as advantageous so religiously asserted that the position of turkey in europe has the sanction of treaties without number framed not in ignorance of what she was but knowing it well if the nations of europe had persisted in refusing to acknowledge such an intrusive and persecuting power and had provided as the first condition of conceding to it by diplomatic recognition a place in the european commonwealth that it should afford to its christian subjects the same advantages as they should have enjoyed under christian rule or at least that it should administer equal laws to christians and turks the case would now be widely different but it was not so europe took turkey as she found it and whatever immunities have since been granted by turkey to christians these have in so far been acts of free grace that they were no original conditions of the entrance of turkey into the european federation in short it is far too late to put turkey on her trial as a candidate for her place it was never said to the turk we shall take proof of you for a century or two by your conduct before we admit you he has on all secular grounds of public law as good a right to his place as we have to ours we may indeed be bound by no treaty to maintain turkey but we are bound by justice to see that it is fairly dealt with at all events let us do one thing or the other abolish turkey with one consent if you will provided you know what next to do but if you deem its abolition undeserved if you cannot put greece in its place or agree how to divide the spoil defend it from all thieves and robbers in the meantime here justice and interest are at one we may regret that the turk is there but we dare not turn him out by the shoulder in our indignation we must wait till that higher power which sent him shall withdraw him no european confederacy then still less any single nation can force turkey out of europe by resolving to impose new conditions on it which it will not or cannot accept yet we do not counsel the folding of the arms in a resignation which borders on fatalism it may come to pass that turkey like any other nation may so change for the worse its original character and may so sin against that common law of nations which is more sacred than any statute or treaty that as madmen are put by their neighbours in a strait waistcoat and they who offend against society are sent to coventry turkey may provoke surrounding governments to vote it out of europe necessity has no law but has turkey so acted on the contrary however far its conduct towards christians in the east may fall short of that ideal standard by which russia now takes a fancy to measure it has there not been for a long time with occasional exceptions a marked and steadily progressive improvement in the exercise of its now declining government as regards them it would need some sudden and flagrant excess to justify the arming of europe against it still more to warrant the zeal of such a solitary champion as the czar but is there no other power which threatens to become rather than turkey a public offender are the instinctive and constant apprehensions of all europe on the side of russia pure hallucinations are they not so strong as to survive every fresh apprehension from france is not every help which russia has lent against revolutionary principles accepted with suspicion as insincere with a grudge as dearly bought with dread as dangerous to european liberty whatever ties may bind the court of russia to others is it not notorious that the hatred of the whole german people to russia is such that no german monarch dare tax the loyalty or the pockets of his people in behalf of russia and each may count upon both against her are we so blinded by the spirit of selfish reaction and so contracted by the spirit of party as to see none but those proximate evils which the brute can feel to apprehend danger from nothing but rebellion and to see wickedness in none but the radicals of western europe or are we such devotees to the mere catchwords of christianity and so given up to believe the religious phrases which political craft takes up into its mouth in order to instigate its friends and paralyze its foes as to be blind to the realities of things and deaf to the claims both of interest and of justice is our vision so filled with the antichrist who denies god that we have no corner for him who confesses him or have we so pinned our faith to the antichrist of rome or republicanism that we have no watchfulness left for the great antichrist of the north who has lifted his paw to appropriate the spiritual crown of christ whose name stands parallel with that of god in the hearts of his serfs and on the buildings of his realm and who at the time dictated by scythian cunning will mount his chariot to drive like a modern jehu in his zeal for the lord are we englishmen prepared after contesting it with those who have paved the way into the east under cloud of night to look on when the journey is undertaken in broad day are we prepared to hail the tyranny of the knout and the treachery of the bribe as a blessed substitute for the bash of the scimitar and the grasp of the spoiler are we who when the fancy took us to be suspicious could hardly listen to the pacific assurances of france ready to swallow any assurance from a government which is the impersonation of craft and the tallowy unmoved countenance of which never yet betrayed its passions or projects do we believe that those who bide their time in silence are less dangerous than those who anticipate it with bluster do we dream that russia has become such an unwieldy mass as to endanger us only by its fall or do we regard the hordes of the north which have more than once overrun europe in savage disorder as being incapable of doing so again in imperial order if we do it is time that we thought otherwise now is the time war is a sad calamity everywhere and a shameful thing among christian nations let us beware of being those to bring it recklessly on but if it must come let us beware of avoiding it by ruin to ourselves or others russia has by her own act set us free from our own former relations to her let us see to it that our new relations be more secure let her not make the black sea a mare clausum let her not make the baltic a mare clausum let her not make the danube a fluvium clausum a european pipe with a russian plug let her not make bornholm a russian arsenal the cattegat a russian strait scandinavia a russian province denmark a russian landingplace or persia a russian highway rather let the caucasus be secured against future butchery and courland liefland and finland be restored to their natural owners meantime let none who must not meddle in the fray but let none who ought waver let them take the right side and do it heartily for while decision saves blood indecision may forfeit all we may push neutrality into selfcontradiction and while we strike at a distance let us not lay ourselves bare at home there are such things as political feints moreover if austria through poverty or gratitude or prussia through family ties shall be won or neutralized by russia let them remember that they do it at the almost certain risk of intestine rebellion and of being despoiled in italy and on the rhine by foreign conquest though we believe in the sure word of prophecy we must beware of its private or premature interpretation and while we ought not on the one hand to be paralysed in doing our duty by prophetic anticipations neither dare we on the other excite ourselves to any breach of duty by a desire to see these realized god will remove all oppressive powers which stand in his way but there are wicked powers enough in the earth to do his work of judgment whether on his church or on her enemies we may not be our own saviours we may not arise in selfwill to carry out gods counsels it is our part to expect his salvation in the way of strict duty men may speculate about the drying up of the euphrates and the restoration of the jews to their land as they please we shall best commend ourselves to god not by skilful calculations as to the rate at which or the manner in which the chariot of his church as the mystery of his coming kingdom rolls along the highways of his providence but rather by ourselves abiding in the chariot and trusting to the goodness of its guide and the sole true foundation on which we can build up the nobler superstructure of holiness is scrupulous righteousness between nation and nation between man and man he only that has clean hands shall prosper in his deed one word more the votaries of reaction insist that turkey shall be blotted out as the gatheringplace of all revolutionary spirits but why is it so not because the policy of turkey is revolutionary but because he who has been the fulcrum of reaction has by declaring war against turkey opened turkey for them as a door by which they can attack him and has justified turkey in using them bad nay blasphemous as revolutionists may be he who would hunt them out of the earth must have an unclean conscience himself he must feel that he has not been the shepherd of his people and that he has more coveted the fleece than loved the flock see
