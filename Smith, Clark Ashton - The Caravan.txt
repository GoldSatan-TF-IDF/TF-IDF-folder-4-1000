the caravan by clark ashton smith my dreams are like a caravan that departed long ago with tumult of intrepid banners and spears and the clamour of bugles and brave adventurous songs to seek the horizons of perilous unknown barbaric lands and kingdoms immense and vaguely rumoured with cities beautiful and opulent as the cities of paradise and deep edenic vales of palm and cinnamon and myrrh lying beneath skies of primeval azure silence for traffic in the realms of mystery and wonder in the marts of scarceimaginable cities and metropoli a million leagues away on the last horizon of romance my dreams departed as a caravan with its laden camels since then the years are many the days have flown as the flocks of southering swallow unnumbered moons have multiplied in fugitive silver uncounted suns in irretainable gold but alas the caravan has not returned have the swirling sands engulfed them on a noon of storm when the desert rose like the sea and rolled its tawny billows on the walled gardens of the green and fragrant lands or perished they devoured by the crimsom demons of thirst and the ghouls and vultures or live they still as captives in alien dungeons not to be ascertained or held by a wizard spell in palaces demonbuilt and cities baroque and splendid as the cities in a tale from the thousand and one nights
