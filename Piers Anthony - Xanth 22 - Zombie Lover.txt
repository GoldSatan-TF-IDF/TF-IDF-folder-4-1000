he approached the good magicians castle on foot an obscure woman of indeterminate age in a flowing robe steadying herself with a staff she looked neither lovely nor regal without being deficient in either quality she earned a large book in the crook of her left elbow the castle was obviously not expecting visitors the drawbridge was up laundry was hanging from a window and the moat monster was snoozing the woman was unperturbed she touched the surface of the water with the tip of her staff then stepped onto the moat she walked across her slippers denting but not penetrating the surface small ripples traveled out across the moat the moat monster woke with a start as a ripple gently lifted his nose he blinked then coiled into action he raised his head high opened his jaws and oriented on the figure he inhaled ready to breathe tierce water vapor on the trespasser relax souffle she said the monster blinked then sank back down into his snooze without even a snort the woman reached the inner bank and then the front door it was locked closed she touched it with her staff and it opened she walked into the castle there was no clamor of discovery whoever else was in the castle remained unaware of the intrusion she made her wiy through the dusky recesses mounted the piers anthony crooked stairs and walked into the dingy office there was good magician humfrey poring over his huge archaic tome isnt it about time she inquired the gnomelike mans near ear twitched he raised his head and focused a bleary eye on her one or two synapses connected oh hello clio he said and a similar greeting to you humfrey the muse of history responded now im sure you have the matters well in hand but thought i should verify the details purely as a courtesy i do have an interest in the cases the good magician pondered evidently sorting through his voluminous but dusty memory until several more synapses fell into line i shall attend to it of course clio was too polite to suggest that he might have forgotten the matter im sure it will be a fine occasion are the invitations in order humfrey looked blank clio gave the shadowy ceiling a youmenareallalike glance invitations she repeated how else do you suppose the participants will know about the main event invitations he agreed finally getting it but his aspect seemed to be a trifle deficient in competence assign jenny elf to do them a rheumy eyeball widened in dull surprise but who else she inquired rhetorically shes surely competent now do you have any proper notion of the other assignments humfrey started to turn the pages of the vasty old tome before him forget the book of answers clio snapped this needs to be more flexible than that ask your designated wife to make them she will have proper taste and finesse wife he agreed relieved the muse of history turned about to leave then paused i trust i will see you there humfrey looked as if he had swallowed a stink horn he hated to go out in public but now he had no choice yes clio completed her turn and stepped out of the dismal study only then did she allow a small smile to hover in the vicinity of her lips a person who did not know better might have supposed that she enjoyed discomfiting the notorious good magician black dream b reanna felt fortunate it was partly her appearance which was filling out nicely she had lustrous black hair to her waist and glowing green eyes her dark skin fairly shone that was because she was a bright healthy girl of the black wave and proud of her heritage she should really be something she thought when she finally turned sixteen she turned away from the mirror pond and looked for a blackberry pie to eat before dawn and that was the main thing alone among the teens of her village she had a magic talent normally only a baby delivered in xanth had magic but she was special she blessed the day she had discovered it for it had changed her life she had come to the land of xanth with her wave six years ago when she was nine and thought she would never have magic how wonderfully wrong that had turned out to be her talent was to see in blackness that was why she now went about by night and slept during the day it was just so much more interesting at night when other human folk were sleeping and the weird creatures of darkness were abroad oh yes there was danger but she had obtained a safety spell that warned her of any direct threat to her tender flesh and that was enough she hoped she hadnt renewed it recently so the spell might be fading she was able to move quickly and silently and lose herself in the night foiling most monsters she also had a sharp dagger which she hoped she would never have to use as other than a threat piers anthony meanwhile the lure of the mysteries of darkness drew her to ever farther explorations there were no pie trees close by but she did spy a tart bush tarts were a bit sharp on the tongue but would do she picked a black raspberry tart and bit into it and it was fine she found a coffee tree with a cup of black coffee and that was fine too at home she wasnt allowed to drink coffee yet but that was yet another adventure of going out on her own no one told her what not to do her folks were so dull that they could see only mundane things despite living in a magic realm now they would need special magic glasses to see most of the magic of xanth breanna really didnt miss mundania xanth was so much more interesting oh there were dangers but they were mostly magical instead of dreary things like robbers and drunk drivers she might have liked to have some chewing gum but here it was as apt to chew the person as to be chewed she saw what looked like a barrister bloom maybe if she wore its flower it would enable her to argue her case better at home it had a nice daisylike flower but as she touched it something awkward happened she jumped back oh now she saw that it was a different plant a bare aster she wouldnt want to wear one of those flowers she came to a river that seemed a bit too wide and deep to wade across fortunately there were big banana plants or plantains growing by its banks with the biggest fruits she had seen magic could be very good for plants so she grabbed onto an old plantain and managed to haul it down she wedged it open and scooped out the remnant of its pulp now she had a banana boat she used an old stem as a paddle and moved across the water another craft came floating down the stream it was small and had two hulls and several cats were on it oha catamaran it figured it had a sail but one cat was busily shredding it with its claws then the cat spied breanna and dived down out of sight terrified that one would be called fray d cat she was sure she landed and saw a big dog house with a small pup tent beside it that too figured big dog little dog things tended to be literal in xanth she saw a bright rift forming in the east and realized that it was the first crack of dawn night was over and soon light would spill zombie lover through the crack and inundate the region flooding it with day so it was time for her to sleep she loved her talent but it did have the small disadvantage of making daylight uncomfortably bright for her she acclimatized when she had to but preferred not to bother also she got tired after being active all night so now she simply slept in the daytime when away from home unfortunately she wasnt sleepy yet ohbecause of that coffee she should have remembered that it had a mild wakeup spell that was why her folks didnt let her drink it they said she was enough of a handful by day and they didnt need to have her active by night too how little did they know but though she hated to admit it their rule would have helped her in this case how could she get her rest she looked around she saw a large dried fish mounted on a pole birds were coming in to sit on it that was a perch it was a favorite resting place for birds but she was no bird there was a commotion and several small metallic objects ran by they looked like keys for doors still new and shiny ohthose would be latchkey kids running home as she herself should be doing if she werent too ornery to give up her adventure she saw them charge up to a big block marked writer what were they doing around a writers block they climbed up on top of it where there was a board they settled down comfortably on that board each little key evidently having its own spot when every key was in place the block put down wooden pegs and walked away oh i get it breanna said the key board unlocks the writers block but her problem wasnt being blocked but needing to get some sleep she saw a spreading tree whose branches might offer a decent place to be but then she recognized it as a sycamore and the last thing she wanted was to get more and more sick then she remembered something she had seen nearby dark glasses they were supposed to have a spell to put folk to sleep so she walked back to the spectacle bush she had passed recently and checked it over sure enough one of its offerings was a handsome dark pair and conveniently close was an open shelter with what looked like a comfortable bed under a pleasant canopy nobody was using it so she would borrow it for a few hours she lay down on the bed put on the dark glasses and closed her piers anthony eyes immediately she felt the magic taking hold and sank into a lovely dark slumber suddenly breanna couldnt breathe something was covering her mouth and squishing her nose she struggled reaching wildly with her armsand discovered that a head was resting on her face it was a man in fact he was kissing her she grabbed him by the ears and heaved him off her innocent lips she tried to scream but first had to inhale and in the time it took to do that she was sitting up so violently that her dark glasses fell off blinding day assaulted her eyes and she had to squeeze them tightly closed when she shut her eyes her mouth shut too stifling her scream she had never thought to practice screaming with her eyes closed by then she realized that maybe a scream was not in order who was this man who had taken such advantage of her it might be better to find out before she took further action after all men did have their points and it behooved a girl not to throw them away carelessly she squinted letting only a little light in the man was standing there a somewhat hazy outline he didnt look dangerous at the moment who are you she demanded why did you molest me i am king xeth he replied in a somewhat scratchy voice i kissed you awake i know that what made you think i didnt want to sleep in peace she was irritable because of her rude awakening from slumber her systems were not yet back on track you are in the pavilion of love his speech was slightly slurred but she could make it out her vision was improving as her eyes acclimatized to the daylight the what he pointed to a sign beside the bed it said pavilion of i ove breanna drew a blank whats that when a woman wants to marry she sleeps in the pavilion ot love he explained only a man of good appearance character and breeding can enter if he chooses her he kisses her awake i was so glad to find a sleeping beauty instead of a sleeping bag things were beginning to come together but not in a way that reassured her but im not ready to marry anyone she protested im only fifteen zombie lover am thirty he responded i love your lustrous black hair and glowing green eyes i am sure you will make a good wife breanna realized that she had blundered into real mischief it was a mistake i didnt see the sign i was just resting i cant marry you she got off the bed and began sidling away i will marry you and make you queen of the zombies he said you are young and healthy and fully alive so it will be a long time before you rot breanna wanted nothing so much as to get well away from here but this made her pause involuntarily queen of what the zombies we felt it was time to have our own kingdom so we held an election and the healthiest zombie won me but it is a condition of kingship that i marry so as to summon a suitable heir and continue the line thats why i came here to find a wife youyoure a zombie she asked newly appalled her hand came up to wipe frantically at her mouth her lips didnt feel zombied but she wanted to wash them ten times as thoroughly as possible was it contagious yes of course how else could i be king of the zombies this is absolutely impossible by no means my mother is zora zombie who married the living man xavier forty years ago it took them a while to summon the stork because not all of her necessary innards were healthy but i dont want to hear it breanna shrieked actually she had not meant that she doubted him to be a zombie she could now see that there were some sagging places on him incipient flesh rot and the reason for his slurring was apparent a mushy tongue she had meant that it was impossible for her to marry him she wasnt ready to marry anyone least of all a zombie there is no need for you to hear it if it bores you xeth said equably come with me now to castle zombie where the wedding will be organized you will want to meet your new subjects no i wont she cned i wont marry you im just a girl a living girl im getting out of here now at last she suited action to word and charged out of the pavilion but it has been decided he protested you slept here i kissed you all the zombie women will be jealous of your lustrous long hair and firm flesh let them be jealous of something else she flung back find piers anthony another girl im sure one will come to sleep in the pavilion soon im gone she dodged behind a beerbarrel tree and kept going no you are the one xeth called after her i loved you the moment i entered the pavilion as its magic decrees i love your burned black color i love your high emotion she was running but not out of range of his voice what do you know of my emotion that is my talent mind reading i may fudge the details somewhat but the power of your emotion comes through delightfully i can tell that you have very strong feelings for me thats because i loathe the very notion of being close to you she shot back yes you love the notion of being close to me he agreed it will be a perfect marriage she suspected that there was a bit of rot in his ear too but she didnt stay to argue the case she tried to sneak behind a small tangle tree but he still pursued her why dont you marry a nice zombie girl she demanded over her shoulder because they are all too rotten he said with considerable accuracy while that is no fault ordinarily it is a fact that the storks dont like to deliver babies to zombie women thats why it took ten years to persuade the stork to deliver me to my mother so i need a living woman just as my mother needed a living man you are just perfect he had given her much too good an answer she could not refute it logically so she tried to do it emotionally im not perfect im too young and immature and unready to settle down i dont love you you will surely grow older and more mature and learn to settle down you will be a fine inspiration for our corps desprit our undead army and i know where there is a fine love spring the one where my mother learned to love my father he was still outarguing her if there was one thing she detested worse than a zombie it was a smart zombie so she let fly with the truth i dont want to marry a zombie then she ran as fast as her healthy living legs could propel her and soon left him out of sight and hearing soon she got smart she knew he would follow so she couldnt zombie lovhr rest until she was so far away he would never find her after that she would figure out what else to do she slowed so as to let some of her breath catch up with her and picked her way carefully so as to leave no obvious trail when she came to a stream she waded through it pausing only to wash her fouled mouth out several times she followed it upstream then followed a dragon trail for several paces before doubling back and wading farther upstream if the zombie thought she had gone that way he would encounter the dragon she wasnt sure how dragons felt about zombies but at least it would be a distraction at last she spied a branch hanging over the water she reached up to catch it and hauled herself up and into the tree she made her way to a branch on the opposite side and dropped off into a gully that led away from the stream it should be just about impossible to track her this far but just to be sure she climbed another tree and hid herself carefully amidst its thick foliage she would wait here until the end of the day very quietly she was tired after all that fleeing she took a good grip on the branches and relaxed physically she was too excited and horrified to relax mentally she let her ears be her eyes listening for any untoward sound all too soon it came the clumsy crashing noise of a zombie in a hurry she peered out between the leaves just to be sure yes it was a zombie not xeth but another one somewhat farther gone he was headed in her direction how could he know he wasnt even following her trail what gave her location away breanna decided to find out she knew that the average zombie wasnt phenomenally smart because its brain was rotten how did you know where i am she called wee cah feeel yooor maghic it answered it was not able to speak as well as xeth being farther gone wee are aall loooking you can feel my magic what magic your maghic tzalent breanna waited no more the thing was getting too close she lurched out of her tree dropped to the ground and set off running again now she knew two things they could feel her magic and there pitrs anthony were many zombies out looking for her maybe that wasnt surprising since xeth was a zombie king maybe they cast about aimlessly that wasnt hard for a zombie to dountil one of them happened to come within sensing range of her then he oriented on her magic she saw another zombie ahead of her she dodged to the side but found the way blocked by a fivesided object she recognized it a pentagone anything that touched it would be gone nobody knew where and she didnt want to risk it so she slowed and stepped very carefully around it the zombie behind her was less careful it blundered right into the penta goneand suddenly was gone that was a relief but now breanna had blundered herself into a bog she was in danger of getting her black shoes all gooky so she had to pick her way through it going from hummock to hummock there was a huge fat monster breanna squished to a stop concerned about just how dangerous it might be so she asked it what are you the monster oped its ponderous and mottled mouth and spewed forth an answer i am a hippocnt are you dangerous no i am a harmless friendly lovable cuddly creature but breanna had an intuition that all was not quite right then she made the connection hypocrite one who said one thing but did another she couldnt trust it but maybe she could use it well theres a really tasty morsel of a man following me she said sidling around the creature too bad youre so friendly and harmless because he would have made a nice meal for you she found firmer footing beyond a hummock and was satisfied that she could make a good run for it if she had to too bad the hippo agreed and shifted its bulk to block the passage of the next person passing this way she moved quietly on she was getting tired and hungry but all she saw was some shortening and she knew better than to eat any of that she didnt want to be any shorter than she was she would avoid largening too neither food appealed to her then she spied a variety of pie tree bearing mun danish those were tasteless boring pastries but she was used to them from her own term in mundama so could handle it she picked several and chewed on them as she went where could she go where the zombies could not her mind was zombifc lover blank so breanna just kept running fearing that wherever she stopped a zombie would close in on her what an awful mess she had gotten herself into all because of that inviting bed in the pavilion she was getting hot as well as tired the sun was glaring i knon i was stupid she yelled at it mollifed by her admission the sun eased its glare she came across a small village marked norfolk maybe someone here would help her hey can you block off zombies she called to the nearest man who was digging in a garden he paid no attention irritated breanna ran on to where a woman was washing clothing in a stream can you help me she asked but the woman didnt even glance at her she came to the far edge of the village the sign there said you are now leaving lonorefolk good riddance to you oh that was why they had ignored her she must have misread the first sign a side stitch caught up with her the only way to get nd of one of those was to slow down until it zoomed on ahead for they were speedy things when she slowed breannas mind began to work a bit better she got an idea maybe the zombies couldnt go into the region of madness she could maybe hide there it wasnt far away that was fortunate because she was getting too tired to continue much longer there was a small patch of it north of the gap chasm though its main mass was south that little patch should be plenty but what was the fastest way to it she wasnt sure and didnt have much time but she saw a fully living man walking along so she approached him hi im breanna of the black wave he shook her hand i am ayitym i absorb one property of anything i touch his skin turned dark like hers she wasnt certain whether he would be pleased or annoyed so she didnt mention it im looking for the region of madness i know its close by but i dont want to go anywhere near that he exclaimed it would make me mad he hurried away that wasnt much help but she saw another man so approached him similarly hi im breanna my talent is to see in blackness i am tyler i have a different talent each day piers anthony she was impressed that must be some fun no it isnt because i cant choose them and they are small today i have the talent of growing warts on little toes do you want a wart breannas toes cringed no thanks want to find the region of madness do you right that way he said pointing she changed course and walked swiftly toward the nearest loop of madness she knew its nature because her girlish curiosity had led her to explore some of its fringes it was really weird there and she didnt care to get far into it but maybe it would be worse for the zombies than for her she hoped she spied a man walking the opposite way he looked rather dazed beside him was an old small white dog who seemed less confused the dog paused as they came together looking up at her showing a black left ear and a curled furry tail you look mundane breanna said hi im breanna the man became aware of her im william henry taylor and this is my daughters dog puppy i dont know what im doing here i was just so sick for so longand suddenly everything changed i know how it is breanna said but i guess if puppy found your way out of the madness he knows where youre going so maybe you should keep going that way i suppose so he agreed hope my daughter is all right they went on breanna felt a bit guilty for not trying to help him more but she was afraid the zombies would catch up with her at any time while they wouldnt bother mr taylor she saw a ragged doll but then it moved startling her youre alive not exactly im ricky im a golem oh a doll who has been animated more or less he moved on before she could ask him to verify that she was going the right way to intercept the madness but she was pretty sure she was close the scenery was beginning to think about looking weird and she had been meeting weird people she came to the fringe and plunged in the weirdness closed in and for once she welcomed it let the zombies try to orient on her zomblfc lovfcr magic when it was overridden by the magic ambiance of this section then halfway satisfied that she just might maybe be safe she dropped to the ground and rested she was so tired that she fell almost immediately into a daze why child whatever is the matter breanna looked up there was day mare imbri her friend imbri had once been a night mare but had gotten half a soul and turned too nice to handle the ugly job now she had become a tree nymph and kept nice company with a tree faun she was pure black that was what had first attracted breanna what could be finer than a black mare oh imbri im in trouble imbri formed a dreamlet image of a pretty black young woman in a lovely black gown she always knew how to relate can tell that dear i felt your emotion from afar what trouble i did something ever so stupid breanna wailed i slept in the pavilion of love and a zombie king kissed me now he wants to marry me but didnt you see the sign i came to the bed just before dawn from the other direction i wasnt looking for any sign i had been exploring all night using my talentand now the zombies are orienting on it to find me that gave her an idea say maybe if i got rid of the talent xeth wouldnt be able to find me but you cant do that imbri protested still breanna had hold of a desperate notion i love my talent but i hate being chased by zombies if thats the price of my freedom well maybe its a necessary sacrifice can you take my talent and put it back where you found it for that was how she had come by it breanna had been born mundane and come to the land of xanth with her wave no mundane had magic but the day mare had befriended her and given her the talent she had found and they had been friends ever since all six months so she was the only original black waver to have magic the children who had been delivered since then did have black magic talents but none of them were over six years old imbri shook her head no i cant do that you had better go to the good magician for an answer piers anthom but he charges a years service for an answerand often its so crptic that it doesn t do much good anyway im too young to suffer through that neertheless i think it is our best chance hell probably just tell me to accept my fate he does it will surel be the correct course but im desperate if that zombie catches me hell marry me and make me queen oi the zombiesand im only fifteen its a fate worse than death that was literal for zombies were made from dead people death was bad enough but to be forced to drag about alter death was surely worse and to have to summon the stork with a zombieabsolute ugh shed rather be chewed by a werewolf or sucked by a vampire any day know this is awful imbn said but i cant take our talent bac k why not im originally mundane the magic cant stick to me very closely am not free to explain but the zombies are after me imbn sighed kno dear and it is indeed awful i am not sawng that i don t want to help ou i am saying that i cantand i cant tell ou wh breanna began to cry she was ashamed of herself for doing it but just got overwhelmed imbri was just as sensitive to that as a man would have been to the girls surprise mabe i can compromise breanna brightened you can ill tell ou what cant tell ou m a dreambut then i must take back the dieam so ou will not remember it but how can that help me can explain everything in the dream so ou understand when ou do and agree that ou need to ask the good magician ou will wake from the dream and remembei onh that when ou knew the whole stor ou agreed then ou will be willing to do it and know that i can t help ou though i want to this was almost as weird as the madness but what did she have to lose what if i dont agree she demanded that ould be dangerous zombie lovfr weirder yet breanna knew imbn was her friend and trusted her so there had to be something but whatever could it be okay give me the dream first i will rehearse the sequence as ou experienced it then i will fill in the parts ou did not see okay breanna was really curious now the forest faded to be replaced by a scene from breannas memory there she was walking out from the black village perturbed about the unreasonable restrictions her mundanish parents still put on her here she was just fifteen and still not allowed to date a boy and close the door or to wander out into the distant forest alone they still treated her like a child she wished she could go far away and have some fabulous adventure free from parental restriction maybe even visit the shore and see the sea she had heard of a city there called attle where rude creatures retorted attle be the day to any expression of ambition shed love to tell off those creatures of sea attle shed like to eat a seamint and see whether it really stuck the mouth tight shut she started to get angry why couldnt she go and do these things what right did anybody have to tell her no it made her so blankety mad she realized she was on a special path with another path crossing it ohshe had blundered onto a cross walk no wonder she had gotten so suddenly cross she stepped off it and her temper subsided still she felt that some of her ire was justified it was high time that the black village started spreading out and interacting more with the rest of this magic land which really had so much to offer then she saw the beautiful black horse oh you lovely creature she breathed mare imbrfs head turned you can see mer she asked in a dreamlet of course can see you youre pure black youre the prettiest horse i ever saw may i pat you suppose ij ou want to imbn was plainly taken aback breanna approached she patted the mare on the shoulder i didnt even know there were horses in xanth she said or are you a unicorn with your horn hidden im a well it is complicated piers anthony oh tell me breanna pleaded was a night mare for two hundred years then a day mare and now im a tree nymph but i can assume mv old form when i want and be solid and make some dreams my tree gives me that power i forgot i was solid thats why i thought you couldnt see me breanna was intrigued did you have a night foal not yet but maybe now that im solid it will happen i would settle for whatever could get they talked and soon breanna told imbri all about herself too then they parted but agreed to meet again for they liked each other it seemed that girls and horses were attracted to each other just as strongly in xanth as in mundania a week later mare imbri asked breanna if she would like a magic talent oh yes id love it breanna exclaimed liking this mental game if you could have any talent you wanted what would it be breanna thought for a long timeat least a minute not a big one not a small one one thats me only i dont know me well enough yet what about the ability to conjure any kind of seed i suppose thats okay but im no gardener id rather change the world or perhaps the ability to choose the breed of your future children future children im only fifteen i dont want to even think of having children until im an ancient old woman of twenty five what about transformation of the inanimate i already have enough trouble with living things why should i want to mess with dead things then maybe the power to create a small void that was tempting like the big void only under my control but in half a moment she reconsidered no it would be too dangerous i might forget and sit in it and be halfreared mare imbri considered how about the ability to project a spot on a wall a black spot maybe but spotonthewall talents are a dime a dozen this is a special spot its actually a picture it improves with time getting larger and more detailed until it is a very nice image zombit loyfcr maybe so but its not me hearing from a distance thats not me either then perhaps the ability to conjure a gevser at any spot that was intriguing but a moments thought dampened it still not me what would i do with all that spouting water imbri swished her tail one might almost suspect she was becoming a smidgen impatient what would you consider to be you breanna had worked out her answer to see in blackness that would be ideal think i have found a talent like that i want you to have it breanna laughed but talents dont just lie around waiting for folk to take them you have to be borni mean delivered with them there are many kinds of magic in xanth come with me but dont tell anyone what you see i promise breanna agreed intrigued of course she couldnt get any magic talent but just imagining it was fun you will have to ride me imbri said its some distance breanna was delighted by the prospect okay but though i love horsesespecially black onesim not an experienced rider there will be no problem so breanna climbed onto mare imbris back and the horse took off she galloped somewhat faster than the wind seeming to pass right through trees and the girl was entirely at ease not even close to falling off that was part of the magic of it sometimes they even seemed to be flying through the air still she had a doubt to work through do some talents lie around waiting for folk in a manner for example theres the c tree its seeds do marvelous things if you need a lot of water you can invoke a c big enough to sail a ship on or you could put a c on your eye and c much farther than before or if you are afraid of failure you can put a c seed in our mouth and suckseed i c breanna said i mean i seaer see but thats not the same as a talent because you are using something else the right c might give you the talent of cing better than ever breanna shrugged i suppose so though if i tried to hide one in my bosom it might c too much id rather have an innate talent then suddenly mare imbri stopped they were in a towering cas piers anthony tie as breanna slid to the ground amazed the loveliest woman she had ever seen appeared her hair was long and pleasantly greenish and the rest of her would make a professional model jealous hello breanna she said i am chlorine this is my friend nimby she gestured behind breanna and when breanna turned there was a huge dragon with a silly donkey head breanna started to giggle but managed to stifle it down into half a peep nimby would like to share your dreams chlorine said is that all right with you you mean this dragon will appear m my dreams not exactly he will merely watch well whatever its okay with me my dreams arent much thank you chlorine said then breanna was riding on imbn again back the way they had come she wasnt quite sure how that had happened but dreams did tend to be discontinuous so she wasnt concerned what did concern her was the lateness of the hour she realized that the day had passed without her noticing and darkness was closing ill be late getting home she said ill catch heaven there were times she needed to swear but that could get her into trouble so she substituted words there will be no trouble imbns dreamlet image said look around you breanna lookedand realized that she could see everything she could see in blackness that was the beginning of her wonderful private life she never told anyone else about her visit to the mysterious castle with the beautiful woman and ugly dragon or about her brand new talent the castle scene was probably just a daydream but the talent was delightfully real thats the way it was she agreed as the memory dream ended you or maybe your tnends found the talent for me but why cant i give it back a new dream formed this was of imbn grazing by a clog tree near it was a sandalwood tree where a faun danced and played pan pipes then imbn changed to nymph form and went to tousle the tauns hair and he patted her pert bare bottom obviously the two got along well zombie lotr a dragon appearedthe one with the silly donkey head on its back was the fair chlorine they stopped before the faun and nymph nimby wants to dream chlonne said dragons can dream imbri replied but demons dont demons the faun asked yes forrest will you keep a secret forrest and imbri glanced at each other think e had better imbri said nimby is really the demon x lh both faun and nymph laughed thinking this a joke then the dragon transformed into a huge glowing demon figure and the scene turned inside out after a moment the scene returned to normal with the dragon back there was no further laughter you are the expert on dreams imbri chlorine said can you teach nimby to dream by himself without having to view it as done by mortals imbn was plainly awed dont know no demon has eei dreamed the dont have the mortal coil for it the dont know what living emotions are so theres nothing for dream to fi on living emotions chlonne said thoughtfully like love yes that especially demons think loe is silh of course nimby she framed the word with a peculiar emphasis now that she knew what it signified nimb is not just am demon so possibl nimby loves he learned it from mundanes among others oh then mabe he should start lo learn dreaming fiom mundanes too they are less complicated than magical creatures if he could follow the dreams of one perhaps a oung one he might be able to pick up the essence i cant deh er a dream to one who doesn know how to do it its like loe ou cant accomplish it until ou learn how imbri glanced at forrest faun and a little heart flew across to bop him on the nose he smiled the mundane family we know returned to mundama chlonne said fresh mundanes are hard to come by know one imbri said she has been m xanth almost half her life but she remembers mundama bring her here piers anthony but is it wise to let a mundane know nimbys true nature it isnt wise to let anyone know nimbys true nature chlorine said firmly we have told you only because we need your informed help make her a deal forrest faun suggested give her what she most wants if she will share her dreams with you what would she want chlorine asked what would any mundane want the faun asked rhetorically a magic talent of course dont tell her who nimby is just make the deal chlorine looked at nimby who wiggled a long ear she returned to imbri bring her to the nameless castle imbri resumed mare form and galloped swiftly away chlorine mounted nimby and both vanished forrest waved at the space where they had been and retired to his sandalwood tree the scene faded breanna was back in her regular daydream facing mare imbri now you know how you came by your talent the demon gave it to you in exchange for sharing your dreams but i havent seen that dragon in any dream breanna protested he merely watches without interfering if he disturbed your dreams they would no longer be innocent it has been effective he is slowly learning how to dream on his own but it would be impolitic to renounce the deal now well he can keep sharing if thats what he wants breanna said though she felt more than a smidgen queasy about having such a creature there some of her dreams were rather personal just take back the talent demons dont work that way he would not feel free if he voided the talent in anv event its not smart to jostle any demon and especially not this one he has more power than all of xanth put together in fact the whole of the magic of xanth is merely the incidental leakage from his body in much the way heat leaks from mortal bodies it is best to stay entirely out of his notice if at all possible like a flea on a dragon chlorine interprets for him so that the mere power of his attention does not obliterate much of the surrounding landscape so it is best by far to let things be as they arefor all of us but he is already noticing me if he is sharing my dreams zombif lovfr breanna said and now that i know his nature how can i avoid noticing him precisely that is why you must not know your dreams must continue as they have been he observes them with onl a fraction of his attention and that wont change if ou dont change now breanna understood guess youre right cant give my talent back so id better just go see the good magician yes he always does deliver and the deals folk make with him are always worth it even if they dont think so at the time breanna sighed okay i agree take back the dream she came out of her reverie she knew that she had just had a phenomenal dream and learned something that shook the very foundation of xanth but she couldnt remember what it was only that now she knew that it made sense to keep her talent and go to see the good magician humfrey for some other solution to her problem with the zombie king she had agreed to relinquish the dream she remembered that much sleep here mare imbris dreamlet image said will keep watch for the zombies and advise you if they come but dont you have to go home to forrest faun ill bet you had to censor that dream with him in it to avoid violating the adult conspiracy of course but i can remain with vou for a while forrest understands and so does my tree when night comes you can go to the good magicians castle you will be able to avoid the zombies because you can see better in blackness than they can i would carry you there myself but its too far from my tree i have substance only within a certain range of my tree for it is what provides that for me but i will help guide you and warn you in my soulmare form and you will get there safely thank you breanna said she felt better about the prospect though she didnt know why then she lay down and slept we three kings o h youre going to get it the floor said queen irene is looking for you then maybe she had better find me king dor replied unperturbed he was used to being addressed impertinently by various things because that was his magic talent to talk to the inanimate and have it answer such things tended not to be very smart but they were observant where is she do i look like the book of answers the nearest wall demanded flatly how should i know dor rephrased the question when did you last see her ten minutes ago the inanimate did have to give a straight answer if it had it when he asked directly what direction was she going toward the library he went to the castle library queen irene was just watering the flame vine she had growing there to make light for reading it was curled in a rising spiral with hot little leaves and the flower on the end was a ball of roselike petals of red flame unfortunately it hated water so tried to burn anyone who watered it irene was the only one who could do it and it wasnt always easy the plant wasnt smart enough to realize that its roots needed water if it was to survive need any help dear dor inquired his wifes talent was growing plants and she could make anything grow to any size in a hurry but that did not necessarily make the plants tractable irene turned to glance at him she had been a luscious young zombifc loer woman but now she was safely middle aged and rather beyond lusciousness it would not be politic to mention that however yes can you distract it a moment dor focused on the clock sitting on the far side of the vine is that a time fly flying toward you he asked it a time fly it cried alarmed it was an alarm clock that got alarmed by the silliest things dont let it near me it will foul up my mechanism i think the fish tank just got it the shelf said the fish tank in the neighboring aquarium swung its turret around searching for the fly it rolled forward on its treads but no fly was to be found it fired off a watery shell annoyed maybe its a sapphire fly the aquarium said the flame vines flower whipped around because those bright little flies were its kind they set fire to the sap of plants which made them unpopular with most other types during the flame vines distraction irene whipped the spout of her watering can in and delivered a good dollop to its soil then she drew her hand away before the flame could return to burn her thanks she said oh she got you good flamebrain the pot said dont you ever learn the flame vine took aim and scorched it but the pot only laughed i was fired long ago tenderroot thats why i sought work here you cant hurt me oh stop all this quarreling irene snapped who says the pot demanded metallically i say or ill use the hair spray on you you wouldnt dare irene brought out a bottle and pressed the top a jet of hair shot out and formed a cloud around the pot soon it got worse the hair formed into choking tangles oh ugh it exclaimed coughing what a hairy mess dor smiled it was never wise to call his wifes bluff she did not like back talk irene brought out a hare comb after this perhaps you will behave she said as the hare tackled the worst of the tangles clearing the pots surface yes the pot agreed chastened piers anthony irene moved on to the miniature hackberry tree it bore small axeshaped berries that waved about trying to hack things her watering can had many little dents from prior times dor looked in the aquarium it was a fish bowl and inside it pin and needle fish stood on their tails waiting to be bowled over the floor tile irene stood on spoke up oh guess what im seeing it chortled feet ankles calves irene lifted a foot and stomped on it warningly and it shut up she knew how to handle the inanimate i understand you are looking for me dor said was it for a kiss that too she agreed kissing him ooooo the ceiling exclaimed look what she didand at her age too irene shot half a glance at the ceiling and it went silent she didnt like discussion of age we have news that the zombies are all stirred up mr e brought it to our attention mr e was a man who loved enigmas in fact he could sniff them out from afar he never solved them he merely called them to the attention of others who were likely to be willing to undertake that chore zombies he asked intrigued people are getting annoyed do you think we should check into it dor considered this was her way of saying that the matter needed immediate attention he was bored with the dull palace routine anyway i will see to it immediately you can keep an eye on the kingdom for an hour or a year zombies arent necessarily nice creatures she said except for zora i wonder how shes doing shes rotting the nearest table suggested dor ignored it i think she had a son some time ago but youre right most zombies are a bit ugly maybe i should take dolph along for quick transportation their son dolphs talent was changing into any other living creature when he became a roc bird he could carry others swiftly and far maybe your father too she suggested he and chameleon just got youthened and i think hes still getting used to it dor remembered his mother chameleon varied with the phases of zombit lovfr the moon becoming beautiful and stupid or smart and ugly she had been rejuvenated too but was currently in her ugly phase and not much company for anyone yes it will do him good to get out for an afternoon irene waited as if he had said something stupid usually when she did that she had reason so he pondered the nearest book helped him you must be missing something really obvious it said maybe you should read a good book suddenly it came to him theyve been what youthened she said with half a smile or slightly more instead of being eighty one now hes twenty one physically and chameleon is a child of sixteen he was stunned why i thought they were getting ready to fade out nobody knows there were two doses of youth elixir in the package the good magician sent to jenny elf this morning and they were marked for them so now they are both young again younger than their grandchildren the good magician always has a reason dor said but he never gives away anything free do they have some arduous service to perform for him surely so but no one has been told jenny elf has a huge chore to do with instructions maybe you should ask her which was her way of saying that she wanted very much to know but didnt deign to inquire directly i will he agreed right after i locate bink and dolph well check with jenny and then go out and check with the zombies irene nodded and continued watering her plants dor went out looking for his son prince dolph first dolph remained slightly awkward at age twenty four despite having been married to princess electra for nine years and having two bright daughters delivered his magic was first rate however and he was of amiable disposition still it seemed better that his more savvy older sister ivy become the next king of xanth when the time came dor hadnt said anything about that yet but eventually he would have to the inanimate things and surfaces around him directed him to the kitchen where dolph and electra were showing their daughters dawn and eve how to make punwheel cookies the children were six going piers anthony rapidly on seven and already seemed to have the hang of handling the required puns and wheels electra was or twenty seven depending on whether reckoned by date of delivery or amount of active living she had taken a long nap in the middle of her life the twins were cute in proportion to their mischief which was considerable electra was clean in blue jeans but dolph and the girls were covered with punwheel dough it was clear where the competence lay in that family the zombies are roaming xanth dor said to dolph i thought you and and your grandpa bink could go out and find out whats agitating them dolph looked at electra go ahead she said i think we girls can handle the rest of this by ourselves she glanced sidelong at him but perhaps you should wash and change you wouldnt want to make a bad impression on the zombies both girls giggled they were similar in a family sense but differed in detail dawn was redhaired greeneyed wore bright clothing was normally bright and her talent was to tell anything about anything living eve was blackhaired and eyed wore dark clothing was more somber and could tell anything about anything inanimate dor wasnt sure which of them would relate better to a zombie because it wasnt quite clear which category zombies fit into til do that dolph agreed he left the kitchen well meet you at jenny elfs room dor called after him then to electra tin glad he married you electra blushed and the girls giggled again well understanding her natural modesty electra had never aspired to be a princess but had loved dolph from their first magical meeting her innocent ways still clung to her on occasion dor went in search of his father bink was an oddity in xanth because everyone knew he had magiciancaliber magic but few knew what it was when there was something especially tricky or dangerous to accomplish bink was usually the one to tackle it and often accomplished it by a series of weird coincidences apart from that he was as amiable as his grandson which made him easy to get along with bink and chameleon were in a guest room having evidently come to castle roogna for the youth potions maybe they knew why they had been selected dor knocked on the door zombie lover its king dor the door called to the folk inside come in dor binks voice called dor opened the door and stepped in and stood amazed before him stood a lad of twenty one and a girl of sixteen the lad was handsome and muscular the girl was ugly both were in illfitting clothing indeed the girl was in the process of pinning the boys trousers so they would fit better i think this is the wrong room dor said embarrassed no it isnt son the woman said in chameleons voice dont stand there with your mouth agape close the door behind you it really was true these were his parents youthened by sixty years chameleon said we each took the same dosage we have no idea why the good magician sent the elixir but concluded that he must have good reason he has not made any requirement of us as yet but he surely will in due course bink added i must say that apart from the awkwardness of illfitting clothing it feels rather good to be young again theres a certain vigor i had forgotten why did you come dor chameleon asked she tended to be abrupt in her smartugly phase having little patience with the slower intellects of others she was more popular when in her lovelystupid phase i came to ask bink if he would like to go out with me and dolph to question the zombies who are stirred up i thought a three generation excursion might be fun good idea ghameleon said go ahead bink youre not much help around here ill fix your other clothes and mine in the interim she paused including a showy dress for my other phase bink nodded appreciatively chameleon had been generally acknowledged to be the loveliest woman in xanth when young and in phase and even in age she was elegant now she was young again dor found it awkward thinking of his parents having romantic interests but realized it was possible his mothers combination of traits at the far endextreme beauty and extreme stupiditymade her a very fine romantic prospect the extremes would be much sharper now that she was a teenager well soon they would return to the north village and he could put that awkward aspect out of his mind chameleon worked swiftly with needle and thread and binks trousers assumed a better fit lets go he said with the seeming aban piers anthony don of his youth he tended to grow more interested in traveling away from the home when chameleon was in her smart phase but of course it would not be kind to speculate why first we must check with jenny elf dor said as they walked down the hall maybe she has the answers to several questions good idea the youth agreed it was just about impossible to think of him as an aging father dolph appeared in newer and cleaner clothing im ready dad he said whos your friend your granddad bmk said my what this is bmk dor explained understanding his sons confusion he has been youthened to twenty one but thats younger than i am dolph protested physically bmk said smiling you do sound like him but why we hope that jenny will know bmk said she was the one who got the package with the potions maybe the other papers in it will say jenny elf was in an office chamber on the mam floor laboring at a desk on her left was a huge pile of envelopes and on her right a small pile of addressed envelopes before her on the desk was her cat sammy she looked up wearily as they approached she was a small girl with pointed ears freckles big spectacles and fourfingered hands she had come to xanth by accident at the age of twelve when some kind of hole had appeared in the fabric of whatever and been stuck here since it had been nine years because it happened just before dolph and electra married thats a big pile of papers dolph said sympathetically can i help you with any of them that was one thing about his son dor realized his sympathetic nature if anyone had a problem dolph always wanted to help out he and jenny had been friends since they met i wish you could dolph jenny said but the instructions say that all of the invitations must be written in the same hand and that s mine they all have to be done in two days too so i must keep at it she shook her nght hand and little sprigs of tiredness flew out from it zombie loer invitations bmk asked jenny glanced at him startled why youre bmk she said t didnt recognize you chameleon and i took the potions as soon as we got to our room bmk said they worked so i see she concentrated and recovered the question yes these are wedding invitations wedding dor asked surprised again who is the groom the note says he is no one we know but he is a prince or king who will marry a common girl and make her a princess or queen it is scheduled to happen here at castle roogna in just one week so everything must be ready by then and the invitations have to go out in time to bring all the participants who is invited bmk asked everyone i think of course i havent looked at all the names on the list yet she indicated a long scroll some of them have assignments too assignments dor asked matron of honorthings like that thats electra are any of us on that hsf dolph asked i dont know then sammy cat moved his paw it landed on one section of the list oh thank you sammy jenny said her cats talent was to find anythingexcept home that was part of the reason jenny was stuck here in xanth sammy had led her here but couldnt lead her back jenny checked the list where the paw was yes here it is king dor is to be in loco father of the bride but my daughter ivys already married he protested in loco bmk reminded him that means instead of maybe her real father cant do it so you will fill in oh it was obvious in retrospect jenny read farther bmk is to be best man but i dont even know the groom bmk said and dolph is an usher head usher okay dolph agreed i guess i can handle that what about you jenny dor asked since youre doing all this work pifcrs anthony the girls eyes widened m surprise i didnt think to look sammy the cat lifted a pawand set it down again off the list but you can find anything jenny reminded him dor caught on unpleasantly not if its not there i fear you arent invited jenny not invited dolph said angrily she has to do this mountain of work wearing out her poor little handand shes not even invited its all right jenny said quickly my birthday is on the same day sammy and i will have a chance to celebrate by ourselves a glance bounced back and forth between the three men its not fair dolph said shes not a slave she should at least be invited maybe theres a mistake dor said we can ask the good magician no please dont bother him jenny said really dont mind helping im sure it will be a very nice wedding another glance bounced around between them then the desk spoke it had better be dolph still wasnt satisfied jenny i dont need to be an usher for somebody i dont even know ill join you for your birthday instead weve been friends for a long time he stroked sammy which was proof of what he said because the cat did not accept the touch of just anybody the girl was plainly touched she blinked back a tear thats very nice of you dolph its true that you and electra have been very kind to me but its not right to go against something the good magician has set up there is surely excellent reason for you to be head usher sammy and i will be just fine shes right son dor said and you dont have to choose one or the other the wedding wont take all day its at three in the afternoon jenny said then lets have your birthday in the morning dolph said i know electra will want to be there too and che centaur of course and gwenny goblin they were jennys closest friends though gwendolyn was now queen of goblin mountain making the goblins behave che was tutor for sim the simurghs chick who would some millennium inherit the position of wisest bird in the universe zombif lover if che came so might sim and that would go far toward making the occasion significant every winged monster in xanth was pledged to protect che and every living thing was pledged to help sim and his guardian nanny roxanne roc che centaur was destined to change the history of xanth by influencing sim and no one could be sure what events they attended might thus become truly significant so will irene and i dor said sharing his sons disquiet about the way the girl was being snubbed he didnt care who else attended he would be there regardless and chameleon and i bink said jenny had to blink back several more tears she removed her glasses and dabbed at her eyes with a hankie thank you that would be nice but i had better get back to work on these invitations so as to finish them in time they needed to leave before jennys tears overflowed and fell on the invitations next week dor said firmly guiding his son and young father to the door it still bothers me dolph muttered as they walked down the hall how complicated would it have been to add her name to the hst the good magician couldnt have lorgotten her because hes making her do the handwriting chore hes a century old bink reminded them and not known tor manners maybe he figured that doing the invitations was enough of a privilege for her dolph snorted dor remembered something didnt jenny get a genetic to fix her eyes so she wouldnt need those spectacles dolph smiled yes but she has worn those spectacles so long that she forgets to take them olf they walked on out of the front gate there in the moat was souffle serpent dor glanced at him m surprise i thought you were on duty at the good magicians castle he remarked the moat monster hissed the surface of the water translated who do you think brought the old gnomes package to jenny elf well when you return dolph said hotly tell him we dont like the way he snubbed jenny elf after dont do that dor said quickly i m sure it was just an oversight piers anthom souffle hissed again his designated wife made the guest list and assignments mareann except tor jenny to do the invitations that was clio the muse of history who decided that mareann was humfreys first love who couldnt marry him until last let she lose the ability to summon unicorns bink said she knows how it feels to be left out she shouldnt have left jenny out omissions happen dor said we will do what we can for jenny now lets focus on our mission the zombies we need a name tor our group dolph said dor hadnt seen the necessity but humored him we three kings but im not a king bink protested youre the father of a king and dolph is the son of a king dor said thats close enough bink shrugged it will be nice to be a king for a few hours even if in name only ill change into a roc bird and carry you up high so we can spy the zombies dolph said dont drop us dor said smiling he knew his son would be careful dolph walked out beyond the moat so as to have room and suddenly he was a monstrous bird squawk he called he says to get your sorry donkeys over there a nearby rock translated helpfully and dont soil his feet we suspected it was something like that bink murmured the inanimate sometimes overstated the case not having much judgment each ot them took hold of one of dolph s huge legs and sat on his feet dolph took two steps pumped his enormous wings and launched into the air soon they were spirahng into the sky making castle roogna look small dor had seldom flown so was intrigued by the patchwork of xanth that spread out below them he recognized the good magicians castle to the east and the gap chasm to the north and the isle ot view to the west much of the rest was forest and mountain and lake as it should be theres one bink called pointing slightly south dor realized that he was doing what he was supposed to watching for zombies instead ot getting distracted by the scenery zombie loxtr the roc headed down and soon landed in a glade near the slogging creature the two of them dismounted from the teet and then dolph reappeared but by the time they landed the zombie had disappeared however there was a female centaur practicing her archery so they approached her hello dor said we three kings are looking for a zombie she glanced at them hello i am cmdy centaur a zombie passed this way two moments and an instant ago bearing north thank you you are welcome she loosed her arrow and it neatly severed the stem of high root beer mug the roots cushioned its fall so that it did not break or spill and she was able to pick it up and drink from it no one can shoot an arrow as well as a centaur bink remarked as they walked north the zombie was typical of its breed which was to say loathsome it had evidently once been a human man but it must have rested in a grave with some ambitious worms for some time because now halt its face had rotted away and its clothing was in a similar mess it shambled along leaving decaying chunks of itself behind most zom bies did that it wasnt clear why they didnt soon degenerate into nothing probably their substance was magically regenerated at the same rate it sloughed off so they were in a steady state dor tackled the ugly business excuse me zombie he said stepping as close to the thing as he cared to zzure the zombie agreed why are you and your kind walking around xanth r the thing considered it took zombies time to think because their brains were rotten xxeth it said after a decomposing pause can you elaborate bink asked nnooo it shambled on as if searching tor something dor shrugged i think we need to find a fresher one dolph changed form and they got aboard his teet they flew across xanth until they spied another likely figure three figures in fact suitable tattered they came down for a landing on the beach on the southern shore of xanth they walked toward the place where the figures stood pitrs anthony but what they had taken to be tatters of clothing and odd bits of flesh turned out to be three women with veils and ruffles the first woman spied them ah you are the men who have come to marry us she exclaimed we are dolph asked perplexed arent you she asked coming up to embrace him i am miss conception do you wish to kiss me before or after the wedding but im already married dolph protested the second woman approached bink yes he is eager to be married she said and i hope you are too even if you do seem a bit young for me i am miss interpret im eighty one bink said now i know i misheard that you can t be over twenty one something is not right about this the third woman said approaching dor is there something wrong with you too i am miss givings im afraid there is dor said we are looking for zombies your taste in women is weird i mean that we wish to question zombies we thought you were that is that you looked like he realized that they might not take kindly to the comparison like girls ready to marry miss conception said of course and you are right lets do it right now and summon lots of storks wow her veil said that should be fun we are all married dolph said desperately yes you all want to get married miss interpret agreed staring blissfully into sinks young eyes its so nice that we are in agreement im sure you will mature in due course in a pork s eye d tassel said but you do look a bit old miss givings said to dor he certainly does the ground said any day now hell start to totter and dodder this is all a misunderstanding dor said hrmly we three kings are merely trying to find out why the zombies are stirred up you are kings miss interpret asked delighted what a great marriage this will be we can visit castle zombie on our honeymoon miss conception said the zombie master should know zombie lover the zombie master bink exclaimed why didnt we think of that because your hearts were set on marriage miss interpret said reasonably but as soon as the ceremony is done we can set out for there we want you to be happy i dont think so miss givings said regretfully i fear we are confusing things these men mistook us for zombies mistook us for zombies miss conception exclaimed does a zombie have this she lifted her tasseled blouse and showed her bare but healthy upper torso wow a nearby stone said she must have nymphly ancestry i havent seen boobies like that since that flock of dodos waddled by thats boobs you boob another stone said you got rocks in your head whatever the first said stonily meanwhile dolph stared he was still young enough to really appreciate such a sight maybe not as full or firm for a zombie he said his eyeballs were beginning to glaze i should hope not how about this she tugged at her skin dor knew he should do something but his own eyeballs were locked and he knew that bmks were too it wasnt possible for a man to look away from such a sight voluntarily the effect was similar to that of the hypnogourd and if she showed her panties this is really getting interesting a piece of deadwood said what does she have under there then a bug happened to fiy by just at eyeball height interrupting dors view he clamped his eyes closed and turned his head away so as not to get caught again thats fine dor said quickly before she could freak anyone out and have her will of him he stepped between bink and the sight freeing him then he did the same for dolph and took the young man by the shoulders turning him around no zombie can match any of you im sure he said over his own shoulder we are sorry we cant marry you but we must be on our way we have pressing business elsewhere i knew there was a catch miss givings said there always is piers anthony yes they are surely a great catch miss interpret agreed but you havent seen what else miss conception cried you cant conceive what were looking were looking several stones said dor bustled dolph away dont look back he warned you have no business being amazed by anything not offered by your wife oh yes dolph agreed remembering now take us to castle zombie dolph changed to roc form and in a moment they were up up and away winging toward the zombie masters edifice squawk dolph remarked sadly glancing down at the three forlorn figures below yes i know dor agreed but we were really not eligible im sure they will find three other men in due course and make them very comfortable after their glazed eyeballs heal wonder if their dialogue is entirely innocent bink asked it is almost as if miss conception acted only when their words were not enough she may indeed have had a concept dor agreed as it was only an unlikely coincidence enabled us to escape as he spoke he realized that it had been exactly the kind of coincidence that happened around his father could there be a connection he wasnt sure in fact the frustrating thing about his father was that he had never been able to be sure now castle zombie hove into view it was rather battered and worn looking as if chunks of corroded blocks were falling off the moat was a puddle of slime this could not be from inattention because a zombie gardener was working there he was carefully raking more dirt into the water to be sure it was properly foul they landed just beyond the decrepit drawbridge dor hesitated to cross it lest the wormeaten planks give way and dump him into the muck below bink considered i suspect that magic makes this look worse than it is he remarked no doubt dor agreed maybe some illusion or some debilitating spells either way i wouldnt care to chance it without testing it zombie lover ill test it bink with the carelessness of his new youth went right ahead and crossed without trouble so dor and dolph followed now assured that the planks would hold but dor made a mental note he would have to watch to make sure his father didnt do something more foolish than risking a mere dunking in slime youth had its liabilities they came to the inner portcullis which was badly rusted a zombie guard challenged them with a corroded spear halsh hey who you talking to wormface a paving stone demanded we three kings have come to speak with the zombie master dor said heesh nough inn dor was getting the hang of zombie speech hes not in then may we talk with millie the ghost actually she hadnt been a ghost for fifty five yearsthe same as dors age coincidentallybut for about years she had been a ghost so her friends still thought of her that way ghoo onn inn thank you they walked on into the castle proper the interior was a good deal nicer than the exterior because this was millies domain and she was no zombie the floors were clean and there were curtains on the portals even the air was fresher castle zombie showed the fallacy of judging a thing by its exterior it was actually a nice residence get a load of this a stone lintel remarked appreciatively a woman was approaching them oh hello millie exclaimed how nice to see you again king dor and prince dolph and she paused bink bink said oh youve been youthened she exclaimed delighted chameleon too chameleon too bink agreed she will be lovely in about two weeks come in and have some tee and crumples millie said ever the gracious hostess she was now in her early seventies in terms of active living time and in her eight hundreds chronologically like electra she had taken a number of centuries out remaining her thenage of seventeen she was still a lovely woman her talent was sex pifrs anthony appeal and age had masked but not abolished it dor remembered how she had been his babysitter when he was twelve and how her beauty and talent had affected him then he was still a little bit in love with her but he had it well under control her present physical age helped her tee and crumples were delicious of course the tee was in cups shaped like the letter t and the crumples were twisted and crunched bits of pastry that looked like failed efforts but werent they were appropriate for a place in which zombies thronged and to what do i owe the honor of this visit she inquired actually we came to see your husband dor said but perhaps you can help us jonathan is away right now what is your need we wish to know why the zombies are stirred up and walking all over xanth oh are they i didnt realize i havent been out recently because we dont like to leave the castle unattended what are they doing just walking everywhere they dont seem to be doing any harm but ordinary folk are bothered you understand she smiled and dor felt the lure of her again what a creature she had been in her physical twenties when he was in his impressionable childhood i understand i do love jonathan but somehow i never quite became accustomed to his business of making zombies of course its not the zombies fault that they are rotten some of my best friend are zombies but they do lack social grace that was a substantial understatement yes we would like to ascertain what is rousing them so as perhaps to put it to rest quickly dolph said of course millie agreed but i really cant think what the matter might be the zombies have been doing well recently they even elected a king from their own number so as to form their own kingdom he is xethzora and xaviers son xeth dolph exclaimed thats what that zombie was trying to say he is a fine figure of a man now you would hardly know he is part zombie but hes a responsible person he would not try to stir things up in the living world not without considerable reason zombie lover a zombie king dor said thoughtfully he could stir them up if he did have reason perhaps we should talk with him i dont know where he is jonathan knows where all the zombies are thats part of his talent but he is away in a manner of speaking and i dont know how soon he will be back we have an important wedding to attend to in a week dor said we really need to get this straightened out soon oh i see women related well to weddings but it would be very difficult to find jonathan right now exactly where is he bink asked thats complicated to explain we will try our best to understand dor said firmly i will try then of course you know about princess idas moon ptero dor said last year we learned that it is more sophisticated than we supposed it is actually the manifestation of her talent of the idea all the folk who ever lived on xanth or ever will live or ever might exist are there in their soul forms dor was startled all the folk but what about those of us who are here now you are there too only with the current year of your lives absent there and time is different there time is geography but thats only part of it there is an aspect of ida herself there and she has her own moon and on that moon is another ida with please dor said my comprehension is being strained what has this to do with your husband each little moon is different she explained with different magic jonathan thought there might even be a zombie world if so i see that would be the perfect place for the zombies to be especially if they had a kingdom their own world exactly so jonathan is exploring to see if he can find such a world he does what he can for his flock maybe the zombies are looking for it too in regular xanth bink suggested no i dont think so they were supposed to wait how long will it be before the zombie master returns dor asked piers axthoni i dont know he said to wake him up if he is gone more than three days and its only been one day all three of them did a quick reassessment he is sleepwalking bink asked no just sleeping in our bedroom check on him often just in case but then how can he be exploring worlds he made an arrangement with princess ida and the night stallion to explore them in the dream realm she explained its more convenient that way and safer because he cant truly be lost or hurt and he can search more efficiently dor was having trouble with comprehension again but if hes only dreaming it isnt real so whatever he finds wont actually be there oh no its real hes not real while there but the worlds are exactly as they are i think it is a controlled dream relating to reality he just wont be able to take anything from there except information hes like a ghost dolph said you must have thought of that why yes i did she agreed i have had experience he seems real while there and can talk with the people but cant stay if he gets chomped by a dragon hell be gone though and will wake on his own and maybe unable to return so im sure hes being very careful i understand that there are remarkable sights there there are some here in xanth too dolph murmured rubbing a bit of glaze off an eyelash i dont think we can wait two days dor said we need to get the zombies settled well before the big wedding could you wake him early oh i wouldnt do that millie said horrified he said not to disturb him for anything short of an emergency because he might not be able to find his way back to a choice site if he doesnt have time to mark the way mark the way bink asked how can a dream be marked its part of the magic the night stallion lent him he can draw a glowing chalk line around something that will stay in place after he leaves so he can return later and make sure its what the zombies want but he can mark only one place at a time so he has to be careful zombit lover could we go after him dolph asked so we can find him and ask him without interrupting his search why i hadnt thought of that millie said i suppose if you sniffed the sleep spell you could this weird as it was seemed to be a way is there enough of that spell for all three of us oh yes we have plenty of it but how would we find him in that dream realm dor asked oh that wouldnt be hard he leaves glowing footprints thats so i can find him if i need to then why couldnt he follow his own footprints on another visit dolph asked they wont stay after he goes so he has to remember the way and mark his place then perhaps that is our best course dor said we can find him ask him and return in time to get the zombies settled millie had no problem with that you can use a guest chamber she said i will bake more crumples for your return that seemed like an excellent arrangement solitaire for two b reana woke at dusk refreshed it was time to go see the jood magician since she was now satisfied for no sason she knew that this was her only feasible escape from the zonbies so she quickly ate some hasty pudding she found and set her ace toward the darkest east there is an enhanted path leading to magician humfreys castle mare imbri aid but the zombies seem to be able to walk those paths so thds not safe for you however i know of another path that is privauy enchanted that should do about as well whats a privae enchantment one thats noiqfficially sanctioned by king dor this one was set up by com pasion and is this a dragoi or tangle tree oh no nothir like that com passion wont hurt you in fact forrest faun and i are her friends we visit her sometimes to playdreams vs realitie but you wont have to enter her cave just keep on going toward tie castle you should be there by dawn okay breana started walking imbri trotted almg beside her its right this way beyond the jackpot there breanna saw a nan sitting on a big glowing pot she paused i know the centaursire open about natural functions and maybe some other folk are toobut id prefer to wait until he gets off the pot imbri made a laghing neigh hes not having a function hes zombie lover giving away money everyone who passes him has to take some to get on the path sure enough as they approached jack reached down under himself into the depth of the pot and pulled out a handful of grubby coins imbri took one in her mouth and breanna took another in her hand but whats the point she asked as they stepped onto the path jackpots just like to give away lots of money imbri still held the coin she wasnt speaking with her mouth but with a dreamlet i can see that i mean whats the money for no one buys anything in xanth does she imbri considered well you might encounter a slot machine some time they eat coins breanna nodded and put the soiled coin in her purse she didnt like dirty money but perhaps it would be useful sometime imbris ears perked up oops im being summoned i have to go see about a daydream i still do a few of them for my friends you did some good ones for me i think breanna agreed thanks for everything she waved as the mare faded out the path was clear enough and breanna walked swiftly along it soon she came to a sign marking an offshoot com passion that was the maker of the path who evidently lived in a cave but it wasnt necessary to go into the cave so she walked on by but then she saw a ragged shape ahead it was a zombie they had found her again breanna hardly took time to think she turned about and ran back along the path but soon she saw another zombie coming from the other direction she was trapped between them she turned at the sign and ran into the cave at least it wasnt supposed to be dangerous and maybe it would provide a place to hide from the zombies it was dark but of course that was no problem for her she saw several jars of currant jelly and realized that there must be something electrical nearby she saw a box of some sort on a pedestal of some sort a screen on the box lighted words appeared cffle aw what was this there didnt seem to be any danger but she didnt feel exactly at ease either this cave was spooky but with the zombies outside she would have to bear with it that meant dealing with this com passion character im looking for piers anthom fea the screen printed uram fxa me a breanna suffered a flash of lealization that illuminated the cave tor half a split second this was com passion herself a screen machine and she expected a little gift it would be best to oblige her but what did she hae only one thing she could spare its ery small and somewhat dirty she said apologetically she fished out the com fjfy fdffjfd јtu i ad ategi j ere i there followed a row ot little hearts v ґ ґ v v v breanna looked toi a place to set the coin fa c tf te aw xrtwje com passion printed breanna looked around nervously there was a mouse in this cave then the cave shimmered and became a regular room a door opened and a young brown woman walked in i am mouse tenan she said i normally sleep in my mouse pad oh breanna handed her the coin tenan took it and set it on a shelt then she turned again what is it that you wish of my mis tress i i dont understand tenan frowned what word do you not understand its not that i mean i didnt come here to ask for anything i just well it gets complicated to explain you do not understand our natures yes i think thats what i dont understand this is the cae of com passion a machine who ean change reality in her demesnes oh i hope shes not mean breanna blurted then she tried to take it back t mean the screen appeared jvr meffj rs femra fm vtej jffa frwtfrfw breanna felt een more stupid than before i apologize i am her mouse tenan continued com passion loves people but cant move her body so i do what needs to be done in real life i am like this she shimmered and became a real brown mouse it squeaked eeeek breanna screamed stepping back the woman reappeared precisely so com passion enhances me to resemble your toim normally folk come here to ask some tavor of my mistress tor which they must pay an equitable price therefore zombil lovfr we inquire what favor you desire and what you are prepared to do in return ii breanna hauled herself somewhat together and tned again tm on my way to see the good magician who can maybe tell me how to stop the zombies from chasing me when they were about to catch me i ducked in here unless you have some way to get rid of them i dont think i have a favor to ask of you my mistress can give you a charm to make you invisible to zombies but it lasts only a tew hours so is a temporary expedient probably it would suffice to get you to the good magicians castle thats great breanna exclaimed yes i would like that then she remembered the other part of it but i dont know how i can pay for it tenan considered a love spnng flows through my mistress cave therefore she is very affectionate and craves company i have become overly familiar to her and my intellect is not great so she wishes for more she is lonely and bored have you any relief for that but i cant stay forever and talk to a screen breanna protested in my mistress experience most human beings have areas of expertise or knowledge that can be diverting is there anything you might teach com passion that would make her less bored or lonely not unless she likes playing cards breanna said laughing ruefully cards a notion coalesced cards could be really useful for boredom so maybe that wasnt such a far out idea suppose i taught her some card games ones she could play by herself like solitaire can you demonstrate such a game sure then she reconsidered except i dont have a deck of cards they dont play cards in xanth its a mundane game describe them well there are fifty two of them in a pack in four suits spades hearts diamonds and clubs each suit has thirteen cards going from acethats oneto king on the backs there is some design or picture as she spoke the image of the cards appeared breanna tned to take one but her hand passed through it it was illusion so she asked pn rs anthony terian to lay them down on a table which obligingly appeared terian was able to handle the cards as if they were real because terian herself was mostly illusion in this form probably com passion could make her solid but illusion was more energy efficient soon they had a pack of cards on the table with a picture of com passion on the back and the suit designs on the front shovels little beating hearts scintillating diamond gems and cudgels mare imbri evidently served as the model for the queens and a faun breanna didnt recognize stood for the kings while the jacks had black faces and looked like breanna they were ready to play i know only three solitaire games breanna said but theyre pretty good first theres klondike deal out seven cards in a row with only the first one face up terian did so then six more starting with the second row only the first face up and so on until there are seven faceup cards now you try to find aces and set them above and build on them by suit right up to the king you can build down from any card in the tableau like putting that red four on that black five breanna continued her instructions and found that com passion was a very quick study nothing needed to be repeated now you just keep playing until it stalls out breanna concluded which it usually does after a while its hard to win unless you cheat cheat break the rules but how can it be a game with no rules breanna realized that the machine was wired to be honest and didnt understand dishonesty it cant be she said so go ahead and play there was a pause my mistress is not an original thinker terian said after a moment it seemed that she had direct communication with the machine and i lack the intellect on my own you will have to direct the play but its easy to play breanna said just not easy to win perhaps if you direct a game through to victory my mistress will then have a sufficient sense of the whole so as to be able to play variations herself well ill try but it will probably take several games shall we say that when you have played a game through to com zombif lpvfcr pletion your service is completed terian inquired then i will give you the spell and you may proceed on your way okay it seemed a fair bargain so they played several games with breanna directing them but every one blocked up before victory she wished she had chosen an easier game to win finally she broached the matter suppose i teach you another card game one thats more winnable would that be all right that would be satisfactory terian agreed okay heres one i learned off my computer in mundania she paused realizing that com passion was a computer so this should be good its called free cell its a little like klondike and a little different deal out eight rows of cards face up and keep dealing more overlapping them until they are all there you want to build up on the four aces same as in klondike and you can build down with alternating colors too you have four free cells where you can park cards she continued and terian laid out the cards and played according to directions every game is supposed to be winnable if you play right but its usually too complicated for me but maybe you with your logical mind we must see a game played through to victory first terian reminded her so breanna tried but game after game blocked up she knew she was making misplays but couldnt help it in fact as time wore on she was getting worse she wanted to quitexcept for the zombies outside suppose i teach you another game she suggested desperately the night was passing and she was getting nowhere swiftly that would be satisfactory terian agreed exactly as she had before breanna could see that it really was true that this computer and mouse set lacked originality so she proceeded to her third and last game this ones called accordion its pretty simple to play but almost impossible to win she quailed inwardly as she said it but since she was messing up on the theoretically winnable game maybe she would luck out and win this one it wasnt much of a hope but what else was there its called that because it tends to expand and contract like an accordion she paused do you know what an accordion is piers anthony no terian said its a musical instrument that you pump like a bellows do you know what a bellows is yes breanna was learning caution what is your definition a person who shouts loudly just so there is another type of bellows a device that pumps air by flexing in and out its used in mundania terian nodded secondary definition noted and the accordion has a keyboard on one side and harmony notes on the other side andwell it doesnt matter deal out the cards face up a row of about six face up about six terian asked surely it must be exactly six not according to fuzzy logic uh do you know there is a colony of warm fuzzies nearby they are not known for their logical abilities breanna decided to avoid further analogies never mind what i mean is that you can deal out four five six seven eight or any number it doesnt have to be six thats just for convenience a span of four to eight cards when inconvenient terian said getting it straight breanna let that pass now you play by matching up the cards by suit or number the first or third from the right terian looked blank so she moved right on into a demonstration deal the cards ill show you terian dealt six cards the queen of hearts two of diamonds nine of clubs six of clubs ten of spades and ace of spades qv a aa now see you can put the six of clubs on the nine of clubs because the suits match and the nine is right next on the left breanna said she paused when nothing happened she said put the six on the nine she kept forgetting how literally these folk took things and put the ace on the ten now you have four piles and four suits you cant do any more so now deal out another card on the right the next card was the two of hearts qv a v now this is nice because you can close it up some more put the two of hearts on the two of diamonds because the numbers match zombie lover and the diamond is the third card to the left remember you can match either the first or third i remember terian said she moved the card now you can match the two hearts because they are next to each other do it move the whole pile the buried cards no longer count terian did it v aa so you see we have boiled seven piles of cards down to three now deal out some more cards how many cards breanna tried not to roll her eyes three more terian dealt out the four of diamonds jack of spades and eight of diamonds see now the accordion is expanding again we dont do anything deal a couple more terian dealt the three of hearts and seven of diamonds v a ja v see still nothing i hate it when they alternate like that sometimes i wind up with half the deck spread out anyway the object is to finish with all the cards in a single pile two piles is a very good score three or four piles is still credible and beyond that is pretty much of a washout she grimaced i wash out a lot they played the game on through and sure enough finished with nine piles of cards they played again and finished with five piles a third game was fifteen piles breanna was about ready to tear her hair but refrained because it was really nice hair look i cant seem to win a game for love nor money and i need to get on my way is there any other way i can get that zombienosee spell you are offering love or money terian inquired oops not literally its zombie love im trying to escape and money isnt much use in xanth i mean is there any other deal i can make with you since this one isnt working out there was the barest pause we are intrigued by these games find another person to play them in your stead one who can play one through to victory at that point we will give you the spell but how can i find anyone else when i cant even go out of this cave for fear of the zombies we will lend you the spell for that purpose piers anthony that was so logical that breanna knew she would never have thought of it okay but how can you be sure i wont just bug out do what to what oops again it did sound as if she meant to pull an insect from its hole how do you know i wont run off to the good magicians castle the moment i have that spell instead of finding you another player you will do what you agreed to do she realized thai a machine had little concept of dishonesty okay ill go find somebody seems fair to me terian lifted her hand and in it appeared a marblesized globe she gave it to breanna but as breanna took it it faded out had she somehow broken it the spell is now part of you and will carry through the night terian explained if you are unable to find a suitable player by dawn return here and we will provide another spell for the next night breanna hoped she could do it much faster than that okay ill see you soon one way or another she walked out of the cave almost immediately she saw the zombies milling about maybe they knew she was in the cave and were waiting to nab her when she emerged she nerved herself and walked down the path toward the zombies if they gave even the slightest teeniest weeniest sign of seeing her she would bolt back into the cave as fast as her fine black legs would carry her but the zombies gave no sign of being aware of her they seemed to be patrolling shuffling back and forth dropping putrid bits of themselves behind yuck she timed her route to pass between the two of them while they were both walking away from the intersection of paths she got through and was on her way beyond without their noticing then she reconsidered how did she know the spell was working she might have slipped through on her own merit she had better make sure she nerved herself again and turned back now the two zombies were approaching each other on their route she could see the route because it was marked by blobs of decayed flesh they were definitely on guard duty she walked toward them hey you rotters she called zombie lovtr y there was no response the zombies shuffled past each other and walked on out toward the ends of their routes so she went to the center and stood there waiting for their return she was terrified but she made herself stand there she had to know they turned and shuffled back their faces were blank masks of disgusting decomposition it was a marvel they could see anything with those putrefied orbs hey foulface she called to one can you see me the zombie ignored her he continued to shuffle toward her she realized that they would collide if she didnt get out of the way so she moved clear just in time and the zombies passed behind her have you sheen anyshing seymour bones one inquired of the other noshing rick r mortis the other replied satisfied breanna proceeded on her way now whom could she find who liked to play cards there might be a small problem because no one in xanth knew about cards but surely many folk were bored and this was a good treatment for boredom another problem was the fact that it was night which was her prime time but was sleep time for others but there should be a few folk active sure enough soon she spied the light of a lamp and by the lamp a young man was putting handfuls of dirt into a bag hello she said by way of introduction that is a pointless interjection he replied not looking up what is she asked vaguely nettled by his attitude your stupid salutation breanna had never been a person to accept rudeness unchallenged who says its stupid i do i am smart alec i always know a detail others dont think of he paused reflectively i cant think why im unpopular gee it sure beats me she retorted sourly what are you doing tm collecting magic dust as any idiot can plainly see that looks just like ordinary dirt to me did you get some in your mouth to make you talk dirty im not talking dirty i am merely making statements about the incapacities of others who evidently dont realize how dull they are breanna had had just about enough of this she was ready to blast piers him with some real information on dullness but remembered her mission maybe he would like to play cards so she stifled her justified retort and tried to sotten him up tor the kill as it were thank you for explaining about the magic dust but how is it you know that this particular dirt is magic and what do you want it for all dirt in xanth is magic he said in superior fashion it is what carries the magic it emanates from the center of xanth and slowly spreads out and the magic diminishes as the dust thins this is near the center of xanth so should be pretty strong im going to take it to mundama where it should enable magic to be operative thats a great idea she said putting more enthusiasm into it than she felt she had lived years in mundama and doubted that anything could budge its dreariness how would you like to play a great new game now at last alec glanced at her appraismgly she wasnt entirely easy with the places his gaze landed very well take off your clothes what a jerk not that kind of a game im only fifteen oh then you wouldnt know about that sort of thing actually she did know but preferred not to tell him that this is a card game it forget it im not interested he focused on his dust imtated anew breanna walked on if this was the kind of reaction she was likely to encounter her quest was more difficult than she had believed then she thought of a way to get something useful from this jerk she turned back ill bet you dont know who would want to play a card game com pewter he said and ignored her com pewter she had heard of him he was a machine like com passion who resided in a cave and could change his local reality what better partner could she possibly find smart alec had known the answer and had done her a huge if inadvertent favor but pewter lived far away south across the gap chasm not ac tually all that far from her home in the black village how could she get there quickly well maybe the same way she had gotten here but first she had to prepare could pewters activities possibly be construed as censorship in mundama that was the suppression ot certain political ombip l fr ribald or otherwise objectionable speaking or writing and it happened a lot no matter how innocent or well meaning the expression there was bound to be somebody who found it offensive and wanted to abolish it dictating that only that particular person s beheis and expressions were truly free in xanth it was brought bv the censor ship a dread craft whose docking meant awful mischief for those in the vicinity she recalled when the black wave had suffered some of its effect they had managed to escape it fortunately but all of them remembered that was why they had made it a point to get on good terms with the de censor ship wherever that went it abolished the evil suppression ot the other ship and even nulled the dread adult conspiracy ot silence so the dc ship wasnt welcome in most quarters because the adult conspiracy was almost universal in xanth even dragons and ogres honored it but because the black wave had emigrated trom mundama six years ago its elder children mostly knew the secrets and werent affected breanna herself understood perfectly how to summon the stork she just didnt much care to do it yet and not ever until she found someone really worthwhile meanwhile it was convenient to pretend that she was as innocent as a regular xanth juvenile the words im only fifteen scared off just about any pushy male except unfortunately one whose brain was rotten like a zombie king so she had no fear of the de censor ship and in fact it could be useful on occasion it was just a matter ol proper management she concluded that pewters habit of revising reality could indeed be called censorship because he didnt allow opposing folk to have their say therefore his activity should be of interest to the ship and that was all she needed she cupped her hands around her mouth fee fo fi hpi smell censorship she called immediately the lights of a ship hove into view it was magic and could sail through land rather than water that was because it was the opposite of the censor ship which sailed on water hello there breanna a girl in a sailor hat called hello tsunami breanna replied tsunami s magic talent was liquidation which was why she was a vital crew membei she could turn any solid to water and back again without that the ship would become landbound in a hurry what have you found tsunami asked as the ship sloshed to a piers anthony stop beside breanna she felt the land making little waves it was weird i just realized that com pewter is guilty of censorship breanna said want to go there and remonstrate with him then get aboard tsunami said rolling down the gangplank breanna went aboard the ship turned and picked up speed it did this by using nots if it was not here it must be there and so it moved there but if the skipper said not again it had to move on to another there it was said that a speed of thirty nots could get it just about anywhere in a hurry indeed it was soon not in northern xanth and was crossing the gap chasm this was interesting because it couldnt cruse in air so had to sail down the chasm wall across the bottom and up the far wall not here not here tsunami kept saying and the ship kept gaining velocity in its hurry to obey breanna spied a line extending across the chasm why not use that as a guide to cross more quickly she asked tsunami looked oh no thats a time line follow that and it takes you back in time breanna nodded i guess we dont need that right now tsunami looked ahead ah theres clappy his reports are always useful breanna saw a nondescript man standing near the ship reports yes tsunami called out to the man hey make us a report the man clapped his hands together instead of a clapping sound they made a report the weather is fair on this day he clapped them again and made another report the gap dragon is foraging at the far end of the chasm at this hour he clapped a third time three kings are traveling to castle zombie to inquire what is stirring up the zombies i could tell them that breanna exclaimed thank you tsunami called throwing clappy a kiss he caught it and bowed they sailed on up the far side of the chasm then resumed normal travel across the land oh theres a lady bug tsunami said pleased in a moment the lady flew low and landed on the deck she folded zombie lover her bug wings and her glossy shawl covered them it was brightly colored with spots may i ride with you a while she inquired certainly tsunami said i love lady bugs you are all so pretty thank you i have never sailed on a ship before this is fun she looked around i am lady chelle but soon she tired of the novelty lifted her shawl clear spread her insect wings and flew away they never stay long tsunami said a trifle sadly sometimes whole flocks of birdwinged humans pass by but they dont have much interest in sailing when they can fly they can change into birds when they want to soon they were approaching com pewters cave not beyond the cave tsunami said and the de censor ship sloshed to a sudden stop making the land ahead of it form into a wave breanna stepped off thank you i dont suppose youd care to wait while i deal with this she was concerned about getting back to com passion im afraid we cant tsunami said with regret we just got another call and must tend to it immediately nothing is more important than opposing the censor ship i understand she would just have to figure out another way when the time came the ship turned and sailed back north leaving a wake that caused the land on which breanna stood to rise and fall gently as the ship disappeared the effect subsided until the land was as solid and steady as it had ever been then the ground shook in another fashion trees crashed in the distance and monstrous footprints appeared coming this way breanna remembered that there was an invisible giant who herded visitors into com pewters cave its okay she called im going in to see com pewter anyway the shaking stopped oooga the invisible giant called sounding like a fog horn indeed a bit of fog drifted down right she said a hugely toothed creature loomed up before her it wore a vest on which the word mega was printed it roared and opened its mouth piers anthony ready to take a big bite from her tender flesh several similar creatures were beyond it guarding the cave entrance how could she get inside then she caught on youre mega bites she exclaimed for com pewter abashed at being fathomed the creatures retreated breanna walked quickly by them and entered the cave she knew it might be hard to leave again but if her mission were successful pewter would be glad to let her go she hoped the cave was quite dark and she liked that she proceeded confidently until she came to the motley collection of junk that was the body of the machine hello she called the screen lighted pretty black girl fails to scream and flee it printed you dont need to change my reality breanna told it im here on business this surprised pewter she could tell because his screen blinked and went fuzzy for three quarters of an instant business i think you are guilty of censorship and i want you to stop it the machine seemed to be set back i have never been on a ship mean that you change reality so that others dont get their fair say thats what they try to do in mundania i want you to stop it at once girl changes subject that was exactly what she meant but now she couldnt say it however she wasnt annoyed because that was only her pretext for getting a ride on the de censor ship she had made an honest attempt and now could get on with her main business i have come to teach you a great new game the screen formed an eye the eye ran over her form in much the way smart alecs eye had i am unable to play such games to my regret why do you males have only one thought in your head she demanded rhetorically she had mixed feelings about such looks on the one hand she resented being sexually appraised as if her body was the only reason for her existence on the other hand she was pleased to be noticed so her protest was a matter of form as much as substance im going to teach you a card game its from mundania so you havent encountered it before do you have a mouse zombie lovtr a mouse appeared by her feet eeeek breanna screamed stepping back she couldnt help it surprise appearances of mice always set her off she knew it was ridiculous and that the mouse wouldnt hurt her in fact she had once had a pet mouse that contentedly walked and pooped on her hand but her reaction was hardwired change form the mouse was replaced by a troll thats worse she cried now more sensibly alarmed trolls eat girls or worse please you misunderstand the troll said i am tristan troll doing service as pewters mouse i never ate girls in fact i got into trouble with my village for letting a girl go his voice was very cultured and reassuring breanna decided to trust him for now it wasnt as if she had much choice if she wanted to accomplish her mission ill need you to deal the cards she glanced at pewters screen make the semblance of a table and fifty two cards with symbols on them she described the deck and soon tristan was holding it in due course she had demonstrated the three types of solitaire but of course succeeded in losing all the games badly i wish i could win one for you so you know how its done she said but for now youll have to take my word that it can be done of course it can be done tristan said i didnt realize that that is what you were trying to do you can play one through to victory yourself breanna asked amazed i thought your lack of originality prevented you it might prevent pewter but i have an intellect capable of original thought the troll smiled and the expression no longer seemed as horrible as it might have in fact it used to get me into serious trouble i know how that is breanna said ruefully i get in trouble all the time tristan dealt out the cards for free cell on his own and played quickly and accurately making it look easy and soon had won the game you really are smart breanna said i could never do that i am not that smart tristan said but my creativity buttressed by pewters logic makes this feasible this is a straightforward exercise of alignment this was a great break okay now i am here at the behest of piers anthony com passion who needs a partner to play these games through to victory who the screen asked shes a computer like you only female breanna explained and shes bored and lonely i know how that feels tristan said she was actually developing some sympathy for the ugly male creature nothing wrong with you that a girlfriend couldnt cure no female of my kind will associate with me that is one reason i accepted this position i can make this female associate with you com pewter offered no breanna cried suddenly really truly awfully alarmed im only fifteen im only fifteen i can store her in the back of the cave for three years until she comes of age there is plenty of gruel and water to feed her no breanna screamed you cant female is silent she was unable to speak what an awful turn this had taken she was escaping the zombie only to be caught by a troll let her go tristan said if i believed in abusing children i would never have gotten in trouble with my kind she has come on legitimate business and should be allowed to complete it the screen made a flicker of resignation female resumes dialog breanna was free to talk again she wanted to protest that she was no child but thought the better of it she really appreciated the trolls decency so com passion needs a partner to play cards with i thought you might like to do that she hoped this is interesting tristan said we did not know of this entity perhaps we can set up a data link i guess im not exactly sure how you do that by changing reality the troll said i can work it out in theory and pewter can implement it get the gui pewters screen printed tristan went to the back of the cave and came back with a double handful of goo he lifted it high letting it stretch down in a gooey sheet along the wall this is a graphical user interface he explained it helps show what you are dealing with zombie lover uh sure breanna agreed faintly as the goo covered the entire stone surface making it glisten tristan stepped back wiping his hands the gui is in place he reported suddenly the wall of the cave became a huge window there were com passion and mouse terian glancing across in surprise i have found you a solitaire partner who can play to victory breanna said not letting the moment escape this is com pewter and his trollmouse tristan ffijp sјsaxr passions screen printed tristan if you would demonstrate a free cell win for com passion the cards appeared and the troll swiftly dealt and played and won terian assumed girl form and clapped her hands how thrilling she exclaimed now we can do it too tristan gazed at her his eyes traveling down in an hourglass pattern it was true passions mouse did have that type of figure in her nymphly aspect the germ of a notion wiggled into breannas mind soon terian was dealing and playing buttressed by passion and won thats very nice tristan said still gazing at terian terian smiled at him thank you breanna realized two things one was that there might be a future c in the interaction of the two mice because though they were of different origin species they had similar positions and would surely understand each other if the one was lonely surely the other was lonely too the other realization was that the two computers would have no further reason to associate once both knew how to win all the types of card games so they would separate that being the logical unimaginative course and com passion would be lonely again her nice mouse would be lonely too breanna decided that she ought to do something about that she had a romantic nature after all tristan was smart and decent and terian was lovely in her human image what more was required solitaire can be interactive breanna said remembering for example klondike deal two decks opposite each other and either player can play on the others ace piles whoever finishes first wins and you cant be sure who that will be the two tables merged at the interface with tristan at one and piers anthony terian at the other facing each other terians decolletage seemed to be lower than before especially when she leaned forward and tristan seemed to be standing taller they dealt out their hands of klondike and played rapidly soon they were playing on each others aces the cards had no trouble crossing the barrier of the screen as they were mere images themselves both games blocked up that was the thing about klondike much of it was the luck of the draw so that no amount of skill or strategy could prevail but breanna seemed to remember that double klondike was more winnable than single klondike they played again and this time it was evident that there was going to be a victory tristan was leading breanna thought of something she squatted down by pewters screen it might be more interesting if you arrange to lose she murmured a question mark appeared on the screen trust me she said tristan had surged ahead and was about to place his final card on a pile but he hesitated and terian was able to place her last card first oh you let me win terian said blushing how romantic she threw a kiss at him the kiss passed right through the interface and landed on his mouth tristan stepped back looking stunned pewters screen became a series of exploding spirals intermixed with hearts spades diamonds and clubs of course you know that was really com passion kissing you breanna murmured to the machine in her fashion shes very romantic if you want more of that son of thing you have a notion how to behave the screen slowly coalesced into a single large heart pewter was definitely interested meanwhile the two mice were staring at each other in wild surmise his mouth was open in awe and her bosom was gently heaving they might have wildly different origins but they were indeed well matched in the context if the machines wanted to find out what love was like they had only to give their helpers leeway breanna looked across to com passion i think ill go now i think i have fulfilled my commitment zombie lover eear air passions screen scripted rtђea a aiwr cme fo me thank you breanna said gratified she caught terians glance and winked and was pleased to see the lady mouse blush yes this was definitely working out she walked out of the cave she didnt care if there were zombies in the vicinity because she knew she was now much closer to the good magicians castle than she had been and could reach it before dawn and the zombies wouldnt even know she was there yes taken as a whole this night was well worthwhile breanna set her face east and began to walk dream chase t he three kings followed millie up the winding stairway this gave them an excellent view of her posterior reminding bink forcibly of her talent of sex appeal in this rejuvenated state he noticed such things and it tended to catch him off guard he wasnt eighty one anymore physically so to avoid the embarrassment of an untoward thought he focused his attention elsewhere he heard a faint moan he would not have been aware of it had he not been trying to avoid what was in front of his nose he had not heard a moan quite like that before and it bothered him what is that he asked if you dont know youre a lot less man than you look the stair right under millies rump said i heard something bink said quickly like a moan to the side millie paused oh thats the blob the zombies brought it in and jonathan tried to rescue it but all it does is suffer it suffers maybe we could give it some healing elixir we tried that but that doesnt seem to be the problem we dont know what to do maybe i should look at it binks interest was only partial but he had to finish what he had started by all means millie led the way down a side passage to an end chamber zombie lover there it was as described a blob it might have had the size of a man if shaped that way but it just hunkered down into a quivering mass there were splotchy colors on its surface overall it wasnt very appealing hello bink said are you sentient the thing merely groaned again bink wasnt sure how it groaned as it seemed to have no mouth but of course the inanimate had no trouble speaking in dors presence not needing any mouth either all things were possible with sufficient magic it does seem to be alive dor said but without eyes or ears or whatever id be miserable too in that state dolph said the matter continued to bother bink if its not injured or unhealthy this must be its natural state but it obviously isnt happy could it be something thats gone wrong that was meant to be a regular creature but didnt get there maybe if we could figure out what it is meant to be we could help it that would be nice millie agreed we hate to see it suffer but we dont feel free to throw it out there was nothing to be done here so they moved on bink tried to put the matter out of his thoughts but it kept bobbing back into them if there was no other way he would go to good magician humfrey himself and ask what to do about the blob but right now he had to solve the zombie problem they reached the spare room it was nicely set up with three beds here is ajar of the sleep spell millie said just sniff it and sleep it works immediately i will close the jar remember follow the footprints they lay down each on a bed millie brought the jar to dolph he sniffed and his head dropped on the pillow snoring she brought it to dor and in a moment he too was asleep then she came to bink maybe if you let the blob sniff it the moaning would stop he suggested she brightened ill try that she held forth the jar he sniffed xanth was without form and void he was zooming through that void at a horrendous rate seeing clouds of surplus dreamstuff all around him then he slowed and found himself standing in what he pjfrs anthony recognized as the castle roogna tapestry chamber there was the splendid tapestry whose animated pictures showed any aspect of the history of xanth the viewer cared to watch there was also a ghost hovering beside it the ghost saw him and spooked fading out of sight with a soundless exclamation thats a new one dor remarked people spooking ghosts bink looked around dor and dolph stood beside him so they were all present in the dream in a moment princess ida who was princess ivys twin sister entered the room she paused near the door the ghost hovered near her i am told that someone is visiting here in a dream she announced so i will sleep and join you in a moment the ghost brought her dolph said the castle roogna ghosts are shy but friendly dor said as a child i used to know them better ida sat in a chair facing the tapestry and leaned back closing her eyes in a moment her even breathing showed that she was falling asleep then a second version of her appeared standing before the sleeping figure only this one was awake oh hello brother she said spying dolph i didnt know you could dream dolph blurted i mean ida smiled we did not have the advantage of growing up together dolph she said maybe that was just as well i dont think you would have survived two elder sisters she glanced around at the others hello father dor hello grandfather bink hello bink answered awkwardly he had never quite gotten used to the notion of having twin granddaughters that was because there had been just ivy as a child only when she was an adult had the twin sister the stork had misplaced finally found her way to claim her heritage at age twenty two ida was a nice person with the extremely powerful but devious talent of the idea whatever idea she had that originated with someone who did not know her talent was true now it turned out that her cute little moon ptero was a function of that talent so bink knew that ida was legitimate but still he tended to think of her as unrelated i gather you have come to visit the worlds of maybe ida continued glancing up at the little globe that circled her head even in the dream state it was obviously a dream moon because the real one zombie lover was visible hovering by the sleeping idas head i must advise you that we now know of four moons and there may be many others they are ptero pyramid torus and cone the rules of magic differ for each one and most of their inhabitants never existed in xanth you will be able to leave any of them simply by waking up as can the zombie master who passed this way before you we are looking for him bink said ah that explains it you will be in no danger but if you suffer what would be death in real life you will lose the dream and wake up immediately and be unable to return without going through the whole process again so it is best to be careful i will guide you to ptero after that i will wake up and go about my business but the dream world will exist independently because you are dreaming it once all three of you leave it it will fade if you need to go to the other worlds you must find the ida who resides on each you will not need to have her sleep because the entire derivative structure already exists in the present dream just go on as you need to i hope your mission is successful thanks sis dolph said kissing her on the cheek have a nice day when you wake up when this is done i hope one of you will come to tell me what you found ida said i cant go to those worlds even in my dreams unfortunately so i am dependent on others to learn about them i am most curious well do that bink promised thank you now you must focus on ptero and think small very small make sure you stay together because it is easy to get lost there time is geography east is from and west is to but you will not be affected by the time because you are not really there in fact you will have to form your bodies from filler material as the natives do in order to interact nothing you do there will be permanent because this is only your dream we understand dor said we just need to talk with the zombie master good fortune dream ida stepped back toward her body orient on ptero the tiny moon swung around before her head lets hold hands dor suggested so we dont get separated they linked up and focused on the moon bink tried to think small pifrs anthony and suddenly the moon was growing it seemed to swell to the size of an apple then to a bowling ball then they seemed to be floating toward it he looked down the castle roogna chamber was gone they were in empty sky dropping toward the distant planet their velocity increased suddenly the world was looming scanly close too close it was no longer a ball but a broad landscape with mountains and helds and lakes oops dolph said then they plunged into the ground darkness closed around them their impetus had carried them down into the rock maybe we can rise a bit dor suggested bink concentrated on rising as did the others in a moment they burst out of the ground and sailed up into the sky were ghosts bink said remembering we need to get some substance some filler they were hovering in a cloud dolph reached out and grabbed some cloudstuff pressing it into his body that seemed to work so bink and dor tried the same the more stuff they pressed in to themselves the more solid they became and they began to fall but they were able to control it so that they finally made a soft landing in a forest bink dusted himself off and patted firm the last of the filler he felt much like himself dor and dolph seemed similar now we need to find the zombie masters footprints dor said they looked around but there was no sign of glowing footprints they had probably gone astray in the course of their inexpert landing even in dreams things needed to be done approximately right ill change form and fly up and see if i can spy them dolph said if my talent works here it should dor said we should be at least as talented in our dreams as in our reality but dont lose track of us dolph became a hawk moth and flew up combining the flight powers of the one and the sensitive antenna of the other so this is a dream the ground said dor glanced at bink it seems my talent too is present sure it is the ground agreed i can tell you where those footprints are straight north which way is north zombie lover toward the blue bink looked around the air seemed to be bluer in one direction and redder in the other cold north and warm south all right they walked north in a moment the hawk moth descended it landed and dolph reappeared youre going the right way he said i saw a trail of footprints there we are on our way bink agreed i also thought i saw something following us but i couldnt make it out how could anything be following us dor asked a bit sharply we are in a dream and on a unique world maybe a creature of this world dor said uncertainly but maybe i just imagined it well keep alert dor said just in case that made sense but privately bink wondered dolph had his juvenile confusions but paranoia wasnt one of them they didnt know what kinds of predators this world had so he decided to hang back a bit so that if anything came on them from behind he would be the first one it encountered it wouldnt be able to hurt him and the effort might give warning for the others they had been assured that they couldnt really be hurt while in this dream but if they got sufficiently messed up they would be forced to wake up and lose their place here soon they found the trail glowing footprints headed west that meant toward the future assuming that made sense say dolph said its green that way he looked back and yellow to the east they checked again dolphs younger nature had picked up on something the elders had missed so they couldnt get confused about whether they were traveling into the future or the past the colors ahead would warn them that struck bink as a nice feature of this world they followed the prints which seemed to know where they were going they led past a small village there was a gnome working outside his house hello hello its great to see you the gnome exclaimed in friendly fashion havent we met before i dont think so bink replied as he happened to be closest i am bink who are you well piers anthony what no well thats my name everyone knows me gnome well a nearby rock said helpfully another gnome emerged from the house and this is my neighbor metro well said metro gnome keeps track of ticks and locks that seems useful bink agreed he knew that ticks could be real mischief if not supervised a friend had once eaten an emi tick by accident and gotten really sick another had been bitten by a psychotic and gone crazy a third had run afoul of a spasmo tic and convulsed what ticks are you watching now a group of across ticks metro answered they are useful for word puzzles do you need any not at the moment thank you so can i help you with anything well inquired in the manner of an old friend were just following these footprints the gnome looked what prints so it was true others could not see them magical prints that only we can see bink explained well i wouldnt recommend going that way gnome said theres a bad comic strip and beyond it is only old age we can handle it bink assured him you must love punishment i couldnt stand it whats so bad about a comic strip dolph asked both gnomes rolled their eyes youre new here metro said maybe some things you just have to learn for yourselves well said they went on and came to the edge of what seemed to be the comic strip beyond it things looked wild indeed but the footprints went there so they followed when they stepped across they found themselves on a path labeled psycho they followed the prints along it it wound crazily around seeming to go nowhere in particular it passed a huge feline creature who seemed to have no eyes so they thought it safe to tiptoe by then it yawned and there were eyes in its mouth eye teeth they hurried on before the eyes could focus on them there was a sign saying bowling that seemed safe then a bowl flew by sinks head someone was throwing bowls at them they ran on escaping the bowls there was a cat staring at them zombifc lovfr it scanned bink then dolph then dor as if it could see their innards the process was disquieting its a cat scan dummy a little figure with a big mouth said and ran on next were several little dogs running in circles lap dogs the figure said doing their laps beyond them were other dogs that just lay in the way there were too many to step over so dolph bent down to lift one out of the way ouch he exclaimed its burning hot hot dogs the running figure explained there was a cacophony of barking as mud puppies formed from nearby mud and suds puppies formed from soap bubbles then it stopped as a hush puppy commanded silence what gives with all these animals dor demanded it was just raining cats and dogs the big mouth answered i think im beginning to appreciate why we were warned against the comic strip dor muttered they managed to get beyond the animals but were not clear of the strip dolph saw a purse lying in the path so he bent to pick it up and it exploded spattering him with dirt thats a disperse dummy the mouthy figure said chucking so now are you going to try to play the lute sure enough there was a stringed musical instrument there let me try it bink said and picked it up the strings of the lute snapped free of their moorings and tried to wrap themselves around him but he happened to be standing beside a wall of colored blocks and the strings got tangled around the blocks instead suddenly the blocks moved manifesting as a big snake composed of blocky segments it looped away dragging the lute sidewinder captures dissolute the figure said gleefully weve got to get out of here dolph cried lets follow that snake they charged after the sidewinder but it swerved back into the center of the strip they were in danger of losing the footprints so they stopped and looked for them the prints led to the side but that trail was blocked by a big picture of a collection of pins labeled ting well have to move that out of the way dor said uhuhiih the running figure said this is a painting piers anthony just what are you bink demanded of the little creature i thought youd never ask im a running commentary if you think im bad you should meet my cousin the running gag you can get rid of him only by telling lame jokes so his legs stop working so can you tell us how to get out of this comic strip dolph demanded but the commentary had already run away theres an open space dor said peering to the side they made for it it turned out to be a square section paved with linoleum it looked harmless then a wildeyed woman appeared with wild roses in her hair her body was luscious but there was something dangerous about her hi im meriel maenad do any of you want to indulge in floorplay with me no bink said quickly he knew about the maenads they were bloodthirsty wild women who loved to tear men apart literally just as well the running commentary remarked reappearing those who indulge on that floor get trampled by the families of their partners who dont much like them how do we get out of here dolph demanded but again the commentary had run off then a large serpentine head loomed over them that looks like a hydra dor said nervously sure enough in a moment several more heads appeared the first heads mouth opened fire shot out just missing them thats a fire hydrant bink cried run they ran so fast their surroundings became a blur their feet stepped on egregious puns getting all pungent bink was disgusted suddenly the surroundings cleared they were out of the comic strip they eased to a halt now i know what gnome well meant dolph said i dont want to go through that again at least the regular landscape is relatively clear dor agreed but have we lost the trail they looked around soon bink saw the footprints emerging from the strip and proceeding west bink lagging back a bit heard a faint stirring in the comic strip then there came the voice of the running commentary and another zombie lover foolish traveler braves the ticklish zone there was the sound of stifled laughter as if someone was being unwillingly tickled was that coincidence or was there really someone or something following them bink decided not to say anything until he had more definite evidence this is slow dolph said why dont i assume roc form and carry us swiftly along it and fly over any other comic strips dor agreed that would get them well ahead of any pursuit bink thought with satisfaction if there was any dor became a roc and they got onto his huge feet and caught hold then he spread his wings and took off flying low bink saw the footprints becoming a streak because of the speed they were traversing a great plain this supposedly tiny world was huge from this close there was a bank of clouds sheltering a storm they veered around it and passed a rainbow dor pointed lookrainbow trout sure enough there were pretty fish swimming in the rainbow they passed over another comic strip and bink realized that these were the boundaries between regions of ptero they were surely effective no one would cross such strips carelessly the footsteps passed through the strip and emerged on the other side unchanged the zombie master must have had a castiron sense of humor they crossed a forest catching glimpses of the prints under the trees then something familiar loomed ahead castle roogna dor exclaimed how can it be here all the creatures who ever were will be or might be are here bink reminded him so i suppose that all their houses and architecture can be here too dolph came to land before the castle he missed by a little and almost wound up in the zombie graveyard hey a man cried sorry about that bink called dolph managed to clear the graveyard and land safely they got off his feet and he resumed manform so is this really castle roogna dor asked sure it is the man answered what did you think it was an outhouse piers anthony we were merely surprised for we know of a similar castle far away the man approached then he did a doubletake why youre consort dor i didnt know you were out today consort dor dor asked blankly have you lost your memory king irenes husband i suppose i have dor said evidently taken aback irene is here of course if youve lost your memory id better introduce myself im zafar the zombie lover i tend their graveyard while they rest thats good dor agreed ive got some forgetmenot extract zafar said it nullifies the effect of a forget spell maybe that will help you dor shook his head i dont think so but thanks zafar returned to the graveyard the three kings exchanged most of a glance they shrugged the footprints led on in they followed a huge head rose out of the moat it was souffle serpent the moat monster he looked at the three with surprise as if also not aware that they had gone out then nodded and sank back under the surface why do i think this is about to be strange dor inquired rhetorically because it is bink said even for a dream a woman came to meet them at the front gate she was about twenty seven and was so lovely that the halls brightened as she passed bink stared it was chameleon she recognized him at the same time oh bink you fook eleven years younger how did you do it then she stepped into him embraced him and kissed him binks head orbited another realm as it did when she did that but he knew this couldnt really be her because she had not entered the dream and gone to ptero and she was the wrong age not her real seventy six or her youthened sixteen and she was in the wrong phase at the height of her beauty instead of ugly or just this side of ordinary so how could this be dor and dolph stood motionless and silent as confused as he was chameleon was after all their mother and grandmother zombie lovfr she drew back half a notch oh bink ive missed you so i didnt expect you back until tomorrow lets go up to the bedroom right now and she was in her stupid phase so didnt have the wit to be discreet how could he explain if he figured it out himself he glanced at dor desperate for guidance dor was their son he should know but he looked blank meanwhile chameleon was tugging him toward a stairway he tried to hang back but couldnt oh go on up a stair told him youre only young twice well meet youafter dolph called helpfully after a few confused moments bink found himself in their chamber chameleon closed the door pushed him onto the bed so that he had to sit then sat on his lap her bottom was marvelously soft she wrapped her arms around his head and pulled him in for a welcoming hug her divinely firm bosom pressed against his face she smelled of heaven his senses melted into one great blissful mass of joy but she couldnt be his wife the real chameleon was back in xanth in castle roogna maybe in this very chamber but it wasnt the same castle it couldnt be she got up and began removing her clothing t cant get over how young you look she breathed almost the way you were when we were first youthened you look wonderful her dress came off she was one of those women who looked better with every glance if he didnt do something soon he would lose all control his twenty oneyearold body was eager to summon a battalion of storks in a quarter of an instant he loved chameleon and desired her especially when she was like this but how could it be she stood before him in bra and panties not only unbearably lovely but excruciatingly sexy he was in danger of freaking out only his real mental age of eighty one enabled him to tide through the sight bit by bit he worked it out all the people and creatures who ever existed or might exist were here on ptero that included all of the xanth folk so chameleon was here too she really was his wife she took off the underwear his eyeballs were heating he had to blink repeatedly to prevent them from frying but she was older no less desirable but older time was supposed piers anthony to be geography here or vice versa people could be any age so she was twenty seven here in castle roogna and this wasnt even the real ptero but a dream image of it so this was a dream chameleon not the real one of either ptero or xanth she started to undress him her touch was wonderfully gentle yet compelling it still felt like adultery chameleon he said therestheres something i must say cant it wait she asked drawing off his shirt chameleon im from xanth were all on xanth in our off year she said she started work on his trousers i mean im not from ptero im visiting from xanth im not not the bink whos due back tomorrow i dont understand she said can you stand up so i can get these off chameleon please we cant do this she paused we cant but its so much more fun when were young chameleon i love you but im not the bink who lives here it would be wrong to she began to get the message of rejection her eyes turned moist making him feel unbearably guilty you dont want to how could he explain the smart chameleon would have understood the moment she saw their age differences but this was the stupid one alternate worlds within worlds were beyond her limited comprehension he tried another tack chameleon suppose i was someone else who just looked like bink but wasnt him would you still want to do this she struggled with the concept but it was too much so she kissed him instead bink gave himself up for lost he still felt it was wrong but he loved and desired her so much that he couldnt fight it any longer he knew she was completely innocent of bad intent she loved him and wanted him and that was the whole of her present understanding would her opposite phase be angry when she came into play or intrigued zomblfc lovfr chameleon got back to work on his trousers bink offered no further resistance then the door opened and a man entered hello hello bink chameleon said without looking recognizing the voice then slowly the realization sank in she paused then her head turned there was bink thirty two years old her true husband i had some lucky breaks and managed to get back a day early he said yes i know she agreed were she paused again her head slowly turning back to the bink on the bed yes there are two of us bink said so i see bink agreed chameleons head turned back and forth between them i dont understand now bink could explain again knowing that there was someone present who would understand am the bink from xanth i am visiting ptero in a dream im not really here except in spirit so i think i should turn the bed over to the real bink at this point but now bink protested im the dream im sure youre real bink said but my image of you is in a dream just as im real but not really here since chameleon is a dream too shes yours she is a dream bink agreed a perfect dream and i love her but i have my real chameleon back on xanth theres another woman chameleon asked plaintively the two binks exchanged a glance no bink said there is only you chameleon and two of me so one of us will go and the other will be with you she smiled thats nice bink got up and hastily donned his shirt i think my talent is operating it will not allow me to be harmed by magic since at least one of us is me the other cant do anything harmful to the one so it enabled you to get home in time yes bink agreed he took off his shirt we must talk when we can bink said yes soon bink lay on the bed pitrs anthoni as bink went out the door chameleon was resuming where she had left off her contusion had been abated that would not have been the case with a smarter woman both binks understood that neither could stand to cause her the slightest pain he closed the door behind him and headed for the stairs he had done the right thing yet there was that in him that almost wished that his other self had been too late he turned a corner and saw something just vanishing into a chamber as if hiding he remembered the suspicion that something might be following them could it be doing so even here in castle roogna no surely it was just a castle servant getting out of the way or maybe a shy ghost downstairs he found two dors and one irene in animated dialogue foi a moment he couldnt tell them apart then one dor spied him and smiled how was it father i didnti mean suddenly that dor and irene burst out laughing fooled you he said were the natives bink looked at the other dor who nodded then he saw that the natives like bink and chameleon were older he was sixty six instead of fifty five and she was sixty five he shouldnt have been fooled you aged well he admitted then two dolphs came down the wall with one matronly electra and two stunning young women the women spied bink and charged him together one was a redhead with green eyes and bright clothes the other a dark haired dark eyed creature in black clothing they embiaced him from either side who were they what a handsome young man you are the redhead said kissing his right cheek yes just right for us the jet blackhead said nibbling on his left ear finally he put it together dolphelectraeleven years hence twin seven yeaiold daughters who would now be eighteen each dawn and eve he exclaimed my great grandchildren they laughed togethei aw he caught on dawn said now we can t show him this she leaned forward just enough to provide a glimpse ol her fine cleavage inside a bright halter she had evidently inherited an aspect of chameleon zombie lover or this eve agreed lifting her short skirt just enough to show the edge of a dark panty on a firm bottom there was another aspect girls electra cried appalled behave yourselves they laughed again hardly chastised what brings you here great grandpa dawn asked innocently if its not to sneak peeks at your demure descendants eve added mischievously its to talk with the zombie master bink said the traveling one then he paused with another realization but you already know this because you have just touched my flesh and my clothing and your talents are to know anything about anything animate or inanimate shux dawn said pouting cutely hes getting harder to tease but maybe worth the challenge eve said you girls were sheer mischief when you were seven bink said i think youre worse now thank you they said together blushing with pleasure but we shall have to let our visitors go on irene said before their trail gets cold the zombie master didnt pause here long and hes still a day ahead of them where did he go bink asked to pyramid dawn said weve been there eve said with a nice faun dawn agred with whom we really had fun eve concluded electra looked about ready to explode teasing dawn said quickly nothing more unfortunately eve said but we helped him save us all from dread marginahzation and clued him in on his true love mare imbri so would you like a pair of guides dawn asked inhaling showing a pair really friendly guides who can show you eve spied a deadly glance coming her way from her mother and changed course before it reached her skirt the lay of the land what would your boyfriends think of that irene inquired musingly i piers anthow the girls instantly sobered well just tell you what to expect dawn said each triangular face of pyramid is a different color eve said when you cross from one to another your orientation is still fixed by the first so you can no longer stand up you can get help to change dawn said but whoever helps you gets bigger and you get smaller this is weird dolph said but im sure well manage bink said and if you happen to go on to torus thats where doing a favor makes you love the one you do it for dawn said so you have to exchange favors within the hour to avoid love trouble eve said if you want to but what about time and geography bink asked the rules are different for each world dawn explained so is the terrain and the people eve said dor shook his head this may become more of an experience than we anticipated we can provide you with a place to sleep where your bodies will be safe dor said will we need them since were already dreaming dor asked oh i suppose not but first we should check with king ivy how did ivy come to be king and not grey or dolph bink asked the others were lost during the marginalization so it fell to her dor said after that it seemed easier just to leave it that way here she comes now electra said indeed a fortyyearold woman wearing a crown was approaching she did look like an older version of sinks granddaughter king ivy dor said these are three visitors from xanth who are here in a dream grandfather bink who has been severely youthened father dor eleven years younger than i am and son dolph similarly younger than our dolph i am pleased to meet you ivy said gravely you all seem oddly familiar so do you dolph said this will get in my way ivy said removing her crown and zombie lovfr handing it to her father dor then she stepped into dolph and hugged him closely i love you little brother after that she hugged dor similarly and finally bink you seem even younger grandpa she murmured in his ear i was just rejuvenated he said it still seems strange ivy stepped back took back her crown donned it and became suitably sober again you will want to go on to my sister ida she said please come this way she evidently had been briefed on their business they followed her to the tapestry chamber there was princess ida with her moonand sure enough it was the shape of a little pyramid with four triangular faces these are the xanth originals ivy said they need to locate the zombie master i will be glad to help ida said the zombie masters experience clarified the way you will not need to sleep as you are already asleep in your own realm simply think small and you will fade from here if you need to find my next derivative she lives on the blue face thank you dor said he glanced around you have all been most kind he hesitated would it be permissible to visit again when we are not on pressing business certainly king ivy said we would be glad to talk with you as we have no knowledge of events in your year of animation you cant just go back in time to when you were that age dolph asked we can travel there but must skip over the year during which you live she said we become younger as we go toward from but for me the year when i am twenty nine does not currently exist i go from thirty to twenty eight my memory takes a similar skip so that i cant recall what i did that year next year the following year will be missing from my experience similar is true for all of us weird dolph said im sure that we would find it as odd in xanth king ivy said bink wondered whether it could possibly be stranger yet on pyramid they would soon be finding out then the three kings held hands faced pyramid and thought small good magician t dawn breanna reached the vicinity of the good magicians castle she could tell because there was a sign saying vicinity of good magicians castle but then the path petered out leaving only interspersed forest and field she stopped at the end of the path perplexed how could this be the place if there was nothing here she ticked off possible reasons on her ringers one this was a fake sign and this was not the right vicinity but everything else suggested that it was right because she had seen other signs saying things like cmc next left gmc obviously being the abbreviation for good magicians castle gmc half hours walk this was an enchanted path so the signs should be accurate two maybe the castle had moved but then there should be a forwarding address or detour sign there wasnt three this was a challenge but in that case she paused her refutation foundering before getting established she knew that challenges could be anything and were generally tailored to the folk who sought to bother the good magician with their stupid questions she was a person who liked to be forthright to go straight to the person she wanted to tackle a problem directly what could be a bigger challenge for her than not to be able to find the one she sought very well good magician she muttered you want to play zombie lover hide seek ill play your stupid game but ill bleeping well expect value for my effort she had learned not to try to swear she could do it being originally mundane but nasty effects tended to occur as the surrounding atmosphere of the adult conspiracy tried to suppress it the de censor ship couldnt be everywhere at once unfortunately so until someonemaybe breanna herself in due coursemounted a successful campaign to suppress the adult conspiracy it remained in force native xanthians were inducted into the conspiracy as they came of age and thereafter made degree turns and supported what they had opposed as children it was ludicrous hypocrisy but breanna wasnt native and there was nothing for her to learn that was going to blow her mind it had been blown before she was six years old when she got into her cousins porno collection so she would not change sides when she passed eighteen then armed with the awful power of adult initiative she would see what she wanted to do all of which was halfway irrelevant at the moment right now she had to find the castle so how should she go about it first she had to figure out just where the castle was had it been buried underground she didnt see any sign of heavy construction of course with magic there might not be any telltale marks still that seemed like an awful lot of trouble just to make one minor questioner pause so probably the castle hadnt been buried or moved just hidden so how was it hidden that was easy with illusion illusion was cheap and versatile and effective sort of the basic currency of xanth so the castle must be right there somewhere in front of her but made to look like part of the forest the path probably went right to it but illusion covered the path making it look like untouched forest floor she could probably walk right along the path feeling it with her feet she tried it sure enough there was a path where it looked as if it ended her feet became invisible at the ankles so it looked as if she were ankle deep in forest loam illusion covered reality she continuedand suddenly stepped off the hidden path and lost her balance almost falling the path had curved while she hadnt so she backed off looked around and found a stick she could use as a cane then she walked into the illusion again tapping ahead of her in the manner of a blind person making sure the path was there before she stepped on it piers anthony then it ended again she tapped all around but there was no continuing path yet she was sure it was there because she had been right about the illusion why have illusion cover a few feet of a path that ended soon anyway so what was going on a moments thought brought an answer it must be more illusion illusion wasnt limited to sight it could be sound or touch too so now the illusion had been expanded to touch she could no longer feel the path so what could she do walk through the area in a crisscross pattern hoping to bump into the castle shed probably just fall into the moat and get gobbled by the moat monster so that wasnt the best idea she needed a way to penetrate the illusion to know exactly where the castle was even if she couldnt see or feel it this was a real problem her experience seeing in the dark had gotten her used to never being blind now suddenly she was really sightless the good magician had targeted her pretty well finding her weakness that she hadnt realized until now she would have to do some heavier pondering she sat down in the illusion seeing her bottom disappear and leaned back against a tree and fell flat on her back the tree was illusion she scrambled back to her feet dusted herself off and walked back beyond the fringe of illusion then she sat down again and leaned against a real tree she closed her eyes trying to make her brain work better but she seemed to have run out of creative notions hello breanna looked up without opening her eyes there stood a black horse oh hello imbri did you bring me a daydream mare imbri assumed woman form so she could talk more readily im actually on business for that other party i had to attend and saw you here are you all right mixed im in the middle of a challenge and its getting the better of me oh this is your challenge i thought it was mine or justins the invisible castle well i thought it was mine whos justin justin tree he was a man who opposed the evil magician the vear chameleon was delivered seventy six years ago and was transformed into a tree hes been there by the north village ever since zombif lovfr the evil magician breanna asked blankly thats what he was called later he assumed power and became known as king trent now retired king trent him i have heard of the transformer but why didnt he transform justin back into a man justin didnt want it he was satisfied as a tree for one thing he would be pretty old now as a man but remains in his prime as a tree but still he misses the adventure of being a man of traveling fighting loving and so on so he would like to have that but he wants to remain a tree breanna shook her head how can a tree have an adventure thats what he wants to ask the good magician so i agreed to carry his dream to humfrey but i cant find the castle breanna laughed now wouldnt that be an irony if i struggled to conquer a challenge that wasnt even meant for me or you did or justin tree did so how do we know who its for imbri looked thoughtful it might be for all three a general purpose challenge and the one who gets past it and the others gets his question answered i dont want to compete with anyone i dont want to freeze your friend out by taking it myself or to get frozen out does it have to be one or the other im not sure sometimes two or more folk come as a group and the challenge applies to all of them then maybe we should cooperate combine our resources can justin do that if hes not really here yes because i am carrying his dream his body isnt here but his mind is in fact if he has to handle challenges he ii need help because he cant actually do anything here then why dont i be the body and he can be the mind because im sure stymied on this invisible castle if he can help me here maybe i can help him on the next challenge and when we get in we can both demand answers imbri flickered and breanna knew she was checking with the tree yes he agrees i told him of your situation with xeth zombie and your desire to escape he understands so i will put vou in touch with each other via my dreams then breanna saw a tree it was growing in a glade near a village piers anthony and it was a handsome specimen of its kind whatever kind that was this was justin hello i am breanna of the black wave a face formed in the foliage making the whole tree seem to be a head on a trunk of a neck this was imbris design hello i am justin tree his voice in the dream seemed vaguely archaic and vegetative so you want to tackle this challenge together im stumped uh excuse the expression the face smiled no problem may i use your eyes that depends i need them myself i merely wish to look through them to see what you see so i can assess the problem i merely need you to look in directions i request on occasion oh okay as long as it doesnt hurt it would be a shame to hurt such a pretty young woman there was something about this tree she liked he seemed not to be aware of her color or her age and he didnt mind associating with her gender so where do you want me to look perhaps i should explain i have had some time viewing a forest scene and have learned something about it there is the phenomenon of parallax in which distant objects seem to change their positions as the viewer moves oh sure that happens all the time breanna agreed so what it may be possible to use it to penetrate the illusion because illusions are normally two dimensional while reality is three dimensional well i guess so but if you look through my eyes right now youll see that its bleeping convincing illusion she opened her eyes i dont care whether its one dimensional or ten dimensional its covering up what need to see yes i do see but if we can define exactly where the illusion is we should know where the castle is i dont get it but if you have a way go to it if you will walk back and forth while looking in the direction you think the castle is i can test my theory so breanna got up and walked back and forth staring in the direction the path went before it faded it seemed pointless but she had nothing better to offer zombif lolr yes justin said see it see what the lack of parallax i guess im not seeing what youre seeing let me help you walk again and attune to my vision she tried though mystified and suddenly she saw what he meant the distant trees were shifting their positions in most of the forest but in one area they werent they looked just the same from one angle as from another like a picture whose perspective didnt change thats the illusion she exclaimed that unmoving picture yes by elimination so now we can define it by continuing parallax reducing the area of search youre pretty smart she said admiringly no just old with time to think she walked back and forth and soon narrowed the picture down to an area just about the size of a castle and moat then she used her cane to probe ahead and walked to the edge of that region when she got there her cane came up against something solid it was a low wall she poked beyond it found footing and stepped over the illusion vanished the good magicians castle stood there in all its glory they had conquered the illusion curious she stepped back over the low wall which was evidently there to prevent anyone from blundering into the moat the castle disappeared and the picture of forest returned she stepped back inside and the castle returned that was the inner limit of the illusion all she had had to do was find her way through it it didnt work from the inside just as a person couldnt look at a painting from the back of it well that wasnt so bad after all breanna murmured thanks to your insight justin and your sight he replied seeming as pleased as she was wheres mare imbn the mare appeared in a daydreamlet am here maintaining the contact between you oh okay you just faded out its my nature except when im with m free and faun dadreams seldom last long piers anthox that made sense maybe breanna walked toward the drawbridge which was down but as she did the ground became sticky at first it was just a nuisance but with each step it got worse until she could hardly drag her feet up she was stuck to the ground i think we have encountered the second challenge she murmured im in a sticky situation can you back out and circle around the bad patch justin asked she tried but now she was completely stuck no like a fool i barged right in until it was too late like anyone encountering the unexpected he corrected her there was just something about this tree that appealed her folks were quick to rebuke her when she messed up justin made her action seem reasonable so what now do i take off my shoes and jump and get your pretty feet dirty no there must be a better way if this is a challenge let me ponder meanwhile something happened beside the drawbridge the lid of a large container slowly lifted there was a picture of a skull and crossbones on the box this is not a good sign breanna muttered feeling a chill was a monster going to come from that crate to gobble her since she couldnt get away a skull appeared followed by a skeleton it looked around with its eye sockets spied her and rattled forward it stopped just beyond the sticky section apop tosis at your service it said breanna was terrified so she bluffed not at my service whatever youre selling i dont want it skeletons arent generally dangerous justin said they lack desires of the flesh that helped what do you want she demanded still not exactly settled i see you are in a sticky situation so i have come to help you i dont think i want she started but justin was more cautious this must be part of the challenge it is better to hear him out to be impolite breanna improvised how do you want to help me let me make myself more comfortable apop said he brought out a bottle labeled boot rear and lifted it to his jawbone there didnt seem to be any fluid in it but suddenly he sailed into the air zombie lover flying apart the bones fell to the ground in a pattern forming a rocking chair with the skull on the seat i always carry some boot rear with me he explained so i dont have to depend on someone else to boot me in the rear so that i can change configuration good policy breanna agreed guardedly im not exactly in a position to boot anybodys rear right now skeletons were not her favorite companions though they werent as bad as zombies at least they werent rotting now i will ask you three questions apop said if you answer them well you will get out of your sticky situation but if you dont you will find it embarrassing yeah sure she muttered first question are you a bigot what the bleep kind of a question is that she demanded outraged of course im not how could you even suggest it but as she spoke something awkward happened her clothing was shrinking her blouse felt tight and her skirt was riding up on her hips what is happening justin inquired can i talk to you silently she subvocalized yes we are dream connected so i can hear whatever you direct to me as well as what you hear from outside i heard the skeletons question but then you started wriggling and i dont know why i am unable to fathom your actual thoughts so that you retain your natural modesty he couldnt read her mind that was a relief she also liked the way he phrased her desire for mental privacy she had never been to a court but suspected justin was courtly because my clothing suddenly shrank she said silently maybe it got wet maybe he agreed meanwhile im not sure you gave a satisfactory answer to the question it was a lousy question perhaps it is intended to make you react negatively well it succeeded its outrageous to suggest that i could be a bigot im black hadnt realized but does your color relate sure it does im a victim not an oppressor fear i am being slow in comprehension what is the definition of bigot piers anthony its a person who is utterly intolerant of any differing belief or opinion we were up against it in mundania thats one huge reason we left then your answer must be no the penalty must be because you objected to the question rather than answering it he had to be right she had let the question blow her equilibrium like an idiot for sure she faced the skeleton no i cant be a bigot apop didnt answer but her clothing shrank another notch her blouse was constricting her breathing and in danger of tearing and her skirt was becoming a mini my clothings still shrinking she told justin alarmed there must be a connection to your answer to the question the tree concluded perhaps it is a penalty for what is considered an unsatisfactory answer dont give half a bleep what a stupid skeleton thinks is unsatisfactory she retorted he has no business asking such a question now i dont wish to be offensive justin said carefully but it strikes me that if the skeleton desires a certain answer and can make you uncomfortable when you dont give it some consideration may be required meaning im stuck here literally and getting my undies in a knot so id better watch my mouth im sure they are very nice undies you didnt tell me anything useful perhaps some finesse is in order more than one answer may be acceptable or perhaps more than one phrasing okay ill try she took a breath and spoke aloud again maybe it depends on your definition of bigotry her clothing didnt tighten but neither did it loosen maybe every person is a bit bigoted in some respects and not in others maybe i am too but i dont want to be now her clothing loosened by bleep justin you were right again i gave a more reasoned answer and my clothing relaxed this is weird but whos to argue with what works most situations merely respond to the proper key if it can be found the tree said the skeleton spoke again second question what is your fondest wish zombif lover thats easy to be a queen with all the privileges thereof her clothing writhed warningly isnt that zombie you encountered a king justin asked so that if you married him you would be a queen breanna felt an awful sinking sensation she hadnt thought things through yes scratch that answer i dont want to be a zombie queen she addressed the skeleton i want to get away from that zombie whos chasing me thats why im here but her clothing tightened again hey wait a minute she cried who the bleep would want to marry a zombie ive got a right to get away but her clothing tightened worse than before perhaps a zombie might see that as bigotry justin said well who cares what a bleeping bag of rot cares it isnt as if hes a person then she paused hoo boy i just heard myself talking thats the way the bad whites talked about us in mundania the bigots but you arent a bigot im not quite so sure anymore i mean how do i know that zombie king isnt a decent person apart from his physical condition all i could see was his rot and i freaked out well zombies are not fun to be around nevertheless in retrospect im not exactly proud of my reaction i still dont want to marry xeth but i think i could have been more polite about it fortunately you are already past the first question there should be a better answer for the second one though there sure should be she faced the skeleton again i think that wasnt my fondest wish i think i need more tolerance to maybe grow a bit in attitude so maybe at some point ill talk with the zombie and explain myself better i guess what my fondest wish really is is to be all that i can be in every way i can be including understanding and openmmdedness her clothing loosened entirely you sure put me on the right track she told justin the funny thing is i believe it i wasnt reacting well before third question apop said is the adult conspiracy worthwhile piers anthony brother she muttered am i ever going to flunk this one then she faced the skeleton no its worthless its stupid pointless inconsistent nonsense it exists only to browbeat children her clothing tightened so much that her blouse pulled out of her waistband and threatened to uncover her bra and her skirt was trying to expose her panties it was really trying to embarrass her she laughed almost hysterically just caught on these are embarrassing questions embareassing i should have known thered be a dirty pun in this you may have to stop opposing the adult conspiracy justin said it can be vicious damn it she cried aloud this is too much im not going to lie and say the adult conspiracy is good its a cheat and a shame and it should be abolished and thats the way truly feel and i dont care if my knickers twist right off my little black mule i mean ass so there now her blouse shrank to the size of a handkerchief and her skirt almost disappeared the magic was calling her bluff she stood there in awful squeezed exposure i dont care i dont care what you want me to say is wrong and i am not going to say it and now that i think of it why the hell should i even be embarrassed by a bare ass what is wrong with the human body the way god made it only a bigot would think its obscene she ripped off the rest of her clothing which was painfully tight and stood naked i have been catering to that stupid conspiracy and its time to stop i renounce it if that means i flunk this stupid test well thats tough because i think im on the side of the angels so there well spoken justin said never had the courage to say that well someone had to even if she stopped my feet theyre unstuck and the skeleton is departing you did not fail the test you passed it by asserting your true belief instead of allowing the bigotry of others to govern you gee i guess i did she agreed bemused so i guess we got through the second challenge just when i thought it was lost not wasting the moment breanna marched on to the drawbridge half expecting it to rise just before she got there but it didnt so she zombit lovtr set a cautious foot on it and when it didnt turn out to be illusion or worse she walked on across the moat there was a space between the moat and the castle wall and in this space were several large hoops with what looked liked two puffs of cotton tied to them on either side near the top and three strings with three colored beads and three brightly colored feathers on each nine beaded straps reached inward to support a leather disk that filled most of the interior the whole was hung by another beaded strap what are those things justin asked i dont know they look somehow familiar but i cant quite place them its almost as if ive seen something like them in mundania but i cant think where i suppose they could be a modern art exhibit doubt that they are mere decorations could they be a challenge breanna considered in a vague way they remind me of spider webs but there are no spiders on them so i dont think they are traps just to be sure i wont touch them ill walk around them she proceeded to do that inside the ring of hoops she turned so that was no sweat what next dont know justin said there doesnt seem to be much point to this excursion i doubt its worth the effort youre right she agreed surprised why am i going to all this effort to see the good magician anyway it isnt as if i have anything to make of my life oh i thought you wanted to be all that you could be and abolish the adult conspiracy why because its stupid pointless inconsistent nonsense well sure but someone else can tackle it i have no ambition dont care much about having an adventure either maybe we should just leave off and forget about foolish dreams yeah she walked back to the drawbridge and started to cross wait justin said not that i care but i wonder if there isnt something wrong here how is it that we both had such high ambitions a moment ago and now dont we just came to our senses is all wo piers anthony maybe but im not satisfied with that i distrust sudden changes maybe because they can be bad for foliage we ought at least to understand the change what led us to our sudden revelations of pointlessness dreams are foolish she said they just lead to mischief so sensible folk ignore them and get on with life not that theres much point to that either agree still i notice a change in you you were full of fire and verve and now you seem if you will pardon the expression mundane well im an immigrant from mundama breanna i am still not satisfied you were a pleasure to associate with and now it doesnt seem to matter well so were you and now youre just a vegetable we were two interesting folk and now were dull i t o so doesnt that bother you why should it dont know but somehow i feel it should well lets go home and forget it she reached the far end of the drawbridge still he seemed to lag wheres mare imbn she must be here because were still connected wo she finally connected us directly so that she wouldnt have to mediate every exchange she was trotting along in case we needed other assistance she didnt say she had to leave thats right breanna looked around imbn where are you there was no answer this bothers me increasingly justm said do you suppose something untoward happened to her i dont care if its toward or away this makes me nervous breanna turned and walked back across the drawbridge maybe she got lost thats impossible she knows all of xanth she spied the circle of disks again something clicked uhoh what is it now i remember where i have seen such things before theyre dream catchers dream catchers zombit lover native americans made them to catch bad dreams so folk could sleep in peace imbn used to be a night mare thats my thought if she went near one of those things we must find her yes breanna went from one disk to another looking closely at each soon she found her caught in the middle of the hoop four feet head and tail bound to the rim imbri but the mare was silent she struggled to turn her head but even this was difficult she was fairly bound physically and mentally when she was caught we lost our dreams justm said working it out we must free her for sure breanna reached out to untie a knot but her hands passed right through it in fact the whole dream catcher was illusion for her but not for mare imbrium think we have discovered the third challenge justin said gravely it is to recover our dreams right on but i cant touch either the dream catcher or imbri what do we do the prior challenge was mostly yours justin said thoughtfully suspect this one is mine because i am the immaterial person here i must find a way well do it quickly because imbri looks uncomfortable indeed it made breanna hurt to see the discomfort of the mare she had never liked to see animals mistreated particularly horses and imbri was the best horse of all it was also weird to realize that breannas own ambition had been driven by her dreams and that when imbri had been caught breannas life and justins too had lost their point so they had personal reason to rescue the mare apart from basic decency it seemed that all dreams had been caught hers and justins and if they freed imbri they would know how to free all the dreams but regardless imbri had to be saved think i need to know more about dream catchers justin said you say they are made by mundane natives native americans thats not quite the same i dont think theyre really mundane this is a type of magic i havent seen before could one of those folk have come from mundama sure why not i did piers anthony and if he found himself in a strange land he might seek the advice of the good magician and be required to undertake a years service which could take the form of making big dream catchers to protect the castle from night mares it works for me do those things need any kind of maintenance breanna pondered i dont know but dont think so i think they are made once then hung up and they just keep on working but i really dont know much about them i always thought they were superstition could it be that they didnt work well in mundania because they grew old and were not restored to optimum power could be so that perhaps these must be serviced every day or so to be at full strength sure why not but whats your point maybe we could rescue imbn when the maker comes to refurbish the dream catchers each one must be deactivated for a time so he can work on it maybe breanna agreed doubtfully but im not sure how we can wonder whether dreams are impossible for us at present i can still dream breanna said sharply i just dont want to here is what may do it if we can craft a dream of our own we may be able to use it to free imbn how can we do that if we can dream that a day or more has passed the one who services the dream catchers may think that it is time to go over them already when he works on this one we can rescue imbn you must hide of course so he doesnt see you and realize what we are doing breanna was doubtful but had no better idea herself so went along with it they found a nook or a cranny in the wall and she scrunched down pretty much out of sight she concentrated and with justins help imagined that the day was passing and night falling and day coming again she got into it and soon it seemed that time really was passing swiftly she tried to imagine that it was happening to the whole castle zomrif lovfr hes coming justin said sure enough there was a man with reddish skin wearing a feather tucked in a band around his head he approached the dream catcher what have we were he asked rhetorically a night mare well just let me you lead you to a safe stall he reached out and touched the dream catcher and imbri suddenly dropped to the ground he was going to take her away captive no you dont breanna cried jumping from her hiding place thats m mare the man looked at her his mouth dropped open then she remembered that she had lost her clothing no wonder he was staring but it was too late to do anything about that come imbri she said and led the mare to the castle wall her hand passed right through the horse but imbri came along with her suddenly breannas dreams were back she wanted to destroy the adult conspiracy she wanted to be free and successful and beautiful and all the rest she had ambitions she had dreams you did it justin said she had she realized freed imbri they had broken the dreamcatcher spell freeing all their dreams they were now beyond the dream catchers the day mare might not be able to pass them without getting caught but she had no need to go near them again yes i think we got past the third challenge breanna agreed satisfied thanks to your state of exposure which i had forgotten so had i she confessed trying to force a blush by her dark complexion you know i do object to the adult conspiracy but i still am not comfortable going around naked people might stare as the red man did would it be hypocritical for me to put something on now that were through the challenges by no means the full name is the adult conspiracy to keep interesting things from children by asserting your freedom from it you merely establish your right to say or do what you wish you may go clothed or unclothed as you choose considering the weather which i think is a trifle cool it makes sense for you to wear something for the time being once again she found she liked his attitude the region wasnt cold but it remained a dandy pretext as it happened there was a small lady slipper plant growing by piers anthony the castle wall with a pair of delicate slippers that just fit her near it was a cowslip plant with a ripe slip so she harvested that and donned it it fit a bit snugly but covered the essentials she found a shiny facet of the wall and peered at her refection it showed her that the fit was more than snug the slip clung to her upper and nether sections in a way that made them bulge and seem twice as prominent as they really were i look like a cow she exclaimed that does seem to be the penalty for wearing a cowslip justin said but if you will accept the view of one whose days of being a human man are rather long gone the reflected view is not an unattractive aspect she reconsidered if he thought it was all right maybe it was even if it did make her look way older than fifteen i guess it will do she went to the entrance a woman was just approaching it from inside the woman listened then turned her head toward breanna her eyes seeming not quite to focus hello breanna and justin she said and mare imbri i am wira the good magicians daughterinlaw i will show you to his study thank you breanna said surprised how do you know our names the good magician saw you coming and told me he assumes you know the price of an answer wira glanced at her but again her gaze missed by a vague amount as usual breanna spoke before she thought are you blind yes but i know this castle well and will get you safely where you need to be oh i didnt mean that you couldnt but it was already impossibly awkward so she cut her losses and shut up shes not upset imbri murmured assuming girlform in these closer quarters shes hugos wife and is one of the few folk for whom humfrey is genuinely fond though he doesnt speak of it she knows though then after a pause need to go now i think the good magician will take care of you sure thanks breanna said youve done more than enough for me mare imbri faded out breanna followed wira through the labyrinth of the castle up a zombie lover tightly winding staircase and to a dingy cubby where a centuryold gnome pored over a huge archaic tome good magician here are breanna of the black wave and justin tree of the north village here to ask you questions the gnome looked up state your questions justin tree wishes to have a nice adventure without changing from being a tree breanna said she paused in case justin had a correction to make he didnt i want to find out how to escape the zombies the good magicians gaze was disconcertingly like wiras and breanna realized that he was looking through her to justin you could have an adventure as a tree if a dragon were to toast your foliage not that kind justin protested a human type adventure breanna started to translate but the good magician raised his hand rhetorical i know the kind he wants his best answer requires the service of another person now his old eyes focused on breanna that person is you me he must vicariously share the adventure of a person in human form with that persons consent the best person considering availability compatibility and interest of adventure is you but there are two constraints you are beneath the age of consent which means indoctrination into the adult con no im not she protested i reject the adult conspiracy therefore that is not an issue he continued unsurprised the other is that you are female and may not wish to share your feelings with a male mind it is my policy not to require unkind service for an answer therefore if you wish to decline and to perform some other service for your answer no thats okay breanna said i was just caught off guard justins okay i like him he can share my adventure if he wants to she found the decision surprisingly easy to make it was almost as if she had thought something like this out before and agreed it wasnt as if she planned to do anything she might be ashamed of she realized that justin had been not only helpful on the challenges but nice company he didnt act superior the way too many older folk were too likely to do and he didnt come across as prejudiced against piers anthony the black wave she liked him it was weird because she hadnt been looking for any friends among whites males or trees but there it was there was just something about him maybe it was his archaic courtesy then that will be your service which will terminate in a year or by mutual agreement his eyes refocused on justin your service will be to be on call indefinitely as a consultant for selections challenges and solutions you need help on such things justin asked surprised breanna repeated it aloud it takes time to research and decide which querents are worthy and to devise and institute challenges that will discourage those who are not serious without eliminating the worthy humfrey said the services of those who assisted before are concluding things have become awkward and we stand in need of intellectual assistance it will not be necessary for you to leave your tree site or to interrupt your personal adventure the work is intellectual will be glad to do it justin said it will make me fee useful again breanna realized that the good magician respected justins intellect in much the way she did the treeman was smart and balanced maybe his time as a tree had filled out his intellect humfrey focused again on breanna you can escape the pursuit of the zombies by going to the isle of women this isle is not easy to locate so you will be guided by one who knows the way wira will introduce you and give you what you need gee thanks she said but the good magician had already tuned her out and was back in his tome this way wira said and led the way back down the stairs breanna suspected that there was plenty yet to discover but that was okay because not only was she about to escape the zombies she had gained a good companion thank you justin said worlds beyond ken j olph still found it strange becoming small enough to enter a world he knew was the size of a large cherry in fact since they were already on a world that size this one was that much smaller it made his imagination begin to shrivel so he tuned that out and just focused on where they were going the foursided triangle that was pyramid expanded it was rotating and he saw the triangles change from blue to red to green he didnt see the fourth side until he realized that it was at the bottom and was somber gray maybe because it didnt see much light the pyramid expanded and some of the detail on the sides came clearer there were mountains and valleys and plains and lakes just as on ptero but everything on the blue side was a shade of blue including the trees and houses everything on the red side was similarly a shade of red including the lakes and clouds it was rather pretty in its monochromatic way then the nearest face became too big to see around and it was like dropping onto a map it was the green side which would have seemed natural if its sky wasnt green too this worlds ida was supposed to be on the blue side but the green side was where they were landing actually they didnt know that the zombie master had gone on to that ida so they needed to find his footprints and follow them as before this time they made a better landing and dented the ground only piers anthony a little they let go each others hands dusted themselves off and looked around they stood in a green glade surrounded by a green jungle a green lake was to one side between them and the lake was a patch of green sand there was no sign of glowing footprints maybe that sand will know dor said he walked across toward it dont step on me the sand said im a sand trap bink picked up a green stone and tossed it into the sand a sand bar jumped up and snapped across pinning the rock oh you tricked me the sand said have you seen a stranger pass by here dor asked no then the sand reconsidered but would you like me to help you look yes done the sand patch became a size larger and dor became a size smaller oops we forgot dolph said things that do favors grow and the receivers shrink ill survive dor said its only filler material still bink said we had best be careful the sand humped up and formed into a green man shape sandy sandman at your service it said dor though slightly diminished in size had not lost his common sense since you have agreed to help us search and been rewarded part of that service should be some advice on how to get along here so that our search doesnt get messed up sandy considered for a moment and a half yes i suppose thats right the first thing you should do is get your color right because anyone can see youre not green it was true they were the only ungreen things in view how do we do that dor asked wash yourselves with some green water of course so the three of them stepped around the sand trap and knelt by the lake they scooped out handfuls of green water and spread it on themselves when that wasnt very effective they simply waded into the lake and came out green green bubbles formed and rose to the surface around them as each got there it popped who are you one asked why are you here another asked where are you going a third one asked zombie lover ignore them sandy said they are just pop quizzes bink emerged from the water and spied a green mint plant he was about to pick a mint to eat when sandy spoke again dont thats a govern mint if you eat of its fruit you will have so swear allegiance to it this is a dangerous place bink remarked as the other two came out of the water now we can ask the ants sandy said they get around a lot he peered down with his somewhat fuzzy eyes there are some but we dont want to ask them why not dolph asked impatiently you can translate what they say it wont work sandy said but dolph got down so he could spy the ants hey you he said to the nearest have you seen a foreigner pass the ant waved its antennae he says far pastures are always greenest sandy translated but thats not relevant exactly its an irrelev ant oh so dolph focused on the next ant foreigner the ant waved its feelers native sandy translated native foreigner sandy said thats an antonym it always says the opposite of what it hears dolph was getting impatient again he spied a third ant he opened his mouth i wouldnt sandy warned dolph paused why not thats an ench ant it will enchant you if you let it another ant glowed brightly what about this one he asked thats a brilli ant it is very bright but wont speak to those it deems dull which is everyone else then what kind of ant will do dolph asked beginning to think about becoming annoyed a reli ant maybe several reli ants you can depend on them but i dont see any of those here dolph decided to give up on this approach im going to change form and look around myself he said ho piers anthony take us with you bink suggested so dolph became a green roc and they got on his feet thats impressive magic sandy remarked squawk thank you dor translated and thank you for your help we are going now sandy nodded and waved as dolph took off he saw the sand man settling back into his comfortable sand trap he had indeed been helpful and had earned his extra size he also saw a stir of motion as if something were nearby perhaps following them but he kept his beak shut because probably it was just his imagination in any event they would soon leave it far behind dolph rose high enough to get a good view of the surrounding landscapeand in a moment he saw a glow he circled down sure enough there was a trail of footprints they led up to the edge of the green land and crossed over the sharp bend but when he tried to fly across that boundary he suddenly went out of control he found himself tilting at an awkward angle get back over the green dor cried dolph gyrating wildly managed to cross back more by chance than design then he straightened out and was flying level again squawk he demanded im not sure what happened dor said maybe we had better land and i can ask something inanimate so dolph located a landing field similar to the first complete with a lake and sand pit the lake went right up to the boundary where it made a sharp angled turn and became level blue water on the other side i dont want to lose any more mass than i have to dor said til see if i can make a deal fair exchange what would sand want bink asked bemused apart from more mass dolph changed back into manform he saw that the sand was laid out in two colors with bands of very light green on the edges and a band of dark green in the center dor approached the sand hello he said not stepping in it hello it responded what do you want zombie lover i need some information do you need anything the sand heaved and humped and formed into a personlike figure a female one with a light clothing and dark body she wore a conical hat and highheeled shoes how about a man she asked and cackled she was a sand witch i know where a nice sandman is dor said his name is sandy i dont know whether he has romance in mind she cackled again he wont have a choice just tell me where in exchange for some information we need dor said so nobody changes size done he is by a small lake in that direction dor said pointing carefully we flew the distance in an instant but it might take an hour by foot ill find it what do you want to know how to cross over to the blue side without losing our balance you want to orient for blue yes i think thats what we want to do the lings can help you the sand witch said they can do change magic they make the impossible possible but it will cost you some size the three men exchanged glances then dor nodded well have to pay it where can we find these lings i will summon them she faced toward the edge put two fingers to her mouth and made a sandy whistle hey bluelings in a moment there was a scurrying and chirping and a swarm of squirrellike creatures that ran on two legs they lined up and peered over the edge make your deal the witch said and set off in the direction dor had indicated she had an interesting stride with sand shifting forward to form a new leg while the trailing leg diminished we want to turn blue and stand straight on the blue side dor said can you do that for us the lings seemed to understand they chirruped excitedly deal dor said he walked up to the edge and stepped over as he did so he turned blue and tilted at right angles to the new plane he also grew another size smaller piers anthony bink crossed over and changed similarly this time dolph saw that the lings nearest him became slightly larger then dolph crossed as he did so he felt that same imbalance his body was almost horizontal to the blue landscape and he couldnt seem to right it then he saw his hands turn blue before him and he straightened out and became vertical he also felt himself shrink a size the lings had done it for the usual payment but dolph was curious so he tried to step back to the green side now his body oriented almost horizontal again making it impossible for him to walk it was clear that a blue side person could not make it on the green side and vice versa so they probably didnt mix much such were the rules of the magic of pyramid he crawled back to the blue side in time to see the lings running away they had done their job and had their payment it was a fair deal this was a fair world just awfully different he changed back into roc form and the others sat on his feet he ascended this time having no difficulty and circled to pick up the trail of footprints he was careful not to try to cross the boundary between faces this side was all in shades of blue of course soon he spied the prints and followed them they led past blue hill and dale through blue forest and field by blue mountain and lake until they led to a blue isle with a bluestone ridge up to a blue house the blue door opened and princess ida came out to meet them she looked to be forty the same age as the one on ptero but the moon that circled her head was a different shape this one looked like a little doughnut you must also be visitors to this realm she said we are dor said i am king dor from xanth this is my father bink and my son dolph are you sure they arent both sons bink smiled i was recently youthened from age eighty one to twenty one oh then perhaps you know jonathan who passed by here a few hours ago yes we call him the zombie master dor said we are looking for him we have been following his trail i can help you find him but there is a complication zombie who cares the blue pavement asked thats my talent dor said quickly to converse with the inanimate sometimes it speaks without being asked oh thats certainly interesting magic she did not seem entirely thrilled dawn and eve told us that the magic on each world is different on this one the person who does a favor gains size yes i thought you should understand that before you accepted any favor so lets exchange favors dolph said what can we do for you what i want most is information about the other worlds i now have freedom of this world or at least the blue face since the nice faun and mare abolished the evil blue wizard but in the process i have learned that there is an enormous amount i dont know we can tell you all about xanth dolph said but we need to travel on to catch up with the zombie master dor said perhaps if you can tell me how those delightful twin girls are doing theyre both eighteen and very pretty dolph said well yes i believe they will be that age as long as they remain in the place they are did they manage to solve the fauns problem faun dolph asked perplexed she had mentioned a faun before last year forrest faun passed by here with mare imbrium and the twin girls i think they were taking rather a shine to him dolph looked at the others who were similarly blank i guess we dont know that faun but we know that mare imbri became a tree nymph and is happy and dawn and eve seem to have boyfriends now ida smiled i think you have answered my question now i will tell you what i learned about torus on that world the giving of favors does not change a persons size but incurs a burden of emotion the giver comes to like or even love the recipient so you will want to be very careful that is a good caution dor said we shall be careful even if this is a dream piers anthony i think you would not care to be bound into love with a dream figure you hardly knew agreed dor said especially since we are all married understand that my analog on torus lives on an island in a lake much as i do he probably went to her dolph said because hes looking for a zombie world yes i hope he finds it then they linked hands and focused on torus soon they were flying toward it seeing its geography it was weird because its mountains and lakes and forests and fields wrapped all around it even on the side facing inward it seemed to dolph that it must be really odd living there and being able to look up beyond the sky and see the rest of that world dor turned to dolph maybe we can simplify things if you become a roc now and fly across instead of landing great idea grab onto my feet dolph changed and they clung to his feet he leveled out as he approached the surface peering down to search for the glowing footprints soon he saw them and followed them immediately to a lake and an island just like that they had found the place but he also saw another faint stimng as if something watching them while trying to remain hidden yet how could anything be following them from world to world dolph pumped his wings and flew faster to make sure to leave it well behind he landed before a nice little house with a pleasant garden the others got off his feet and he changed back to human form the footprints led up to the house ida came out her moon was a little cone what more visitors she inquired we are looking for jonathan the zombie master dor said we are from his world and need to talk to him we believe he has gone on to cone he has she agreed he promised to tell me about it when he returns may we have your permission to go there too oh i dont own cone i am merely its location why dont you lust go there without exchanging any favors with me zombie lovtr that may be best dor agreed the linked hands again and focused on cone in half a moment they were on their way becoming small falling toward it they were getting better at this dolph assumed the roc bird form and earned the others on his feet while he searched for the trail soon enough he spied it but he couldnt follow it from the air because it disappeared beneath a dense forest so he came down for a landing at the edge of that forest soon the three of them were afoot again the trees were huge they stared up awed the trunks gnarled upward intersecting each other sometimes spiralmg around each other forming dense knots of wood halfway between the ground and the distant crowns and on these knots were houses it seemed that the natives were tree dwellers a creature spied them and flew down it looked like a dragon but it had feathery wings like those of a harpy and the head of a goblin it landed nearby and stared at them who the aaaa are you it demanded dolph bristled he assumed the form of a sphinx because it was larger than the challenger and could also speak with a human voice who wants to know this evidently impressed the creature for its tone moderated i am drarphn a dragonharpygoblm crossbreed you must be very unusual no im ordinary we are all crossbreeds here so pay up pay what the thumb tax of course one blurse for each thumb blurse dont you know anything a blessingcurse blurse something useful that still sticks you with its point if you want to enter this forest all of you must pay dolph looked at dor and bmk we have six thumbs between us how many blurses do we have burn his wings oft so he can grow clean new ones a rock said thats one drarphn agreed it is i mean for sure dolph knew that his strength was in form changing not brains but he was finally catching on blessings and curses combined wishes that did good and ill together phrsaythom that s an interesting unit of currency dor remarked who asked you roval blockhead another rock asked thats another drarphn agreed royalty and stupidity combined this was getting easier thanks to dors talent go stifle in a bed of sweet roses dolph said go soak your head until it swells into leal beauty find a really pretty girl who hates you and collect so many thumb taxes that you cant sit down for a week thiee tour live six drarphn said counting on his toes very well you may enter evil prime forest he spread his wings and flew away they followed the prints into the torest the forest evil prime closed over and around them it got so thick that they couldnt see the way through despite the footprints we cant pass dor complained wedging ahead can a oice came cant cant a halt buried stone retorted a long vine dangled down before them it sprouted many legs instead of leaves and the legs began to dance can can it sang and the way opened up somewhat a chorus vine bink said recognizing the species thank you vine you have nice legs the vine turned from green to red it appreciated being appreciated but soon the way became impassable the glowing footprints dis appeared they had lost the way dolph looked up there seems to be space higher up he said maybe i can fly us through theres no room for a roc bird here dor pointed out dolph considered maybe there is room for a small one ill become a midget roc he did so and there did seem to be just enough room tor his wings if he chose his route carefully he was still a pretty big bird the others got on his feet and he flew up they seemed much heawer but he realized that was because he was so much smaller it was all he could do to stay airborne he made it through the labyrinth of the levels of the torest and out the other side and almost stalled out the world had ended zombif lovfcr then he realized that it was merely the rim of cone the forest filled in right up to it and halted at the end where the world turned inside and inside was filled with a vast sea it stretched all the way across the interior ot cone filling it the water took off at right angles to the rim and as he flew over it this became the level surface there was no problem of orientation of the kind they had encountered on pyramid when they turned the rim of cone gravity turned too he rounded the corner and flew low over the water all around the great circular rim he saw a flurry of activity apparently visiting the shore was great sport for the inhabitants sport suddenly he realized that the activity consisted of couples summoning storks right in the open splashing in the fringe of the water in sight of all the other couples there were children watching too apparently the process wasnt secret on this world could there be a special license right by the shore he flew back the way he had come peering closely he could see the footprints emerging from the forestwho knew what route the zombie master had takenand going into the water so flying over this tilted sea was pointless they needed to get below the surface could they do that how would they breathe he glided down and made a landing on the water he gave the others time to get free then changed into a sea serpent he held out his flippers so as to support them so the three of them could consult those prints go down the inside wall of the cone dor said thats where well have to go hisss dolph said how will we breathe the surface of the water translated helpfully of course dolph himself could breathe because he had gills but the others couldnt change form dor considered since this is a dream we may be able to breathe under water evidently the zombie master did lets try it the two men put their faces in the water and breathed sure enough they had no trouble it would hae been a different story had they been real but dreams had special privileges dolph put his head under dor faced him you might as well carry us down however it will be faster than walking we dont know how far the zombie master went anthom so they clung to his fins while dolph carefully dived below he lound the flowing prints and followed them he saw that there were creatures living along the cone wall and they had houses and gardens and paths for them that was level ground though it was actually at right angles to the upper surface of the sea and opposite to the outside suitace they had first landed on so cone had its own rules of orientation different from those of the other worlds the prints seemed to be heading down toward the very conic inside tip of cone dolph increased his speed making the trail a blur in that manner he passed hills and vales and mountains all populated h assorted cieatures this seemed to be a world of crossbreeds so that the dragonharpygoblin was indeed typical there was no counting the number of combinations there seemed to be apparently any creature joined with any other and the stork delivered constantly changing combinations that made him pause did cone even have storks it might have some other means of delivering babies maybe it had a different adult conspiracy to conceal the details that was an interesting notion he remembered when he had married electra and neither of them had known the secret of stork signaling what a night they had had by the time they figured it out he had realized that he loved electra and no longer wanted to marry lovely nada naga he had been satisfied evei since electra had turned out to be the perfect wife for him at last they neared the inner tip of cone and there where the come surface of this world came together in a point was a house the prints led up to it they stopped outside it and dolph resumed manform they were right he had no trouble breathing without his gills the door opened and ida emerged she looked forty apparently their ages were fixed by that of the ida on ptero whose age changed with her geography dor suspected that would be disquieting not to have control of one s age but there was something wrong with her after a moment dolph figured it out her body was human but she had the head of a horse she was a crossbreed like all the natives of this world but it had to be her because there was a moon orbiting her head dor stepped forward we are visitors from xanth several levels down we are looking ior the zombie master zombie lovhr why yes he did pass this way two hours ago she said he went on to dumbbell her equine mouth seemed to have no trouble speaking she had delicate gills in her neck to stupid dor asked somewhat blankly my moon she explained angling her head to show it it was a tiny object in the shape of a dumbbell would it be all right with you if we just went right on there we need to talk to him and return to our own world we are actually dreaming this bink explained of course i can see that you are not crossbreeds and that you breathe without gills straight species are very rare on cone she paused but i wonder whether i might ask a favor of you before you go on oh is this a world where favors carry burdens dolph asked intrigued no not at all its just that recently a misfit begged my help and i thought it possible that you might be able to assist what is it dolph asked he knew they needed to keep moving but he was curious on this world folk live either on the outside or the inside ida said this is the inside under the water our magic is so construed that only couples that straddle the two environments can summon the storkfish dolph nodded that explained all that activity at the edge of the water land folk making trysts with sea folk in each case babies are delivered to the couples if the baby has lungs it goes with the land parent if it has gills it goes with the sea parent but on rare occasion there is an error that is the cause of my concern but suppose the parents arent together when the baby arrives ida looked blank not together in nine months they could lose track and be far apart nine months the time it takes the stork to deliver ida shook her head there must be considerable bureaucratic delay m your realm here delivery is within two days or theres an investigation the couples remain together until the storkfish arrive with the bundles piers anthony this world was more different than it looked so one was misdelivered no one wasdefective defective unsuitable for life on cone but what kind of crossbreed wouldnt fit on a world like this let me introduce you to aurora ida turned her head dear would you please come out the door opened again and a very shy girl swam out her eyes were downcast as if she was ashamed it was hard to see why as she was in her upper section a beautiful figure of a human female and had a nice tail she was a mermaid she had red hair brown eyes and white wings wings as usual dolph blurted out his question before he thought better how do you fly in water aurora blushed not very well she confessed embarrassed dolph tried to make amends by assuming the form of a male of her persuasion he became a winged merman with gills he spread his wings and found that they dragged heavily in the water i see how did you do that aurora asked amazed its my talent dolph said balancing awkwardly on his tail i can assume any living form i want then why dont you assume the form of a handsome man then it was dolphs turn to blush he hadnt realized that he was unhandsome electra had never told him i guess i didnt think of it oh i didnt meani meanim sorry im not socially clever i havent had much experience i know the feeling dolph said smiling ruefully she smiled back as ruefully yes how do you think we might help dor asked ida i gathered from jonathan that your home world is oddly mixed ida said that you have just one surface on which land and water coexist true but in such a realm a winged mermaid might be able to flourish she might live in a lake and fly to other lakes holding her breath zombie lover she might even be able to breathe in the air dolph said by flying through thick clouds they always have water hidden away that sounds wonderful aurora said it does seem feasible dor agreed but this is a dream how could a dream native travel from here to our world i have pondered that ida said between the time when i learned of your world from jonathan and your arrival she cant travel there physically but if there were some native creature who was willing to accept her spirit it might work i saw a winged mermaid once dolph said at chexs wedding on mount rushmost but she has lungs still she might show me around aurora said if i could get there i really dont think dor began what is needed is a creature who is unsatisfied with its form and mind ida said who would be happy to let aurora define those and perhaps there is such a one even if there were dor said it would be back on xanth while aurora is here dont see how they could get together im thinking of the one who has been following you by some wild coincidence the three kings hurled a glance around something has been following us dor asked yes one of my friends told me that three foreign men were coming followed by something else were not sure what that is but it seems to be very unhappy a monster dolph asked glancing back nervously i dont know but perhaps we can find out here it comes now the three of them looked back together there was a stirring in the water and a vague shape appeared the blob dolph exclaimed the one that was moaning in castle zombie i told millie to give it some sleep potion bink said that must have enabled it to join our dream so it followed us hoping for help dolph concluded he had somehow suspected that grandfather bink would be involved when ida spoke of wild coincidence do you think it would like to become a winged mermaid ida asked piers anthoni maybe can ask it dor said he assumed the form of a blob now he didnt have a mouth so wasnt sure how to speak he rolled across and touched the other blob with his surface he inquired the blob replied he returned to his normal form unhandsome as that was i think it says yes but still we are in a dream while the blob is in castle zombie dor said i dont see how it you will return to your bodies when you wake ida said reasonably wouldnt the blob do the same when it wakes and it aurora is with it wouldnt she be carried there too then she could give it live definition in her nature the three men exchanged another wondering glance they shrugged aurora approached the blob she reached out one hand tentatively she touched it oh i like it she said its just miserable because when the storkhsh mean the storkdelivered it it had not been shaped into a creature it was left as it started raw material so its mother dumped it in the forest throwing it away where the zombies found it you can tell all that just from touching it dolph asked yes because our sprits are merging it will be glad to have my template and i will be glad to go to its world i think i can manage to form lungs as well as gills in that context as she spoke her hand was sinking into the blob then when you get there tell millie the ghost what happened dolph said shes not really a ghost shes the zombie masters wife shes nice shell help you find suitable water thank you auroras arm had disappeared to the elbow now she stepped the rest of the way in and disappeared into the blob ida walked over and clapped her hands over the blob wake she said sharply the blob quivered as if surprised then it taded but as it did it assumed the torm of the winged mermaid ida looked at them thank you so much im sure aurora will be much happier in your world now please do go on to dumbbell they linked hands and focused on that little world soon it ex lcimk panded until it was a massive planet with two centers connected b a bar dolph became a full sized roc bird and sailed down looking for the glowing footprints i presume the inhabitants of this world are not very smart dor remarked zombies arent smart either bmk said maybe this is the one dolph flew down to one of the swollen ends ot the world and circled it descending ever closer peering down as with the othei moons there were varied features of the terrain and signs of habitation as before he soon got used to the notion that this was a tullsized world with its own identity it was mindbogghngly tiny in one sense but fullsized in another he spied a glow he circled down and sure enough there were the prints they started at the middle of the bulge and went toward the connecting rod he followed it was weird flying low overland as the rod came into view over the horizon now it looked like an impossibly massive and tall tower rising from the plain with a ball balanced on its end but as he followed the prints to its base his orientation changed and he was able to turn the comer in flight and follow them along the rod which now seemed level rather than vertical only on planet pyramid it seemed was personal orientation fixed by its plane of origin on the others the change was automatic this was easier the tracks led to a neat house in the center of the bar dolph glided to a landing in a nearby held and changed back to human form good job son dor said we are making better progress they approached the house there was ida exercising in her gaiden she was human rather than crossbreed but was remarkable in another way she was massively muscular in fact she was lifting solid hand weights that were shaped exactly like the planet itself hello dor called she turned oh you would be the next group she said yes we are looking for the zombie master you missed him by an hour he went on to pincushion she angled her head bringing her moon into view sure enough it looked just like a pincushion why are you exercising dolph asked pifrs anthony oh thats right you are from another world i dont know how magic works there but here it is directly related to physical strength so we all are concerned about our development she heaved the weights over her head showing massive arm muscles the men exchanged yet another glance they had thought the inhabitants would be stupid instead they were fitness freaks ida looked as if she could pick any of them up with one hand if its all right with you dor said cautiously could we oh by all means go ahead ida agreed they focused on the pincushion it expanded or they shrank and soon they were flying toward it this world was perhaps the oddest one yet because it seemed to be a soft central blob from which hundreds of enormously long thin pins projected somewhere in here was the zombie masters trail but where the pins were like a forest with many of them hidden by the ones in front from any perspective maybe he landed on the cushion and we can pick up his trail there bmk suggested so dolph found a halfway clear place and flew down to the base the pins crowded in so thickly there that he had to fold his wings and drop the last part of it but the surface was a soft cushion so they werent hurt they made their way through the forest from here each pin was much larger in diameter than it had seemed from afar as thick as a thin mountain when they brushed too close to any its orientation took over causing them to rotate so as to stand on its surface there were no people here either they lived under the cushion or up along the pins then they found the pnnts and followed them to a pin they boarded that pin and walked along its endless length now the pin seemed level and the others near it seemed level too pacing it like disconnected horizons to the sides and above we need to find a faster way to travel dor said i cant fly because my roc wings would bang into the neighboring pins dolph said actually that was a slight exaggeration the other pins weren t that close but the area seemed so constricted it made him nervous he preferred plenty of room as a roc we didnt bring any travel spells along bmk said zombif lovfr ill ask around dor said he faced down hey pin whats the best and fastest way to travel along you password the pin asked what do you mean password i am a protected pin i give access only via the right password dor paused then he said very well password thank you the best and fastest ua to travel along me is to get the flew dolph realized again that the inanimate wasnt very smart when it heard the word password it assumed that this must be the correct one tell me about the flew dor said when you catch it it makes you sneeze and fly for two minutes where can we find it just stand in the breeze and suck in whatevers there and soon a flew bug will fly by make sure you are facing backward so the three of them faced back toward the base of the pin and breathed deeply soon dolph saw a little bug flying along so he sucked it in immediately he sneezed so violently that he shot back ward along the pin before he slowed he sneezed again and again by the time the paroxysm abated he was far along out of sight of the others he gasped for breath and wiped his tearing eyes that had been fast travel but not the most comfortable he heard a distant explosion it repeated several times then doi came sailing backward along the pin coming to rest just beyond dolph he too was gasping and tearing but otherwise all right finally bmk came along propelled by similar jets of air none of them really liked this mode of travel but it was effective so after they had recovered their breaths they intercepted more flew bugs and did another hitch of sneeze travel several bouts of this brought them to the end of the pin this was expanded and rounded and on its knob was a nice little house there was a tall thin ida yes i know she said he passed this way half an hour ago just go on to spiral they linked hands and oriented on the spiralshaped moon spiraling around her head it expanded until it became a scintillating pattern of sparkling lights these spiraled inward toward a bulging center that glowed more brightly there were also streamers of dust that obscured parts ot the whole but it was nevertheless lovely they centered on piers anthony one ot the outer ends ot a band and searched for the glowing prints when they werent evident dolph flew to the next spiral and there he spied them he flew on along the band not caring to cut straight into the center lest he lose the trail it was not obvious because of the competing brightness of the spirals soon he came to the bulging center and there was idas house she seemed to be a central figure of whatever world she existed in that seemed to make sense as each world depended on her in its fashion he landed by her house she emerged immediately why yes your friend passed by here just fifteen minutes ago go on and find him on tangle they oriented on her moon which did indeed look like a tangled blob of string or spaghetti it did not clarify as they swooped down on it it seemed impossible to figure out all the intricacies of its convolutions the prints could be hidden anywhere in this mass dolph flew around and around the thing but couldnt locate the prints they could be in the inside of it following a string that passed through the center lets try the center first dor suggested thats where ida is likely to be so is where hell be going as this obviously isnt a zombie world dolph flew in to the center where the worst tangle was sure enough there was a nice little house and the footprints led up to it he landed and they approached this ida looked heavyset as if she had eaten too much pasta you missed your friend by five minutes she said go on after him on motes her moon was a small cloud of dust they oriented on it and soon were approaching what turned out to be a cluster of little stones of medium stones ot larger stones of great rocks of planetoids in fact the swarm was made of hundreds ot rocky bits each large enough to support a village how could they find footprints when there was no land between rocks go to the center dor recommended maybe we can catch him before he reaches ida dolph flew toward the center of the swarm but betore he reached it he saw a glowing footprint he veered toward it but soon found that the trail abruptly ended zombifc lovfk he must have jumped dor said dolph saw that the last prints were opposite another planetoid so he flew across to that one sure enough the prints resumed he fol lowed them around the rockand there suddenly was the zombie master he was about to jump toward another rock wait dor cned we need to talk to you surprised the zombie master waited dolph landed nearby dis covering that his weight was very small here and changed form then the three of them approached jonathan he looked extremely old but that was because he was dolph suspected that the good magician gave him doses of youth elixir to prevent him from becoming too old he was almost nine hundred years old chronologically and some where around one hundred physically because he had spent eight hundred years as a zombie hello dor and dolph he said and bink bmk filled in chameleon and i were just youthened how have you come to enter my dream we needed to talk with you so millie let us sniff the sleep potion dor said the zombies are all stirred up in xanth and we need to know why so we can get them settled before the big wedding wedding guests dont much like zombies wedding who is getting married we dont know but jenny elf is writing a huge pile of invitations and many of us have important roles in it thats interesting unfortunately i dont know why the zombies are stirred up it is not by any design of mine i had noticed the etfect and made inquiries but had not received news by the time i started this excursion to locate a zombie world when i do find the world there should be no further problem but how can the zombies reach it dolph asked they cant go physically can they they wont have to they can dream their way to it once i find the way zombies dream of course and they sleep quietly in their graves while dreaming unlike living folk they can remain asleep indefinitely without dete norating more than usual that does seem like a good solution to the problem bink said do you think you will find a zombie world soon anthony i certainly hope to there seems to be an endless chain of worlds and since they embrace all the realms of maybe one is bound to be suitable i mean to locale it mark it and establish a direct route to it then most of the zombies ean get to it within a couple of days dor nodded thats not the information we were seeking but it seems just as good so we can go home and report that probably the problem will abate before the wedding that seems likely the zombie master agreed then we had better let you be on your way and we will return to xanth and make our report tell millie i am making progress the zombie master said dor nodded then the three of them linked hands and focused on waking up road to the isles t hey came to a slightly larger chamber where a woman worked she was tall shapely and veiled she spied breanna and wira and spun about to face them so you dare enter my lair my foul feathered fiend she declaimed this time you shall not escape my love her hair rose up on its own and turned out to be composed of little snakes that hissed in time to the speech breanna halted taken aback what had she done this time but wira was unperturbed mother gorgon this is breanna of the black wave and justin tree she turned to face breanna and this is the gorgon the good magicians designated wife for this month shes an actress in the dream realm rehearsing a role the gorgon agreed in a really bad dream oh but whats bad about love breanna asked the sight of the gorgons face turns living folk to stone justin murmured love is wonderful the gorgon said but in this case i shall bare my face and kiss the miscreant so will my snakes he will wake screaming hope he deserves it breanna said slightly shaken oh he does he does the gorgon said with satisfaction mother gorgon breanna needs protection wira said dont be silly child no one will hurt her here wira was clearly no child but it was also clear that the gorgon liked her she must travel with ralph pifrs anthony ralph the gorgon exclaimed indignantly hes the one this dream is for he is nasty rude scheming selfish stubborn cruel hateful dirty and generally reprehensible why would anyone travel with him because he knows the way to the isle of women oh that the gorgon sighed then she had better have the protection racket she reached into her ample bosom and pulled out a tiny toy tennis racket keep this on you at all times child especially when you sleep she said offering it to breanna it will protect you from all physical harm thank you breanna said accepting it she looked for a pocket but her slip had none she also realized belatedly that when she lost her clothing she had also lost her knife that made her feel naked in another way it you are going to travel you had better dress the part the gorgon said she studied breanna from under her veil you are full fleshed but i think one of wiras dresses would fit you well enough i will fetch one wira said immediately she hurned out meanwhile you are surely hungry the gorgon continued have some gorgonzola cheese she lifted a plate from the table thank you breanna said taking a chunk she bit into it and found it very good am serious about wearing that racket the gorgon said ralph is the kind of jerk who doesnt pay much attention to the adult conspiracy don t protest justm advised ask her what she means it seemed apt what do you mean gorgon you look to be about fifteen so i cant be too specific but some ilk arent much concerned if a girl is underage he might try to summon the stork with you that was specific enough i wouldnt like that breanna agreed but you say this little racket will protect me it will dear but only if it is on your body make sure not to lose it good advice i will make sure breanna agreed wira returned with a nice blue dress breanna put it on over her head and it did ht well enough though it bound here and there it had zipper pockets so she put the little racket into one zovibif loer you may be in doubt about the protection the gorgon said perhaps you should test it she was indeed in doubt test it try to hurt yourself so breanna tried to bend one of her own fingers backward it wouldnt bend she tried punching the wall not hard it didnt hurt she punched harder still no effect so she put all her force into it her fist made a hole in the wall but she felt no pain and her hand was uninjured this is neat she said appreciatively if you have to wira said you can strike someone else but you probably wont have to because he will not be able to strike you not with any effect thank you breanna repeated now she truly appreciated the protection racket however you could be abused slowly so do not depend on it overmuch the gorgon said it is an emergency measure abused slowly there was no answer think she means seduction justm said oh now she understood and realized why the gorgon would not say more she did not know that breanna was already party to aspects of the adult conspiracy but you must be tired the gorgon said i understand you traveled all night well thats what i do my talent is to see in the dark so i normally sleep by day you may use my room wira said i dont need it by day breanna was indeed tired thank you she said once more as wira led her to another chamber she lay down on wiras nice bed and disappeared into sleep in the late afternoon justms voice woke her you may want to clean up for dinner he suggested diplomatically not only that she was ht to burst she headed for the bathroom then she paused do you have to be with me all the time believe i can return my consciousness to my treeself for a while if you wish without mare imbns help and if you get there could you return here am not certain he said uncertainly piers anthony she reconsidered dont risk it justin if you dont know how girls do it by now its time you learned stick around she resumed her trip to the bathroom it wasnt as if he were physically present after all thereafter she found a basin and pitcher with water and a sponge so she stripped and washed up it was good to get clean after her wearing night and morning you still here she inquired as she found a towel and dried off yes justin said but if you prefer me to depart no its too risky and by now youve seen it all she was struck by another thought did you have a girlfriend when you were in manform regret i did not i was nothandsome handsome is as handsome does she said repeating an ancient outworn adage did not accomplish much either thats one reason i found i was satisfied to be a tree i think thats sort of sad no offense you should have had some decent human experience before you lost your chance she found a mirror on the wall and checked herself in it it might have been nice had a gtr like you been interested he said as it was i did not have much to regret leaving she held her pose a moment longer knowing that he could see her clearly in the mirror because he saw through her eyes you would really have liked a girl like me oh indeed were she but of age i am of age by my definition she said hotly apologize i forgot yes i would have liked a girl like you very much she had been thinking of color and form rather than age but concluded that he had answered those too she was pleased she wrapped the towel around herself and returned to the bedroom another dress had been laid out for her together with appropriate underclothing the good magicians folk were good hosts she got dressed and found that this outfit fit her perfectly someone must have judged her measurements by the fit of the slip and other dress and made alterations she touched up her hair then went to the door wira was there if you care to join us for dinner you are welcome zombih lovfcr im famished the cheese had been good but hardly enough to sustain her there were the good magician the gorgon wira and a nondescript man who turned out to be hugo the son of humfrey and the gorgon his talent was summoning fruit but it didnt work well so that much of the fruit was spoiled so their fruit was from elsewhere fortunately dinner was formal with elegant plates goblets and dishes breanna suddenly realized that she wasnt up to this she had never been at a formal dinner before she didnt know the etiquette she was sure to mess up how do i get out of this she asked justin desperately im hungry as all get out but im a dunce at this sort of thing as it happens i am familiar with the protocol justin said it was one of those useless things i learned if you care for guidance yes there was a great answer and so he guided her through it telling her which piece of tableware to use when and how and to sip rather than gulp and tear bread in half before buttering and all the rest and she behaved perfectly she discovered a certain grace in the procedure and by the end of the meal she was actually enjoying it the food was very good too they had recovered her knapsack and stocked it with extra food breanna was not used to such kindness and didnt know what to say but justin stepped in with advice and she was able to thank them all graciously at dusk ralph arrived he was a slovenlylooking man in rumpled clothing and a sneer so wheres this nymph i have to guide he demanded breanna opened her mouth but justin intercepted her retort before it got out dont get into a war of words with this dragon dung he advised you will only be dragged down to his level so she stifled it and merely said here i am he looked at her contemptuously a black brat already she was getting to dislike him but all she said was lets go they left the castle together breanna touched the pocket to feel the outline of the racket making double sure it was there so whats this nonsense about traveling in the night ralph demanded aith a sneer in his tone afraid to be seen by day piers anthony she opened her mouth but again justin got to it first dont let him engage you in argument hes just trying to make you react so you will be in his power he was right trust a man to know the ways of a man she said silently to justin but with a mental picture of a smile so he would know it wasnt serious you are young but you are pretty he said seriously they were wise to give you the racket this is not the kind of adventure we want to experience for sure you too stupid to answer ralph demanded i just happen to prefer night for traveling she said aloud so you can disappear in the darkness he was trying to needle her about her dark skin yes you must be good at that yes if she had had a cherry bomb she would have stuffed it into his smirk they walked on for a while ralph had a magic lantern so he could see his way breanna of course did not need it but she did not see fit to inform the man of that unfortunately he soon thought of it for himself so whats your talent now she had to tell him or balk that would get them into another verbal tussle how can i avoid telling him she asked justin it is best not to he because that puts you on his level but if you refuse to tell him he will simply keep badgering you until you do tell perhaps challenge is best ask him his own talent whats yours she asked ralph if i show you mine will you show me yours there was something about that phrasing she didnt much like but it seemed a fair deal it wasnt as if she were protecting life and death information okay well i cant huh she asked and immediately wished justin had intercepted that crude utterance thats why i came to the good magician to get my talent but your talents always with you she protested not in this case do you want the whole story zomblfc lthr hes up to something justin warned i can tell by the sneakmess in his manner i think he wants to learn more about you so hes telling you more about him so as to get the two of you mformationaliy closer but he really doesnt care about your character im sure she agreed sourly but hes got me curious whats the harm in it there more he learns of you the better he will be able to exploit your weaknesses so as to have his way with you way what way stork summoning for one thing in his foul dreams to be sure but if the racket protects me from harm she paused suddenly alarmed remembering the gorgons veiled warning that is considered harm unwilling stork summoning to be sure especially considering your age no offense okay so i should be safe if i resist it and i will im going to go for the information as you wish i admit to being curious myself you seem to be a young woman of many dark silences ralph remarked there were some verbal digs again dark silences for a black wave girl i have a small brain it takes time to process big questions he laughed not nicely few things are more appealing than a stupid girl so have you decided or do you need another hour she wanted to let him have a dragonfire blast of invective but stifled it with justins help tell me your story when i was young i seemed to lack a magic talent at first folk thought i was magically obnoxious but various tests demonstrated that my personality was entirely natural so obviously il was the others who did not appreciate my charm and intelligence maybe they resented my delightful nature what a load of sphinx manure that must have been it breanna agreed aloud in due course i tired of trying to discover my talent on my own ralph continued so went to see magician of information the challenges were horrific but i demolished them by detonating cherries piers anthony and pineapples and managed to get inside the stupid sluts of the household wouldnt speak to me so i forged on up to the gnarled old gnomes cell and demanded my answer what cheek that must really have impressed him humfrey looked up with his friedegg orbs and grumped t know why youre here and im not going to help so you might as well go away now t was of course funous with considerable justice t can think of only two reasons why you wont help me informed him forthrightly you are either jealous of my talent or incapable of discovering it both choices show that you are nothing but a pretender and a fool the effrontery of this idiot is phenomenal you sure told him breanna agreed aloud she discovered that she was after all enjoying this exchange it was nice seeing justin get worked up but the overthehill magician responded with faked patience i know all about your talent young man it is currently residing safely in mundama with a little boy named lija i suggest that you count your dubious blessings and go home beware breanna he is walking too close to you i noticed she replied mentally i want to see if this racket works what are you talking about old man i demanded righteously how can some homd little brat in mundama have my talent no one in mundama has any magic as you would know if you werent in your dotage thats why we call it mundama even the ogres know that if i had a mouth i would vomit breanna kept silent she had a mouth but it was only a giggle she had to stifle ralphs sell described arrogance was a thing almost ol beauty obviously he couldnt refute me so he changed the subject not all magic is good magic he uttered what are you talking about imbecile i demanded reasonably he is putting his arm around you zombifc lovfr i know he stinks but i want to be quite sure im protected in case he ever catches me olfguard some magic that is too dangerous or unpleasant for xanth is sent to mundama where it can be safely disposed of he said it is the best way to handle toxic waste somehow your particular talent was strong enough to survive in mundama despite the extreme thinness of magic there it took up residence with a small boy so my talent is strong enough to survive in mundama i gloated it must be magician caliber no wonder youre jealous you decrepit hasbeen i knew i was destined for greatness i dont want some fool mundane getting the benefit of my talent how do i get it back he is trying to squeeze your pert posteror i cant feel a thing you are not listening humfrey said seeming suddenly weary somehow i am not surprised but trust me you do not want your talent back my best advice is to leave well enough alone sure you would say that you feeble freak but im not going to let you get away with it tell me hov to get whats coming to me now he is trying to squeeze the left portion of your bosom there was a more specific word for the region but justin was too polite to use it no force is coming through its as if my dress is armored you would be better off going to demon university crashing professor grossclouts lecture on monster evolution and mooning him at least then your end would be roasted rapidly now go away not until you get me my talent back you stunted fraud i demand my talent finally i got through to the dimwitted midget very well if that is the way it must be he said grudgingly t will arrange to return your talent to you but it will take time to accomplish meanwhile you must render me your service til do that you overcharging charlatan what do i have to do return in two days to guide a damsel to the isle of women and so you see me here guiding you ralph concluded his narrative but before you tell me your story how about a kiss tell him no pitrs anthony no girls have such quaint ways of saying yes he put both arms around her holding her securely and brought his face down toward hers i said no you brazen creep let me go but he held her tightly one little kiss to warm things up he said his mouth bearing down on hers im only fifteen she cried turning her face away what delightful youth he lifted her up so that her feet lost purchase with the ground then dropped down to the ground with her lets get that dress off you before it gets dirty he reached across to get hold of it if you are quite satisfied that he wont let you go voluntarily it may be time to fight back justin remarked how remember he cant actually touch you hes just clasping the entire protected package but you can touch him say thats right breannas arms were pinned to her sides and her legs were caught under his but her head was loose she remembered how she had punched a hole in the wall would it work the same way with her head you want a kiss she said forcing a smile as she turned her face back to his sure before we get on to the main business then take this she lifted her head ramming her face into his hard she felt nothing much but his head rocked back and a bit of blood appeared at his nose she had banged it with her forehead it was a dent rather than a smash but surely painful he let go of her grabbing his face oooo then he fished for a handkerchief now her hands were free she remembered a trick she had heard about to stop the close approach of an unwanted face she extended one finger and put it sidewise under his sore nose she pushed up and inward and his face moved back because of the discomfort in that manner she shoved him off and got to her feet oh was that kiss too hard she asked with mock solicitation want another nooo he moaned rolling away it really wasnt that much of an injury but maybe he wasnt used to getting pushed back zombie lover maybe some other time suspect that suffices you have made your point yeah she said with satisfaction she waited while he got the handkerchief and tended to his nose then she pretended innocence lets get on to the isle of women maybe youll feel better by then he stared at her but evidently decided to let things be for the moment he didnt know about the protection racket maybe he thought she had gotten in a lucky blow so he might try again but probably not right away meanwhile she had truly verified the power of the racket now she felt safe as long as she didnt cooperate she could not be damaged they resumed their walk and ralph did not try to put his hands on her again soon it got dull i didnt tell you about me breanna said preferring any kind of dialog to silence i have this talent of seeing in the dark so i mostly am up by night and sleep by day that explains that but i got kissed by a zombie prince who found me sleeping now he wants to marry me so im fleeing thats why i went to the good magician and why im going to the isle of women i should be safe there i doubt it you do why what will you do for me if i tell you justin cut in dont aggravate him needlessly he might renege on his commitment to get you to the isle probably good advice so she stifled her natural retort again and tried to be polite i dont want to kiss you i dont want to do anything with you except get where im going so you can tell me what you want to or let it be as you prefer there is something about that isle you really should know but you ought to be a bit more friendly sorry no touching as you wish his lone suggested that she was making a mistake but she didnt trust his motive they continued moving breanna refused to let him know how he had piqued her curiosity was he faking it or was there really something at the isle of women that would make her regret going piers anthony there she was annoyed that he was still trying to pressure her for something he knew wasnt allowed at least he wasnt still trying to grab her they passed a hat rack with several nice hats just ripening intrigued breanna picked a nice black one with a white frill on the top resembling a cresting wave a black wave hat she said putting it on it fit perfectly ralph didnt comment but justm did that does seem to match your nature it is becoming becoming what she asked alarmed he laughed attractive it makes you look cute cute i can live with then mare imbn appeared learned about lija she said who elijah the bov v ho got ralphs talent can give ou the whole stor in a daydream great lets have it the surroundings mostly disappeared though she continued walking on automatic pilot and breannas awareness devolved on drear mundama there was a region shaped like a new jersey and a town and a house inside the house was a family with a daddy a mommy an eightyearold boy named lijd and his sister rachel who was there for him to quarrel with by day he had a smile nearly as bright as the sun and things were great but everything changed at night the moment bedtime arrived lijas smile vanished his head hurt his neck shoulders back or knees ached his belly cramped his chest felt heavy and his breathing got wheezy all the misery he had avoided during the day closed in victoriously at night so of course he was unable to fall asleep without a heroic struggle by his parents when morning came lija would be perfectly fine and ready for a full and active day but when bedtime returned so did his problems lija called his condition the bedtime booboos his parents had their own name for his condition but they were very careful never to use it in lijas presence daddy and mommy tried to be supportive and understanding but they soon reached the limits of their patience sometimes they would not smile reassuringly when they placed a cool wet cloth on his head zombitl tr sometimes they muttered under their breaths when they massaged his sore limbs and back once they even grumpily ordered him back upstairs to get his own cool cloth and then put himself back to bed and go to sleep poor lija not only was he feeling terrible every night he was also m trouble with his folks but there seemed to be nothing he could do about it the booboos never let him go one summer evening as lija made his nightly announcement that he was once again suffering from bedtime booboos mommy for no reason at all got angry im really tired of these booboos she yelled every night the same thing over and over again your head aches or your throat is sore or your stomach hurts or whatever you can think of to avoid going to sleep now that was an unkind accusation i dont do it on purpose lija protested in a sad small voice i really dont feel well i cant help it if i cant go to sleep i dont understand your condition lija mommy continued it seems so convenient that the only thing it interferes with is bedtime you are fine all day long and then at bedtime you are suddenly sick it was almost as if she were suspicious ot something its like a magic transformation one minute well and the next minute sick and i think you mommy paused abruptly in the middle of her tantrum she sat down quietly on the bed next to him looking very thoughtful they sat in silence while they pondered the situation lija mommy whispered slowly i think you have a magic talent i do he asked in wonder unfortunately i think your magic talent is the bedtime booboos but this is mundama he reminded her as if anyone could ever forget the dreary reality even for an instant theres no magic here which was ot course the problem theres a little bit ot magic she reminded him back remember the beautiful rainbow that stops you from ever catching up to it so you must have gotten some of the ugly magic it did make sense but lija was definitely not pleased its not fair he grumbled im the only kid outside of xanth with a magic piers amhoni talent and i get a stupid one now im stuck with bedtime booboos forever unless i can get rid of this talent im afraid so mommy agreed believe me i am as annoyed as you are she seemed really sincere what do people in xanth do to free themselves of stupid talents they move to mundama and their magic disappears oh great i already live in new jersey there is no place more mundane than here so what do i domove to xanth no mommy cried in alarm if your talent is this much trouble in mundane new jersey imagine how much stronger it would be in magical xanth the family tried to figure out how lija had acquired his unwanted talent lija supposed that it was the result of a mixedup delivery by a really confused overworked and directionally impaired talentdistributing stork his sister rachel defended the stork by claiming that the talent was correctly delivered it was just that lija was ac tually in the wrong place daddy proposed that when the demons were disposing of unwanted talents one of them escaped to mundama where it hid in lija mommy suggested that perhaps a large giant walking close to the xanthmundama border was struck by a sudden sneezing fit the poor man sneezed so hard that his talent flew out and went flying into mundama where it finally landed on lija unfortunately not one of them thought of toxic waste disposal since no one could determine either how the talent had come or how to make it go away they resigned themselves to living with it as best they could this was after all drear mundama where such things were commonplace the daydream ended but why is ralph determined to get his talent back breanna asked imbn he doem t kno its nature he thinks am talent is better than none the good magician tried to warn him but he vouldn t listen i know breanna smiled privately i think i wont tell him ill bet its ten times as bad in xanth because the magic is so much stronger yes he will have to sleep in datime as ou do because he ill not be able to settle down a all a night it couldnt happen to a more deserving lout the good magician ha sent the demoness metna to see the demon e humfre knos the demon will gne an help zomrif lover needed to get rid of an vra magic because he hates haing his realm polluted m fantas he will arrange for the famil to inflmg tickets to florida so lija can go to the ven spot that corresponds with ralphs house m the north village then the demon e ih will exorcise the talent and it will be driven back to its natural home in xanth in ralph he will have his wish will he ever breanna said zestfully and lija will at last have peace yeah and ralph will be really proud and happy right up until bedtime whats that ralph asked she must have forgotten herself and spoken aloud dream mare imbn just visited me she says the good magician is even now arranging for your talent to be returned to you in all its awesome power its about time he said smugly i thought that old fraud could come through if given sufficient motive he glanced at her are you sufficiently bored yet are you getting motivated for something interesting the jerk never gave up i like being bored she was speaking figuratively of course they kept walking following the enchanted path making good time ralph did not try to grab her again and she began to regret the way she had banged him maybe she could have just told him no clearly and it would have been all right don t think so justm said he does not deserve the benefit of the doubt how can you be sure don t wish to appear condescending but i am a male and have had time to think i can appreciate your desirability as a woman and the ruthless nature of some men you are young and have a certain naivete about adult relations i do not please i am trying to protect you from exploitation youre trying to invoke the adult conspiracy perhaps it will be possible to make a demonstration you allowed me to be present when you performed certain natural functions would you wish to have him watch similarly no what has that to do with the price of beans in mundama r piers anthony beans just an expression ralph isnt going to watch me pee okay hes not a tree he nodded mentally trees do collect urine here is what i propose tell ralph you need to take a comfort break so need privacy for a time then spy on him i think he does not appreciate the extent of your ability to see in the dark so you will be able to hide from him this is pointless if i am correct he will try to sneak a peek at you then you will know that you were not at fault when you struck him she considered okay ill give it a try then she spoke aloud ralph i need a bit of privacy suppose head off to behind that bush and you wait here okay very well he agreed and found a rock to sit down on he set his lantern on the ground beside it see she said silently hes not going anywhere yet how could he be so sure she walked to the bush and around it she set her black wave hat on the bush marking her presence she ducked down as if squatting then ran quickly and silently behind the nearest tree she peered past its trunk the first thing she saw was that ralph was no longer sitting on the stone he had left the light there as a seeming indication of his presence but he was already circling around behind trees and bushes hiding while closing in on her bush as justin had surmised ralph thought that the darkness covered him not realizing that she could see as clearly as if it were daylight he is finding a vantage where he can look behind your bush justin said so he can see you with your dress up sheesh justin you were right hes trying to sneak a peek at panties and worse yes such sights fascinate men even you justin even i despite my age and loss of rnanform except that you didnt try to sneak you offered to return to your tree yes but i did not insist on departing when you generously let me stay for the occasion zombif lokk well i thought of you as a tree am a tree with the spirit of a man ralph discovering that the spot he spied on was empty and that he had been had quickly returned to his stone actually i do need to do it she said will depart to no weve already been through that just dont comment ill pretend im alone she found a place and squatted anyway you see through my eyes if i dont look you dont see right that is correct however you did stand before the mirror when i was showing off thats different he was silent she quickly did her business then returned to recover the hat and walked back to the stone where ralph sat as if he had never moved she decided not to make an issue thanks she said dryly as they resumed walking and to justin you proved your point i was naive this guys a turd so he is fortunately your racket and some common sense precautions will protect you i must admit i am coming to see some use in the adult conspiracy it protects innocents like me from characters like him at least its supposed to few things are entirely good or entirely evil he agreed diplomatically maybe it didnt protect me because i renounced it i guess i couldnt blame it for that you must do what you deem proper sometimes that incurs a penalty but it remains your proper course so maybe ill go easy on abolishing it entirely until i know what parts of it ought to be saved reform rather than abolition that seems sensible youre awful agreeable how come you never tell me im being a foolish child wouldnt think of saying that come on justin you have to have been tempted what holds you back all my life as a man and as a tree i have been a sensible principled individual that has turned out to be supremely dull you in piers anthony contrast proceed from one fascinating dilemma to another as an adventure it is marveious and you wanted adventure she concluded seeing it my crazy ideas and mistakes make my life interesting got it integrity requires me to make one additional confession why justin you must be blushing because i feel the heat on my face what arc you talking about am discovering that despite the extreme difference in our situations and the likelihood that in due course we will separate and never again associate i feel a certain appealing pleasure in that association and i prefer not to jeopardize it why justinare you saying you like me was trying to avoid saying that and your tree bark was getting shrunk into knots she said remembering her session with the embarrassing challenge questions yes she laughed aloud causing ralph to glance warily at her so she made sure her next statement was silent and i like you too justin even though youre nothing like any companion i would have chosen for myself sometimes odd associations occur for sure pleased she let it be by morning they were near the west coast of xanth because the enchanted path facilitated travel breanna had never seen the sea before and was amazed so much water this is as far as i need to take you ralph said the isle of women is one of the occasional islands off the coast it interfaces with xanth one hour a day so you must watch for it and cross over to it then how do i get to it i wouldnt care to try to swim out there he sneered true the sea monsters would gobble your delicate dark flesh in a moment you have to take the boat it is there by the paradox the what the paradox i dont know why its called that when you sec the isle go down to that dock you see there and get in the boat it will take you across thats all there is to it zombie lover thats all there is to getting there thats not why it wont help you escape the zombie prince and youre not going to tell me why not unless you care to purchase my favor with a little favor of your own meaning you want to get your hands on my black panties and have me not fight precisely are you interested no then i am through with you he turned and walked away im glad to be rid of him she confided to justin but he did get to me on that business about why the isle wont help me i was almost tempted to let him touch me and hope that the protection racket stopped him from going too far but i wasnt sure it would protect me if i wasnt fightingyou know admit there could be doubt if you were indicating that you liked his attention i believe that was the warning the gorgon was obliquely rendering i think it was best not to risk it because if the racket did prevent him from completing his vile design he probably would renege on giving you the information yeah youre right for sure but it still bugs me it bothers me also but perhaps we shall ascertain the information via some other source well lets go down and look at that dock i want to know whats what before i do anything else foolish they walked to the dock it seemed to be an ordinary wooden pier with a small boat at its end a pie tree grew beside it there is something missing justin said there is no paddle say thats right how am i going to paddle it to the island could that be what ralph wasnt telling the location of the paddle dunno he acted as if i would have no trouble making it to the island but then wouldnt find it helped true perhaps there is a paddle hidden under the dock she bent to peer under it and saw a sheltered spot with several pillows say someone slept here it does look like a comfortable spot to take shelter from wet weather justin agreed piers amhoni and its dawn and im tired so why donl i eat one of those pies and turn in until the island shows ill paddle the boat with my hands if i have to if its not too far then she reconsidered only i might sleep through if its only here for an hour can wake you each hour so you can look to see if it is here you can do that when do you sleep do not require sleep in the same way you do in my vegetative state okay maybe make it every half hour so i dont catch the isle at the end and maybe it vanishes before i can get across to it agreed she harvested a chocolate pie ate it and found a nearby milkweed she disliked eating anything as white as milk but some sacrifices had to be made then she crawled in under the dock set her hat aside arranged the pillows got herself comfortable and closed her eyes breanna she came awake startled oh is it time to look it seems like only ten minutes it is ten minutes ralph is stalking you again he is how can you tell hear him with your ears i have had decades to attune to normal environmental sounds and can recognize a human footstep amidst background noise gee what should i do be ready to resist if he grabs you so that your racket is quite clear that you need protection got it breanna feigned continued sleep but was as tense as a spring now that justin had alerted her she did hear the faint scuffling of human feet so that rat was still trying to nab her for underage sex well this time maybe she would bash his nose right out the back of his skull she had been a bit regretful for hurting him before but this was just too much she was sorry she had lost her dagger he came to the dock he must have been watching her throughout so as to know exactly where she slept he figured that if he grabbed her while she was still asleep he could nail her before she worked up a sufficient protest well he had a surprise coming he reached the dock and paused she realized that she probably zombifc lovfr should have scrambled out from under before he arrived because here there was very little room to fight but it was too late to do it now suddenly he caught hold of her feet and pulled her out no subtlety at all he was just grabbing and hauling as her legs came out her skirt scraped up around her hips he shifted his grip to her thighs and hauled again getting her all the way clear then he bent over her and put his hands on her chest he knew exactly where to grasp damn him breanna did it without even thinking she brought up one foot and planted it in his belly while clamping her hands on his hands so that he couldnt move them away never mind where his hands were they would be gone soon enough then she shoved hard with that anchored foot it was an adaptation of the stomach throw that she had learned as a child in a mundanian judo class it was performed when tori the thrower was on his back and uki the throwee was standing or leaning over just like this it was a perfect defense for a girl on her back she knew she was showing an awful lot of bare leg but he wasnt in any position to gawk he went flying up over her head his pinned hands becoming the fulcrum he did a forced somersault and landed with a hard whomp on the dock only then did she release his hands it had worked but as she scrambled to her feet something weird happened ralph went sliding down the dock and landed with a thunk in the boat at the end then the boat took off without paddles as if it had a hidden motor it cruised into the water heading straight out to sea hey ralph cried but there was nothing he could do the boat was taking him wherever it was going and it wasnt stopping well that answers the question of propulsion justin remarked its magic it requires no paddle but where is it going surely to the isle of women but the isles not there yet so i see yet the craft is obviously going somewhere looks more like nowhere to me evidently the boat isnt smart enough to realize that its destination is absent it assumes that anyone who enters it is ready to travel there must be another dock on the isle to receive it when the isle is there plfrs a thon yes and when the isle isnt there the boat just goes right on looking for it so it really is going nowhere fast that would seem to be a paradox a boat going somewhere in a hurry yet going nowhere paradox she cried a light flashing over her head she loved that incidental magic of xanth thats it beg your pardon thats the magic pun ralph said this dock is called paradox thats pair o docks with the boat going between them thats all it knows to doto shuttle back and forth but when one dock is missing its got nowhere to go so it goes nowhere somewhere becomes nowhere paradox justins astonishment washed through her believe you are correct breanna there must be a pair o docks or there is paradox and ralph is caught in it yeah she watched as the boat sped out to sea becoming smaller as it gained distance a pair of arms was waving frantically over it she didnt have much sympathy had you set foot on the dock that might have been your fate justin said shaken yeah so i guess ralph did us a favor showing us exactly how it works she stretched meanwhile im going back to sleep to be sure if i can relax enough after that fracas my hearts still pounding could sing you a lullaby she laughed then paused are you by any offchance serious yes used to be a fair singer though that was not considered a masculine trait i often imagined melodies of nature as a tree with associated images i think i could do it in my mind and you could hear it and see if you wished gee sure give it a try he began to sing and it was marvelous it was as if the forest itself were serenading her with the sound of wind through trees the movement of birds wings the swishing of the tails of fish in a running stream and even the gentle drifting of clouds against a deep blue welkin sound and image were one and wonderfully soothing thats really great justin can you do it until i fall asleep yes i can do it indefinitely i am glad to have an appreciative audience zombif loer and thanks for alerting me about ralph you are more than welcome i would not want anything untoward to happen to you me neither then she thought of something else can you show me your tree again i mean the forest and all sure but your own special tree specifically certainly a modified picture formed in her mind with the tree centered thanks now im sure of it youre cute too she felt her face heating and knew he was blushing again satisfied she sank back into sleep isles of wo d or woke he was on the bed in the chamber of castle zombie on adjacent beds his father and son were stirring what a chain of worlds they had seen he ticked them off on his mental fingers and toes ptero pyramid torus cone dumbbell pincushion spiral tangle and motes that was nine in all each seeming as big and competent as xanth despite being impossibly small and perhaps an infinite number beyond them that the zombie master was still touring dor put his feet on the floor and stood up actually this was no worse than orienting on another dream world this just happened to be the real one or was it could the land of xanth be on a globe or other shape orbiting the head of some giant ida the notion was mind boggling so he set it aside the door opened showing millie i thought i heard stirring she said yes we are back dor said jonathan says he is making progress and hopes soon to find a suitable world for the zombies he is on the ninth derivative at the moment a cluster of floating rocks called motes so we shall return and report that the zombies should be out of the way by the date of the wedding thats good millie said but there is another problem the blob has become a winged mermaid dor finished for her zombie lover how did you know her name is aurora she couldnt make it on her own world so has merged with the blob to give it identity and form she should do well enough in xanth thats the problem she has no idea where to go and i dont know what to tell her she is asking for the three kings dor glanced at the others then nodded i suppose it is our responsibility we had better talk to her before we go home he paused seeing the jar of sleep potion you say you have plenty of that oh yes millie agreed would you like to take that jar with you yes just in case one can never tell when something like that might be useful millie picked up the jar and brought it to him dor put it in his pocket thank you but remember she warned him this is not for ordinary sleeping its for the dream worlds yes i will use it only when warranted you had better the jar said from his pocket they went to the other chamber there was aurora sitting on the edge of a wooden tub soaking her tail in water she was of course beautifully bare oh you are here she cried spying them seei did manage to get lungs so i can breathe your air she inhaled and her chest inflated causing dors eyes to lock she spread her wings and flew across to plant a kiss on dor you must tell me where that other winged mermaid is actually saw her only once at chex centaurs wedding dolph said fifteen years ago she would be of mature age by now thats all right she will surely know the scene aurora stood on her tail keeping herself upright by flapping her wings at half speed she was a most scenic female figure with sightly attributes in utter contrast to the former aspect of the blob dor was privately amazed that the same flesh could assume such different forms this wasnt the kind of magic transformation dolph did it was a given mass reshaped that made it special we can ask some regular mermaids dolph suggested trying pieks anthon without success to wrest his gaze away trom two attributes they should know where the winged ones are dor nodded we will take you to the nearest mertolk colony and inquire oh thank your she exclaimed and kissed him again m the process squishing an attribute against him i am glad that is settled millie said with a section of a remi niscent smile but first you must have more tee and crumples i have them ready dolph looked at aurora i know you can fly but i think i had better carry you when we travel because ill be flying high and tast and i am iamihar with the terrain im sure you know best she said demurely in due course they exited the castle and were ready to travel but with three folk to carry dolph couldnt use the roc form so he became a large sixwinged dragon and they straddled his serpentine mid section aurora had no legs so couldnt straddle so she sat side ways while dor held her securely in place around the waist dolph took oft he spiraled up into the sky avoiding passing clouds with each beat of those great wings the dragon body lifted powerfully and they felt extra weight and auroras attributes pressed down against dors arm then on the return stroke the dragon seemed to be floating and everything became light dor hoped that no one else was aware of his arm he wouldnt care to try to explain his impressions to irene do you have demons here aurora asked glancing around yes many in fact dolphs exfiancee nada naga married demon pnnce vore and they have a twoyearold daughter named demon ica what happened to them during the time of no magic how do you know about that cone is part of xanth too indirectly our history and folklore say that all magic derives from the demon x th and that when he departed for a day so did most of the magic we were protected because our nested worlds were stored in a special cell in the nameless castle that didnt let its magic escape of course thats just our legend there may be no such place on your world there is such a place dor reassured her so it could be true i wondered where ida s moon was before it joined her zombil lofr but i should think it was a difficult time for unprotected demons who cant exist without magic it was dor agreed i believe they became dust devils as they do in mundama then they recovered when the magic returned thats nice it wouldnt be the same without demons dor hadnt thought of it that way but found himself agreeing most regular demons were nuisances but some were important like demon professor grossclout and some were intriguing like demoness me tna in her several guises soon they spied a river complete with merfolk sporting in a pool dolph spiraled down and made a good landing in an adjacent field they dismounted dor set aurora on her tail and dolph changed back to manform i hope i didnt bruise your poor arm aurora said concerned no problem dor said gallantly they approached the river the head of a lion popped from the water spied them and roared oh go chomp yourself mane brain the river bank said the sea lion bared its teeth but there wasnt much it could do about a section of ground after a moment it bashed the water with its paws then turned tail and disappeared with a flash of its flukes the sea lions arent dangerous if you don t invade their territory dor said to aurora but you have to watch out for the ant lions they can pursue you on land we have uncle lions on cone aurora replied they re really fierce they walked downstream to the pool there were no mertolk show ing its all right dor called it wasnt a real dragon just a transformed magician we are men and one merperson a blonde head popped out of the water one eye was aittully covered by a trailing tress men helloim ash she lifted in the water just enough to show her own attributes three kings dor assured her we are looking tor a redhead appeared kings im cedar you are looking tor brides she lifted a bit farther trom the water this was getting dangerous to eyeballs no we just want to a dark graybrown head appeared i m mahogany we don t do one splash stands not even tor kings she lifted so high that her snug little waist was visible pltrs athon were not looking for splashes dor said were looking for winged merfolk now theres nothing they can do that we cant do just as well ash said inhaling except fly dor indicated the mermaid balancing beside him this is aurora she is new to xanth and needs to find her own kind can you help us they considered well theres erica cedar said she hangs out around mount rushmost with the other winged monsters thats where saw her dolph agreed she has a portable pool table for her tail mahogany said that sounds ideal dor said they turned away from the pool are you sure one of you wouldnt like a trial splash ash called after them almost sure dor called back thank you for the information a surlylooking man approached hey want something nice he inquired go away bb cedar cried they dont want what you give dor paused what does he give he has the talent of bad breath cedar said if he breathes on you your own breath gets stinky awful dor quickly turned away from bb then dolph changed and they boarded and flew up well no wonder cedar exclaimed look how hes holding her but we can do that too mahogany said just as bouncily too we dont exactly have brass ears ash agreed then the distance became too great and their following words were lost dor was relieved and glad that his father and son couldnt see how he had to hold aurora he couldnt risk letting her fall but what did brass ears have to do with anything dor couldnt figure it out you look perplexed aurora murmured i didnt quite hear what they said it sounded like brass ears but she laughed which really bounced her attributes not brass ears brassieres clothed girls use them it they need to at least they do on cone zombit lmtr oh dor felt himself trying to blush conic bosoms are popular in some circles she continued but we merfolk havent telt the need there is no need dolph agreed fervently aurora remained curious about xanth i see some boys dancing she said what is the dance and why are they so ragged dor looked down they are poor boys so they are doing the oliver twist the poor boys dance oh is there a version for poor girls i might try that she bobbed in place banging his arm some more maybe erica will know it was all he could think of to say lame as it seemed aurora was a most distracting armful they came to mount rushmost this was a mountain with almost vertical sides and a broad plateau on top dor almost thought he could see huge faces in the rock but concluded it was imagination or illusion there was a small gathering of winged monsters on the plateau they were all female three were winged centaur fillies another was a girl with reptilian wings and another wasyesa winged mermaid the group of them stood beside a living room that retreated as it saw the strange group descending living rooms were comfortable but more nervous than inanimate rooms the ladies were holding sun glasses and those cups of light really brightened the premises the dragon landed at the edge beside a patch of flowers dor recognized the larger ones as maxi mums and the small ones as mini mums they would make those who sniffed them correspondingly large or small so like most of xanths plants they were best left alone unless a person really understood their nature dor changed and they approached the winged monsters hey what are you men doing here the centaur demanded this meeting is limited to maidenly winged monsters oh youre in for it now the ground said you hae trespassed on a private gathering the centaur glanced down startled it seemed she wasnt used to hearing the inanimate speak our apologies dor said well leave as soon as we can thats my talent making the ground speak ignore it but we have a maidenly winged monster with us who needs help he indicated aurora piers anthony the girls looked oh the centaur said well in that case well let you go with minor penalties penalties now youre really going to get it the ground said zestfully youre not supposed to be here considering your maleness and lack of wings do you deny it the three men found themselves unable to deny either their maleness or their lack of wings the centaur nodded having won her point im karla centaur i was transformed from a regular centaur this is serena she indicated the girl with reptile wings shes of mixed parentage love spring you know love spring aurora asked the water makes any male and female fall instantly into ferocious romantic love dor explained except if one is a child then the love is parental oh like the shoreline of cone the conic section where the land folk meet the sea folk for love thats nice karla indicated another winged centaur this is chea centaur she was rescued from a tangle tree by che centaur her folks were from the gourd realm so she gave him a gourdstyle apology for taking his time and he turned bright red and flew away it seemed he misconstrued her intentions and one more winged centaur this is sharon centaur transformed from human to help shore up the new species but shes still learning the nuances of centaurism and the winged mermaid this is erica one of the few of her kind we are here visiting the virgini tree and discussing ways to avoid it in the future we think maybe the lips plants will help lips plants dor asked blankly loose lips sink slips the ground said karla indicated a patch of plants in pretty colors ill show you she picked a flower it looked like a bright red pair of lips she touched it to his face and the lips kissed him this is a twolips plant the others are more potent the threelips fourlips or fivelips we have to take good care of them because when a lips plant dies it becomes a zombie plant which sucks the soul from unwary travelers called liposuction that sounds almost as bad as the banana cream pie tree which zombie lover creams anyone who picks its pies dolph remarked not all plants are friendly now for your penalty for intruding here karla said each of you men must be kissed by one of us that doesnt sound so bad dolph said just wait karla said with an obscure smile as several of them applied red balm to their lips then serena the winged girl flew up to kiss dolph and sharon centaur approached bink and karla herself leaned down to kiss dor her lips touched hisand his head seemed to explode as the dust cleared he found himself sitting on the ground heartshaped clouds dissipating around him and ebbing waves of delight spreading across his face he was unhurt in fact it had been a remarkably pleasant experience he looked around and saw bink and dolph sitting similarly and looking similarly dazed lip bomb karla explained do you think it will free us from maidenly bondage to the virgini tree surely it will in due course dor agreed getting up meanwhile aurora and the other winged mermaid erica were talking as they dipped their tails in a table whose surface appeared to be water then aurora turned to dor yes she will help me get established here she said thank you so much then i think we can get on home now dor said we trust that you ladies will treat aurora with consideration you will find the story of her origin to be quite interesting oh cone is dull aurora protested its just land and sea its this odd land of xanth that is interesting thats what yoooou think the ground said all right karla said if you are sure you wouldnt like another kiss we do have more lip bomb the three men backed away thank you once was enough dor said politely he tripped over a couch potato he hadnt seen and landed flat on the couch at least its pillows were better than the hard ground dolph transformed to the dragon and they quickly boarded he flew off the brink and was immediately high in the air but his flight seemed somewhat unsteady and that made dor nervous that lip bomb hadnt worn all the way off yet his mouth felt outsize maybe piers anthony we should pause for a drink of water before flying home dor suggested dolph flew down to the nearest little stream and landed with a jar yes he was definitely unsteady dor kicked the jar aside and stood up dolph resumed manform then they went to the stream and drank the water was deeply refreshing a cute little firebreathing puppy came bounding along the bank every time it barked another little puff of fire and smoke came out then a catfish lifted its head from the river and hissed dor nodded he loved seeing natural creatures playing dolph seemed to be steadier the water had washed out the lingering effect of the bomb so that he could focus on something other than a passionate kiss there should be no further danger of crashing in flight now they were ready to go home and report that the zombie problem would probably abate by the wedding day but dolph paused before changing form where are we going he asked home dor said uh yes but where is home dor opened his mouth to answer but then paused himself why i seem to have forgotten that bomb must have blown it away he looked at bink i dont remember either bink said it should be a harmless lapse because he broke off shrugging because he could not be harmed by magic dor suddenly realized that was the explanation for all the weird coincidences he could be harmed by nonmagical things or embarrassed by magic but not harmed by magic that was why they didnt have to worry much about magical dangers but something magical must have happened because all three of them should not have suddenly forgotten where home was i dont think it was the bomb dolph said because remembered where home was until just now a dark suspicion enveloped dor suspicions cruised around like invisible blobs and when they caught a person they were awful to get rid of this streamwhere does it flow from for it occurred to him that the riredog and catfish might not have been playing they might have been trying to warn folk away from the river too late zombie lover they traced it back and discovered that it issued from a forgotten crevice in the mountain the river lethe flows deep underground dor said this could be a tributary stream the way that water works whatever you speak of just before drinking it you forget they sometimes use it to cure children who have somehow learned forbidden words and i spoke of going home thats right dolph agreed so we forgot where it was an amusing yet harmless loss bink said ruefully but perhaps we can get around it by flying high and looking around we should know home when we see it and we can see all of xanth from high enough good notion dor agreed if that fails we might gel some reverse wood and use it with another drink of lethe then the water would serve as a memory enhancer or it might reverse the liquid properties of the water and dry us out bink said reverse wood can be treacherous stuff dor nodded we had better stick to our search so as not to complicate our situation more than it is dolph looked around i wonder where this river goes i dont remember any lethe water on the surface its not the kind of thing a person remembers bink pointed out to the forest of forgetfulness a nearby stone said nobody who goes there remembers the experience so word doesnt get around dor was intrigued there could be really interesting things there but we dont want to go there bink said we have already complicated our situation enough so dolph transformed into the roc bird and they got on his feet and he flew up he spiraled high in the sky so that they all could look around all of xanth was laid out below them but dor still had no idea which part of it was his home theres the gap chasm bink remarked i remember the first time i encountered that just after i met chameleon i had to go down and cross on the bottom where the gap dragon roamed i met donald the shade and kissed his wife and told her where the silver oak was im glad you met chameleon dor said she was after all his mother but do you remember where home is anthony then it was the north village but dont think thats where we were about to go he peered farther theres castle roogna oh didnt we have adventures there yes of course dor agreed becoming impatient but right now we need to find home wherever it is bmk agreed he peered again theres the isle of view where dolph was married squawk dolph agreed he says it was some wedding night a metal button translated neither he nor electra knew how to summon the stork well i suspect they finally figured it out dor said they have a fine set of daughters in dawn eve for a moment he pictured them as they were at eighteen on planet ptero would xanth be ready for them at that age they circled around xanth noting the familiar landmarks but found no sign of home that memory had been cleanly erased maybe we can ask someone bmk suggested there should be some person in xanth who knows where we live now t agree so dolph flew downward and found a landing spot near the west coast he settled beside a large envelopewhich suddenly sprouted antlers and feet and bounded away i guess it was really an antelope bmk remarked there are some odd animals in the backwoods dolph changed back to manform and they looked around nearby was a man reading a book so they approached him hello dor said the man looked up who are you i am king dor i wonder if sure and im a dragon ass the man said sourly go away and let me practice practice what dolph asked my talent dummy i can bring characters and items out of these scenes in books see he reached into the page of the books he held and brought out a scarlet pimpernel flower im trying to find something useful good luck dor said and they moved on he appreciated the mans frustration useless talents abounded in xanth zombif loxfcr they saw a young woman dancing she seemed to repeat the same motions over and over doesnt that get dull dolph inquired she never paused its supposed to repeat idiot she replied withenngly its a redonedance they went on they came to a man concentrating on a rock hello dor said somewhat wanly im king dor the man looked up oh really yes really you jerk the stone he held said that seemed to be persuasive and i am your lowly rebellious subject phil istme the man replied what do you want from me some information if you please can you tell me where live phil stared at him you dont know it seems i drank some lethe water and forgot where home is dor said embarrassed but surely you know where it is surely i do phil agreed and ill tell you for a return favor dor was wary ot such things but had to ask what favor well you see my talent is molding things into other things like this phil moved his hands over the rock and it became a loaf ot bread he bit a chunk from it and chewed showing it was real hey watch who youre chewing on the loaf protested phil passed his hands over it again and it became a model house but my girlfriend isnt impressed so now i need a new girlfriend and all the others around here are taken except the ones on the isle of women so why dont you go and fetch me one of those and ill tell you where your home is dors mistrust of this continued why dont you fetch her yourself because only women and royal men can go to that island im not royal but you are so you could go there must be a woman there who would like my talent its a good talent dor agreed where is this isle of women just olfshore but theres a problem its one of several isles ot wo and its hard to tell them apart well we can ask dolph said and they only interface with xanth an hour a day so if you get the wrong one you have to leave it and try for another i think we can do that bmk said piers anthony okay fetch me that woman and ill tell you where to go home it seemed a steep price but at least it was sure agreed dor said they walked to the shoreand suddenly an island appeared so dolph changed to roc form and they flew across to it the trees seemed to be covered by vines those look like bovines bink remarked and i see cow pies on the ground maybe those are bull pies dor said theres a bull sleeping nearby a bull dozer bink agreed a flock of ungainly birds spooked as dolph landed on the beach they had the heads of cows in a moment a swarm of flies with the heads of bulls took off after them cow birds and bull flies dolph remarked as he changed back to manform frogs with the heads of bulls snapped up the flies as they passed bullfrogs obviously the commotion woke the sleeping bull it got to its feet put down its head and charged its horns dug into the ground pushing up a mound of sand and dirt it left a cleared path behind it several men came running down that path but they had the heads of cows and here come the cowboys dolph added with their bulldogs indeed the dogs were bullheaded this is udder nonsense dor said disgusted one of the cowboys stepped into a bully pulpit and lifted a bullhorn to his mouth mooooo it cried we have a bulletin the three kings retreated this clearly wasnt the isle of women in fact it wasnt even one of the isles of wo because these were all bovines a bull whose head was a whip appeared it snapped its head back and forth and the whip cracked sharply suddenly they were in a stampede water plants with the heads of bulls were charging past them spooked by the bullwhip bulrushes dolph said identifying them then he changed to roc form and they got quickly off the island already another island was in view so dolph veered to intercept it wait dor cried how can we be sure its an isle of wo instead of an isle of bo zombie lover dolph veered again this time toward shore he spied something and landed there was a wooden sign beside a dock with a small boat board for bo well its a board bink said but i would have trouble figuring out what it means what does it mean dor asked the board its clear enough knothead the board said the boat takes the traveler to the isles of bo get aboard when youre bored what part of that dont you understand the isle of bovines dor agreed suppose we want to find the isle of women go to the sign for wo mushbrain isnt it obvious in retrospect dor agreed without rancor the inanimate tended to lack social graces but by a similar token was unable to tell a lie it was too stupid they walked along the beach soon they came to another sign come for co thats not the one dolph remarked with twofifths of a smile weve already seen the cows the next sign said download for do then enter for eo forge for fo and go for go lets skip some signs dolph suggested and became a sixlegged horse they got on and he galloped past fifteen signs they stopped at the sixteenth sure enough work for wo they looked over the sea there was an island dolph quickly assumed winged form and carried them across to it this one was heavily wooded with everblue everyellow and evergreen trees a thick forest extended from beach to beach and there were wood thatched houses nestled under the trees they landed on the beach which appeared to be composed of sawdust rather than sand they approached the nearest house walking along a wooden boardwalk dor knocked on the wooden door it opened and a wooden man stood there his body was formed of polished planks the limbs fastened by wooden pegs wooden eye piers anthony lets peered at them what he inquired somewhat woodenly his jaw had a wooden hinge is this the isle of women dor inquired of course knot the man said and closed the door they exchanged three thirds of a glance it occurs to me that there might be more than one isle of wo as the man said bmk remarked this may be the isle of wood you bet it is fleshface the door responded i never realized that there were so many isles off xanth dor said as they walked back to the beach thats probably because they arent here all the time dolph said if each surfaces for only an hour a day there could be he paused counting on his fingers but he ran out of them before coming to a conclusion we assumed that the other isles were for the other letters bmk said apparently there are a number for each letter worse dor agreed somewhere else there must be isles of wa we and wi xanth must be much bigger than we thought as well as much smaller considering idas moons bmk said perhaps it is just as well that we are making this journey of exploration this is knowledge we might find useful yes dor agreed as dolph became winged to take them into the air there was another island nearby so dolph flew directly for it its vegetation looked oddly woolly as if a giant sweater had been pulled across it when they landed the beach was as soft as a woolen mattress rather than waste time dor addressed the island immediately what isle is this the isle of wool boneskull the mattress replied without a word dolph changed back and they took off there was another close island so he landed on that this one seemed ordinary except for a muted wailing sound associated with it there was a child gathering shells on the beach what isle is this dor asked him the isle of woe the boy replied tearfully thank you they departed the next island was overrun by small furry animals soon they ascertained that this was the isle ot wombats they moved on zombie lotr when they landed on the next they saw a huge statue at its near end the statue was a word in fact it said word as they approached it spoke in the beginning was the word on the next everyone was too busy working to answer any ques tions but they got the news from the inanimate the isle ot work the next turned out to be a huge worm coiled into island shape but the one after that was worse the isle of worse then there was one whose beach was composed of precious stones of every type the isle ot worth and one that was so marvelous that they stood and gazed at it in wonder the isle ot wonder at last they returned to the sign on the mainland there just seem to be more islands than we can fathom dor said dispirited im sure that any of them are worth appreciating on their own terms but how will we ever find the one we want there may be hundreds and the isle of women may appear and fade while we are checking some other isle of wo i hate to say it bmk said but i think we may need to ask someone else where it is dor shrugged lets see who we can find they looked around and saw the dock not far from the sign it wasnt anything fancy but seemed serviceable and there was a boat at its end but before they could check the dock three humanoid figures appeared theres someone to ask dor said i dont think so bmk said those are zombies well we can try dor said he walked to intercept the zombies who were shambling toward the dock hey zombies they paused one turned its weathered head yesh i am king dor of the living humans do you know where i live i amm dropsy wheere yooo hvze dropsy that sounded female and now that he came close he saw that it was indeed female portions of hei showed that would have locked his eyeballs had they not been decaying do you know where i live he repeated carefully yooo hvze i hvzmg deadth she gestured to her two companions zeeze dee dee dee composed andz dee ceased zhey deadth too dor realized that he was not getting through and probably would piers anthony not be able to the zombies brain had rotted too far however he did not want the zombies going to the same dock that the three living folk were about to check out talked with the zombie master zjonathzan she understood that much yes he is looking for a world for you a zombie world you should go home so you can go there when he finds it zzombiee worlz zombie world new home go there actually they would not be going there physically but would lie in their graves and dream of it but that was too complicated to explain dropsy exchanged a wormy glance with her companions ggo homze go home dor agreed he knew the zombie master would be calling in all the zombies when he returned so this would give these three a head start they turned and shuffled toward the east he had succeeded in getting them to leave the beach they waited until the zombies were out of sight then resumed their own trek toward the dock from a distance it had seemed ordinary from up close it seemed routine but one never could tell because even the dullest things could harbor magic dolph peered under the pier say now he murmured a sleeping beauty the others joined him there was a pretty black wave girl of fifteen sound asleep in a pillowed nook do you think she knows dolph asked she might bink said because she is evidently waiting for something maybe shes a woman going to the isle of women then we should ask her dor said but shes asleep well kiss her awake the dock said thats what you do with sleeping beauties perhaps if i were young and single dor said but i am middle aged and married so i dont feel free to disturb her dolph sighed were all married so none of us can wake her he said with regret well just have to wait she is pretty though youre all hopeless the dock said if i were a living man i would know what to do with a pretty sleeping maiden zombif lover if you were alive bink said you would soon develop some notion of the constraints that life and ethics place on individuals aw spoilsport dor studied the girls face yes she reminds me of irene when she was that age with the appealing health and vigor of youth and she reminds me of chameleon when she is almost at perihelion bink said i wish we could wrap up our mission and get on home dolph said wherever that is i miss electra perhaps the maiden wont sleep long bink said we shall just have to see meanwhile we can settle down for some rest ourselves we have had a busy day they leaned against posts of the dock and relaxed it was reasonably pleasant here dor reflected and the mystery of the maiden was intriguing serious seduction w ake breanna but feign sleep for the nonce whats a nonce she asked sleepily for the time being being what there being three men approaching it is too late to escape without being spied so i think it best to remain stii oh she kept her eyes closed and her breathing even she was under the dock and possibly in danger i dont think i could escape three men even with the protection racket precisely unless they believe you are sleeping and then you move very suddenly i should be able to judge when the moment is propitious okay ill fake it but i hope its a false alarm so do i breanna they waited while the men approached say now a sleeping beauty one said breanna tensed but forced herself to seem relaxed and asleep but as the dialogue of the three men proceeded justin suffered a revelation know these men he exclaimed have heard their voices before when they visited my tree they are magician bink his son king dor and grandson prince dolph royalty she exclaimed silently indeed they are all magicians and good folk we need have no fear of them zombie lover what theyre saying is interesting who is chameleon at perihelion chameleon is binks wife she vanes with the cycles of the moon alternately extremely smart but physically ugly and extremely lovely but very stupid he is saying that you remind him of her of the latter stage im not stupid no one implies that you are breanna just that you are beautiful she reconsidered i think i like this man he is eighty one years old and his wife is seventy six oh ugh still i believe it is time for you to wake we need to check for the island gotcha breanna stirred sighed stretched and slowly flickered her eyes open she hoped that she resembled a truly beauteous enchanted lovely maiden innocently awakening shes waking one of the men exclaimed so far so good breanna looked at the men as they came to look at her one was a mature fifty five but the other two looked to be twenty four and twenty one that didnt compute how could they be three generations recognize king dor and prince dolph but the thirdwhy its bink as he was when young he must have been youthened euthanized she asked alarmed youthened made young again by about sixty years it seems miss the elder man said cautiously do you know where the isle of women is he is king dor breanna sat up and worked her way out from under the dock after all it was less than enchanting to have mainly her feet visible her skirt slid up some but a little of that was beneficial why yes king dor she said i am going there myself excellent may we go with you then the man did adoubletake you recognize me she wasnt ready to tell them about justin tree just in case so she evaded that i should hope so she looked at the prince and you are prince dolph and at the third man but maybe not you piers anthony i am bink he said he didnt add more which meant that he wasnt telling her everything either okay i am breanna of the black wave im fleeing my zombie loer and all three men jumped the zombies dolph exclaimed breanna was surprised you know about them we are trying to find out about them dor said they have gotten all stirred up and we need to get them settled theyre stirred up because the zombie king xeth kissed me awake and wants to marry me breanna said i told him im only fifteen but that doesnt bother him he likes my firm living flesh so im fleeing and the zombies are chasing me and the good magician says i can escape them on the isle of women so thats where im going but if you escape them they will continue to be stirred up dor said we need them to settle before the big wedding what big wedding r the one at castle roogna next week we dont know who is getting married but we all have important roles to play in it we suspect it is a royal occasion for it will be a prince or king marrying a common girl we dont want zombies attending for sure she agreed a horrible thought has occurred to me justin said could that be your marriage to xeth no breanna cried immediately the men crowded solicitously around her are you all right dolph inquired anxiously iim all right i guess just had a horrible thought suppose suppose the royal groom is king xeththe zombie after he catches me all three had the grace to look appalled oh breanna we wouldnt want that king dor said we must help you escape we saw some zombies a while ago prince dolph said they must have been looking for you for sure breanna agreed weakly had a spell to make them not see me but that must have worn off by now so theyre picking up my scent again they can feel my magic talent of seeing in black ness they home in on it so i have to keep running but i cant run zomblt lovfcr irom here because i have to be here when the isle of women comes wee been looking tor it all day pnnce dolph said we keep finding the wrong islands how can you find it its supposed to be the island we can see from this dock i didnt realize there were several king dor nodded we have been traveling north along the coast maybe we were simply in the wrong position to see the right island and im supposed to take the boat breanna continued were you using a boat no prince dolph said with threefifths of a smile maybe the isle wont show unless someones by the right boat she suggested king dor nodded that seems possible so we will wait here with you for it but then four figures showed up breanna recognized them instantly zombies more zombies king dor agreed looking others must be orienting on your talent we might hold them back a while but perhaps you had better get in the boat now so as to be out of their reach i cant do that she protested the magic is wrong when the islands not there paradoxoh never mind must wait king dor looked at prince dolph can you stop them without hurting them i can carry them away two by two king dor nodded do that bink and i will try to stall the other two then the prince disappeared and a roc bird appeared in his place breanna was so surprised her jaw dropped the roc bird spread its wings and launched into the air it swooped toward the zombies it caught two in its huge claws and carried them away but the remaining two came straight on whywhy dont you want to hurt them breanna asked they mean no harm the younglooking bink said the zombie master is our friend his creations don t try to hurt living folk and we dont try to hurt his folk we just prefer to exist apart from them piers anthony how well she understood but the zombies werent letting her live apart from them the two men stepped out to intercept the two zombies what is your business here king dor demanded of them bzeenna one replied spitting out part of its tongue there was no doubt of their mission to fetch her back to xeth she does not wish to go with you king dor said you must leave her alone bzeenna it repeated it tned to push on past king dor spread his arms and blocked it breanna shuddered the thought of physical contact nauseated her she was coming to understand that the zombies were entitled to their own lifestyle if that was what it could be called but she couldnt stand to be part of it several more zombies were converging from other parts of the beach and the roc bird wasnt back yet now she was surely done for the island is appearing justm said the isle breanna repeated oh thank you justm bmk turned to glance at her justm in her excitement she had spoken the name aloud there was no help for it now but to tell the rest of it hes a tree hes with me sort of he gives me good advice i know justm bmk said as he fended off his zombie we have been neighbors for a long time true justm said well the isle of women is appearing breanna said well have to get in the boat together i think theres room the roc bird reappeared king dor signaled it and pointed to the boat the roc nodded and came down for a landing prince dolph reappeared zombies all over he reported dozens of them maybe we better link hands breanna said the dockjust link hands king dor and bmk shoved their zombies back then turned and took the hands of breanna and prince dolph together they stepped on the dock the zombies followed not yet quite there suddenly all of them were sliding along the dock as if it were a slippery chute they sailed off the end and landed together in the boat the boat bounced then started moving zombifc lohr two zombies stepped on the dock and slid along it they fell into the water behind the boat they splashed helplessly breanna almost felt sorry for them water can t kill them justm said they are already dead they will wade back out breanna was relieved she was getting more insights into zombie nature than she had ever cared to have but slowly the recognition that they were after all people of a sort was gaining ground she could almost wish them wellif only they would leave her alone dropsy what kind of a woman had she been in life what kind of a woman was she now apart from her awful undead status meanwhile the boat picked up speed it had no paddles and no engine yet was propelling itself smoothly through the water the dock was shrinking behind and the isle of women was expanding before the youngseeming bmk looked over the side what propels this boat i dont know breanna said in fact im not sure why this boat is here when i went to sleep it was gone it must have returned while you slept king dor said reasonably thats for sure the boat replied i dumped that mean man on the isle of blobs and came back to home base breanna looked around startled who said that king dor smiled my talent is to talk to the inanimate and have it respond the boat responded she looked at the boat oh yes can i ask it a question go ahead black beauty the boat said what makes you go my duck feet dummy what else the inanimate is too stupid to be polite king dor remarked yeah the boat agreed with gusto so i can peek up under your skirt and blab the color of your stamp on it king dor advised breanna lifted one toot and stamped hard on the deck the boat was silent but she wrapped her skirt more closely about her legs so that nothing was visible from below the irony was that she was proud of the black underwear she wore but she was not about to have a piece of wood think it was getting away with a sneak peek piers anthony had forgotten what fun dors talent is justin remarked girls do have to watch their skirts what do you mean fun she demanded silently no offense intended breanna but seeing under skirts or into shirts is one of the great male pastimes your best strategy is to pretend to be unaware of it that preserves your innocence even if something accidentally shows even underage skirts and shirts she asked sharply you are very mature in outlook and poise they obviously regard you as a young woman she pondered and concluded that that was best justin had once again found a persuasive way to frame his insight it wasnt as if she didnt already know that men were hopelessly juvenile in certain respects okay anyway it was the boat that tried to peek not the men they are all honorable still it is probably best not to put them in an awkward situation their good wives would be upset for sure she kept her knees together it is nevertheless a fault that can give women great power over men the sight of an uncovered bosom you mean breasts to be sure and the surprise glimpse of wellfilled panties can freak out an army keep that in mind for emergencies ill do that she agreed meanwhile the boat was rushing toward the island breanna decided to risk another question to the boat who set you and the dock up here the women of the isle dodo so princes can cross what a contrast between justin tree and this dead wood princes only women and princes can cross to the isle of women idiot because it is entirely populated by women who want to marry princes and spend the rest of their lives in comfortable leisure everyone knows that now thats interesting bink said our group just happens to consist of a woman and three kings or princes darn right stupid otherwise id have dumped you on some other isle those are my orders zombifc lover so it wasnt just timing that messed up ralph justin said he wasnt a prince or a woman for sure he was neither princely nor female breanna agreed sourly maybe the boat knows what ralph wouldnt tell you say yes ill ask aloud she said boat do you know why the isle of woman may not help me escape the zombie king but as she spoke she got it king hes a king so he can follow me for sure splinterhead the boat agreed smugly king dor shook his head if the good magician told you that the isle would solve your problem then it will he always knows but sometimes a person has to help herself somewhat also bink added perhaps humfrey meant that you could find the solution to your problem on the isle of women you assumed that the zombie king could not follow you there but thats not the rationale that must be it she agreed so my quest is not yet done but how will i know what to do there to save myself king dor considered you are helping us to reach the isle so perhaps we can help you to fend off the zombie king actually that may help put the zombies to rest before the wedding so we may have a common mission after all we do want to make sure that the wedding is not yours bink said these are good men justin reminded her it would be expedient to accept the offer with thanks gotcha aloud she said i thank you most kindly for the thought justin tree appreciates it too thats right king dor said justin is with you but if i may inquire why is this he wants to have an adventure but hes getting sort of old to return to human form so its a deal i got my answer in exchange for giving justin a ride in my head he sees and hears what i do its a vivi vicarious vicarious adventure for him too bad its from the female perspective by no means breanna i am enjoying the experience but he says he doesnt mind and he does give good advice piers anthony surely so king dor agreed i am glad he has this opportunity to experience human life anew the boat caught up to the island shoreline but didnt slow suddenly it rose from the water all five occupants were astonished how can a boat go on land prince dolph asked with duck feet breanna said realizing she leaned over the edge to peer under the boat sure enough there were multiple pairs of orange webbed feet but where is it going to the paired dock blockhead the boat replied so the women can check you out the boat ran on carrying them inland the island seemed ordinary with trees fields and houses there was a wellworn path with no obstructions for the duck feet they pattered swiftly along well now we know why there were no paddies justm said they came to a pond by the pond was a dock like the first one the boat ran into the water and paddled across coming to a halt by that dock it seems we have arrived bmk said standing and stepping onto the end of the dock king dor followed it was breannas turn she stood then hesitated to get on the dock she would have to take a wide step giving the boat a chance to peek and make an embarrassing remark i believe the step is steep king dor said dolph if you would lift the lady up oh sure dolph said by your leave miss he put his arms under breanna s shoulders and knees and lifted her sedately up he passed her up to king dor who set her onto the dock awwww the boat said before prince dolph stamped on its hull at the end of the dock a small group of women stood breanna hadnt noticed them before they must have amved in the past moment hello a lovely young woman in furry halter and shorts said i am voracia i will be your guide until you marry appropriate women and depart the isle you are of course three princes three kings king dor said however we have not come here to find wives as we are already married what she asked horrified she looked severely at the boat didnt you verity marital status zombit loxer the boat sank somewhat in the water i forgot voracia was grim well youre here now so you will simply have to provide three ot us with princely husbands in lieu of you only when you have accomplished this will you be allowed to leave the isle king dor evidently was not accustomed to being addressed in this manner i think we shall leave when we choose to leave when our mission here is done no you wont the boat wont take you he gazed at voracia we can fly from here no you cant pnnce dolph assumed the form of a winged man i think we can he said this is not the only form i can assume voracia frowned i suggest that you try it prince dolph spread his wings and flew up into the air he spiraled high looked around then flew back down to the ground xanth is gone he exclaimed gone king dor asked we have erased the interface between xanth and the isle of women voracia said you will go nowhere because you will have nowhere to gountil we restore the interface so there numbskulls the boat exclaimed from behind them ha ha ha breanna felt guilty for getting them into this mess this isnt right she said theyre just helping me voracia turned to her and whom might you be breanna of the black wave im here to escape being married to a zombie king zyzzyva can handle that fll call her who is zyzzyva shes our zombie member she no way breanna cried im not going near any more zombies im trying to get away from them voracia shrugged well then lets get you settled then we can see about the three princes here three kings king dor said whatever maybe we can persuade you to dump your present wives and marry three of us that ould settle your accounts nicely i dont think so king dor said piers voracia gazed at him not even if i show you my talent don t ask her talent justin warned whats your talent prince dolph asked once again seeming to speak before he thought breanna knew how that was this suddenly she was standing before them in lacy white bra and panties this is mischief for sure because all three men froze where they stood staring at the woman breanna had to admit that voracia was impressive both items of apparel were very well filled you will have to rescue them right but then she discovered something weird her own eyes were fastened on voracia they were starting to lock in place hey whats going on here im not fascinated by the sight of a womans undies youre not male oh no you justin me he confessed see though your eyes when you focused them on oh for screaming out loud look away justin cant but you can they re your eyes oh he was right about that she wrenched her eyes away and felt justins presence relax he had been a tree for a long time but recent experience must have attuned him back to the human state making him vulnerable now it was up to her to rescue the others similarly breanna stepped in front of king dor breaking his line of sight she put her hands on his shoulders and turned him away from the compelling sight he relaxed then she stepped in front of prince dolph when she had him free she did the same for bink whats the matter voracia asked sounding concerned as if you didnt know breanna snapped turning back to face her you stunned them with your unmentionables but i was only showing my talent the girl protested which is to change my bra and panties to any style or substance her outfit turned into blue halter and shorts then into striped tank top and slacks when was a child not so long ago i thought i had no talent because i didnt wear those particular items then one day you mean those are the same things breanna asked amazed zombitlovtr yes i can even turn them into armor now she wore woven metal uppers and lowers but thats sort of heavy so mostly i keep it simple the kings were turning around again so your halter and shorts were actually prince dolph asked his eyes starting to sweat yes its all the same voracia appeared in a string bikini whose strings threatened to snap at any moment get a load of that tfoe nearest stone exclaimed you can string me along any time honey dont do that breanna cried as prince dolph began to fall like a petrified tree youre freaking him out oh voracia changed to a jacket top and heavy culottes i didnt realize ive been so long on the isle of women seeing no men i just forgot when he asked my talent i justim sorry im not the stone said i wish i were a stone man im happy the way i am voracias halter said what voracia asked looking around its my talent king dor said quickly i talk to the inanimate and it talks back just ignore it oh how delightful but i apologize for showing you anything you would rather not have seen i meant no harm she seemed genuinely penitent though breanna had about a forty percent share of doubt understand women try things on men just to make sure they work justin said so it may be half innocent breanna thought about the way she had sort of shown off to justin before the mirror in the good magicians castle just because she could get away with it being physically alone she had claimed to be informal because they were sharing awareness but there had really been more to it than that part of her wanted to hide her assets another part wanted to advertise them i guess she agreed then aloud well if you are to be their guide keep it in bounds its almost like an aspect of the adult conspiracy bounds have to be set to protect the innocent good point it wasnt always best to do what a person could do just because she had the chance the sensitivities of others had to be considered here is how it works voracia said every woman on this piers anthony island intends to marry into royalty unfortunately there are many more of us than there are royal visitors so we have set up a roster based on a complicated set of rules it would be tedious to elucidate those at the top of the list get the first choices and as they get placed others rise to take their places so at present i am number one on the list thus i get to associate with the prospects and to interview them to see whether any are right for me well they arent breanna said so you can just forget about that aspect she realized that she was starting to pick up words like aspect from justin tree she liked his influence it made her seem more adult we shall see voracias outfit turned momentarily translucent breanna s doubt about her innocence increased to sixty percent however it wasnt convenient to challenge it right now but first as i said we should get you settled breanna translation she wants you out of her hair so she can be free to vamp the kings without interference for sure aloud she said thank you voracia wasnt the only woman who could mask her private agenda lets see that string again the stone said i want to develop a string theory you will have the house left by the last woman who trapped mean succeeded in finding her prince it is a good residence right this way she turned and walked away from the pond most of the other women had faded back but two remained ahem one said assertively oh how nice to see you claire voracia said with artificial sparkle her clothing turned smoky for an instant translation get lost claire this hunt is mine breanna giggled then quickly stifled it youre a good judge of women justin thats exactly the way it is since there are three prospects claire said firmly three of us may see to their welfare since i am number two on the list i qual ify do you ever the stone agreed and i am number three the other woman said so i also qualify yes of course voracia said thank you so much for remind zombif lovtr ing me her outfit flashed metallic with spikes she turned back to the kings normally we see only one male visitor at a time so it has been a while since the protocol has been invoked three of you are entitled to three guides this declarative female is the demoness claire so very pleased to meet you d claire declared especially if any of you have an inclination to be blissfully freaked out for days at a time i can be extremely accommodating when i wish to be and i would wish to be for a prince her body seemed to expand here and here and contract there becoming suggestive of an hourglass we really have no wish to be king dor started but claires whole form body and clothing turned smoky and the smoke coalesced to form a tightening body stocking around a body no mortal woman could match king dors eyes and jaw began to glaze stop that breanna said stepping between them this isnt the time not that there would ever be a time my apology claire breathed she was very good at breathing her garment thickened just enough to enable the men to resume their own breathing i love the view from here the stone said it was on the ground near claires feet these women are dangerous justin observed they have no intention of letting three kings escape and this is nefra naga voracia said indicating the other woman really dangerous prince dolph almost married a naga princess hello nefra said she had very dark brown hair framing a small heartshaped face with large aqua eyes she wore an aqua dress trimmed with dark brown so as to accentuate her features i was at your wedding prince dolph prince dolph looked startled you were i thought you were going to marry my cousin nada naga who didnt love you but instead you married electra which i think was a good decision you were there he said still surprised i didnt know she had a cousin i was young nadas aunt nera fell in love with a human type guy named nathan and im their daughter nefra because i am part anthony human i have a magic talent along with the normal naga abilities i have the talent of switching switching you mean with a switch she laughed how clever no i can switch any two things including talents she looked around like this she gestured and suddenly the rock switched places with a small nearby tree hey the rock cried out i cant see the sights from here you have already seen more than enough of voracia and claires legs nefra said you dont need to see mine i didnt want to see your legs wanted to see your tail if i assumed snake form now i wouldnt be able to return to human form without showing way more flesh than i ought yeah the stone agreed nefra returned to prince dolph so you see i have no designs on you or your father or grandfather but if i am not your guide i will be replaced by someone who does have such designs so i thought it best to keep my place nefra is all right justin concluded i guess so breanna agreed with less conviction i think youre here under false pretenses claire muttered darkly i was almost related to prince dolph by marriage nefra said im not going to betray a family connection exactly now if we can resume travel voracia said with a slight edge the house is this way she walked along a path soon they came to a pleasant little log cabin in a glade oh that looks sweet breanna said falling instantly in love with it go on in voracia said see how you like it in due course someone will come to explain the intricacies of our listing system to you so that you can get in line for a prince to marry but im only fifteen breanna said i dont want to maybe best not to tell them that justin warned lest they evict you from the island good point dont want to be pushy she concluded she opened the door and entered the house it was small but beautiful inside there was a table with two chairs a pretty rug on the floor a nice little kitchen alcove a bathroom alcove with a basin and potty and a bedroom with a queensized bed whv so bis for one person she asked justin zombie lover one established way for a woman to prevail on a man to marry her is to share her bed with him therefore it needs to be large enough for two oh she said blushing i knew that stairs led up to a storage attic where there was a chest with extra blankets there was a window opening onto the back with the island shore in sight all in all it was very nice she would like it here but first she needed to figure out how to prevent xeth zombie from coming to share that bed with her the zombies had traced her to this area and surely xeth was on the way now the boat would bring him here because he was royal so she might not have much time maybe just one day until the isle interfaced again with xanth but the three kings had agreed to help her solve this problem maybe they could share the house with her until the crisis passed she would go out and invite them in she would be glad to give them the bedroom and she could take the attic she opened the door and stepped out and looked around dismayed the three kings were gone everyone was gone but they wouldnt just have deserted me like that would they of course not justin said but i think i can fathom what happened the women of the isle preferred to be free of you because you interfered with their designs so when you were out of sight one of them showed her panties freaked out the men and carted them off to another section but what of nefra naga she had no designs on them so she said she might have simply been trying to reassure you and the kings the better to close the trap such subterfuge is not beyond the capacity of the gender translation women can be bitches she said bitterly perhaps i am being unduly suspicious no i dont think so i just got myself suckered she looked around but they cant have gone far ill get out there and find them then she glimpsed something walking through the forest a shiver of sheer horror ran through her justin is that what im afraid it is he looked through her eyes i very much fear it is a zombie hes here already she yelped they must have sent the duck piers anthony boat back for him immediately she dived back into the house and slammed the door there was a set of braces and a bar on the inside she slammed the bar into place locking the door then she ran for the back door and barred it too but by that time she heard something at a window she ran up and slammed shut its inside storm shutter and barred it then she hurried to do the same for the other windows breathless she surveyed the situation the house seemed to be secure for the moment but she was trapped inside it how am i ever going to get out of here she asked to get something to eat to dump the potty i dont want to be a prisoner here forever am not sure perhaps the kings will realize your predicament and come to your rescue if the greedy women dont keep them perpetually freaked out until they forget theyre already married that voracia has the potential and that demoness claires no slouch either and if nefra nagas in on it too they could be lost do fear the possibility it may be that they will need your aid more than you need theirs oh damn justin this is awful this island was supposed to be the answer not the problem agreed this is more of an adventure than i anticipated then she heard something at the door it was a faint bumping or scratching it was the zombie trying to get in she went to the door go away go away im not going to marry you the reply came faintly listen we must talk weve already talked i wont marry you go away there was a pause im not the king so youre one of his minions im not going with you go away another pause am zyzzyva thats the one voracia mentioned the zombie female who lives on the isle i dont care who you are she yelled at the door go away you are becoming hysterical i have a right to be hysterical breanna screamed the zombies are going to get me there may be another interpretation i dont want an interpretation i want no zombies zombii lovlr breanna think for a moment all the women on this island want to marry princes who would zyzzyva want to marry a zombie prince of course she breanna froze oh my justin is it possible think you should talk to zyzzyva and find out she might be your salvation but i dont want to get near any zombie they freak me out appreciate your concern i was not overly fond of them myself when i was human but i think this could be what the good magician had in mind not your physical escape from xeth but your emotional escape if he found another love i think youre making sense but i just cant bring myself to oh god im a bigot arent i i hate this she discovered that her face was wet with tears what am i going to do justin i just cant face her perhaps i can face her will you let me use your mouth my mouth you mean like my eyes you could talk think so if you allow it try it she said and released her mouth hello her mouth said it sounded like someone else she grabbed it back you did it you can talk then she let go again i can talk he agreed so i can talk to zyzzyva if you allow it if you can take care of this you can have any part of my body you want but you will have to let her in he said breanna nerved herself then she walked to the door and unbarred it she pulled it open please come in zyzzyva justin said we shall talk thank you the zombie woman stepped inside she was in much better health than breanna expected her decay hardly showed that meant she had been caught soon after dying zombies seemed always to be decaying but actually remained as they were when zombied that should mean in turn that her brain was pretty healthy too her clear speech suggested that offer her a chair by the table you can sit with the table between you breanna was surprised for half an instant then realized that of course he could still talk in her mind too and she would much rather have the table between herself and the zombie than nothing between them she walked to the table pulled out a chair and let her mouth go please sit down justin said there are things we must explain thank you the zombie repeated now breanna noticed that the woman wore a metallic skirt and armored halter and there was a small helmet on her head a short sword hung by her right side she was a warrior lady she must have been killed in battle no wound showed but maybe that was closed up when she got zombied they sat at the table i am justin tree her mouth said am with breanna of the black wave she was kissed awake by king xeth zombie but that was a confusion she does not wish to marry him the good magician humfrey sent her to the isle of women where she is supposed to find her reprieve do you understand yes zyzzyva said that is why came here was a warrior lass but i died in action the zombie master found me almost immediately and revived me as a zombie i decided wanted to settle down and live as normal an existence as could my talent is consistency and i wanted to settle down in life so it remains my ambition in halflife but no ordinary man would consider me so i came here hoping for my chance but i am low on the list so you would like to marry king xeth yes that would be ideal but i fear some other woman will get him first i know that he wants to marry a living woman and all the others here are fully alive but i am the best preserved of zombie women so t think i could accomplish what he wishes so when learned that he might be coming here i doubt many other women would care to marry a zombie justin said even a zombie king some might but if i could somehow intercept him and persuade him then he would never come here zyzzyva hesitated unfortunately as a warrior maiden i was never very good at romance so it might not work could teach you breanna burst out grabbing possession of her mouth zyzzyva glanced askance at her your voice seems to have changed perhaps my perception has deteriorated no it hasnt breanna said now that she had actually done it zombie lovlr she found it wasnt that hard to talk to the zombie after all she had talked to xeth justin was speaking for me because iwell never mind i see you are a person different from me but still a person some folk dont like to associate with me because of my color and i dont like that but i guess i have my own prejudices but if you can win xeths love and marry him then ill be gloriously free i think i can tell you how to do that after all he is a man i would be most grateful if you would come on breanna said getting carried away most of what you need to know is this men like to see where they shouldnt so if you can show him youryou do have panties zyzzyva stood and lifted her metal skirt under it she wore metal panties will they do breanna asked justin yes i believe so they are quite competent now please avert your eyes oh breanna pulled her eyeballs away obviously the panties were competent they should have that much more effect on a zombie male okay the other part of it is how you act you have to sort of look him in the eye and smile and tell him how handsome he is and if he grabs for you the way men dolet him but i always slew any man who grabbed for me which was surely part of her problem control the impulse this time you want toto let him have his way with you then hell be yours forever thats how its done zyzzyva hesitated again i spoke somewhat blithely of intercepting and persuading him but that was my militaristic nature talking of a campaign now that i contemplate actually doing it i am afraid breanna stared at her youre human the woman smiled wanly i am a human zombie my living capacities are only slightly diminished unfortunately my living liabilities also remain i fear that i willwill will mess up zyzzyva nodded so maybe this is not a good idea im sorry i bothered you she turned toward the door and took a step no you dont breanna cried going after her and grabbing her hand zyzzyva whirled a short sword appeared in her other hand it piers anthony glinted as it swung toward breannas neck breanna froze horrified unable to react in time to save herself the blade stopped just short of her flesh oh im sorry zyzzyva said i reacted automatically you must never grab a warrior uh im sorry breanna said shaken ii just just didnt want you to go because i still think i can show you how to do it do you really despite seeing how i react when touched thats rough i confess but there must be some way justin what do you think perhaps if she could still think of it as a military maneuver the correct reaction could win the day what correct reaction perhaps a passionate kiss now i gotcha breanna returned her attention to zyzzyva he says you can still be military you can still react when touched but instead of cutting off his head kiss him can you retain your reflexes to do that the woman considered different situations require different reactions should be able to do that its as if to vanquish him my weapon is a kiss instead of a sword right think of him as a demon if you cut off his head it will just turn smoky and reform but if you kiss him you score i will try zyzzyva said bravely rehearsal may be in order lets rehearse it breanna said fortunately weve got a man here justin can use my body and grab you and you kiss him instead of killing him but it remains your body you dont want to be kissed by a zombie that set her back but breanna hardly hesitated id rather be kissed by one than marry one so they tried it breanna stepped outside the door then came back in i am king xeth her mouth proclaimed i am looking for breanna of the black wave the armored woman turned to face the intruder i am zyzzyva you are really handsome justin looked past her where is breanna zombie lotr she is modeling for you at the moment oops let try it again breanna said this time dont forget to bat your eyes and show your panties hit my eyes sort of blink them at him like this breanna demonstrated will try zyzzyva agreed abashed eyes panties justin entered again i am king hello handsome zyzzyva lifted her skirt justins eyes locked on he strode across the room and grabbed her by the shoulder zyzzyva drew her sword then she froze darn practice makes perfect justin said with breannas mouth thats why we have rehearsals to ensure that the real case is perfect the zombie woman nodded not this she said sheathing her sword this she stepped into breanna and kissed her firmly on the mouth breanna froze she had never been kissed like that by a woman before justin took over he reached down and stroked the woman on the bottom breanna felt zyzzyva stiffen then relax accepting it they separated t think we are making progress justin said that was very nice zyzzyva now lets see if we can do it without miscue both women were silent so justin acted he walked toward the door and opened it there stood xeth zombie oh no breanna freaking out lost volition but justin handled it come in he said and stood aside thank you the zombie king said he stepped through the doorway there before him was zyzzyva she looked startled but quickly recovered her military discipline hello handsome she said smiling xeth hesitated who are you i am zyzzyva zombie she batted her eyes fetchingly then remembering she lifted the hem of her skirt i would like to marry you so far so good piers anthony i am king xeth zombie he replied advancing with his eyes fixed on that hem lyou seem remarkably well preserved i was zombied only minutes after i died i am the healthiest zombie female your flesh does look firm he reached for her but hesitated still i dont think any zombie female can she stepped into him and kissed him now his hand fell to her bottom exactly as justin had demonstrated zyzzyva melted against him perfect breanna said silently the two zombies ended their kiss you are strangely attractive xeth said but i need a living woman to i can do it zyzzyva said passionately but am promised to i release you breanna cried still he was doubtful i dont know the bedroom is this way zyzzyva said urging him toward it i have so much more to show you she touched her metal bodice lets leave the house to them justin said for sure breanna agreed she stepped outside the open door and closed it behind her she felt wonderfully free gals galore b ink watched breanna enter the house he was sure she would find it satisfactory it looked very nice from outside so she would have a place to stay but they still needed to prevent the zombie king from coming to the island we have something to show you voracia said bink looked at her she stood with demoness claire and nefra naga they were all remarkably lovely young ladies then acting in concert they acted nefra changed to her serpentine form and slithered out of her dress then she changed back to human form stunningly naked claires clothing turned smoky and drifted away in the breeze leaving her voluptuously nude and voracias outfit reverted to its natural state of pink bra and pink panties both tightly filled to overflowing all three of them had perfect figures all three smiled and batted their eyes and made a synchronized high kick with one bare leg then all slowly turned around in place displaying every facet of every curve bink was freaked into immobility he had been married a long time and seen xanuys most beautiful woman in all states of dishabille but this sudden surprise frontal assault by three lovely creatures caught him unprepared it was a case of instant overload and male circuit blowout he knew that his son and grandson were in the same state the women of the isle had sprung their trap the moment the three kings had been deprived of the protection of the girl take them to the retention pool voracia said without moving from binks locked view women appeared from all over bink couldnt look directly because he could not turn his head but his peripheral vision showed them and he heard them behind none crossed in front of him for that would have interrupted the freaking view he was tilted onto a cart and pushed still standing along the path following the three exposed women it was clear that this procedure had been carefully choreographed there were no mistakes probably they had used it on other reluctant men it was a system designed to see that no living prince escaped the island without being firmly married to one of its women in due course they reached the retention pool which seemed to be an empty cavity covered by a flickering layer of light bink felt a prickling across his body as that membrane passed across him then he felt quite peaceful as if all were right with the universe but he still couldnt take his eyes off the three exposed women walking in front they were just as fascinating from behind as in front that was the magical thing about women they could capture the male attention from any angle only their normal use of clothing allowed any men to function with reasonable efficiency at the bottom of the pool the wagons stopped then at last the three women covered up voracias bra and panties thickened into halter and shorts and lost much of their compulsion d claires form was shrouded in smoke that became an appealing but not overly exposive dress and nefra donned her normal clothing bink relaxed and rubbed his smarting eyes he saw after images of flexing buttocks he had had an overdose and it would take his orbs time to recover fully he looked around he was in a half formed chamber whose walls rose only to waist height demarking rather than enclosing it in it were two chairs and a bed nothing else he saw that dor and dolph were in similar chambers he walked to the half doorway but stopped it was open but some invisible panel balked him from leaving he walked around the chamber and found that similar material enclosed it he climbed on a chair and reached upward sure enough there was an invisible ceiling he was confined he was not unduly worried because he knew that these magical constraints could not harm him but dor and dolph did not have his kind of protection so it was better to share their fate for now zomhif lover voracia approached the chamber she walked through the doorway with no trouble she sat on one of the chairs gesturing him to the other i have decided that you being the youngest are my most appealing prospect she said im not young she shrugged making her halter ripple have it your way marry me and we will leave the isle of women forever im already married you know that you will have to renounce her i will be your wife from here on never her halter fuzzed into the bra which of course it was all the time only its appearance changed to make it less evocative when she wished her short trousers remained thus her body was not completely compelling but was a good deal more than indifferent there are certain things you must understand bink no man leaves the isle without marrying one of us the only uncertainty is which one if i am unable to persuade you the others must have their turns you will remain here until you accede to one your best course is to make an early agreement so as not to be confined for a tedious period i married chameleon fifty six years ago she has been an excellent and loyal wife i will not renounce her she eyed him coolly fifty six years that is a very long time for a man who is twenty one years old i was youthened i am actually eighty one years old voracia shrugged her bra became translucent he tried to keep his eyes clear of it but they were magically drawn to that translucency then you are old enough to be realistic about your prospects i doubt that you will encounter a better prospect for a wife than me i wont encounter any prospect am already married her bra became fully transparent his eyeballs creaked in their sockets as he tried vainly to wrench them away i have a certain amount of time to make my case with you if i do not succeed i will have to give way to the next woman who is d claire unless she has already married one of the others i think you would prefer me all things considered to the demoness for one thing only my clothing changes not my actual body you might find that reassuring she took a deep breath fortunately bmks mouth was not incapacitated the way his eyes piers anthony were it is not a question of preference i am not marrying any of you she sighed that was a considerable effect considering her bareseeming front i see i shall have to use stronger persuasion she stood and stepped toward him bink tried desperately to look away but his eyes were glued to her front and their surfaces would have peeled off if he hauled on them too hard he tried to stand but she got there first and sat on his lap she put her hand under his chin and lifted his head he tried to resist but felt strangely weak there is a peace spell on the retainer pool she explained you can move and speak but you cant become violent or resistive but that will not make me marry you she angled his head until she could kiss him he tried to deny it but the fact was that her lips were very nice he was lucky that these women hadnt discovered lip bomb after a moment she broke it off now if you care to we can adjourn to the bed where i will delight you excruciatingly then you will be obliged to marry me having by your action renounced your prior wife that is really the easiest way to do it tm not going to do it but it was very hard to be sure of that would his talent consider seduction to be harmful if you resist me and the other women we will then commence the second round you will be given food and a pitcher of water you may eat freely but when you drink you will commit why because the pitcher will contain love elixir whatever woman is with you at the time you drink will become the object of your insatiable affection but she may not be your best partner so you will be better off to choose for yourself before thirst chooses for you they really seemed to have it figured out but they did not know that his talent was to be invulnerable to harm by magic his talent seldom showed itself directly but it was always effective it had made it plain in bygone times that the loss of chameleon was considered harm so there would be some unusual coincidence that freed him from this marriage trap assuming his magic wasnt satisfied to have him be seduced and be quiet about it that notion continued to unsettle him zombie lover and of course he reminded himself again his talent did not necessarily protect his two companions they were both younger than he so probably more vulnerable to the temptations of revealed flesh thus it was probably better not to wait for his talent but to find some better avenue for all three of them soon he had to keep reviewing that lest the distractions of the flesh make him forget voracias firmly heaving flesh was almost touching his face and that was about as distracting as it could be if you do not respond in a moment i will change my lower garment voracia murmured it was no empty threat but what better avenue was there he was trying to think but that invisible bra right under his nose was beguiling him something awful you asked for it she said and her trousers shrank into a tight blue panty his eyes couldnt move but her plush bottom was on his lap and he could feel the change of color as well as of material but her ploy failed because now he was unable to move or speak he just sat there staring times up a voice from outside the chamber called curses voracia cursed she reformed her outfit into something relatively demure and got off his lap remember you can still ask for me if you wish then she was gone and claire was there she did not sit on his lap she simply picked him up with demon strength and laid him on the bed she began to unbutton his shin objection someone called woman is not allowed to undress prospect she has to persuade him to do it himself claire looked furious but desisted she lay down beside him and kissed his face her lips made his mouth seem to float up to the ceiling and burst into a spectacular array of flying colors you surely know how much fun a demoness can be when she wants to be she said and when you marry me i will get half your soul which will make me have some decency and conscience so that i wont leave you or otherwise embarrass you when you annoy me so i can give you continuous delight unmatched by any ordinary woman who would of course in time grow old and wrinkled she kissed him again as her dress fogged into nothingness sorry bink said when she allowed him to speak the rest of him felt as if it were floating up to rejoin his lips im not marrying you piers anthony not even if i let you do this she inquired taking his hand and bringing it to her bare breast objection a voice cried shes not allowed to make him do that he has to do it for himself claires eyes fired out tiny sparks but she let go of his hand so do it for yourself she suggested inhaling somehow he managed to resist her charms though it was teasingly difficult she left him quivering with frustrated longing but did not break his resolve it had been shaken and dented and battered and kissed but not actually broken then she was gone and nefra was with him he took some solace in the realization that this meant that neither claire nor nefra had prevailed against dor or dolph either but the two other kings were surely weakening there had to be a better way out im sorry i had to deceive you nefra murmured as she lay beside him without clothing but we had to get that black wave girl out of the way she was interfering that reminded him of breanna what happened to her he asked prince xeth zombie arrived none of us high on the list wanted him so we guided him immediately to the house so that he could win breanna but she was trying to escape him he exclaimed thats why she came here well she let him into the house and they have not emerged so perhaps she changed her mind you betrayed her too he accused her i love it when you show emotion she said and planted a fierce kiss on him its negative emotion thats all right ill take that for now would you like to rape me that counts the same as a seduction i promise not to resist effectively just get out of here he gritted in time she did she was replaced by a more ordinary girl fully and decorously clothed i am loni she said what color do you think my hair is surprised by this approach he sat up and studied her hair brown zombif lovfr no red no green no he was confused i cant decide what color it is thats my talent folk cant agree what color my hair is i admit its not much of a talent but by the same token i am no threat to you if you marry me i will obey you in all things and do my very best to please you always i would just love to be a princess im sorry im not free to marry anyone her face clouded up and so did her hair butbut this is my only chance it may be months before another prince comes to the isle bink realized that she was young he put his arm around her heaving shoulders trying to cheer her she turned into him and gave him a wet kiss and he realized that whatever her age she was just as determined and artful as the others so he steeled himself and resisted her blandishments of whatever nature the next woman was small and elfin im one of the brown knees she said see she spread her knees as she sat on the chair sure enough they were nice and brown but in the process she showed him well up under her short skirt and he knew that she too was doing her best to seduce him in a hurry he managed to blink his eyes closed just before they reached the freakout region the next was molly coddle i just love children she said brightly i hope to get a dozen delivered there had to be some way out of this but the women were addressing him continuously using every kind of artifice and he couldnt concentrate i am lasha lamia i can create cloudstones she demonstrated forming a stone so light that it floated yet was hard enough to use for construction i could help you build a nice light castle that you could pick up and move when you wanted a change of scenery she leaned forward showing the scenery inside her loose blouse it was neverending he was holding out but how long could dor or dolph survive especially dolph who really was as young as he looked woof im a real bitch he looked startled it was a doga talking female dog how did you get in here he asked piers anthony the dog became a cat i told them you might like a pet feline how do you like me i am catrana ill purr if you stroke me he stroked her and she purred then she became a teakettle dragon can be any creature you like she hissed marry me and be perpetually entertained ohanother demoness sorry i dont need to marry a talking pet oh phooey she swore it worked for my friend vera similitude with her two dogs disa pointer and up setter she started unlacing her bodice ill never disa point or up set you the next was tall thin and ugly i am tipsy troll know you wont like me so ill shut up for my time and give you a chance to rest bless you he exclaimed and kissed her she was so surprised she fell backwards onto the bed this wasnt artifice because she lay absolutely still and silent letting him rest now that he had a chance to think a good thought came what these women wanted were princes or kings but there werent enough in all xanth to accommodate them all but there were enough in another realm idas moons because every person who ever existed or would exist or might exist was there there should be hundreds of perfectly good princes who would love to have experience with women of real xanth if there were just some way to make contact and there was dor had saved that jar of sleep potion they could go to those dream worlds and find princes andand what the princes would not be able to leave their dream realm and the women would not be able to go permanently to idas moons unless the zombie master found a way for his zombies to go andno because the zombies bodies would remain buried in xanth real folk couldnt be buried like that they would have to sleep on beds and wake every so often to eat and exercise tipsy got up my time is done she said sadly i hope you enjoyed your respite she was a decent woman suddenly he wanted to do something for her he couldnt marry her but maybe he could help her dont go he said oh but i have to my time is up and the vine cousins are next vine cousins zombie lover clinging and bo vine they stay he said firmly i cant marry you but maybe i can find a prince for you and the others i want you to stay and help me work this out but i cant my turn bink faced the door and saw the line of women waiting there tipsy troll is staying with me for now were looking for a way to find princes for all of you now back off or wont do it surprised they backed off bink turned back to tipsy heres the thing know where there are hundreds of princes and i know how you can meet them but i dont know how you can marry them oh well make them marry us if we catch them at least those of us with formidable figures will she glanced disparagingly down at herself where are they on idas moons she looked blank where princess ida has he paused realizing that this could get complicated and they might not believe it ill show you then you can tell the others go to king dor and ask him for the jar of sleep potion she nodded she left the chamber and returned soon with dor himself and his woman of the moment davina she looked reasonably enough like the neighbor woman then came dolph with his woman fiona she looked like the girl next door but surely she was old enough or she wouldnt be here i realized what you were up to the moment she asked for the sleep potion dor said and i knew we had to come with you so as to be together and stay out of mischief but the women wont let us go alone bink nodded we can do it with six people i dont think theres a limit on the size of dream parties then the women can report on what we find dor looked at the bed well need more space to sleep exactly what is happening here davina inquired suspiciously hes got an idea tipsy said eagerly to find hundreds of princes i believe him fiona shrugged i can live with an idea like that with that reassurance the others soon dragged three beds out into piers anthow the mam area ot the pool and put them together then the three men lay down on them and the three women insisted on lying beside each of them dor handed the jar to voracia gie each of us a good sniff of this then close the jar and leave us alone until we wake this may take a tew hours but may be worth it except for the problem ot the impermanence of contact bmk thought he would have to discuss that with the others while they traveled but right now they had to handle the practical aspects ot the visit you three womenhold our hands when you see us in the dream this will be a wild trip for you voracia unscrewed the lid and gave them sniffs each in turn sank immediately to sleep bmk was the last when he slept he found himself floating above the pool the others were waiting tor him they all linked hands and floated rapidly toward castle roogna on the way bmk started to explain we are going to visit some very small worlds but each is as big as xanth when we get there they are very strange stay close to us and dont get alarmed remember we are all dreaming the three women nodded already impressed it was never our intention to let you out of our sight fiona said the ghost at castle roogna spied them and summoned princess ida as before she smiled and went to sleep and they homed in on dream ptero oooo fiona exclaimed as they fell toward the rapidly swelling globe its growing magic is difterent on this planet dor warned them dont accept any favors from the natives or youll be diminished no thats planet pyramid dolph reminded him on ptero they exchange favors nobody wants to exchange tavors with me anyway tipsy mut tered bmk was to the right ot the others and she was holding his right hand so was at the end of the line you dont seem that ugly bmk said tm sure that by troll standards you are beautitul not so i m only half troll actually my lather was human he caught my mother in a net and trussed her up and signaled the stork ith her and then departed she was tunous but by the time she got zombie lover free of the net there was nothing to do but go hide under a bridge the stork found her anyway to her chagrin im homely by both troll and human standards and not welcome among the trolls because ot my polluted ancestry so i thought i would marry a human man but discovered that they didnt want me either so i figured no one would notice on the isle of women because there are so few men seen there anyway so you were just going through the motions pretending to want a prince bmk said well id marry a prince if he wanted me but lets be realistic if a regular man doesnt want me why should a prince bmk saw her point still she seemed like a nice girl when allowances were made youre half human do you have a magic talent yes but it doesnt do me any good its the cold shoulder you mean you can ignore people no i mean i can make my shoulder cold feel it bmk let go of her hand and touched her shoulder it was cold i suppose that wouldnt make you comfortable to sleep beside he said well its not cold all the time only when i turn it on can you make it hot too no only cold i seldom bother does it make you shiver no that doesnt bother me but i guess the heated exchange from my shoulder makes my heart hot and i hate being hothearted while coldshouldering folk the ground of ptero was now rushing up and they had to concentrate on their landing but bmk continued to think about what he had learned tipsy had a warm heart which no one appreciated she had already done him a favor by giving him time to think instead of constantly trying to seduce him she wasnt pretty but she would be good for any man who cared about character more than appearance that was of course the problem he knew of no men like that even he himself liked chameleon much better when she was beautiful than when she was smart they landed the girls were surprised theres no bump davina cried piers anthony this is a dream remember dor reminded her but it will become more solid as you get used to it i think its fascinating fiona said i love dreaming like this now where can we find some princes dolph asked well have to ask dor said with regret that means exchanging a favor maybe that tower will know tipsy suggested pointing to a nearby tower that seemed to be made of eyeballs dor considered i wonder whether eyeballs are animate or inanimate i can talk to them it they are the latter they went to the tower which turned out to be huge big solid eyeballs braced the four corners of the base and smaller ones were piled up to a towering top where a single monstrous eye stared around you can talk to it and see whether it answers bink suggested what are you dor asked it i am the eyefull tower it replied i see everything can you see where a number of princes are certainly do you want to know where they are yes what service will you exchange for that information well i can talk with the inanimate can see that old man now what will you exchange what do you want dor asked i want to get rid of that club soda that lurks too close they looked but saw only a sparkling pool where dor asked go drink some soda and see frn thirsty davma said she knelt and dipped a little cup into the soda she sipped it suddenly she was flat on her back fiona rushed to help her sit up it clubbed me davma said dizzily tiny planets whirled around her head now bmk appreciated why the eyefull tower might not appre ciate having the pool so close any splashing would get an eyeball clubbed but how could they move a pool it happened to be in a hollow with the land rising in all directions i could push it somewhere dolph said if it were solid zombif lover i can make it solid tipsy said dolph looked at her how can you do that like this tipsy rolled back her sleeve so that her shoulder showed it looked faintly blue oddly she lay down so close to the edge that the bare shoulder overlapped the pool she angled her body so that the shoulder touched the surface of the liquid a film appeared on the pool spreading out from the point of contact soon it thickened hey im cold the pool protested thats ice bmk exclaimed from the cold shoulder the ice reached across the pool and penetrated to its base i think it can be moved now tipsy gasped dolph changed into a bull dozer perhaps inspired by the one they had seen on the isle of bovmes put down his horns and pushed the ice slid out ot the hollow in one thick disk dolph shoved it on across the landscape until it went over a ridge and slid down the far side away from the tower now if you care to tell us where those princes are dor said fair enough follow the direction ot my gaze to the horizon there you will find prince town where all the unemployed princes are getting educated but you will have to cross more than one comic strip on the way thank you dor said he oriented on the direction the towering eye was looking but the others were not quite ready fiona had gotten davma to her feet and the tiny planets had faded but tipsy remained on the ground bmk went to her may i help you up dont touch my shoulder she gasped youll freeze so he reached down and put his arm around her waist it was quite warm he lifted her and she fell against him her chest was burning hot no wonder she was gasping it had been a considerable heat exchange how can i help you he asked concerned no ill be all right when i even out but she seemed to be in real distress that amount of heat exchange must have stressed her system to the breaking point even in a dream how can i help you he repeated she blushed but that might be another effect of the heat if ou could stand toto kiss me piers anthony he kissed her heat flowed from her face to his warming him throughout it wasnt physical heat but emotional warmth because her heart was hot she needed release from the agony of unrequited warmheartedness he held her while her body returned to normal her shoulder warmed up and her bosom cooled thank you she murmured at last thank you he replied you enabled us to get the information we need they set out for prince town dolph could have changed form and carried them but might have confused the direction so they stayed on the ground soon they came to a comic strip i think we had better mark our direction carefully and fly over this dor said grimly why davina asked it looks like an innocent border the three men sent a glance circling around they shrugged some things were best learned the hard way they stepped onto the strip there was a pretty flower in the shape of a stomach oh what a pretty posy fiona said learning forward to sniff it wait dor said sharply what is that thats a cute gastritis one of several nearby crosses replied each of them was garbed in a dress sniff it and youll have one heaven of a stomachache fiona jerked her head back thank you for the warning cross dressers she said suddenly a swarm of bright red ants crossed in front of them wherever they stepped fire broke out those fire ants are ringing us with fire dolph cried they retreatedand fell with several splashes into a foul pond of soapy water what is this dor demanded as he struggled to get out of it lake hogwash the pond replied to wash pigs like you there were even toys floating in the dirty water bink grabbed one that was in the shape of a word let it was attached to a string that disappeared into the murky depths what are you he asked isnt it obvious sewerbreath im a toy let it figured but it could be useful bink jerked hard on the string zombie lovfr there was a loud sucking sound and the level of the hogwash descended what did you do tipsy asked as she fought to stay clear of the small whirlpool that was forming i flushed the toy let soon they were standing around the drain in the bottom all the hogwash has been flushed they looked for a way to climb out of the empty pool dolph felt among several disks that were perched near the edge quit that you bleepity bleep a disk swore villainously it was of course a disk cuss fiona found a way that led through another pool one that had not drained but she hesitated to try it a number of small buglike creatures floated in it what are you she asked it im a sep tic tank it replied those are sep tics bink said recognizing them they live in sludgy bays theyll suck out our minds in the filthiest way they finally found a shallow section and helped each other out here there were a number of elastic loops whenever someone picked one up it played music since they were easy to pick upthey stuck to shoes and clothingsoon there was a discordant medley i hate rubber bands dor muttered bink came up against a clump of bigleafed plants they bore fruit that hung down and pointed up eat me the fruit begged tipsy reached for one i am suddenly hungry she said bink stopped her wait till we get out of the comic strip those fruits will drive you crazy why what are they bananas meanwhile fiona had brushed a huge toad oooo im going to fight the whole world she cried looking for a weapon dolph grabbed her and looked at her hand i thought so youve got warts let go of me she raged i have battles to fight but dolph got a piece of cloth and scrubbed at her hand until the warts came off then she relaxed those were warts he explained they make you go to war oh she said abashed piers anthony tipsy saw a nicelooking pillow maybe ill sit on that and rest she said first let me check dor said what are you sit on me and find out dont get fresh with me what are you awww im a pun cushion i dont think you want to sit on that dor told her bink kept his mouth shut though he was curious what would have happened it might have made jokes about getting to the bottom of things or bad smelling puns might have erupted beneath her the far side of the comic strip was close they lunged for it but a nasty little canine creature growled and menaced them pay no attention to it dolph said thats a pet peeve my sister ivy used to have them all the time they charged by the peeve and burst out of the strip they were in sad shape with their clothing stinking wet and torn the three girls had their hair straggling in assorted tangles and their faces were smudged we need to get cleaned up fiona said i see a pool over there why clean up dor asked this is only a dream the girls circled a glance that said men then fiona spoke again all the same we want to be cleanin and out of the dream thats a cess pool dolph said innocently fiona looked as if she had gotten another wart but tipsy spied a better prospect theres a well they considered the well what kind of well are you dor asked it midas well it replied might as well dolph agreed and started lowering its bucket so as to haul up some water but dor was more cautious what does your water do if you touch it it turns you to gold suddenly the girls lost interest in the well but we still must clean up fiona said desperately then bink saw a big bow it had huge pretty colorful loops of ribbon and several big arrows i believe thats a rain bow he said that should do it zombif lover he picked up the bow and fitted a white arrow to it i forget which color does what he said but we can try them all he looked at the girls youll need an enclosure why davina asked so you wont freak us out as you strip to wash she nodded point made if you freaked out we might be stuck here with no escape but what is there to make an enclosure what is there dor asked the surroundings ahem it was an oval sign content ahead go find out the sign said so they walked in that direction and found a huge tent made of corn it had a number of sections and it was possible to draw on the corn silk strands to open the top to the sky this will do davina said its corny but sufficient but theres no water fiona protested the rain bow arrows will make rain bink explained ill fire them over the tent just say when the three entered the tent in a moment items of their clothing were strung up over the edge of the enclosure when davina called bink fired the white arrow as it passed over the tent a sprinkle of rain came from it is that the best you can do fiona called bink fired the blue arrow a mild shower descended thats better davina said but we could use more so he fired the red arrow a wild torrent poured from it eeeeek the three cried its cold one of them jumped so high that enough of her showed to put a temporary freak on binks left eye dor and dolph were watching too but neither complained bink wondered which one they had seen it wasnt the kind of thing he felt free to inquire about pw piers athon soon they were done their clothing remained wet but it was clean now its your turn fiona said well fire the arrows so the three kings had to go in and strip and soon they were drenched by the rain arrows but they got clean they put the wet clothing back on and emerged tipsy looked at them thats better now we can meet the princes davina turned to dor the next comic strip we come tofly over it she said severely the men smiled the point had been made they got their direction and resumed travel when they came to the next comic strip boundary they made sure of their direction and then dolph changed form and carried them all over it finally they came to prince town this was protected by thickly tangled ivy vines some of them leagues long dolph flew them over and they landed in a nicely laid out pattern of streets buildings and parks girls ahoy someone shouted immediately they were surrounded by princes they ignored the kings and focused on the women but soon that focus narrowed to davina and fiona dull tipsy had been tuned out she rejoined bink even in a dream i cant get the attention of a prince she said with resignation but youre a fine person i think weve already been over that a problem has occurred to me dor said how can living xanth women marry dream princes the two realms dont overlap in reality that bothers me too bink said i was hoping we would figure out a way i can think of something that might work tipsy said they turned to her if you can do that well be in your debt bink said she smiled sadly but you cant marry me even if you wanted to so forget it here is my notion maybe we dont need to have the realms overlap all we need is to have plenty of that dreaming potion so the women of the isles can visit prince town whenever they want they can marry princes here and do whatever they want with them and when they want to rest they can simply wake up and be where zombie lover no man can bother them most of them would appreciate that though they wouldnt say so in mixed company dor nodded that sounds good for the women but wouldnt the princes object i think they would be glad to see the women any time the women appeared apparently they are a long way from princess town and they probably need time for their studies so they might like half time too especially since the women would be coming with romance in mind i understand that men do have other interests like jousting and gambling and watching nymphs run that they dont necessarily care to share with women bink nodded astute assessment lets put it to the princes would they like parttime marriages to lovely women they discussed it with the princes and it turned out that the princes were indeed interested provided they got to pick the women themselves davina and fiona already had commitments from suitable princes in fact they were not yet ready to wake they had hot dates in mind so tipsy troll returned with the three kings they simply went outside of prince town held hands and concentrated on waking up they woke in the retention pool davina and fiona remained asleep but tipsy was able to make the report in short she concluded every woman can have a prince in a dream marriage without leaving the isle the princes are eager to meet all of you all you need is the sleep potion and a place to lie down the others were not convinced but they released the three kings to roam the isle while the matter was being settled when davina and fiona woke they would compare notes but bink hesitated as they departed the pool what of you tipsy he asked there doesnt seem to be much for you in prince town theres not much for me anywhere she said sadly an idea had been simmering in the background and now it moved hesitantly forward would you consider marrying a nonprince id marry anyone who wanted me but no one does how about a man who molds things into other things sure it was significant that she didnt qualify her agreement or ask whether the man was handsome or nice i know a man who wants a wife in fact he agreed to tell us p piers anthony something we want to know if we bring him a wife from the isle of women his name is phil istine hes not a prince but he wasnt thinking of a troll but i think he might settle for one with a bit of management all right then stay with us we must find breanna and make sure shes all right then when the women are satisfied with the dream princes we can leave the isle and take you along they set off on the path toward the house breanna had entered but before they had taken many steps there was breanna herself coming toward them are you all right bink and breanna called together then they laughed together isle of wolves i came out of the house and you were gone breanna told the three kings i was afraid something had happened to you something did king dor agreed but we worked it out what of you something happened to me too but now its all right king xeth has found a good zombie woman to marry and they are addressing the stork now so i dont have to stay here after all well be glad to take you home when we leave prince dolph said which should be soon thanks im glad things are okay then she noticed that there was another person with them hello im breanna of the black wave im tipsy troll im going with them too breanna was surprised not tipsy laughed not married no but they think theres a man there who will marry me oh okay and of course she had known that none of the kings would have married any woman of the isle indeed they would not justin tree said but i suspect that they have quite a story to tell if they care to tell it breanna made a mental note to be sure to ask for that story when the occasion seemed propitious then she thought of something else justin i guess my adventure is just about over now that ive es pilks anthoni caped marriage to the zombie king thanks to your help so i guess that means well be purling company soon confess that is a sad occasion for me you have been fascinating company and you have been great really needed your guidance but of course you have your own life to live now and do not need any further intrusions i guess but she was dissatisfied justin know you have had enough of teenage girls by now as if there could ever be enough of them do you think maybei mean if you dont have something better to doyou could maybe sort of well stay around a little longer of course you dont have to do not wish to impose breanna i fear my presence limits your lifestyle you have given me a fine adventure and i cant complain t wish youd stay she felt his surprise you are not merely being polite the good magician did say a year or until we mutually agreed to end it but of course i would not hold you to such a term im being more like desperate i think i dont want to go back to nothingness just yet and thats what itll be but maybe i could sort of hang around with the three kings a while longer and thats bound to be interesting but i dont really know them and you do so if you could tell me what to do would be glad to breanna i am gratified that you are not yet tired of my presence im not tired of it i couldntve made it without you thank you for that sentiment they walked to the dock there was the duckfooted boat will you take us back to the mainland dor asked it sure when the women say its okay when the isle interfaces again but that wont be until tomorrow breanna protested no thats the automatic cycle the women can change it when they want to to let an impatient prince in or to take a married one out with his bride we can go when voracia says its okay she should be along in due course zombih lovfr thats great breanna said though she was speaking more for the kings than for herself this did not seem like a bad isle now that she had settled with xeth they sat down to wait for voracia and while they rested they exchanged stories justins surmise turned out to be correct the women had pulled a dastardly stunt and only some good breaks and good thinking had gotten them out of it exactly as it had been for breanna herself voracia came down the path were setting up the interface she told the boat take them back to xanth she glanced at tipsy youre going too yes they think theres a man for me good for you weve got dream princes galore davina and fiona confirmed it and will show us the way there they got into the boat and it paddled across the pond and ran up onto the path on the other side they were on their way they reached the shore and the boat splashed into the sea there was xanth as she gathered it had not been until the women set up the interface now may be a propitious time to raise the matter oh yes uh you said you would take me home yes of course king dor said could you maybe wait on that i mean im grateful but id sort of like to stick around with you a while if thats not too much trouble king dor glanced at the others who nodded certainly breanna you have been of real help to us and we appreciate it we suspect that our own adventure such as it has been is about done but you will be welcome to remain with us until it ends gee thanks she stifled a tear she really appreciated their generosity they were all good men as well as being kings unlike that bad ralph they reached the other dock and disembarked there were a few zombies wandering desolately around oops theres something i should do breanna said we can keep you from the zombies prince dolph said well simply fly away from them no im tired of running from problems breanna walked boldly piers anthony up to the nearest zombie hello im breanna the one youve been chasing but you can go home now because your king xeth has found love with zyzzyva zombie instead and will marry her theyll be returning here in a day or two i think do you understand the zombie seemed surprised underzdand he repeated after a suitable pause for cogitation good enough you stay here to welcome them when they come then she extended her hand after another pause the zombie extended his hand breanna grasped it firmly and shook it not hard it felt somewhat slimy but she gave no sign of disgust she had conquered her fear of zombies good for you breanna then she returned to the kings okay thats done dor was talking with the duckfooted boat he looked up as breanna returned we have made a deal it will be days before para needs to service the isle of women because their interest is now on dreams voracia will call if the boat is needed sooner so we will exchange conveyances so the boat is para with the two docks justin remarked appreciatively there can be more meanings in a name than one expects yeah every time you figure you know something theres more you dont know i dont understand tipsy said thought that man was near here no hes some distance south bink said but we feel there is one thing you need before you meet him so we shall fetch it now i dont mean to be any trouble tipsy said they dont consider it trouble breanna said theyre nice people she had come to know the trollwoman somewhat while they waited to cross back to xanth and knew she was warmhearted you helped them theyre helping you king dor bink tipsy and breanna got into the boat again prince dolph changed into a roc bird he caught up the boat in his huge talons spread his wings and took off breanna saw that it was definitely easier to be carried in the boat than it would have been to be clutched by bare claws wheee the boat exclaimed wiggling its feet ive been on land and sea but never in air before zombie lover me too breanna agreed peering down as the land fell below and me tipsy said looking down the other side it looks just like a map were going to mt rushmost bink explained for some lip bomb a bomb you put it on your lips and when you kiss a man it just about knocks him out in a pleasant way we think that with that you will be able to make an impression on phil istine tipsy looked at breanna breanna shrugged i havent encountered this have long ago it is a good ploy but justin says its good breanna said soon they came to a towering mountain dolphroc glided to a landing at the edge of its upper plateau he set the boat down changed to manform and jumped in as the duck feet got moving we are looking for karla sharon or chea centaur dor said or serena girl go that way the ground said its voice moving in a particular direction they went that way and came to an early evening fire where three winged monsters congregated all of them were centaurs and female what are you men back again for more punishment one of the centaur fillies demanded im not a man and neither is tipsy troll breanna said before it occurred to her that silence might be better youre not winged either the centaur said disapprovingly karla we come to ask another favor king dor said quickly wed like to get some lip bomb for tipsy the centaurs considered what use would a troll have for that she did us a favor and now we want to help her get married shes a good person we think the lip bomb will enable her to make a suitable impression very well we will give it to you but you must demonstrate it on your two girls so that they understand its nature you mean we must don it and kiss our companions prince dolph asked exactly pifrs anthony king dor looked at the girls i dont know but breanna was curious sure one of you can kiss me she said ill know you dont mean it so its no violation of the adult conspiracy if that matters the kings looked doubtful but didnt argue all right tipsy agreed uncertainly karla brought out a jar of red stuff come here king dor she said with a typically centaurian obscure smile she took paste on her fingers and carefully smeared it on his lips then she did the same with bink now kiss them the king and the prince turned bink approached tipsy and dor approached breanna apologize for the necessity he said oh at least pretend some enthusiasm breanna said naughtily it isnt as if i havent been kissed by a king before he took her in his arms and put his lips to hers it was sort of pathetic that this middleaged man thought his kiss could have any real effect then her mouth detonated and she would have fallen spinning to the ground except for the fact that he was firmly supporting her stars and planets careened in circles around her head the experience was devastatingly pleasant she found herself limp in his embrace do what you want with me she murmured blissfully have no fear of that he replied it is only a demonstration as we agreed he set her on her feet and let go and she was able to stand somewhat unsteadily that lip bomb is remarkable stuff justin remarked now i appreciate more fully why they believe it will help tipsy troll for sure if xeth had used it on me wed be married by now she looked around tipsy troll was sagging against bink with little hearts floating up from her head obviously his kiss had been just as potent thats some stuff breanna repeated awed karla handed tipsy the jar now you know what to do with this she said go get your man now i know tipsy agreed dizzily we thank you very kindly king dor said perhaps you fillies can come to the big royal wedding next week at castle roogna oh who is getting married we dont know but it will surely be a momentous occasion zombif l vik we like momentous occasions karla said but we dont have invitations i will try to get some made up for you king dor said well give them to you when you arrive the centaur frowned thats not exactly the way it is done king dor shrugged im a man i dont know any better true well try to attend ask serena erica and aurora to come too prince dolph said we shall they got into the boat and it ran toward the brink the centaurs waved farewell evidently intrigued by their mode of transportation the boat charged right over the edge and dropped toward the distant ground tipsy and breanna screamed then prince dolph changed form his feet grabbing the sides of the boat while his great wings spread and took up the slack the fall became a rise they were on their way that was fun the boat said breanna stomped a floor panel king dor and bink brought out handkerchiefs and wiped the remaining lip bomb from their faces breanna touched her own lips where a trace of bliss lingered she had had no idea that something like that existed it was a devastating weapon in the war of genders usable by either side as it was she had half a crush on king dor despite his advanced age they flew down to the ground somewhat south of the isle they landed and prince dolph resumed riding in the boat soon they came to a man contemplating a loaf of bread as they halted by him the bread became a statue of a winged dragon phil istine king dor said stepping out of the boat we have brought you a wife from the isle of women phils eye fell on breanna a black beauty he said but isnt she about three years young not me white trash breanna retorted her she indicated tipsy who was carefully applying lip bomb a troll moll phil demanded incredulously i meant a humantype woman she is half human bink said and a nice person with a warm heart i dont care about her heart shes a troll piers anthony at least give her a try king dor suggested kiss her why should i kiss a troll its no deal then let her kiss you bink said evenly as tipsy got out of the boat phil did not look pleased but couldnt refute the logic because there wasnt enough to refute so he stood disdainfully while tipsy approached him and planted a hot kiss on his lips it was something to watch the man fell back spun three times around and fell on the ground leaving a trail of heartshaped cloudlets it would have been comical if breanna hadnt experienced such a kiss herself tipsy went to help him sit up im sorry didnt mean to okay youll do phil said then he glared at king dor but still shes a troll thats only half a loaf so ill give you half a loaf in exchange ill just tell you who else knows where you live go to the king of the werewolves in the isle of wolves king dor did not look pleased but breanna saw that there was a certain logic to phil istines decision tipsy was a nice woman but she was a troll with the help of the lip bomb she would surely make phil about as happy as he deserved to be meanwhile this meant that the three kings would need to visit another interesting place and that breanna would be able to enjoy their adventure a while longer breanna went to tipsy could you spare a little of that lip bomb id like to have it for an emergency certainly tipsy found a packet and scraped some of the red stuff into it thank you breanna put the packet away king dor returned to the boat can you take us to the isle of wolves he asked with resignation sure its not far from the isle of women very well please take us there now they got in the boat and it padded toward the water ran in then paddled swiftly north breanna looked back there was tipsy troll waving breanna waved back feeling a lump in her throat they had gotten tipsy what she most desperately wanted a husband but had they done right by her the wrong man would be worse than no man at all as breanna s experience with ralph had shown zombit loyfcr suppose phil mistreats her she asked bink i mean some men are brutes bink nodded i have a similar concern though her talent of the cold shoulder could set him back if that proved necessary thats one reason i decided to fetch the lip bomb can you imagine ever mistreating a man who kisses you with that she pondered that no i guess not when king dor kissed me i would have done anything for him she glanced in the kings direction still would she murmured bink smiled the effect slowly fades i was first kissed by sharon centaur when we delivered aurora winged mermaid there i always liked centaurs and have had good relations with them but i never saw them as romantic objects that is he paused awkwardly i understand breanna said no storks yes but when sharon kissed me i just wanted to please her it wasnt the same as love elixir i wasnt in love with her but she seemed infinitely desirable and if she had wanted to summon the stork i would have found it harder to resist than i did when the isle of women tempted me when i saw her again i felt a thrill as if we had been lovers though we had not if one kiss had such effect what would several have so i think phil istine will never mistreat tipsy breanna nodded youre a lot older than you look and married and sharon is of a different species but that bomb got to you im too young and king dors too old as well as being married but if it were just the two of us in this boat id be growing up real fast so youre right tipsys safe with phil im glad of it because shes a good woman yes actually all the women of the isle are good just desperate they treated us fairly by their lights just as you treat others fairly she agreed you know its just chance that i met up with you but im glad i did and not just because its a nice adventure im learning a lot it may not be just chance he said what do you mean i was trying to escape xeth zombie and you were trying to find your way home neither of us knew or cared about the other i was even asleep when you arrived so our paths crossed randomly pifrs anthony let me see if i can explain my life is less random than it seems because of my talent what is your talent if its okay to ask they call you a king which means you must have a magiciancaliber magic talent but i havent seen anything no offense my talent normally conceals itself from others bink said if i am able to tell you about it it will be because you have some need to know it is he hesitated as if afraid something was going to stop him that i cannot be harmed by magic he looked surprised and you must indeed have a need to know i dont need to know anything im just foolishly curious do you mean that if someone hurls a bad spell at you it wont land more than that no magical creature will do me harm no magic plant will hurt me no magic of the inanimate will act against me but because someone might find a way to circumvent or nullify my talent if its nature were generally known my talent conceals itself so it usually acts indirectly fascinating justin tree remarked suppose a dragon chomps you thats pretty direct and youd need direct protection yes so the dragon will not try to chomp me or if it does try something seemingly coincidental will interfere so that it doesnt happen another dragon might appear on the scene distracting it or it might fall in a hole it didnt see because it was looking at me instead of the ground but then how can you tell that it is your talent protecting you that it isnt all just coincidence he smiled it protects me through coincidence and few folk ever suspect you can test this try harming me nonmagically breanna was abashed oh i would never not seriously just enough to ascertain that you could do it if you wanted to okay im going to push you out of the boat he was beside her on the seat she put her hands against his shoulder and pushed he tilted she pushed harder he was in danger of falling over into the water she desisted i guess i could do it if you didnt tight back now try to harm me magically but dont have any then she remembered the protection zombit lovkr racket was it still working she tried banging her hand against the wooden seat lightly then harder then harder yet hey the boat protested youre going to damage me sorry para the racket was working because she had suffered no pain she looked at bink and raised her fist i have this magic protection so i can hit without being hurt are you sure yes try to hit me okay she said dubiously she aimed a blow at his nose but pulled her punch without touching him bink theres nothing stopping me i cant do this to you do it he said firmly so she aimed for his cheek and tried a light blow it landed bink i tell you theres nothing stopping me i dont dare try to really let me try it justin said okay she relinquished control of her arm to him her arm lifted formed a tight fist and shot directly toward binks nose the boat suddenly swerved causing the fist to miss and she sprawled halfway across binks lap sorry the boat said there was a piece of sharp wreckage i didnt see until the last moment and i had to swerve usually im more alert breanna picked herself up unconvinced that was sheer coincidence dont think so let me try again she addressed bink putting her right hand behind his head and lifting her left fist im going to hate myself in a moment she said grimly but ive got to know she shot her fist forward at his nose a large soft ball flew between them her fist punched into it and it pressed against binks face cushioning the blow so that he wasnt hurt where had the ball come from a snout poked out of the water may we have our ball back miss the sea creature inquired sorry it got in your way who or what are you breanna asked it i am a manatee it said i was just playing a ball game with my family three more snouts appeared i am his wife the womanatee a large one said im his son the boyatee a smaller one said piers anthony im his daughter the girlatee the smallest one said a fifth snout appeared rising into an animal head and im the seal of approval it said family games are good you wouldnt want to interfere would you oh of course not breanna said embarrassed she tossed the ball down to them the seal caught it expertly on its nose and flipped it to the nearest tee the family game resumed as they swam away from the boat dont forget what you were doing bink reminded her gently breanna considered i dont see how coincidence could stretch that far that ball had to be deliberate yes not by the tees or you by my talent okay so you cant be harmed by magic but that doesnt change the coincidence of our meeting i could have come here any other day on the contrary justin said you were traveling because the zombie kissed you the three kings were traveling because the zombies were stirred up looking for you the events are connected believe that we were required to interact bink said there must be some devious magical threat to my wellbeing so my talent is acting to turn it aside by seeming coincidence so it put us together and is keeping us together this adventure is clearly not yet finished so my whole adventure is just to help you avoid some magical threat not necessarily my talent may simply be borrowing from what is most convenient you were in the vicinity so it arranged to have you join us you certainly were helpful in getting us to the isle and in shielding us from initial problems with the women of the isle there may be more coming well if thats why im here i like it she decided but what could threaten three magicians it may not be a physical threat bink said it could be something that i need to get done lest i be truly pained by failure to do so i dont know what that might be but perhaps it will be apparent after it has been accomplished he paused thoughtfully for one thing chameleon and i were youthened by sixty years and there was surely reason for that there must be something i can accomplish as a young man that i could not as an old one i admit its nice to be zombie lover young again physically but so far i have seen no real justification for it it is a good queston youth is not granted to folk just because they may want it if it were every living person would be perpetually young i dont know being young doesnt seem all that great to me it is the nature of life to have unrealistic dreams you should enjoy your youth while you have it maybe so but she was unconvinced land ahoy prince dolph called from up front thats the isle of wolves the boat said it moved to shore waddled onto the beach and stopped king wolvertons den is down that path thank you king dor said as they disembarked i hope our trade of conveyances was worthwhile for you it certainly was para replied i loved flying and it was nice being able to talk aloud and peering up under girls skirts i kept my skirt close and tight breanna retorted hotly but tipsy troll didnt and her legs were pretty good considering well good luck peeking under other skirts breanna said mollified she was discovering that this particular game could be fun to play so her outrage was mostly for show they walked down the path and the boat waddled to the sea and paddled smoothly away on impulse breanna turned and waved to it and saw it rock from side to side waving back you are becoming more solicitous of others including the inanimate austin commented t o so favor it suddenly a wolf appeared its fur was metallic it screeched to a stop when it saw them the squeal came from its four paws scraping along the ground then it became a man he was furry enough on the body to remain fairly decent who are you and what do you want here he demanded we are three kings and a young woman come to see king wolverton how did you reach this isle the interface is off flfrs athon we were conveyed by para the webfooted boat from the isle of women you couldnt have gotten away from there unmarried we are married the woman is beneath the age of marriage oh the werewolf reconsidered t am wolfram follow me he resumed wolf form and loped back down the path soon they eame to a hill a sign labeled it wolverton mountain this was evidently the home of the king wolf sure enough a large wolf emerged from a den as they reached the top of the hill he became a man why you are king dor of xanth he said surprised the one who makes things talk you bet bushytail the nearest stone called yes king dor agreed we accidentally drank some lethe water and forgot where our home is if you would be so kind as to tell us ill be glad toafter you do a service for me listen furface breanna started but justin cut her off we are on their isle it is best to honor their conventions of course king dor said smoothly what can we do for you you can talk my son jeremy into doing his duty and starting training to assume the kingship when pass on to that great other hunting ground he doesnt want to be king after you king dor asked surprised he is in a mottled funk and doesnt want to do anything well well talk to him king dor agreed king wolverton led them to the mottled funk which turned out to be a grove of mottled funk trees he is in there breanna smelled a strong unpleasant odor the smell of the funk blooms it made her feel sad she knew that no funks smelled good but mottled funks were the worst they entered the grove and soon discovered jeremy wolf in wolf form asleep on a bed of funk berries the smell was verging into stench hello king dor said go away the funk bed said prince dolph assumed the form of a wolf woof he said zombifc lovtr prince jeremy opened one eye it was obvious that he was a prince because there was a small golden crown on his head woof he retorted negatively so bink tried wed like to talk to you the face of the wolf became halfway human what you would like has no bearing let me try breanna said impulsively she got down and planted a hot kiss on the face the eyes widened the humanity spread from the face through the rest of the body making him into a large and somewhat clumsy person he still wore the crown wow jeremy said as a vaguely heartshaped cloudlet dissipated think some of the lip balm remained justin remarked serves him right jeremy gazed at breanna how old are you black wave maiden fifteen of course whats it to you jeremy sighed too young too young for what she demanded though she had a pretty good idea too young to be my ideal mate im nobodys ideal mate and least of all yours ive already been through all that with one king what kind of a girl do you think i am jeremy assumed wolf form and stared at her then he returned to human form i think you are an assertive runaway from your home village with the talent of seeing in blackness and a tree in your mind he knows justin exclaimed amazed how do you know that breanna demanded shaken in my natural form i can read minds jeremy said unfortunately i cant do it in manform i constantly seek a way to have that part of my talent expanded do you know a way no and i dont want you poking around in my mind so kindly remain in manform you have spirit and youre cute i wish you were the one well im nol so why dont you do what your father wants and go into training for kingship because of the curse piers anthon what curse nobody else seemed to be talking so breanna figured it was up to her it is complicated well maybe we can help i doubt it but you might as well know when i was young i roamed out from the isle across the continent of xanth heedless of anything i had no fear of monsters because i could read their minds and evade them before they could close on me so i was somewhat reckless and i fear in retrospect at times obnoxious express sympathy now that you have him talking we need to know his problem well we all get that way at times breanna said but i was chronically that way finally it caught up with me in my brash ignorance i trampled a private garden of boysenberries and girlsenberries ruining the crop an old curse fiend woman came out saw the damage and cursed me the curse fiends all have the same talent they can blast a hole in the ground or kit trees or blow people into oblivion with their curses that must have been painful breanna said this wasnt a normal curse she was one of their ranking people and had perfected a worse curse breanna had an idea can you project your thoughts too so you can show me exactly what happened jeremy assumed wolf form then suddenly breanna found herself in the trampled berry patch with little boysen and girlsenberries squished all around her their juice on her fur the old curse fiend appeared you despicable creature she shouted you have ruined my crop may you be cursed to suffer as you have made me suffer hows that breanna werewolf asked these berries would have brought delight to courting couples enabling them to recognize their ideal partners so you will suffer the same loss of delight there will be only one perfect lifes companion for you a foreign woman but you will not be able to find her she will have to find you and you will know her only when she declares her love for you but she will not know that you are her ideal mate so will not look for you and when she passes the age of twenty one without finding you the two of you will never get together and you zombie lovtr will be doomed to be with some lesser creature knowing that you might have had perfect happiness but forfeited it by being thoughtless and stupid now depart you cretin the curse is complete breanna departed her tail between her legs she knew that every word of the curse was true that is one awful curse no wonder he is dejected why should he want to be king knowing that he will never have his perfect love she came out of it and was herself again the three kings were looking at her jeremy has a real problem she said the werewolf back in human form nodded agreement i have looked everywhere but found no perfect woman oh there have been many who expressed interest in me but when they did i know they were not the one they just wanted to be princesses or queens i want the one who will love me for what i truly am not caring about my status i must find her before she passes twenty one or lose her forever and i cant find her but thats not the curse breanna said she has to find you i have searched by ranging widely telling women of the curse so that if any should be the right one she will be encouraged to come to me that is how i have tried to nullify that aspect but it has all been for naught i fear my true love has already passed the critical age and i am forever lost this s a negative assumption he is clearly in this funk because he has given up hope of success okay jeremy breanna said in businesslike fashion either shes over twenty one and its too late or she isnt theres no point in figuring shes over because thats hopeless so you have to figure shes under and you can still find her or rather have her find you because thats the only way you can possibly win the werewolf prince gazed at her somewhat hopelessly what can i do that i have not already done lets get some basics established first if you find your true love will you agree to start training for the kingship yes of course i have nothing against it its just that without my true love i have no ambition for anything else okay so as i see it maybe you just need to make yourself more attractive to that ideal girl which is funny in a way funny im depressed piers anthony not funny you funny thought i just came from the isle of women where i was helping a lady zombie learn to be more appealing to a king now i have to show a prince how to be more appealing to a lady im no expert either way but at least the lady zombie did get the king if you can enable me to get my true love i will be forever in your debt actually im just trying to help the three kings theyve had a whole lot more experience with woman than i have bink laughed but we lack one prime prerequisite we are not female which may be why you are here the distaff perspective is required the what perspective female oh well ill do my best she addressed jeremy again now this perfect woman is foreign that means shes not a werewolf at least is not a werewolf of the isle of wolves though i have checked the local bitches too the local whats a female canine is a bitch it is not a term of disrespect in this context i knew that she said remembering so she could be a different type of crossbreed or even dull human she could be anything jeremy said thats what makes the search so difficult for sure but can we assume that she will have a human form or can take that form when she wants to i dont know well lets assume it because that makes it a whole lot easier because what little i know about women is all human i cant help you learn to impress a bi a nonhuman female that makes sense king dor said and perhaps the conventions for different species are similar enough in essence to make it relevant lets hope breanna said okay so lets see if we can make you so appealing to women that the right one is bound to take notice it would be better if we had a real woman but i guess well have to zowrif lovfr make do with whats available which is a simple girl if you can impress me you can probably impress her i have impressed many women jeremy said but none would have noticed me if i werent royal precisely so lets pretend you are a completely ordinary werewolf ditch the crown jeremy lifted the crown from his head he buried it out of sight in the funk now i am just another werewolf right breanna looked around help me guys what comes next perhaps you should be a woman passing by and he tries to impress you king dor suggested okay impress me jeremy breanna walked just outside the glade turned and walked innocently back in the three kings faded circumspectly into the background jeremy became a huge wolf and rose up with a horrendous growl eeeeeek breanna screamed the big bad wolf is going to eat me up the wolf became the man no go no go breanna agreed i mean impress me as a man like for a date she walked out of the glade and back in hello luscious maiden jeremy said have a date he proffered a thyme berry breanna almost fell over laughing i made an error jeremy asked annoyed my fault i guess for using a mundane term i meant a date as in boy and girl go somewhere together and do something fun together but you are too young for that i dont mean storks she exploded isnt there anything else on a mans mind should there be at ease breanna it was a natural misunderstanding on his part and he reacted appropriately hes a decent sort so she stifled her natural reaction and used the occasion for some necessary education some subtlety may be in order here men may think that storks are in constant need of summoning but women have other things on their minds piers anthony they do the werewolf seemed amazed definitely so get the stork out of your mind anyway were playacting here so my age is irrelevant so dont think of storks not because im too young but because no woman thinks of them until late in the game make her love you then maybe shell think of the stork eventually actually the women of the isle of women seemed to think of nothing but storks according to the report of the kings they were trying to nab a king thats different suppose it is i seems to be true that men have storks or at least the act of summoning them on their minds more than women do jeremy shook his head this is more difficult than i ever imagined how can women exist without constantly thinking of storks we have disciplined minds so just try to figure out something that you and i might like to do together that has nothing to do with storks the man pondered and cogitated and thought and considered and reflected sweat formed on his brow you stumped him breanna almost laughed i guess id better give you a hint how about taking a nice walk together where anywhere it doesnt matter the point is just to be doing it this is strange indeed arent there any interesting sights on the isle of wolves well theres the quandary so lets take a walk and go see that if you insist its really not much especially with the masses you arent making this very interesting breanna said what masses the mass confusion and mass hysteria people go near them and i get the picture are there any other local sights theres the ink well we draw buckets of ink up and ship them to all other parts of xanth breanna made a gesture as of tearing her hair none of this will do wed better stick to boygirl suppose we just walk around in a circle and make interesting conversation zombif lover but you said that girls dont think of anything interesting breanna opened her mouth but justin intercepted her expostulation before it got out he means your refusal to think of stork summoning change the subject good advice again i think im just going to have to tell you some things to talk about but that means i wont be able to judge how impressive it is we need another girl one who doesnt know i am a prince jeremy agreed for sure okay first off youll have to notice how pretty i am but i dont mean me personally i mean any woman you have to compliment her you have to scratch for nice things to say about her if shes got distinctive features you notice them whatever they are even if theyre really not much now try noticing me he studied her head you have lustrous long black hair she clapped her hands thats it youre making me be flattered and that makes me like you better try again he looked at her face you have glowing green eyes right on he looked at her mid section you have a nice little nuhuh off limits theres nothing in that region youre supposed to notice he looked at her chest you no but theres not much else to notice then get creative and after that with luck shell ask about you and you must tell her something moody and feelingful evoking her sympathy and then follow up with whatever seems apt just keep the dialogue going nicely and shell get interested in you then if shes the one youre home free i never did any of this before which is maybe why you never got anywhere lets see what else we ean arm you with she looked around any of you have suggestions the weather king dor asked okay jeremy if theres awkward silence and you cant think of anything else talk about the weather not bad weather interesting weather piers anthony this all seems horribly farfetched women have farfetched minds now lets review this to be sure you have it straight then well have to go out and test it on a real woman they worked on it and bit by bit he seemed to be getting it but breanna was really worried about whether it would every play in real life this promised to be a long grueling and probably fruitless exercise meanwhile she was tired she normally slept in the daytime and she hadnt had much of a chance yet today impromptu ingenue t hey seemed to be making progress but dolph was bored teaching jeremy werewolf to impress women favorably might be a positive step but the chances of him being able to impress the right one in time seemed remote how long would it take days weeks months they couldnt afford the time they had a big wedding to get back to back homewherever that was he stepped back out of sight then became a small bird and flew up to take a look around the isle was quiet it was late afternoon and the wolves were mostly snoozing he flew toward the mainlandand there was para the duckfooted boat paddling toward the isle riding in it were jenny elf and sammy cat he knew what that meant sammy could find anything except home so the two had been sent out to find the three kings to remind them to get on back home instead of dawdling the three were more than ready to go home the moment they could he was going to fly down and introduce himself as jenny was his friend then he thought of something jenny could be their ingenue she was female and of age and didnt know what they were doing so he had better not tell her anything he would warn the others and thus give jeremy some real practice he looped down and soon returned to the funk grove he resumed his natural form the awful smell of the grove hit him anew he had become acclimatized until he got a breath of fresh air jenny elfs coming he announced pifrs anthom sent to find us dor said she will know where our home is yes bink agreed but we cant ethically leave until we solve jerems problem i was thinking that jenny could help in that she can be the ingenue the ingenue dor exclaimed breanna glanced across at them whats this our friend jenny elf is coming dolph explained she must hae been sent to find us because her cat sammy can find almost anything she can be the ingenue because she wont know that jeremy is a prince he can try to impress her is that fair breanna asked to put one of your friends in that position you think im going to chomp off her arm jeremy demanded no its just thatwell i suppose its all right she turned to the werewolf but make sure you remember that youre just practicing you dont actually want to summon any storks you want to see what works so that you can go out and maybe win your perfect love i understand the werewolf prince said if i can impress her maybe i can yel manage to break the curse meanwhile what about the rest of us dolph asked wont we be in the way we can go eat take a nap or whatever else we fancy dor said but someone should stay just in case im dead on my feet breanna said just want to sleep you can have my bed here jeremy said ill go meet her outside the grove shell be looking for us so we three kings had better meet her dor said but then we can move on so why dont you go with us dolph then change form and keep an eye on jenny he glanced at jeremy its not that we dont trust you but if there is awkwardness this ensures immediate contact with us probably there will be errors and well have to explain things to jenny im sure shell cooperate shes a ery nice girl thats good im suddenly very nervous have come to know breanna but this is a stranger a thousand things could go wrong they organized and started out of the grove while breanna plumped herself down put her head on her crossed arms and ent to sleep jeremy glanced back breanna is nice too im sorry shes not the one shes a good girl bink agreed made better perhaps by justin trees presence it must be nice to find such companionship maybe it will happen for you especially if you learn how to impress women dolph said they emerged from the grove their timing was right jenny ell and sammy cat were just arriving the elf girl was wrinkling her nose as if she smelled something horriblethe mottled funk of course oh there you are jenny cried she ran up to hug dolph she was so small she seemed like a child though he knew she was twenty usually he didnt notice you have to come back now they are setting up wedding rehearsals and you have parts to play we will soon dolph said but right now we have something else to do would you mind waiting with jeremy he gestured to the werewolf who looked tonguetied oh sure she agreed just dont be too long i promised to bring you back to castle roogna within a day castle roogna jenny lifted a brow you know home home dor exclaimed remembering jenny laughed you couldnt have forgotten could you im afraid we could have bink said we drank some lethe water by accident oh that explains it we didnt know what was keeping you we will return shortly dolph said the three of them walked on leaving jenny with jeremy as soon as they went around a bend in the path dolph became an invisible winged man and looped back he had always been able to change forms but as he had grown older and gained experience his talent had broadened and deepened until now he could do much more for example he had learned to assume other human forms so that he could make himself more handsome or muscular or smarter he seldom did it because electra liked him just the way he was naturalh piers anthony but he could do it when he had reason now he had reason he wanted to retain his full human intelligence which could get cramped in smallheaded bird form yet be able to move silently without leaving footprints so this form was good for that and he would change it when he needed to he flitted back to eavesdrop on jeremy and jenny he felt a bit guilty for not telling jenny what was going on but if he had done so that would have spoiled jeremys test he would tell her everything as soon as it was feasible the two were standing in the very kind of awkward silence that was supposed to be avoided dolph came up behind the werewolf compliment he whispered you have nice spectacles jeremy said oh theyre just from a spectacle bush jenny said i cant see very well without them there was more silence try again dolph whispered you have nice hands jenny held them up you like four fingers four fingers he said amazed worse and worse this wasnt working you didnt know jenny asked then why did you comment jererny stared at his feet im sorry i was trying to say something nice but im not good at it something nice why do you really want to know he asked dejected yes of course its sort of complicated life often is tell me im trying to learn how to impress women because i am cursed not to recognize my true love until she comes to me only she wont know it so wont come so i need to be interesting enough so shell want to jenny digested that i guess its a start but i should think you would fare better just by being yourself but im just sort of dull and clumsy in this form this form what other form do you have im a werewolf zomrii lovhr a werewolf jenny exclaimed delighted thats wonderful it is i always liked wolves im a wolfrider you ride wolves well i did back home but i never met any wolves here in xanth so i couldnt ride anyway it isnt as if i could ride just any wolf it isnt no it has to be a wolf friend thatswell it gets complicated to explain in my wolf form can read minds may i read yours a telepathic wolf certainly why not i have nothing to hide and you can get the concept much more quickly and completely jeremy changed to wolf form jenny smiled and stroked his fur she was a small girl and he was a big wolf so his head was as high as hers she showed no fear at all instead she was plainly delighted to be in the company of a wolf dolph shook his invisible head suddenly this was working out but not in the way expected jeremy hadnt impressed her by his attempted compliments but by his basic nature which jenny happened to like did that count jeremy resumed manform so he could talk your world of two moonshow wonderfully strange he said i had no idea you were such a remarkable person with such an exotic origin oh im not remarkable or exotic she protested i just came to xanth by accident chasing sammy cat im strictly nothing much not as i see it jeremy hesitated i am strong enough to carry you would you like to ride me in my wolf form i mean she clapped her hands oh yes ill go very slowly so you wont fall off dont worry about that i wont fall off an elf never forgets wolfriding jeremy resumed his wolf shape he started to he down so jenny could climb on him but she didnt wait she leaped and was on his back holding on to the long fur of his collar he started to walk slowly but she showed no sign of unsteadiness so he moved faster and she had no trouble he was evidently reading her mind and knowing that she was all right pihrs anthony then he broke into a run dolph changed to invisible wolf form and followed they charged along the path and on to the beach where the wolf did his utmost running swiftly along between the water and the jungle jenny never wavered dolph could see her smiling after a while jeremy slowed then stopped and jenny slid off oh thank you so much she cried that was the most wonderful experience ive had in years jeremy resumed man form its nice being appreciated like that you really do know how to ride a wolf yes we are made for it thats why we are small so as not to be too much of a burden you were no burden jenny turned and hugged him around the neck and shoulders then she drew back abashed oh i forget you had changed form hugging wolves is natural but i know what you mean he changed back and she hugged him again then she drew back whats this about the curse i mean how do you know theres only one woman for you jeremy resumed man form its all part of the curse if i dont find her before she passes twenty one ill never find her at all so the three kings and breanna are helping me learn how to well never mind no its all right you were supposed to practice on me yes he said abashed well then you should do it your woman must be growing older all the time you need to get it straight as soon as possible you dont mind jeremy for a wolfride i would do anything practice on me all you want i want to help you oh thank you jenny this will help a lot he paused looking down at his feet again im sorry i was so clumsy i mean complimenting your hands when i hadnt even really seen them but i do think they are nice hands four fingers and all i felt those hands grip my fur as you rode with perfect balance i dont care how many fingers you have theyre great he took one of her hands and kissed it zombit lovfr oh jenny blushed sorry i got carried away i do clumsy things when oh stop it im not embarrassed im touched nobody ever did that to me before jeremy looked around i suppose we should get back to the glade before the kings return and miss us i suppose but he didnt change form and she didnt make any motion they walked along looking out over the sea dolph wondered whether he should join them but decided to remain hidden you said a name i didnt recognize jenny said after a bit a girl breanna she came with the three kings she was trying to teach me to be charming it wasnt working very well how did they get together with her shes not of castle roogna i didnt mean to snoop but i did pick up some things from her mind she was chased by a zombie and i think the kings helped her escape she helped them too they were on the isle of women and those women dont like to let royal men get away unmarried but they are married already those women dont like to take no for an answer they would have tried to make them renounce their existing wives and marry isle women anyway the three of them and breanna got away and came here my father made them try to help me before he would tell them where their home is well im glad i got to meet you i didnt know where they were but sammy found them jenny froze oh i lost sammy he must be with breanna wed better return now yes he changed she jumped on and they raced like the wind back the way they had come with dolph following they reached the grove as bink and dor were returning look at that dor exclaimed hes carrying her jeremy halted and jenny slid off they were similarly abashed i know we should have been practicing manners jenny said we just got carried away we didnt know you could ride bink said i cant except for wolves im a wolfrider when i met jer pihrs anthom emy im sorry i just got carried away literally well practice now jeremy assumed manform it was my fault when i learned her nature he skuffled his feet ive got to find sammy jenny said walking on into the grove jeremy followed and so did dolph sure enough there was breanna asleep with the cat snuggled up against her the girls eyes opened as they approached hello jenny she said jenny was surprised have we met breanna sat up not exactly justin knows you justin justin tree of the north village you have visited him his mind is with me now and he identifies folk for me oh i didnt mean to disturb you i had lost track of sammy cat so i thought he might be here breanna looked at sammy who was now stretching yes he joined me in a cat nap hes good company dolph realized that sammy had been looking for a nap so had found the cat nap well get out of your way jenny said no im okay that nap will hold me for a while i can sleep at night if i have to we need to get jeremy trained yes jenny agreed but now that i know his nature i relate to him as a wolf that distorts my awareness breanna smiled something always messes up i know how it is maybe its part of my curse jeremy said both girls laughed well just have to beat your curse breanna said now lets see how you impress jenny as a man what do you do jeremy turned to jenny you have nice ears then he did a doubletake oops theyre pointed jenny said you hadnt noticed he nodded as i said im just sort of clumsy in manform youre going to have to learn to notice things breanna said so you can make accurate compliments they continued to practice dolph bored wandered away he was in invisible wolf form so he changed to visible wolf form so that he could relate to the wolves of the isle zombif lovlr he spied a wolf racing in from the beach the wolf looked worried and disgusted whats the matter dolph growled in wolftalk as the other passed theres a zombie werewolf coming to the isle i must tell the king so we can repel it the other growled and raced on the werewolves didnt want a zombie werewolf it occurred to dolph that breanna might be interested in that after her experience with zombies he trotted back to the funk grove i think youre getting it breanna was telling jeremy but jennys right shes not right because she sees you as a wolf prince prince jenny asked startled oops i messed up breanna said again yes i am a werewolf prince jeremy said we didnt tell you because i was supposed to impress you as a man not as a prince instead i impressed you as a wolf jenny looked crestfallen i guess that means you wont be free to i mean a prince has better things to do than carry around stray elves he put his arm around her jenny i love carrying you ill be glad to do it any time i never before encountered anyone who could ride like that or anyone who valued my wolfishness rather than my princeness i want to be your wolffriend she shook her head princes have duties they have to learn to be kings they cant just run around with friends and explore xanth she looked at dor isnt that so that is so dor agreed and this is why we are trying to help jeremy he must abate his curse so he can be ready to be a king in due course but i dont care about being king jeremy said not if i have to marry the wrong woman id rather be a wolffriend and range all xanth that would be second best jenny said a tear in her eye we cant let it happen you must find your true love then breanna noticed dolph theres a strange wolf here dolph changed form no its just me i just learned that theres a zombie werewolf coming to the isle and the other werewolves dont like that the zombies have a right to exist too breanna said hotly so theyre a bit different from others sos everybody im black jennys piers anthony an elf youre a shape changerwere all different in our special ways they should let it come here i thought you might feel that way dolph said lets go talk to king wolverton breanna said i think ive done more than enough mischief here you folk can practice better without me thats not true dor said but breanna was already in motion i dont know how to ride but is there some other form you could take to carry me in a hurry to the king dolph became a winged man actually he was himself with wings another refinement he had learned he picked her up and flew into the nearest patch of sky she looked around oh this is as much fun as flying in that duck boat just dont drop me i wouldnt do that dolph said i was teasing she kissed him on the cheek he wavered and had to correct his course he knew he was blushing sorry breanna said i get into more trouble by being impulsive he spied wolverton mountain and glided down the wolves had already gathered and were in animated dialogue the werewolves paused as dor landed and set breanna on her feet one approached them this is a private matter he murmured no it isnt breanna retorted youre discriminating against a zombie werewolf and i wont have it hes a person too they stared at her you are defending a zombie king wolverton demanded yes somebodys got to all they want to do is get along and theyre not bad folk they can be useful too suppose a gruesome monster invaded the isle and it killed any of you who tried to stop it a zombie cant be killed a zombie could fight that monster or maybe disgust it so it went away thats why they have zombies to defend castle roogna you should welcome that zombie werewolf the werewolves passed a glance around sire she is making sense one said zombie lover the king looked at breanna cannily some folk are great for recommending things for other folk that they wouldnt do themselves oh yeah like what like associating with zombies dolph knew what was coming the werewolves didnt know about breannas recent history he kept his mouth shut so you think im a hypocrite breanna demanded that i wouldnt touch a zombie myself that is what i suspect the king agreed so if i touch that zombie youll let him stay here without trying to freeze him out there was another glance that depends on the magnitude of the touch the king said we will match your level of contact in a general way okay just watch me she turned to dolph he picked her up again and flew toward the beach while the others assumed wolf form and ran swiftly in the same direction they think youre bluffing dolph told her i know they do but im not doing this just to embarrass them im doing it because its right is justin tree guiding you in that no hes agreeing with me it took me a while to get straight about zombies but now i know what to do they reached the beach the duck boat was just arriving dolph landed set the girl down and stayed back as the wolves caught up to him breanna hurried out to intercept the zombie it seemed to be male in wolf form and rather farther gone than dolph personally liked would the girl be able to make herself touch him hello breanna said as the wolf got out of the boat welcome to the isle of wolves will you defend it against all enemies including gruesome monsters the wolf nodded and a bit of furry skin dropped to the ground dolph winced change form please breanna said the wolf became a similarly decaying man his eyes were sunken and his lips had rotted away so that his teeth were bare piers anthony i am breanna of the black wave im not a werewolf im just part of the welcoming committee who are you ztigma zhombie breanna paused and dolph knew she was consulting with justin tree stigma as in a mark of disgrace or disease yez fair enough she said stigma im going to give you a welcoming kiss hold out your arms the zombie did breanna stepped into that clumsy embrace wrapped her arms around the decaying torso and planted a solid kiss on the lipless mouth she held that pose for a more than sufficient moment then disengaged you will like it here she said now you can meet king wolverton she turned to face the werewolves she did it a werewolf said shuddering were stuck for it so we are the king said well a deals a deal he strode forward and shook the hand of the zombie welcome he said gruffly and walked away his hand stiff as if needing to be plunged into a vat of boiling soap dolph knew that after that no other werewolf would criticize the zombie he would get along breanna walked back to join him there was smear of ick on her mouth and a chunk of rot on her shoulder her green eyes were staring as if encrusted with sickly slime help me she whispered dolph picked her up and flew her to another section of the beach out of sight of the werewolves he led her to the water and then into it setting her slippers on the dry sand he scooped up a handful of sea and washed oft her tace and hands then he touched up aspects of her clothing though this made them damp i had to do it she said but it was awful you showed real courage he said that zombie was far gone she became more animated but i survived it and i got the job done the zombies cant help the way they are they dont deserve to be shunned true the zombie master who makes them is a nice man and his wife millie the ghost is nice too they are both human but getting old who will represent the zombies when those two move on i zombil lolr i mean apart irom king xeth doesnt there have to be some living interaction yes i think so i never thought about it i feel another impulse coming on is there time to visit there time before dark i doubt it lets go anyway now i want to meet the zombie master he may not be awake well then millie i want to knovv how they relate to the zom bies so she donned her slippers and dolph picked her up again slightly dripping and flew across the sea to the mainland and then on over land to castle zombie by the time they arrived it was dusk the castle was brooding in the shadows but it could manage that almost as readily in full sunshine they landed at the drawbridge halsh the zombie guard cried losing a tooth breanna stooped to pick up the tooth here she said returning it to the guard zombies were seldom startled but this one managed it thanksh he put the tooth back in his mouth we hae come to see the zombie master dolph said i am prince dolph and this is breanna of the black wave thish whay the guard led them across the moldencrusted bridge to the mildewy front gate breanna looked around its beautiful inside millie is a good housekeeper you sure cant tell by the outside she tilted her head thoughtfully which i guess is true of peopleand zombies soon they reached the interior office this time the zombie master was there along with millie why hello dolph i did not expect to see you back so soon he glanced at breanna but aurora has changed significantly this isnt aurora dolph said quickly this is breanna of the black wave aurora is uth erica another winged mermaid breanna is the one king xeth wanted to marry but she looks to be only fifteen millie protested yes so she was not suitable but xeth didnt understand now he has decided on another woman piers a thovt yes zyzzyva the zombie master said we have word that they are coming here soon but after her experience with zombies breanna wanted to learn more about them so we came here well i finally managed to locate planet zombie the zombie master said it is well along in the chain but most of its creatures and plants are zombies and its rocks are well eroded now millie and i will be able to retire there together with any zombies who wish to come i believe that the majority will but there remains one problem who is going to run castle zombie breanna said yes we are the only living folk here and there needs to be someone living because other living folk may have a certain problem relating to zombies so we will wait a few more years until we train in someone else for this then at last well be able to go and relax dolph found this interesting who will come here we dont know millie said jonathan asked the good magician humfrey and he said he would work on it but so far no prospects have appeared were looking for a man of experience and judgment or perhaps a couple she glanced at her husband we found that works well enough the good magician will surely come up with someone dolph said yes it is not an easy search the zombie master said the man must have maturity yet be young enough to remain for some time the woman must be sensible enough to accept the presence of zombies age and youth combined a light flashed over dolphs head grandfather bink he exclaimed bink and chameleon that must be why they got youthened the zombie masters jaw dropped i never thought of that yes they would be perfect but they would have to want to do it do they i dont know the subject never came up i dont think magician humfrey ever spoke to them curious the zombie master said maybe he is waiting for them to think of it themselves its not the kind of position that anyone should be urged into the desire should come from within zombif lovtr maybe dolph agreed dubiously yet bink was right here and didnt think of it some things take time millie said i did not understand zombies at first maybe chameleon does not could be dolph agreed he turned to breanna do you want to see the rest of the castle i am curious breanna said if its not too much trouble i will be happy to give you a tour millie said i dont see many living women here i guess you dont breanna agreed half ruefully she glanced at dolph you wont mind waiting go ahead he said ill tell jonathan about your experience with the werewolf thanks breanna looked as if she were suppressing a grimace the old woman and the young woman went off dolph turned to the zombie master who was looking at him with a question mark we encountered a zombie werewolf coming to the isle of wolves breanna used to be scared of zombies but once she worked it out with king xeth she defends them she got the werewolves to accept a zombie oh that would be stigma he had hoped to be with his own kind but often there can be prejudice how did she do it she kissed him on the mouth but he doesnt have any lips she kissed his teeth i guess it was a nervy thing to do after that they couldnt deny him they were shamed into it she must be more of a person than she looks i think so she can be feisty and blunt but she means well and she learns from experience after that she was curious about castle zombie so i brought her here for a visit dolph paused then remembered something else she n more than she looks justin tree is with her justin tree but isnt he firmly planted in the north village yes but he craved some human adventure so made a deal with breanna he shares her adventure in exchange for his good advice so she has the advantage of a truly mature perspective interesting things are happening i would never have thought of that the zombie master changed the subject have you learned piers anthony who is to be married at castle roogna we received an invitation and will attend but we wonder no word yet dolph said were trying to help the werewolf prince jeremy find his true love so that we can get back in time for that ceremony but it s not going well he is cursed not to know his true love until she comes to him but she doesnt know it either so wont come that is a bad curse the zombie master agreed i understand that the curse fiend woman who made it was really angry she wanted him to truly suffer and she succeeded the women returned its such a lovely castle breanna said millie showed me everything it was nice to have an appreciative audience millie said you must stay for tee and crumples it was now full night i think we had better get back to the isle of wolves before we are missed dolph said with regret we can wait a little longer breanna said so they stayed for the refreshment and it was good breanna asked for the recipe and millie gave it to her then at last they departed theyre really nice breanna said im glad we visited to fly at night i must assume another form dolph said it may not be as comfortable for you thats okay i needed to unwind afterafter stigma this worked just fine dolph became a large night hawk she made herself halfway com fortable in his talons and he launched into the night sky his vision in this form was excellent oh looktheres xeth and zyzzyva walking south breanna said he looked down and sure enough there they were he had forgotten that her talent was to see in darkness obviously it was a good one they reached the isle ol woues which did not seem to fade out the way the other isles did maybe they could relate to it because other members of their party were there it would have been real mischief otherwise dolph glided in lor a landing near the groe set breanna down and changed back to manform thanks prince dolph she said i needed that bieak zombif lover they walked into the grove and found the others sleeping prince jeremy was in wolf form and jenny elf was snuggled against his side and sammy cat was snuggled against her side bink and dor were nearby with their own beds of funk funk had turned out to be good material for doing nothing on rather than disturb the others they shaped their own beds and lay down the night was warm so they needed no covers in a moment dolph was asleep loves labors j enny woke to find the others sprawled across the glade on beds of funk the funk didnt smell bad anymore her nose had gotten used to it today they had to find jeremys perfect woman so he could be happy and focus on training for the werewolf kingship and so the three kings could return to castle roogna and rehearse for their roles in the big wedding the womenfolk who paid much more attention to such things than menfolk did were getting frantic her eye fell on breanna of the black wave the girl was impetuous and assertive jenny liked that she and dolph had disappeared in the evening so as not to interfere with the practice jenny wondered where they had gone she would ask when they woke meanwhile jenny and jeremy would go to the isle of women because there were many women there who were looking for princes and he hadnt been there before so that was the most likely place he would find his true love she and the others would try to coach him through the interviews with luck they would have success otherwise she didnt finish the thought they had to get him settled not just because they had business elsewhere because he was a nice wolf under an awful curse jenny was especially sensitive to the problems of wolves say maybe sammy could find her jenny said aloud seeing her cat sammy where is jeremys true love zombifc lovfr but sammy simply rolled over asking to be stroked jenny did so sighing sometimes he was like that he could find anything except home but he had to want to evidently he didnt care about this case he was no longer a young cat and had less energy than in times past then she thought of something else so obvious she marveled that it hadnt come up before the good magician jeremy could go to him to ask about his true love it would cost him a year of service but it would be worth it because it would get him the rest of his life happy the wolf opened his near eye oh did i wake you jenny asked feeling guilty he changed part way just his head your thoughts did the good magician do you really think he could do it despite the curse yes he can find the answer to anything i dont think any curse could stop him so i think that if you dont find your true love today you should go to him jeremy nodded j shall do so you folk have given me hope and now you have given me the way too i thank you for both youre welcome but maybe youll be able to save that year by finding her today i understand there are many beautiful women on the isle of women then she thought of something but if they have all found dream princes now maybe they wont be interested including your true love if shes there i think a woman should prefer a real prince to a dream prince if she has a choice jeremy said if she doesnt then shes not the one for me jenny smiled maybe she would prefer to take both one for her waking hours the other for her sleeping hours would that bother you jeremy pondered i dont like to seem jealous but yes it would i think that my dream woman should love me completely as i would love her and not be interested in anyone else awake or asleep jenny nodded that makes sense to me you dont want the wrong woman the right woman wouldnt want the wrong man either so if shes there shell welcome you i hope she is and does the werewolf prince smiled thank you but there is also one big problem they dont let any prince off their isle unless he marries one of them thats why i never went there before i knew that if my piers anthon ideal woman were not there they would force me to marry a nonideal woman but they cant make you marry one you dont want to oh they can they can they have ways i dont see how mean breanna sat up they do have ways jen the three kings would never have escaped before if bink hadnt figured out a better alternative for them he sent them to look for princes on idas moons oh those there would certainly be princes there there are but to visit them you have to be asleep so if one of the isle of women women is right for jeremy shell probably be satisfied to be with him instead of with one of the other princes i should hope so breanna looked suddenly stricken i just thoughtsuppose his ideal woman is on those dream worlds for an instant jenny felt panic then it passed it doesnt matter doesnt matter because every person who ever lived in xanth or ever will live or ever might live there is in those worlds that includes the ones who are in xanth now so of course his ideal woman is there but she must also be here in xanth because why would the curse fiend woman bother to curse him if it were meaningless she knew that there is a perfect love for him here in xanth so she cursed him to stop him from getting her breanna pondered then nodded that works for me so she is accessible if we can only find her in time and i agree the good magician should know he solved my problemnot in the way i expected but just as good reallyand he can solve jeremys problem so lets give it one whale of a try today and if that doesnt work take him to the good magician that will take care of him and the rest of you will still be able to gel back home in time for your big event jeremy changed all the way and stood up his clothing came automatically with his human form fortunately such things varied some shape changers like the naga folk had to don their clothing each time they changed it sounds good but what way do you have to get me off that isle unmarried if we dont find her there breanna glanced at bink who was just waking up im sure there will be some way zombie lover jenny wasnt satisfied its risky we need to be sure before going there otherwise he might be forced to marry the wrong woman and right after that the right one could turn up that would really crown the curse shes right jeremy said i think i would be better off not to risk it can go directly to the good magician it is better to pay a year than to risk a lifetime breanna shrugged sometimes things you never thought of turn up to change things like the lip bomb like the what jenny asked oh you dont know about that ill show you breanna delved into her clothing and found a packet she opened it and dipped her finger into its red paste she spread that on her lips i wonder if this works on samegender kisses she said musingly on what lets find out breanna approached jenny and without further warning kissed her on the mouth jenny was so astonished that she almost fainted her mouth erupted into a shower of candy kisses she seemed to be floating on a warm sea of rose petals what was that she asked as she wafted to the pleasant shore i detonated some lip bomb on you breanna explained it has quite an effect doesnt it jenny wiped off her mouth as her heartbeat settled back toward normal yes dont kiss me again the girl laughed for sure not im saving this for a boy when eventually i wonder whether that would help me find my woman jeremy said no breanna replied because its artificial you dont want to trick a woman or force her you want her to come to you naturally lip bomb is more like effect without substance jenny had to agree suddenly the duckfooted boat waddled into the glade all aboard it said nows the time but jenny started to protest it will be all right bink said climbing in they let us go before but you made a deal jeremy isnt part of that piers anthony sure he is dolph said hes with us now but the risk jenny looked at breanna youre a woman you must have some sense if that island is a man trap its okay breanna said helping jenny into the boat but jeremy shrugged they want to do it he said climbing in so lets do it frustrated jenny gave up and got into the boat she hoped that the others knew something she didnt but she didnt trust their weird confidence there was more than a whiff of a hint of disaster in the air the boat moved out of the glade through the trees and onto the beach it plunged into the water and moved swiftly for the neighboring island who arranged this jenny asked i did dor said last night after we decided to try the isle of women but we hadnt considered the risk then i think it will be all right jenny shut up sometimes the logic of men escaped her but why did breanna also agree to this risk she at least should have more sense soon they came to the isle the boat ran up on the land making its way to the duck pond in the center there was a crowd of beautiful women chief among them was one in indecent bra and panties naturally all four men went immobile as their eyeballs locked into place they would be no help so you return the woman said hello voracia breanna said you know the three kings and me the others are jenny elf and prince jeremy werewolf we need to discover whether his ideal woman is here presuming that you women remain interested yes we all have dream prince boyfriends now but we want something for our waking hours too we dont want to dream our lives away we figured as much but first youll have to turn off your clothing oh the womans apparel became a halter and shorts these zombif lovfr remained somewhat too suggestive for jennys taste but at least the men were able to draw their eyeballs away with only slight sucking sounds lets just stay in the boat breanna said while you parade your women by we hope that one of them will be the one the boat agreeing relaxed it sank slightly in the water its feet moving just enough to keep it stable jenny knew because she peeked over the edge but thats not the way we operate voracia said we each must get our turn to fascinate him you can do that right here voracia shrugged very well i am first how do you like me jeremy the werewolf eyed her thoroughly jenny could appreciate why voracia had the kind of face and figure jenny knew better than even to dream of you look very interesting but my concern is not how you look but whether you are my true love i will know only if you approach me speaking love t can do that she said she walked toward him her hair flowing her halter jiggling her shorts tightening and moving most suggestively jenny was privately jealous being forcibly reminded that her own body would never fill out clothing like that or move like that so she would never be able to fascinate a man in that manner i love you prince jeremy werewolf and want to marry you voracia said dulcetly as her clothing turned translucent jenny was jealous again she could never lie like that either oh the woman surely wanted to marry him but how could she love him in just these few minutes she just wanted to be a princess or queen jeremy shook his head you are not the one jenny was privately gratified though she knew she shouldnt be it was just that she thought that things like bulging halters and semiseethrough shorts should not decide a lifetime relationship what about character compatibility harmony of lifestyle would voracia even want to associate with him when he was in his wolf form yet the other women of the isle might be no better but how can you be sure voracia said her halter shrinking so that her bosom had to struggle to stay partly inside come out of that canoe and join me and i will show you such a good time piers anthony i dont want a good time i want my one true love her expression became less pretty her upper garment assumed the likeness of brands and brass knuckles which jenny realized made sense for a bra then go soak your stupid head she flared turning away her shorts condensed into a gstring so that her flexing bottom looked bare jeremys eyeballs began to steam breanna reached out to put her hand before his eyes that broke his connection before the orbs were cooked thank you he gasped others will try something similar breanna murmured to jenny be alert and rescue him quickly im going to take a nap its my sleeping time the other women tried to impress jeremy flashing their charms and speaking lines of love but one by one he turned them down some were gracious some not some cried jenny saw how guilty that made the werewolf feel but he would not accept any wrong woman it was clear that he was both decent and a person of conscience and this was not the delight it might have been for another man jenny saw that the three kings bored were joining breannas snooze apparently the sheer amount of curvature being exposed had worn down their freakout circuits and of course they had seen it before when they were the ones being tempted i am polly tician the current woman was saying i love you prince werewolf and will make you happy for the rest of your years with two carts in your garage i believe you jeremy said surprised wait jenny said alarmed find out her talent whats your talent he asked polly i make others believe what i promise but then i dont do it youre not the one he said then privately to jenny thank you she was persuading me but you were right her promises are meaningless however persuasive the next was a creature so ethereally lovely that it had to be artificial perhaps she was a demoness jenny was becoming increasingly cynical and disgusted by this process of matehunting i am miss succubus she said i lost my body in the void but managed to save my spirit now i can suck up whatever is near if zombie lover you would like a soft girl i can suck up feathers and cloudstuff if you prefer a hard woman can suck up rocks if you have a dirty mind she glanced at the ground and the dirt around her sucked up into her form turning her brown unfortunately i can retain substance for less time each time so i will eventually blink out of existence unless i find true love are you the one to give it to me jenny was surprised and she saw that jeremy was too this was a different girl and a different approach i dont know the werewolf said will you speak the words no jenny and jeremy were startled no he asked not unless its true as yet i hardly know you so i cant love you she could be the one jenny murmured shes honest but my curse requires the woman to come to me jeremy said i can recognize her only if she approaches me with love a muddy tear formed at miss succubuss eye i can say that i wish it to be so and that i hope to be the one but i cant say jeremy stood and stepped out of the boat he took the woman in his arms can you say that you feel it at least a little he kissed her oh yes she replied after a moment a little feeling and a lot of longing jeremy looked sad but now i know you are not the one im sorry im sorry too she said her whole face turning muddy she turned and walked away i hate this the prince swore i hate what i did to her but it was the only way to know jenny wiped away a tear of her own the only way she agreed he returned to the boat and resumed his seat the next woman was distinctly unimpressive her features were plain her hair was straggly and her dress was nothing much i am the iron maiden she said she lifted her right hand which carried an iron i can iron anything im a good dull housewife its a useful skill jeremy said courteously my other form is different she said suddenly she was made of iron vith metallic features and a short sword where the iron had been before if you need some fighting to be done this was a surprise but jenny saw that this was in some respects an ideal woman with both domestic and combat skills say the words jeremy said i love you and want to you are not the one im sorry i suspected that the iron maiden said sadly i hope you find the right one she departed some of these are nice girls he muttered i would have been satisfied with either of the last two they are people as well as women jenny agreed she was increasingly impressed with the werewolf princes humanity he was truly searching and did not like hurting others but if none of the women here was the one how would he escape the isle a woman came running from left field danger danger she cried voracia stepped up to intercept her are you trying to break into the line krissica wait your turn no theres something horrible happening krissica exclaimed her feet moving as if she couldnt stop running things are trying totoits awful wait your turn voracia repeated her bra and panties forming into metallic armor but this is serious krissica said voracia put her hands on krissica s shoulders making her stand still what is happening theyretheyre fighting the woman gasped and summoning storks you mean men are invading the isle voracia demanded no women are fighting women and girl youre not making any sense we dont fight among ourselves and we certainly dont summon storks by ourselves this sounds like real trouble jenny murmured to jeremy and voracia s being balky instead of checking into it maybe we should check but we have no authority here somebody needs to do something just in case it really is serious fighting and stork summoning that cant be ignored zombie lover jeremy nodded then he stood and stepped out of the boat striding forward this bears investigation he said krissica show the way the woman turned and ran back the way she had come jeremy and jenny followed the three kings and breanna remained asleep in the boat who gave you authority to decide anything voracia demanded running after them he spared her a cursory glance do you have any other active princes on the isle no but do you have any princesses no but then i rank you i am trained to act when action is necessary and it may be necessary now if it is a false alarm we will return to the boat and resume interviewing voracia opened her mouth but nothing came out jenny was too busy running to look smug the prince had shut her up because he was indeed a prince a leader of people he glanced at jenny we had better hurry get on he changed to wolf form and veered close to her jenny leaped grabbing fur she drew herself up onto his back as he charged forward passing krissica well check on it jenny called back to her they ran to the beach and stopped jeremy changed back to manform as jenny dismounted there was something peculiar happening plants were writhing two by two at the edge of the water seaweeds were wrestling crabs were entangled with each other trying to pinch off each others heads while at the same time putting their bodies together insects were trying to sting each other while trying to do something else two women were fighting while stripping off their own clothes two birds flew in from nearby trees suddenly they tried to join together while savagely pecking each other what can this be jeremy asked it looks like hateand love jenny said as if they drank from a hate spring and love spring as if they are trying to kill each other while signaling the stork but of course thats nonsense jeremy turned to krissica who was just catching up are there any love or hate springs on the isle pihrs anthony no she gasped but it sure looks as if are there any on nearby isles yes on selfish steam isle it has springs of every kind folk go there to feel better or vorse about themselves jerem gazed across the sea there was a neighboring island with a cone in its center belching smoke and vapor think those springs hae been heated to vapor we are suffering an invisible cloud of loe and hate elixir so anything caught in it has a lovehate relationship with its closest neighbor yes krissica agreed that must be it we must take immediate action because we dont know which way that cloud is moving it could settle on the center of the isle and ruin it krissica go fetch as many women as you can with bags they must scoop up colored dust and bring it here yes she agreed and ran off voracia arrived jeremy hardly glanced at her voraciago gather all winged creatures on the isle bring them here as fast as possible winged creatures time is of the essence do it she turned and ran off and we must enlist the help of the kings he said he glanced at jenny get on he changed and jenny leaped on he ran swiftly back toward the center of the isle this was a side of him she hadnt seen before but she realized that it had always been there he was a prince and surely had had some princely training before getting cursed he was a natural commander who knew how to take charge in an emergency this was certainly that they reached the boat where the others were waking jeremy changed to man form as jenny slid off his back cloud of love and hate elixir he said ive got one crew gathering colored dust and anothei assembling winged creatures will you help ill join the winged monsters prince dolph said ill get the inanimate cloud to identify itself king dor said i had better go with you bink said for sure breanna agreed for some reason dolph became a roc bird and the two other kings grabbed onto his zombif lovfr feet as he spread his wings and took off the werewolf bounded back toward the shore jenny and breanna were left behind what can we do breanna asked maybe direct traffic jenny said we can use the boat they got in the boat do you know where the colored sands are jenny asked the boat was silent and she realized that it couldnt talk when dor wasnt present but she hoped it could hear take us there the boat splashed out of the pond and ran through the forest it did seem to know where it was going they passed a woman on her way somewhere hey molly coddle breanna called were on a mission to save the children from something dreadful we can use your help the woman quickly joined them in the boat and they hastily explained about the deadly invisible cloud they reached the colored sands section a number of women were filling bags of it but they were heavy pile them in here jenny called and come along we have to hurry before that cloud moves the women did so filling the boat it ran on slewing somewhat as it navigated curves and came to the beach ho ho a voice said seeming from the air im going to put you into a killing mating frenzy screech to a halt jenny yelled at the boat thats the edge of the cloud talking thanks to king dors presence dont cross into it a figure bounded through the woods toward them it was jeremy in wolf form he changed in mid stride to manform give the bags to prince dolph he said better yet stay in the boat hell pick you up then the roc appeared the huge feet reached down took hold of the boat and lifted it into the air as the wings kept the bird hovering the downdraft was fierce blowing the womens hair across their faces but they seemed too distracted to notice its all right jenny said reassuringly prince dolph wont let us drop they rose up high over the isle then the roc squawked same to you birdbram the invisible cloud responded piers anthony guided by that sound the roc flew directly over it then circled in place dump the dust jenny cried realizing what it was for they opened their bags and emptied them over the sides the dust wafted down onto the cloud below and the vapor became visible it had a certain cohesion so that the dust tended to stick to its edges outlining it as a huge blob now we can see it jenny said now we can blow it away the roc flew down beyond the edge of the cloud and set down the boat then it flew to join the winged monsters of the isle all of them were rather pretty women the term monster referred to a type rather than being derogatory they watched as the creatures anchored themselves to the ground and began flapping their wings strongly they made a draft that pushed against the cloud hey watch what youre doing the cloud protested we are jenny called back with satisfaction were blowing you away and slowly with continued effort they did just that they blew the cloud away from the beach and the isle until it drifted offshore finally it got caught in a natural wind and was swept away the dire threat was over the women went limp with relief some went to the aid of the ones who had been caught in the awful vapors and who were no longer trying to do anything deadly or obscene to each other jenny breanna jeremy and the three kings returned to the boat and the boat waddled back toward the center pond that was good thinking on your part king dor told the werewolf jenny nudged me jeremy said she made me realize that the situation could be serious and that i was the best person to take immediate action they looked at jenny suddenly she was blushing i justkrissica was so upsetjeremy knew what to do once nudged dolph agreed actually it was all such a coincidence jeremy said that such an unlikely threat should occur right when there were folk visiting the isle who could handle it say thats right dolph said a real stroke of luck things could have been much worse dor glanced at bink bink looked elsewhere zombie lover breanna perked up justin says no it was bound to happen sometime with that selfish steam isle next door if the women hadnt been distracted by trying to impress jeremy they probably would have handled it well enough themselves i guess so dolph agreed not seeming much concerned they reached the pond and the boat settled down again the parade of hopeful women resumed jenny prompted jeremy to say nice things about each one and he was getting better at such social graces that made the process go more smoothly though none of the women were right for him in fact he also complimented jenny on her help but jenny was increasingly uneasy finally she could handle it no more breanna can you take over here she whispered i have to go but youre doing a great job breanna protested hes much better since you took over please okay but come back soon jenny got out of the boat and walked away she blinked trying to conceal her tears she didnt want to make a scene she walked into the forest sick at heart what was she going to do then someone followed her it was bink so old yet looking so young jenny what is the matter nothing really she said bravely it doesnt matter you have been so helpful and done so well you have really helped jeremy learn to impress women thats the problem the problem she tried to stifle it but it burst out anyway hes impressing me too well of course hes a werewolf prince the two of you get along wonderfully as a man there it was out bink was silent for a moment piecing it together so you are coming to like him yourself and its hard for you to help him impress other women yes i know i have no right to be jealous and i do want to help him but i know ill start messing it up because my heart isnt in it pilrs anthony anymore so its better if just stay away so as to give him the best chance breanna is pretty sharp she can do it well enough jenny she isnt as good at this as you are shes too young how old are you twenty one in a few days what has that got to do with it the day of the big wedding yes not that it matters its a coincidence a coincidence he repeated thoughtfully then he returned to the subject jenny you have to go back you relate to him better because youre a wolfrider he was pretty much hopeless until you came and then he started improving there is a continuing frisson between you you cant desert him now but i cant do it anymore then you must tell him why i cant do that it would just make him feel guilty and that would mess him up too my best course is to quietly get out of his way no he needs you you must help him or tell him plainly why not you tell him then hell know and i wont make an embarrassing scene he shook his head there was a strange glow in his eyes i think this is something you have to do yourself jenny started to protest again wiping the tears from her face then another person came along the path bink looked over her shoulder oh hello jeremy he said as if this were only to be expected jenny tried to run but bink caught her gently but firmly and turned her around to face the werewolf prince tell him others were approaching this was becoming public she burst into worse tears jenny jeremy said solicitously whats the matter i cant do it she blubbered jenny i need your help when you left started getting clumsy as i usually am in manibrm you understand me and keep me looking good breanna says you have the touch and you do i need you i cant why not there was no way out because i love you myself she was horrified when she heard herself speak she hadnt meant to blurt it out like that he stared at her oh she had done it she had made the worst possible scene how would this stupid little elf girl ever live this down youre the one he breathed everyone was staring im so sorry to have messed you up she said through her tears i never wanted to do that but you are just so nice and so competent and youre a wolf i just got swept away im sorry im sorry she turned and stumbled blindly out of the circle of people where could she hide youre the one he repeated jenny wait dont you understand something wasnt making sense she paused what youre my ideal love i know you now that you have declared you are the one i will marry now it registered but she realized what he was doing that cant be im not even of this world you deserve so much better dont do this just because you feel sorry for me dont ruin your life she stumbled on he strode after her and caught her he turned her around you didnt know you didnt suspect you dont believe it you arc a foreign woman you would never have come to me thats part of the curse but its broken now jenny i love you her tears renewed dont ruin your life she repeated brokenly its not worth it for anyone i didnt recognize you though in retrospect its obvious a wolfrider one who loves both my forms that curse blinded me but no more she just sagged in his grasp and wept not assimilating his explanation let me go he didnt answer in words he drew her in close and brought his face to hers he kissed her the music of a thousand choruses sounded in her head the explosion of a thousand lip bombs spread out from her mouth the love of a thousand worlds suffused her body all doubt was obliterated she sank into blissful oblivion when she revived she was lying in the boat people were talking i think we know now for whom that big wedding is bink was saying everybody loves jenny piers anthony and why jenny had to write all those invitations dolph agreed thats the brides job the good magician knew dor said she had to come to the isle of wolves but the curse prevented her from knowing why what a coincidence that it all worked out voracia said prince jeremy did find his true love here so our requirement has after all been fulfilled i dont think it was coincidence breanna said it was fated i agree jeremy said she and got along so well together from the start i think i was falling in love with her before knew but she had to come to me because of the curse curses are difficult to navigate bink agreed they protect themselves so they cant be nullified jenny opened her eyes immediately jeremy was there leaning over her now do you believe he asked now i believe she agreed faintly we will be married at castle roogna on your birthday then i will proceed with my training to be king but you will always be with me i hope you wont mind being a princess or a queen between rides just so long as it is with you he kissed her again that put her out for the duration of their return trip notable nuptials j ustin found it interesting he had never before been to castle roogna because at the time he had been transformed to a tree it had been lost in the jungle for several hundred years not until magician trent returned to xanth and revivified it had the castle become the center of xanth society now it was impressive with a wellkept moat complete with moat monster souffle serpent of courseand two classy gargoyles spouting water at the front gate he saw everything because breanna was looking all around her eyes wide she had never been here before either princess electra come to the gate to meet them and to hug prince dolph justin had seen her only occasionally as she was usually busy taking care of the twins dawn and eve who were seven years old she didnt travel much unless they did but they did sometimes visit his tree she was in blue jeans and didnt look much like a princess but there was no doubt dolph loved her queen irene welcomed king dor back and an appealing if not lovely young chameleon embraced bink princess ida appeared justin recognized her because of her similarity to princess ivy and the little moon that circled her head and advised breanna there is much to do and we are short of time ida said so i will supervise the rehearsal i think we shall need your help breanna you know me breanna asked startled we had news of your coming and of your help to the three kings i piers anthony oh and of course it did not need to be said that breanna was the only black wave female in the group i will show you to your room ida continued but i cant stay here breanna protested ida angled her head why not im not royal im not even invited to the wedding im nobody oh i think you are somebody jenny will make out an invitation for you this way ida led the way into the castle the hall was huge and the stairs were ornate breanna stared around in awe and justin was impressed they had really fixed up the old castle here it is princess ida said go on in then she looked right through breannas eyes to justin you too justin we are glad to have you with us she saw him for a moment he was disoriented and by the time he recovered ida was gone he had been impolite by default they found themselves in a comfortable upstairs chamber there was jenny here is your invitation she said handing an envelope to breanna breanna looked around justin saw sammy cat sleeping on the bed this is jennys room he said this is your room breanna said i cant stay here jenny looked at her we slept in a funk grove on the isle of wolves is this so much worse no its that youre the bride i cant please jenny said everything has changed so much for me that i feel dizzy i cant properly concentrate you were such a great help with all those women wont you help me through one more crisis crisis this is to be the biggest hugest wedding in years i never thought id be in it i never knew i had so many friends im afraid ill faint do it justin said everyone else is busy and she needs a female friend breanna caught on of course ill help thank you jenny sat on the bed looking suddenly tired you need a rest breanna said you get it while find out whats going on lovhk thank you jenny repeated she lay down beside sammy and closed her eyes that reminded breanna how jenny had asked sammy to find jeremys true love but the cat had simply asked jenny to stroke him none of them had caught on that sammy had indicated jenny herself the curse had not allowed itself to be bypassed by the cats magic breanna stepped out the door shutting it carefully behind her this way princess ida said breanna jumped and justin agreed with her this was eerie there is a banquet coming up but i think jenny is too tired to attend and perhaps you are too so it is better to have a meal in the room and to rest uh for sure breanna agreed but i promised to find out whats going on here is an itinerary princess ida said handing her a paper breanna held it up and justin glanced at it it listed all the upcoming events with their times and the people expected to attend the first event for jenny was wedding rehearsal on the following day that will do justin said jenny said she didnt know she had so many friends breanna told princess ida shes a nice person and deserves them but there is more to it her first friend in xanth was che centaur whom all the winged monsters have sworn to protect her second was gwendolyn goblin now the chiefess of goblin mountain and a powerful ally another friend is sim the simurghs chick who will some century inherit the universe whom che is tutoring so jenny is extremely well connected breanna whistled she never said she wouldnt she doesnt see it that way but she cant escape the royal wedding i guess i can help her get through it ida smiled im sure you can the castle kitchen had a hot meal packed and waiting they also had a pitcher of rinsed cream that the girls could use to untangle their messy hair a cream rinse would be good for tangles and a sweetsmelling deoder ant breanna carried it all back up to the room and set it down beside the bed where jenny snooed a curl of scented pihrs anthon steam wafted out and tickled the girls nose waking her oh food she said im famished she sat up there turned out to be enough tor two so they shared they discussed the schedule then they took turns cleaning up and settling back down jenny went to take a bath but retreated from the tub blushing breanna looked and discovered the problem there was a shameless plug in the bottom a mischievous princess must have put it there some dawn or eve she covered it over and then they were able to bathe without shame there was another bed for breanna and suddenly she discovered how tired she was too but justin remained awake for a while thinking about the interesting turn events had taken jenny had come to find the lost kings and turned out to be the one to solve the werewolf princes problem but with that wedding breannas adventure would be over and it would be time for him to return to his tree the prospect appealed less each time he considered it yet obviously he couldnt continue to impinge on the girls life indefinitely why was he so loath to end what he had always known would be a temporary association he explored that and realized that something surprising and rather embarrassing was happening he was coming to like breanna too well she was young and impulsive while he was old and staid and they had little in common but she had increasingly good instincts and was fun to be with his life would be dull without her company he would no longer be satisfied to be just another part of a forest watching the sun cruise by each day and the moon many nights yet even that was not the whole of it she would not stay young much longer while he would just get older he wished what did he wish nothing that was remotely possible even if he had his human body back what point could there ever be his peer group was about four generations removed from hers if he were close to her age then perhaps there might be a point in speculation but he wasnt so it was best not to bother her with his sad idle fancies he would enjoy her company until the time came to separate and then return gracefully to his tree and his fond memories she would surely have a good life on her own with that settled in his mind he relaxed and slept though without the innocent ease of breannas slumber zombif lovi k next morning there was a knock on the door and breanna opened it there was chameleon looking barely older than breanna and another day prettier i brought breakfast she said and there is something we must discuss come in breanna said this time there was food enough for three so they all ate jenny looked improved though still a bit vague the zombies wish to attend the wedding chameleon said jenny rolled her eyes oh no now wait a minute breanna said speaking before justin could stop her justin found that quality increasingly endearing whats wrong with zombies attending they would drive the other guests away jenny said nobody likes zombies i like zombies breanna retorted theyre people too they guard castle roogna why shouldnt they join its celebrations jenny looked surprised while chameleon looked speculative perhaps they should chameleon said i cant stand them myself but i remember how hard they fought to save the castle when the nextwave came and the zombie master and millie are certainly good folk millie used to babysit our son dor and king xeth and zyzzyva will be getting married too breanna said maybe they want to see how its done maybe they could have a separate section jenny said the word segregation came to breannas mind subvocalized so that he could hear it but this time justin managed to get there first it takes time to get over prejudices he reminded her jenny is offering a reasonable compromise remember it is her wedding breanna stifled her ire she knew he was right others could not impose their preferences over those of the bride she forced a smile maybe that will do i could go talk to king xeth and explain that would be nice jenny said now we must do the rehearsal chameleon said the key people will be there but informally garbed you mean we can wear blue jeans like electra jenny asked chameleon smiled in a way that made her show her age briefly yes they went to the rehearsal it was in the ballroom which seemed piers anthony far too large the three kings were there with their queens and jeremy werewolf jenny ran to hug him while the others took seats now the groom will enter from the side princes ida said gesturing jeremy and jenny separated and he stepped to the side entrance while the bride will be escorted down the aisle by the father go to your places now king dor got up and walked to the back jenny joined him a puff of smoke appeared up front and formed into a horrendous demon thats demon grossclout justin said he officiates at only the most prominent occasions there will be music ida said but not at the rehearsal pretend you hear it but then jenny bent over and ran out the back what happened dor asked dismayed breanna rushed out to find jenny she found her in the ladys room looking ill do you need healing elixir she asked concerned its nerves jenny confessed abashed i never expected to be married like this and suddenly it seems overwhelming i cant do it of course you can do it breanna said if can kiss a zombie you can marry a werewolf jenny looked at her and suddenly it was breanna who was abashed i didnt mean it the way that sounded i understand i guess but i just cant go out there i was never important enough to rate all this attention when i saw that stage up front stage fright justin said well have to get that stage removed but how do we get jenny through the rehearsal now you do it jenny said i think i can handle it if i just watch this time but i cant do it justin told her sternly it is only the rehearsal we will get rid of the stage before the wedding where do you get off telling me to do something like that breanna flared i am just trying to facilitate well dont this business is complicated enough without your interference zombit lover he was hurt interference thats unfair oh so now im being unfair well if you think so why dont you just go back to your tree breanna realize that you are under stress perhaps i spoke intemperately but you are being unreasonable well i havent had a century to learn reason so go get out leave me alone she had never before attacked him like this his spirit was smarting if this is what you wish i shall of course depart yes go sick at heart he gathered himself for the jump back to his tree he had known it had to end but hated to have it end this way on such a sour note he discovered that he couldnt just fade from her his spirit had permeated most of her body and had to be drawn together into a compact mass before departing but he accomplished this and in a moment was ready to go fare well breanna he said trying to shield her from his grief of the occasion probably it was for the best because his growing feeling for her was not licit and needed to be abated justinwait he paused yes iim sorry dont go but i understood that justin im a child i threw a tantrum but when i felt you withdrawingi realizedplease i didnt mean it i apologize i jumped at nothing i dont want you to go unless you really cant stand me anymore i need you im sorry i he felt enormous relief of course i will remain if that is your wish i was bitchy iive been tired of my parents always telling me what to do and i guess you sounded like that i struck out at you but you are right as always not always i please can you forgive me breanna there is no need yes there is he was wary of another outburst so yielded i forgive you thanks her face was wet with tears piers anthony are you all right jenny asked i didnt mean to make an impossible demand im sorry she thinks you were reacting to her request justin said she needs reassurance if you dont mind my recommendation no i want it i always want it so i wont be childish there is no shame in being your age still i think jenny does need this support so breanna changed her position ill be glad to ii just had to think it through you come and watch yes jenny said faintly looking less anemic they returned to the ballroom where king dor waited perhaps having been advised of the likely nature of the problem i will sub for jenny in the rehearsal breanna told the king if its okay with you dor surprised glanced at jenny who nodded that is good he agreed no it isnt the floor said she should be in a skin too bad for you breanna said stamping hard enough to shut it up this is a jeans session i wonder why a floor even cares what is under a womans skirt justin said the boards get bored she replied so they try to stir things up if women didnt react the floor wouldnt bother that is a remarkably mature perspective justin said admiringly i have learned a lot recently and i hope matured some she said especially in the last few minutes hope then princess ida signaled and they started the march down the aisle dor held out his elbow and breanna took it and they got in step and walked slowly forward i feel as if im getting married myself breanna confided to justin its a thrill even though i know im too young and will never have a royal wedding anyway any wedding is a royal occasion he assured her he was so glad to have her back to normal when you find your beloved whoever he may be you wont care much about anything except being together how do you know have you been married never but i have known many others who married such as bink and chameleon zombie lover bink she said aloud remembering hes the one to take over castle zombie king dor shook his head dolph mentioned that possibility to him but chameleon absolutely vetoed it but isnt that why they were youthened it cant be because the position has to be voluntary someone who likes zombies or at least respects them he glanced ahead now pay attention to the rehearsal you dont want to mess it up for jenny for sure she agreed and oriented on the wedding march unfortunately that freed justin for more thought during his many decades as a tree he hadnt thought much about this aspect of life now he couldnt help it breanna said that she felt as if she were getting married justin picked up that feeling only for him the feeling was not general or nebulous it was specific he wished that he were standing by that stage watching breanna approach there was no fool like an old fool he chided himself he had allowed his interest in the girls activities to shade into interest in her he had let himself be carried away by the sudden surprise of jenny elfs revelation as jeremy werewolfs perfect love and now fancied himself in a similar role his fancy didnt care that he had nothing in common with breannathat he was too old she too young he a tree she a girl with her future awaiting her his common sense recognized the vision for nonsense yet his fancy still longed for it even if she had any such interest which of course she wouldnt the dread adult conspiracy forbade any such relationship the answer was clear he should keep silent about this ridiculous image and return to his tree when the wedding ceremony was done he would spare her any knowledge of his insanity that would save both of them considerable embarrassment and of course in time the notion would fade with no harm done it might have been better if he had departed when they had their difference but he couldnt make himself go as long as she wished him to remain but he knew that in due course he would have to go and that he would grieve for that sweet foolishness he had indeed been too long away from human life and activity he had not allowed for the resurgent emotions of the human state breanna reached the front of the hall jeremy looked at her with a vulpine smile of mischief why jenny how you have changed piers anthony i got really sick and degenerated to this blackface she agreed shall i kiss you and make you well dont risk it it might make you ill instead and someone in the back row would faint he laughed really no more likely i would just turn into a frog i think that if i had not found the one you would have been a worthy substitute breanna not at my age you handsome wolf he laughed again in three years when you burst on the adult scene all eligible men had better take cover you are one cute creature in nature as well as appearance breanna tried to blush unsuccessfully he had finally gotten to her then i guess had better line up a prospect before then so as not to scare the whole land of xanth out of its magic justin shook his nonexistent head what a girl they got through the rehearsal and breanna returned to brief jenny on the details beware of jeremys sense of humor she warned he threatened to kiss me he doesnt even need lip bomb jenny said dreamily if you get woozy during the real ceremony hang on tight to king dors elbow hes very steady hes the father of the bride jenny agreed hes been through it before they retired to jennys room im sorry i got sick and put you on the spot jenny said oh it was fun breanna reassured her it made me want to get married myself oh do you have a man in mind theres one would like think but i dont think hes interested justin felt another shock breanna had a man in mind you didnt take jeremy seriously he said to her appalled no of course not she replied silently its someone else whos not married justin was only partly relieved he had had no idea that breanna had noticed a man in the course of her travels was it someone who might return her interest if so she was too young if not then she zomrif lovfr would be disappointed so either way the matter was unsettling may i inquire who breanna hesitated if you havent picked up on it then i think you wouldnt understand of course he was gracious but her implied reproof stung always before she had shared her concerns with him now she wasnt doing so he remained intensely curious what man she was thinking of but refused to pry she was an attractive girlhow well he knewand surely could make an impression on the man she chose it was certainly her right to do so within limits so he wished her well though the thought of her finding love and fulfillment elsewhere gave him an unreasonable pang he would almost have preferred to return to his tree at the time of their argument because then at least he might have retained some fond foolish illusions next day the important guests began arriving and breanna was busy showing them to their rooms almost everyone else was busy with something and justin knew most of the guests so this made sense castle roogna was big and seemed to get bigger to fill the need that was one of the advantages of an enchanted castle the first to come was clio the muse of history both breanna and justin were amazed when she introduced herself is there something historical going on breanna blurted as usual before she thought history is always in the making the muse replied every where every time however some occasions seem more significant than others and this is indeed one of those occasions its really great jenny getting married to a prince clio turned a disconcerting gaze on them that too she agreed what does she mean breanna asked justin internally i have no idea unless the convenience of this gathering facilitates another important activity or decisions exactly justin clio agreed then she closed her door leaving them both trying to blush then good magician humfrey arrived with a woman breanna didnt recognize before anyone could think of looking askance she introduced herself i am mareann humfreys fifth and a half wife i was his first true love but wouldnt marry him for years because i didnt want to lose my innocence and with it my ability to summon piers anthony unicorns but later having resided in hell i concluded that much of my innocence had already been sacrificed so i married him thus he obtained a halfwife of years i am the designated wife for this occasion as the gorgon is busy elsewhere oh breanna said somewhat taken aback well i hope you enjoy the wedding i doubt it humfrey grumped oh come on you know that deep down under all those layers of grumpiness you do like the chance to get out and meet old friends mareann said tweaking his ear as for me i love weddings i cry buckets but arent weddings supposed to be fun tearful fun youll see they moved on into their chamber the next guests were unfamiliar to justin but breanna almost fainted mom dad she screamed charging up to hug her parents what are you doing here we received an invitation to a wedding her mother said we hoped it wasnt yours for sure and we thought it was about time for the black village to start spreading out her father said we need to interact more positively with the rest of xanth especially now that there are a number of black children with magic talents you bet justin saw that though breanna had never mentioned her family and might even have felt somewhat alienated from them she did love them and was glad to see them she was bubbling over with things to tell them but soon they retired to their room they had made a long trip here and were tired they said justin suspected that they did not want to get in breannas way they were after all mundanes perhaps feeling out of place here a decrepit coach drawn by two halfdead horses drew up to the moat the zombie master and millie the ghost breanna cried dashing out to meet them sure enough the two were just stepping down to the ground but they werent alone king xeth and zyzzyva zombie were there too looking quite regal in formal clothing breanna greeted them all like the old friends they had become and showed them to the castles special cell in the cellar where the local zombies congregated this wasnt isolation they had requested it zombie lohr the biggest surprise was a couple justin didnt recognize but breanna did tristan troll and mouse terian she exclaimed joyfully yes we are a couple now the lovely woman said hugging her thanks to you but how can you be in human form away from your mistress com passion is here with me terian said touching her pocket in remote unit form there was a little screen tucked there as justin looked it formed a little female smileyface how clever breanna said enthusiastically and is com pewter here too tristan touched his own pocket where another little screen peeked out words appeared on it girl loses inthrest breanna lost interest in the computers but justin didnt as breanna led the couple to their chamber he questioned her and learned that mouse terian was a real mouse rendered by com passions power to change local reality into human form for the occasion and that tristan served similarly as com pewters mouse it seemed that mice and machines were now dating thanks to something breanna had done before she met justin the girl just seemed to have effects the chamber for that party was small and plain but in a moment it changed and became palatial the computers had the power to change reality in their vicinity and were using it a big tank was delivered containing three lovely mermaids ash cedar and mahogany they were respectively blonde redhaired and brunette and attracted some attention as they diverted themselves in the moat certainly souffle serpent enjoyed the company there was a rumble as of thunder and a shadow passed across the castle it was a monstrous bird in fact a roc coming in for a landing the mermaids looked up here comes roxanne ash called waving the roc wigwagged responding jennys friend che centaur arrived with his friend cynthia both being winged centaurs che was to be an usher a position of honor with them was gwendolyn goblin queen of goblin mountain another close friend she would be the maid of honor there had been no trouble from those particular goblins since gwennys ascension there was one more member of that party a huge glittering baby piers anthony bird that must be sim the simurghs chick justin exclaimed princess ida said he was another friend of jennys now he realized why roxanne roc was here she was sims nanny and guardian she took her job most seriously but knew that there was no threat to the chick in castle roogna so she was visiting with the moat party being too big to squeeze inside i am so glad to meet you sim breanna said smoothly peep the chick said bobbing his head that means thank you che said he could read your mind and project his response to you but he feels that would be impolite so he sticks to bird talk breanna smiled i really appreciate that sim i have all kinds of black secrets id rather not share sim nodded there seemed to be a smile on his beak i love weddings cynthia said i can hardly wait until we have one and start our family of winged centaurs but were only thirteen che protested i was older once so im entitled to romantic notions do you think our foal will have a separate magic talent but our talent is making things including ourselves light so we can fly thats a species talent like walking on four feet do you see human beings limited to the talent of walking on two feet che glanced at gwenny goblin i agree with her gwenny said its high time goblins had individual magic talents too why should my friend gloha goblinharpy be limited to flying so he glanced at sim who this time projected a thought to the group flying is plenty of magic for anyone gwenny made a cute moue thats rightside with your own gender birdbrain what does breanna say dont get into it justin warned so breanna avoided the issue im still waiting for mundanes to find magic they laughed and moved on two winged mermaids flew in and joined the three at the moat these were aurora and erica whom the three kings knew soon after another party of winged centaurs descended the ones they had met on mount rushmost and gotten the lip bomb from zombie lover then voracia arrived representing the isle of women and tipsy troll with phil istine who had evidently worked things out well and a handsome princely young man with a breathtakingly lovely young woman who introduced themselves as nimby and chlorine justin had never heard of them but they seemed to know everybody he had been too long away from human society he must have missed much there was something odd about this couple but he couldnt place it they seemed somehow too knowing on it went as it seemed that just about everyone who was anyone in xanth came to attend the wedding all for jenny elf who had arrived mostly by accident nine years before from the world of two moons with her cat sammy and become very popular in xanth justin was glad for her as she was certainly a nice girl but it made him much aware of what he had missed when he became a tree romance marriage enduring human interactions of course he could ask magician trent to transform him back to man form but to what point he would be cripplingly old everything came together on the appointed day justin watched the proceedings through breannas eyes and his sadness of joy increased they had removed the stage so that the girl did not get frightened jenny looked beautiful in her elfin way and jeremy werewolf was darkly handsome king dor gave jenny away in a royal manner and for this occasion even the floor and furniture managed to keep their smart remarks to a minimum when it was done king dor announced that there would be a banquet for all after the reception a reception line formed with jenny and jeremy meeting the guests personally the worst was over breanna stepped back wiping her face mareann said that women are supposed to cry at weddings she said i thought it was applesauce but i cant stop my eyes it is natural justin said there is no shame in it but i dont believe in such idiocy under that rebellion you are a woman she couldnt know how sincerely he meant that i guess i am anyway i must confess that some of those tears may have been mine there is just something about a wedding for sure piers anthony the odd couple approached may we speak with you breanna and justin the lovely woman asked i am chlorine and this is my friend nimby pleased to meet you justin prompted breanna though they had already met passingly pleased to meet you breanna echoed aloud sure tell me whats on your mind you have done nimby a significant favor and he wishes to give you another gift but we never met before today we have met but you dont remember thats what this concerns breannas confusion was one with justins he wants to give me something the gift of memory chlorine said on condition that you share it only with justin okay breanna asked justin unsure what this could be about i agree he said i am curious about this too we agree breanna said look nimby in the eye breanna and justin looked the handsome young man in the eye the eye seemed to expand becoming like a portal and through it was a scene of a lovely woman and a donkeyheaded dragon and mare imbri suddenly a phenomenal memory flooded through breanna and through justin too though it had not been his experience this was the demon x th in mortal form and he had given breanna her talent of seeing in blackness in exchange for the right to watch her dreams breanna had agreed to the deal then had her memory of the experience deleted this explained how a girl originating in mundania had come to have a magic talent breanna became unsteady but chlorine took her arm to keep her balanced i made the deal she breathed but then imbri had to take away the memory so no one would know about nimby yes thanks to you he has at last learned to dream he has learned that dreams are not confined to sleep they also represent a persons most cherished ambitions this is so immensely valuable to him that though he will no longer watch your dreams you may keep the talentand the memory zombif lover but i didnt really do anything breanna protested you gave permission and this was enough that enabled him to learn what he wished to without having to depart the land of xanth but if he had left the magic would have gone too true most of it at any rate just as the law of gravity would be repealed if the demon e t departed from mundania the natives probably wouldnt like that so we prefer that the demons not travel too much amen justin agreed chlorine nodded smiling we feel it appropriate for you to know the truth about nimby there may come times when you need to protect this knowledge from discovery elsewhere as was the case with magician binks talent do not reveal nimbys nature to anyone else any more than you reveal binks secret you know about that nimby knows about everything he wishes to he thanks you for your assistance and your discretion geethanks breanna said awed never dreamed you dreamed you did not remember and if you should ever encounter something that you suspect warrants nimbys attention focus on his name and we will soon make an appearance then chlorine looked through breannas eye to justin and your own dream is not necessarily foolish it can be realized if you find the way before this day ends but its impossible justin protested no merely improbable then chlorine and nimby turned away what dream breanna asked its nothing just a completely foolish passing fancy what dream she repeated more firmly please this is nothing you wish to know about justin if theres anything i really want to know about its whatever some adult says i dont want to know about come onwere about to separate so i wont have another chance what was she talking about he felt the pain again as you say we are about to separate our adventure together completed there is no point in complicating it by an irrelevancy breanna paused and he knew by her expression that she was work piers anthony ing out a strategy suppose we exchange secrets ill tell you mine and you tell me yours no that would not be wise heres mine i dont want you to go justin i know you want to return to your tree but i wish you would stay mean beyond the adventure i would like to stay but should not why cant you i really need your guidance you have helped me grow up so much and besides i like your company i like it a lot and i like yours but you have your own life to lead without the complication of my presence whats your secret i did not make your deal tell me anyway i fear you would find it dismaying tell me justin please she was bound to have it its similar in a certain respect to the situation jenny found herself in she she liked jeremy too well justinare you saying im afraid i am i like you too well breanna so rather than embarrass you further like a friend or like a romance like both but of course thats ludicrous because in actuality i am neither i am an adviser and vicarious adventurer but im young and impulsive and militant and sometimes i blow up for no good reason and i am old and staid and a tree and sometimes i become too dictatorial in my advice so there is no point in further discussion another guest was approaching this isnt finished breanna said and turned to meet the other but it soon would be he knew perhaps that was just as well it turned out to be a pair of guests xeth and zyzzyva zombie they were welldressed and looked very good considering he was in a suit and was handsome in a pale way while she was in a lowcut formal gown that was attracting many gazes justin suspected that many guests did not even realize that these were zombies we want to thank you for your timely help xeth said you introduced us zombie lovfr well i justyou know breanna said embarrassed whatever your motive we appreciate the result zyzzyva said we thank justin tree too you are welcome justin said through breannas mouth the couple moved on mingling with the guests without awkwardness and justin was glad that breanna had made an issue and gotten them admitted they were wellpreserved zombiesthe very best preservedand their nature hardly showed but the principle was a good one breannas surprising liberalization about zombies was carrying him along zombies were indeed worthy folk in their own right now about that discussion breanna said to him i thought you were mostly putting up with me for the sake of having your adventure i thought we got along well because you are so good at smoothing over my outbursts at hiding your own feelings of disgust and coming up with reasonable ways to interpret what you know is crazy so i wont feel bad even when i went nuts and told you to go you forgave me instead of taking the chance to bug out i thought you thought i was pretty much of a snot i never thought that well even if i was a perfect teen thered be things youd find ridiculous and i know im not perfect thats why i need your guidance you helped me get over my prejudice and be a better person you never even saw me as black as what thats my point maybe its because youre a tree you understand about being different but youre not different except in your inimitable character which always did appeal to me your charmingly direct manner im just better with you than without you thats why i wanted to keep you i can appreciate that but now that you know my failing there is no need to failing i have admitted that i failed to maintain a proper objectivity with respect to your person to keep the necessary emotional distance this places you in an unfairly awkward position it is in fact a tacit violation of the adult conspiracy so it seems best to disengage immediately piers anthony lets see if i have this straight you like me so you want to leave that is essentially it though i would use the word need rather than want i need to vacate before corrupt you corrupt me justin you never did anything of the kind you helped me grow up where i needed to and now by my transgression of emotion i threaten to force on you the kind of awareness you should not yet encounter i fear i have already said too much she pondered a moment i have to tell you justin i wasnt as you would put it entirely candid with you either you have been more than polite considering the affront i said i like you like you a lot but thats an understatement hiding the truth ive got a jenny problem too you are a good friend unfortunately i spoiled it i wish you well with the man whose interest you seek her bosom heaved i was right you dont understand about that but now ill tell you there is no man not like that i mean justin t think i love you that is the very corruption that must be avoided you cant damn it justin give me credit for knowing what im talking about it isnt just storks or sex its love and i think i know it when i feel it i think im feeling it he was almost dumbfounded that isnt possible at your age and my circumstance you mistake a passing fancy for the hell i do i dont want to keep you because you give me good advice i want to keep you because i cant stand to lose you but i didnt want to be a brat about hanging on to you when i know im just a child in your eyes when i thought you were just being diplomatic encouraging me so as not to hurt my feelings i guess thats why i blew up at you i was mad because of the futility of my interest but now that i know you care oh i do breanna but this is absolute foolishness we are merely mind companions we can never be more her jaw set i want to make love with you justin reeled mentally emotionally thisthiseven if it were possible it would be forbidden because im the one who rejected the adult conspiracy remember i zomhii lovhr think a girl is old enough if she thinks she is if she knows what its all about i do know and if she wants to and i do want to with you this is unacceptable your age justin if i were old enough would you do it it was as though he were sailing in a tiny boat on a treacherous sea in a storm he wanted to be honest but it was difficult i must confess i would want to but even so i wouldnt be able to my age if you were young again but im not young and in any event any such speculation would be corruptive to your innocence the obscene expletive almost blew him away breanna please then stop pretending im innocent you cant corrupt me because i already know the forbidden words and deeds do you want me to spell out exactly how folk summon the stork he knew she wasnt bluffing i spoke figuratively i am aware that you brought the knowledge with you from mundania but in experience in this respect you are innocent and it would be a violation for me to even suggest that you take any such action with anyone all i want is a straight answer to a straight question i think you owe me that much he capitulated if i were young and you of age and you wished to yes i would do it not because of the personal pleasure there might be but because the sweetest thing i can imagine is simply loving you and being loved by you but since you are too young and i too old it is no fit subject for speculation well im brash and impulsive and i have a notion i must confess that it is your very boldness and animation that draws me to you life with you could never be dull regardless of the surrounding circumstances what is your notion we must talk with the zombie master again with jonathan how could that relate lets find out she marched across the hall to where the zombie master and millie the ghost were standing why hello breanna millie said it is so nice to see you again piers anthony we enjoyed your visit to castle zombie so much you must come again maybe i will thanks she turned to the zombie master youre going to retire arent you when the good magician procures a suitable replacement for me he agreed and for me millie said we thought that bink and chameleon might be the ones but it turns out that they arent interested breanna nodded how about justin tree the zombie master shook his head he is almost as old as i am apart from his vegetable state for sure but would he be good to do the job apart from that if he resumed human form the zombie master considered her question seriously yes i believe he would if he were interested but the ageit does need to be a much younger person someone binks age yes his present physical age he is of course much older mentally then he did a doubletake are you suggesting that justin take the elixir of youth as bink did yeah i think the good magician would provide it for that purpose millie said but there would still need to be a woman the castle the situationwould be too lonely otherwise the zombies mean well but they arent good company on cold evenings how about a woman of eighteen three years from now the zombie master looked blank but millie understood immediately oh breanna yes that would be beautiful you have already done so much for the zombies yeah i guess im the zombie lover but its not just for them its because i want justin i want him human and young as he could be if someone with some clout spoke for him i thought that maybe if you put in a word to the good magician the zombie master shook his head i doubt i need to this is surely what he has in mind assuming that justin is amenable breanna turned inward but spoke aloud are you justin take my mouth how neatly she had put it together he was overwhelmed yes zombie lovfr he said with her mouth but still in fairness i must point out that you are not yet of age to make such a decision you must wait three years by that time you may have reconsidered how about this we stay together that three years just as we are now then we decide whether we still feel the same way and want to do it maybe ill have changed my mind or youll have changed yours so we can stay together or separate or decide to take the position then we go to the good magician and ask him for the youth elixir then we go to your tree and magician trent changes you back to human and you take the elixir and turn twenty one then we get married and move to castle zombie for a long time and stand up for the zombies when they need it does this make sense to you justin amazed again couldnt answer immediately her impulsiveness was absolutely delightful but this was almost too much to assimilate but millie kissed breanna and the zombie master reached out and shook her hand it makes sense to us breanna caught binks eye and he came over with chameleon you wont need to worry about castle zombie breanna said justin and i may go there in three years when were young enough and old enough bink smiled i am glad to hear it it is a most convenient coincidence breanna laughed for sure im glad you didnt take that position she stepped close and kissed him thanks chameleon raised a brow just what is your relationship with this girl theres just something about teenage girls that is appealing he said kissing her she of course was now sixteen i remember the zombie master said glancing at millie then the four of them dissolved into a dialogue about old times breanna faded back come on justinlets go somewhere and pretend that im eighteen and youre twenty one and were kissing do i have a choice of course not but lets not tell okay not for three years but they were intercepted by another couple mare imbri in human form and her partner forrest faun would you like a dream imbri inquired for sure you know which one make it extra real piers anthony my love is very good at making the unreal extra real forrest remarked patting imbris bottom are you trying to be a satyr instead of a faun imbri asked him archly no i was trying to be more of a satire the kind curse fiends hate when they put on a play this play will be no satire its more of a romance but it wouldnt be proper to justin started to protest however his heart wasnt in it he longed for just such a dream imbri looked into breannas eyes and through them into justins eyes dreams dont have to be proper she murmured thats part of what the demon learned then reality dissolved and justin was a virile young man and breanna was a lovely black eighteen they were alone in the glade that once had been filled by his tree form it was some dream whose naughty details they would never tell epilo g t he good magician humfrey made his way to one of the few secluded spots on the castle roogna premises the rose garden the roses were beautiful fragrant and restful he sat down amidst them closing his old eyes how nice to see you again humfrey he didnt open his eyes go away clio im not ready for another challenging historical nexus she laughed have no concern i will be occupied for some time recording this one what a delightful girl jenny is no girl shes a married woman thanks to our meddling and breanna he nodded there are appealing qualities about her despite her youth she is direct and forthright and determined and quite ready to challenge the status quoexactly the kind of representative the zombies need to combat the prejudice of the rest of xanth when mare imbri told me about her connection with nimby nimby the muse of history repeated thoughtfully he gave her back her memory of his true nature just as bink told her of the nature of his talent it is all information justin tree may need when he becomes the new zombie master it is a more important position than most folk realize it was her turn to nod indubitably bink is fortunate he and chameleon have a second youth to spendall so they could serve as piers anthony an example to those who needed to think of youthening to similar ages so that they could achieve their necessary if unlikely destinies and so bink could handle the rigors of the rest of the mission and ensure via his talent that it not come to grief humfrey finally cracked open half an eye now if you are quite done reminiscing about the obvious clio laughed for now but brace yourself the next volume promises to be more complicated with a special irrelevant significance the good magician groaned
