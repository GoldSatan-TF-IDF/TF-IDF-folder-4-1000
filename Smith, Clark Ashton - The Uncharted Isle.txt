the uncharted isle clark ashton smith i do not know how long i had been drifting in the boat there are several days and nights that i remember only as alternate blanks of greyness and darkness and after these there came a phantasmagoric eternity of delirium and an indeterminate lapse into pitchblack oblivion the seawater i had swallowed must have revived me for when i came to myself i was lying at the bottom of the boat with my head lifted a little in the stern and six inches of brine lapping at my lips i was gasping and strangling with the mouthfuls i had taken the boat was tossing roughly with more water coming over the sides at each toss and i could hear the sound of breakers not far away i tried to sit up and succeeded after a prodigious effort my thoughts and sensations were curiously confused and i found it difficult to orient myself in any manner the physical sensation of extreme thirst was dominant over all else my mouth was lined with running throbbing fire and i felt lightheaded and the rest of my body was strangely limp and hollow it was hard to remember just what had happened and for a moment i was not even puzzled by the fact that i was alone in the boat but even to my dazed uncertain senses the roar of those breakers had conveyed a distinct warning of peril and sitting up i reached for the oars the oars were gone but in my enfeebled state it was not likely that i could have made much use of them anyway i looked around and saw that the boat was drifting rapidly in the wash of a shoreward current between two lowlying darkish reefs halfhidden by flying veils of foam a steep and barren cliff loomed before me but as the boat neared it the cliff seemed to divide miraculously revealing a narrow chasm through which i floated into the mirrorlike waters of a still lagoon the passage from the rough sea without to a realm of sheltered silence and seclusion was no less abrupt than the transition of events and scenery which often occurs in a dream the lagoon was long and narrow and ran sinuously away between level shores that were fringed with an ultratropical vegetation there were many fernpalms of a type i had never seen and many stiff gigantic cycads and wideleaved grasses taller than young trees i wondered a little about them even then though as the boat drifted slowly toward the nearest beach i was mainly preoccupied with the clarifying and assorting of my recollections these gave me more trouble than one would think i must have been a trifle lightheaded still and the seawater i had drunk couldnt have been very good for me either even though it had helped to revive me i remembered of course that i was mark irwin first mate of the freighter auckland plying between callao and wellington and i recalled only too well the night when captain melville had wrenched me bodily from my bunk from the dreamless undersea of a dogtired slumber shouting that the ship was on fire i recalled the roaring hell of flame and smoke through which we had fought our way to the deck to find that the vessel was already past retrieving since the fire had reached the oil that formed part of her cargo and then the swift launching of boats in the lurid glare of the conflagration half the crew had been caught in the blazing forecastle and those of us who escaped were compelled to put off without water or provisions we had rowed for days in a dead calm without sighting any vessel and were suffering the tortures of the damned when a storm had arisen in this storm two of the boats were lost and the third which was manned by captain melville the second mate the boatswain and myself had survived but sometime during the storm or during the days and nights of delirium that followed my companions must have gone overboard this much i recalled but all of it was somehow unreal and remote and seemed to pertain only to another person than the one who was floating shoreward on the waters of a still lagoon i felt very dreamy and detached and even my thirst didnt trouble me half as much now as it had on awakening the boat touched a beach of fine pearly sand before i began to wonder where i was and to speculate concerning the shores i had reached i knew that we had been hundreds of miles southwest of easter island on the night of the fire in a part of the pacific where there is no other land and certainly this couldnt be easter island what then could it be i realized with a sort of shock that i must have found something not on any charted course or geological map of course it was an isle of some kind but i could form no idea of its possible extent and i had no way of deciding offhand whether it was peopled or unpeopled except for the lush vegetation and a few queerlooking birds and butterflies and some equally queerlooking fish in the lagoon there was no visible life anywhere i got out of the boat feeling very weak and wobbly in the hot white sunshine that poured down upon everything like a motionless universal cataract my first thought was to find fresh water and i plunged at random among the mighty ferntrees parting their enormous leaves with extreme effort and sometimes reeling against their boles to save myself from falling twenty or thirty paces however and then i came to a tiny rill that sprang in shattered crystal from a low ledge to collect in a placid pool where teninch mosses and broad anemonelike blossoms mirrored themselves the water was cool and sweet i drank profoundly and felt the benison of its freshness permeate all my parched tissues now i began to look around for some sort of edible fruit close to the stream i found a shrub that was trailing its burden of salmonyellow drupes on the giant mosses i couldnt identify the fruit but its aspect was delicious and i decided to take a chance it was full of a sugary pulp and strength returned to me even as i ate my brain cleared and i recovered many if not all of the faculties that had been in a state of partial abeyance i went back to the boat and bailed out all the seawater then i tried to drag the boat as far up on the sand as i could in case i might need it again at any future time my strength was inadequate to the task and still fearing that the tide might carry it away i cut some of the high grasses with my claspknife and wove them into a long rope with which i moored the boat to the nearest palmtree now for the first time i surveyed my situation with an analytic eye and became aware of much that i had hitherto failed to observe or realize a medley of queer impressions thronged upon me some of which could not have arrived through the avenues of the known senses to begin with i saw more clearly the abnormal oddity of the plantforms about me they were not the palmferns grasses and shrubs that are native to south sea islands their leaves their stems their frondage were mainly of uncouth archaic types such as might have existed in former aeons on the sealost littorals of mu they differed from anything i had seen in australia or new guinea those asylums of a primeval flora and gazing upon them i was overwhelmed with intimations of a dark and prehistoric antiquity and the silence around me seemed to become the silence of dead ages and of things that have gone down beneath oblivions tide from that moment i felt that there was something wrong about the island but somehow i couldnt tell just what it was or seize definitely upon everything that contributed to this impression aside from the bizarrelooking vegetation i noticed that there was a queerness about the very sun it was too high in the heavens for any latitude to which i could conceivably have drifted and it was too large anyway and the sky was unnaturally bright with a dazzling incandescence there was a spell of perpetual quietude upon the air and never the slightest rippling of leaves or water and the whole landscape hung before me like a monstrous vision of unbelievable realms apart from time and space according to all the maps that island couldnt exist anyhow more and more decisively i knew that there was something wrong i felt an eerie confusion a weird bewilderment like one who has been cast away on the shores of an alien planet and it seemed to me that i was separated from my former life and from everything i had ever known by an interval of distance more irremeable than all the blue leagues of sea and sky that like the island itself i was lost to all possible reorientation for a few instants this feeling became a nervous panic a paralyzing horror in an effort to overcome my agitation i set off along the shore of the lagoon pacing with feverish rapidity it occurred to me that i might as well explore the island and perhaps after all i might find some clue to the mystery might stumble on something of explanation or reassurance after several serpentlike turns of the winding water i reached the end of the lagoon here the country began to slope upward toward a high ridge heavily wooded with the same vegetation i had already met to which a longleaved araucaria was now added this ridge was apparently the crest of the island and after a halfhour of groping among the ferns the stiff archaic shrubs and araucarias i managed to surmount it here through a rift in the foliage i looked down upon a scene no less incredible than unexpected the further shore of the island was visible below me and all along the curving beach of a landlocked harbor were the stone roofs and towers of a town even at that distance i could see that the architecture was of an unfamiliar type and i was not sure at first glance whether the buildings were ancient ruins or the homes of a living people then beyond the roofs i saw that several strangelooking vessels were moored at a sort of mole flaunting their orange sails in the sunlight my excitement was indescribable at most i had thought to find a few savage huts and here below me were edifices that betokened a considerable degree of civilization what they were or who had builded them were problems beyond surmise but as i hastened down the slope toward the harbor a very human eagerness was mingled with the dumbfoundment and stupefaction i had been experiencing at least there were people on the island and at the realization of this the horror that had been a part of my bewilderment was dissipated for the nonce when i drew nearer to the houses i saw that they were indeed strange but the strangeness was not wholly inherent in their architectural forms nor was i able to trace its every source or define it in any way by word or image the houses were built of a stone whose precise color i cannot recall since it was neither brown nor red nor grey but a hue that seemed to combine yet differ from all these and i remember only that the general type of construction was low and square with square towers the strangeness lay in more than this in the sense of a remote and stupefying antiquity that emanated from them like an odor i knew at once that they were old as the uncouth primordial trees and grasses and like these were parcel of a longforgotten world then i saw the people those people before whom not only my ethnic knowledge but my very reason were to own themselves baffled there were scores of them in sight among the buildings and all of them appeared to be intensely preoccupied with something or other at first i couldnt make out what they were doing or trying to do but plainly they were much in earnest about it some were looking at the sea or the sun and then at long scrolls of a paperlike material which they held in their hands and many were grouped on a stone platform around a large intricate metal apparatus resembling an armillary all of these people were dressed in tuniclike garments of unusual amber and azure and tyrian shades cut in a fashion that was unfamiliar to history and when i came close i saw that their faces were broad and flat with a vague foreomening of the mongolian in their oblique eyes but in an unspecifiable was the character of their features was not that of any race that has seen the sun for a million years and the low liquid manyvowelled words which they spoke to each other were not denotive of any recorded language none of them appeared to notice me and i went up to a group of three who were studying one of the long scrolls i have mentioned and addressed them for all answer they bent closer above the scroll and even when i plucked one of them by the sleeve it was evident that he did not observe me much amazed i peered into their faces and was struck by the mingling of supreme perplexity and monomaniacal intentness which their expression displayed there was much of the madman and more of the scientist absorved in some irresoluble problem their eyes were fixed and fiery their lips moved and mumbled in a fever of perpetual disquiet and following their gaze i saw that the thing they were studying was a sort of chart or map whose yellowing paper and faded inks were manifestly of past ages the continents and seas and isles on this map were not those of the world i knew and their names were written in heteroclitic runes of a lost alphabet there was one immense continent in particular with a tiny isle close to its southern shore and ever and anon one of the beings who pored above the map would touch this isle with his fingertip and then would stare toward the empty horizon as if he were seeking to recover a vanished shoreline i received a distinct impression that these people were as irretrievably lost as i myself that they too were disturbed and baffled by a situation not to be solved or redeemed i went on toward the stone platform which stood in a broad open space among the foremost houses it was perhaps ten feet high and access to it was given by a flight of winding steps i mounted the steps and tried to accost the people were crowding about the armillarylike instrument but they too were utterly oblivious of me and intent upon the observations they were making some of them were turning the great celestial sphere some were consulting various geographical and celestial maps and from my nautical knowledge i could see that certain of their companions were taking the height of the sun with a kind of astrolabe all of them wore the same look of perplexity and savantlike preoccupation which i had observed in the others seeing that my efforts to attract their attention were fruitless i left the platform and wandered along the streets toward the harbor the strangeness and inexplicability of it all were too much for me more and more i felt that i was being alienated from the realms of all rational experience or conjecture that i had fallen into some unearthly limbo of confoundment and unreason into the culdesac of an ultraterrestrial dimension these beings were so palpably astray and bewildered it was so obvious that they knew as well as i that there was something wrong with the geography and perhaps with the chronology of their island i spent the rest of the day roaming around but nowhere could i find anyone who was able to perceive my presence and nowhere was there anything to reassure me or resolve my evergrowing confusion of mind and spirit everywhere there were men and also women and though comparatively few of them were grey and wrinkled they all conveyed to my apprehension a feeling of immemorial eld of years and cycles beyond all record or computation and all were troubled all were feverously intent and were perusing maps or reading ancient pells and volumes or staring at the sea and sky or studying the brazen tablets of astronomical parapegms along the streets as if by so doing they could somehow find the flaw in their reckonings there were men and women of mature years and some with the fresh unlined visages of youth but in all the place i saw but one child and the face of the child was no less perplexed and troubled than those of its elders if anyone ate or drank or carried on the normal occupations of life it was not done within my scope of vision and i conceived the idea that they had lived in this manner obsessed with the same problem through a period of time which would have been practically eternal in any other world than theirs i came to a large building whose open door was dark with the shadows of the interior peering in i found that it was a temple for across the deserted twilight heavy with the stale fumes of burntout incense the slant eyes of a baleful and monstrous image glared upon me the thing was seemingly of stone or wood with gorillalike arms and the malignant features of a subhuman race from what little i could see in the gloom it was not pleasant to look upon and i left the temple and continued my perambulations now i came to the waterfront where the vessels with orange sails were moored at a stone mole there were five or six of them in all they were small galleys with single banks of oars and figureheads of metal that were graven with the likeness of primordial gods they were indescribably worn by the waves of untold years their sails were rotting rags and no less than all else on the island they bore the imprint of a dread antiquity it was easy to believe that their grotesquely carven prows had touched the aeonsunken wharves of lemuria i returned to the town and once again i sought to make my presence known to the inhabitants but all in vain and after a while as i trudged from street to street the sun went down behind the island and the stars came swiftly out in a heaven of purpureal velvet the stars were large and lustrous and were innumerably thick with the eye of a practiced mariner i studied them eagerly but i could not trace the wonted constellations though here and there i thought that i perceived a distortion or elongation of some familiar grouping all was hopelessly askew and disorder crept into my very brain as i tried once more to orient myself and noticed that the inhabitants of the town were still busied with a similar endeavor i have no way of computing the length of my sojourn on the island time didnt seem to have any proper meaning there and even if it had my mental state was not one to admit of precise reckoning it was all so impossible and unreal so much like an absurd and troublesome hallucination and half the time i thought that it was merely a continuation of my delirium that probably i was still drifting in the boat after all this was the most reasonable supposition and i dont wonder that those who have heard my story refuse to entertain any other id agree with them if it werent for one or two quite material details the manner in which i lived is pretty vague to me also i remember sleeping under the stars outside the town i remember eating and drinking and watching those people day after day as they pursued their hopeless calculations sometimes i went into the houses and helped myself to food and once or twice if i remember rightly i slept on a couch in one of them without being disputed or heeded by the owners there was nothing that could break the spell of their obsession or force them to notice me and i soon gave up the attempt and it seemed to me as time went on that i myself was no less unreal no less doubtful and insubstantial than their disregard would appear to indicate in the midst of my bewilderment however i found myself wondering if it would be possible to get away from the island i remembered my boat and remembered also that i had no oars and forthwith i made tentative preparations for departure in broad daylight before the eyes of the townspeople i took two oars from one of the galleys in the harbor and carried them across the ridge to where my boat was hidden the oars were very heavy their blades were broad as fans and their handles were fretted with hieroglyphs of silver also i appropriated from one of the houses two earthen jars painted with barbaric figures and bore them away to the lagoon intending to fill them with fresh water when i left and also i collected a supply of food but somehow the brainmuddling mystery of it all had paralyzed my initiative and even when everything was ready i delayed my departure i felt too that the inhabitants must have tried innumerable times to get away in their galleys and had always failed and so i lingered on like a man in the grip of some ridiculous nightmare one evening when those distorted stars had all come out i became aware that unusual things were going on the people were no longer standing about in groups with their customary porings and discussions but were all hastening toward the templelike edifice i followed them and peered in at the door the place was lit with flaring torches that flung demoniac shadows on the crowd and on the idol before whom they were bowing perfumes were burnt and chants were sung in the myriadvowelled language with which my ear had become familiarized they were invoking that frightful image with gorillalike arms and halfhuman halfanimal face and it was not hard for me to surmise the purpose of the invocation then the voices died to a sorrowful whisper the smoke of the censers thinned and the little child i had once seen was thrust forward in a vacant space between the congregation and the idol i had thought of course that the god was of wood or stone but now in a flash of terror and consternation i wondered if i had been mistaken for the oblique eyes opened more widely and glowered upon the child and the long arms ending in knifetaloned fingers lifted slowly and reached forward and arrowsharp fangs were displayed in the bestial grin of the leaning face the child was still as a bird beneath the hypnotic eyes of a serpent and there was no movement and no longer even a whisper from the waiting throng i cannot recall what happened then whenever i try to recall it there is a cloud of horror and darkness in my brain i must have left the temple and fled across the island by starlight but of this too i remember nothing my first recollection is of rowing seaward through the narrow chasm by which i had entered the lagoon and of trying to steer a course by the wried and twisted constellations after that there were days and days on a bland unrippled sea beneath a heaven of dazzling incandescence and more nights below the crazy stars till the days and nights became an eternity of tortured weariness and my food and water were all consumed and hunger and thirst and a feverous calenture with tossing seething hallucinations were all that i knew one night i came to myself for a little while and lay staring up at the sky and once more the stars were those of the rightful heavens and i gave thanks to god for my sight of the southern cross ere i slid back into coma and delirium and when i recovered consciousness again i was lying in a ships cabin and the ships doctor was bending over me they were all very kind to me on that ship but when i tried to tell them my tale they smiled pityingly and after a few attempts i learned to keep my silence they were very curious about the two oars with silverfretted handles and the painted jars which they found with me in the boat but they were all too frank in refusing to accept my explanation no such island and no such people could possibly exist they said it was contrary to all the maps that had ever been made and gave the direct lie to all the ethnologists and geographers often i wonder about it myself for there are so many things i cant explain is there a part of the pacific that extends beyond time and space an oceanic limbo into which by some unknowable cataclysm that island passed in a bygone period even as lemuria sank beneath the wave and if so by what abrogation of dimensional laws was i enabled to reach the island and depart from it these things are beyond speculation but often in my dream i see again the incognizably distorted stars and share the confusion and bafflement of a lost people as they pore above their useless charts and take the altitude of a deviated sun
