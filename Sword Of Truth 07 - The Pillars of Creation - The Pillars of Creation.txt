chapter picking through the dead mans pockets jennsen daggett came across the last thing in the world she would ever have expected to find startled she sat back on her heels the raw breeze ruffled her hair as she stared wideeyed at the words written in precise blocky letters on the small square of paper the paper had been folded in half twice carefully so that the edges had been even she blinked half expecting the words to vanish like some grim illusion they remained solid and all too real foolish though she knew the thought was she still felt as if the dead soldier might be watching her for any reaction showing none outwardly anyway she stole a look at his eyes they were dull and filmy she had heard people say of the deceased that they looked like they were only sieeping he didnt his eyes looked dead his pale lips were taut his face was waxy there was a purplish blush at the back of his bull neck of course he wasnt watching her he was no longer watching anything with his head turned to the side toward her though it almost seemed as if he might be looking at her she could imagine he was up on the rocky hill behind her bare branches clattered together in the laind like bones clacking the paper in her trembling fingers seemed to be rattling with them her heart already thumping at a brisk pace started ad pound harder jennsen prided herself in her levelheadedness she knew she was letting her imagination get carried away but she had never before seen a dead person a person so grotesquely still it was dreadful seeing someone who didnt breathe she swallowed in an attempt to compose her own breathing if not her nerves even if he was dead jennsen didnt like him looking at her so she stood lifted the hem of her long skirts and stepped around the body she carefully folded the small piece of paper over twice the way it had been folded when she had found it and slipped it into her pocket she would have to worry about that later jennsen knew how her mother would react to those two words on the paper determined to be finished with her search she squatted on the other side of the man with his face turned away it almost seemed as if he were looking back up at the trail from where he had fallen as if he might be wondering what had happened and how he had come to be at the bottom of the steep rocky gorge with his neck broken his cloak had no pockets two pouches were secured to his belt one pouch held oil whetstones and a strop the other was packed with jerky neither contained a name if hed known better as she did he would have taken the long way along the bottom of the cliff rather than traverse the trail across the top where patches of black ice made it treacherous this time of year even if he didnt want to retreat the way he had come in order to climb down into the gorge it would have been wiser for him to have made his way through the woods despite the thick bramble that made travel difficult up there among the deadfall done was done if she could find something that would tell her who he was maybe she could find his kin or someone who knew him they would want to know she clung to the safety of the pretense almost against her will jennsen returned to wondering what he had been doing out here she feared that the carefully folded piece of paper told her only too clearly still there could be some other reason if she could just find it she had to move his arm a little if she was to look in his other pocket dear spirits forgive me she whispered as she grasped the dead limb his unbending arm moved only with difficulty jennsens nose wrinkled with disgust he was as cold as the ground he lay on as cold as the sporadic raindrops that fell from the iron sky this time of year it was almost always snow driven before such a stiff west wind the unusual intermittent mist and drizzle had surely made the icy places on the trail at the top even slicker the dead man only proved it she knew that if she stayed much longer she would be caught out in the approaching winter rain she was well aware that people exposed to such weather risked their lives fortunately jennsen wasnt terribly far from home if she didnt get home soon though her mother worried at what could be taking so long would probably come out after her jennsen didnt want her mother getting soaked too her mother would be waiting for the fish jennsen had retrieved from baited lines in the lake for once the lines they tended through holes in the ice had brought them a full stringer the fish were lying dead on the other side of the dead man where she had dropped them after making her grim discovery he hadnt been there earlier or she would have seen him on her way out to the lake taking a deep breath to gird her resolve jermsen made herself return to her search she imagined that some woman was probably wondering about her big handsome soldier worrying if he was safe warm and dry he was none of that jennsen would want someone to tell her mother if it were she who had fallen and broken her neck her mother would understand if she delayed a bit to try to find out the mans identity jennsen reconsidered her mother might understand but she still wouldnt want jermsen anywhere near one of these soldiers but he was dead he couldnt hurt anyone now much less her and her mother her mother would be even more troubled once jennsen showed her what was written on the little piece of paper jennsen knew that what really drove her search was the hope for some other explanation she desperately wanted it to be something else that frantic need kept her beside his dead body when she wanted nothing so much as to run for home if she didnt find anything to explain away his presence then it would be best to cover him and hope that no one ever found him even if she had to stay out in the rain she should cover him over as quickly as possible she shouldnt wait then no one would ever know where he was she made herself push her hand down into his trouser pocket all the way to the end the flesh of his thigh was stiff her fingers hurriedly gathered up the nest of small objects at the bottom gasping for breath at the awful task she pulled it all out in her fist she bent close in the gathering gloom and opened her fingers for a look on top were a flint bone buttons a small ball of twine and a folded handkerchief with one finger she pushed the twine and handkerchief to the side exposing a weighty clutch of coinssilver and gold she let out a soft whistle at the sight of such wealth she didnt think that soldiers were rich but this man had five gold marks among a larger number of silver marks a fortune by most any standard all the silver penniesnot copper silverseemed insignificant by contrast even though they alone were probably more than she had spent in the whole of her twenty years the thought occurred to her that it was the first time in her life that she had ever held goldor even silvermarks the thought occurred to her that it might be plunder she found no trinket from a woman as she had hoped so as to soften her worry about what sort of man he had been regrettably nothing in the pocket told her anything of who he might be her nose wrinkled as she went about the chore of returning his possessions to his pocket some of the silver pennies spilled from her fist she picked them all up from the wet frozen ground and forced her hand into his pocket again in order to return them all to their rightful place his pack might tell her more but he was sprawled atop it and she wasnt sure she wanted to try to have a look since it was likely to hold only supplies his pockets would have held anything he considered valuable like the piece of paper she supposed all the evidence that she really needed was in plain sight he wore stiff leather armor under his dark cloak and tunic at his hip was a simple but ruggedly made and wickedly sharp soldiers sword in a torn utilitarian black leather scabbard the sword was broken at midlength no doubt in the long tumble from the trail her eyes glided more carefully over the remarkable knife sheathed at his belt the hilt of the knife gleaming in the gloom was what had riveted her attention from the first instant the sight of it had held her frozen until she realized its owner was dead she was sure that no simple soldier would possess a knife that exquisitely crafted it had to be more expensive than any knife she had ever seen on the silver hilt was the omate letter r even so it was a thing of beauty from a young age her mother had taught her to use a knife she wished her mother could have a knife as fine as this jennsen jennsen jumped at the whispered word not now dear spirits not now not here jennsen jermsen was not a woman who hated much in life but she hated the voice that sometimes came to her she ignored it now as always forcing her fingers to move to try to discover if there was anything else about the man that she should know she checked the leather straps for concealed pockets but found none the tunic was a plain cut without pockets jennsen came the voice again she gritted her teeth leave me be she said aloud if under her breath jennsen it sounded different this time almost as if the voice wasnt in her head as it always was leave me alone she growled surrender came the dead murmur she glanced up and saw the mans dead eyes staring at her the first curtain of cold rain billowing in the wind felt like the icy fingers of spirits caressing her face her heart galloped yet faster her breath caught against her ragged pulls like silk catching on dry skin with her wideeyed gaze locked on the dead soldiers face she pushed with her feet scuttling back across the gravel she was being silly she knew she was the man was dead he wasnt looking at her he couldnt be his stare was fixed in death thats all like her stringer of dead fishthey werent looking at anything neither was he she was being silly it only seemed he was looking at her but even if the dead eyes were staring at nothing she would just as soon that they werent doing it in her direction jennsen beyond above the sharp rise of granite the pine trees swayed from side to side in the wind and the bare maple and oak waved their skeletal arms but jennsen kept her gaze fixed on the dead man as she listened for the voice the mans lips were still she knew they would be the voice was in her head his face was still turned toward the trail from where he had fallen to his death she had thought his lifeless sight had been turned in that direction too but now his eyes seemed to be turned more toward her jennsen curled her fingers around the hilt of her knife jennsen leave me be ill not surrender she never knew what it was that the voice wanted her to surrender despite having been with her nearly her whole life it had never said she found refuge in that ambiguity as if in answer to her thought the voice came again surrender yourflesh jennsen jennsen couldnt breathe surrender your will she swallowed in terror it had never said that beforenever said anything she could understand often she would faintly hear itas if it were too far away to be clearly understood sometimes she thought she could hear the words but they seemed to be in a strange language she often heard it when she was falling asleep calling to her in that distant dead whisper it spoke other words to her she knew but never so as she could understand more than her name and that frighteningly seductive singleword command to surrender that word was always more forceful than any other she could always hear it even when she could hear no other her mother said that the voice was the man who nearly jennsens whole life had wanted to kill her her mother said that he wanted to torment her jenn her mother would often say its all right im here with you his voice cant hurt you not wanting to burden her mother jennsen often didnt tell her about the voice but even if the voice couldnt hurt her the man could if he found her at that moment jennsen desperately wished for the protective comfort of her mothers arms one day he would come for her they both knew he would until then he sent his voice thats what her mother thought anyway as much as that explanation frightened her jennsen preferred it to thinking herself mad if she didnt have her own mind she had nothing whats happened here jennsen gasped in a cry of fright as she spun pulling her knife she dropped into a half crouch feet spread knife held in a death grip it was no disembodied voice this a man was walking up the gully toward her with the wind in her ears and the distraction of the dead man and the voice she hadnt heard him coming as big as he was as close as he was she knew that if she ran and if he was of a mind he could easily run her down chapter the man slowed when he saw her reaction and her knife i didnt mean to give you a scare his voice was pleasant enough well you did although the hood of his cloak was up and she couldnt see his face clearly he seemed to be taking in her red hair the way most people did when they saw her i can see that i apologize she didnt slacken her defensive posture in acceptance of the apology but instead swept her gaze to the sides checking to see if he was alone to see if anyone else was with him and might be sneaking up on her she felt a fool for being caught by surprise like that in the back of her mind she knew she couldnt ever really be safe it didnt necessarily take stealth even simple carelessness on her part could at any time bring the end she felt a sense of forlorn doom at how easily it could happen if this man could walk up in broad daylight and startle her so easily what did that say of her hopelessly extravagant dream that one day her life could be her own the dark rock wall of the cliff glistened in the wet the windswept gully was deserted of anyone but her and the two men the dead one and the one alive jennsen was not given to imagining sinister faces lurking in forest shadows as she had been as a child the dark places in among the trees were empty the man stopped a dozen paces away by his posture it wasnt fear of her knife that halted him but fear of causing her a worse fright he stared openly at her seemingly lost in some private thought he quickly recovered from whatever it was about her face that so held his gaze i can understand why a woman would have cause to be frightened when a stranger suddenly walks up on her i would have passed on by without alarming you but i saw that fellow on the ground and you there bent over him i thought you might need help so i rushed over the cold wind pressed his dark green cloak against his sinewy build and lifted the other side away to reveal his wellcut but simple clothes his cloaks hood covered his head against the first trailers of rain leaving his face somewhat indistinct in its shadow his smile was one of courteous intent no more he wore the smile well hes dead was all she could think to say jermsen was unaccustomed to speaking to strangers she was unaccustomed to speaking to anyone but her mother she was unsure as to what to sayhow to reactespecially under the circumstances oh im sorry he stretched his neck a little without coming any closer trying to see the man on the ground jennsen thought it a considerate thing to donot trying to come closer to someone who was clearly nervous she hated that she was so obvious she had always hoped she might appear to others somewhat inscrutable his gaze lifted from the dead man to her knife to her face i suppose you had cause perplexed for a second she finally grasped his meaning and blurted out i didnt do it he shrugged sorry from over here i cant tell what happened jermsen felt awkward holding a knife on the man she lowered the arm with the weapon i didnt mean to to appear a madwoman you just startled the wits out of me his smile warmed i understand no harm done so what happened jennsen gestured with her empty hand toward the cliff face i think he fell from the trail up there his necks broken at least i think it is i only just discovered him i dont see any other footprints my guess is that he was killed in a fall as jennsen returned her knife to its sheath on her belt he considered the cliff glad i took the bottom rather than the trail up there she inclined her head in invitation toward the dead man i was looking for something that might tell me who he was i thought maybe i should notify someone but i havent found anything the mans boots crunched through the coarse gravel as he approached he knelt on the other side of the body rather than beside her perhaps to give the knifewielding madwoman a precautionary bit of space so she would feet a little less jumpy id guess you were right he said after taking in the abnormal cant of the head looks like hes been here at least part of the day i was through here earlier those are my tracks there i dont see any others about she gestured toward her catch lying just behind her when i went to the lake to check my lines earlier he wasnt here he twisted his head in order to better study the still face any idea who he was no i dont have a clue other than that hes a soldier the man looked up any idea what kind of soldier jennsens brow drew tight what kind hes a dharan soldier she lowered herself to the ground in order to look at the stranger more directly where are you from that you wouldnt recognize a dharan soldier he ran his hand under his cloaks hood and rubbed it along the side of his neck im just a traveler passing through he looked as tired as he sounded the answer perplexed her ive moved around my whole life and i dont know of anyone who wouldnt know a dharan soldier when they saw one how can you not im new to dhara thats not possible dhara covers most of the world this time his smile betrayed amusement is that so she could feel her face heat and she knew it must be going red with how ignorant of the world at large she had shown herself to be well doesnt it he shook his head no im from far to the south beyond the land that is dhara she stared in wonder her chagrin evaporating in light of the implications that came into her head at such an astonishing notion perhaps her dream might not be so extravagant and what are you doing here in dhara i told you traveling he sounded weary she knew how exhausting it could be to travel his tone turned more serious i know hes a dharan soldier you misunderstood me what i meant was what kind of soldier a man belonging to a local regiment a man stationed here a soldier on his way home for a visit a soldier going for a drink in town a scout her sense of alarm rose a scout what would he be scouting for in his own homeland the man looked off at the low dark clouds i dont know i was only wondering if you knew anything of him no of course not i just found him are these dharan soldiers dangerous i mean do they bother folks folks just traveling through her gaze fled his questioning eyes ii dont know i guess they could be she feared to say too much but she wouldnt want him to end up in trouble because she said too little what do you suppose a lone soldier was doing way out here soldiers arent often alone i dont know why do you suppose a simple woman would know more about soldiering than a man of the world who travels about dont you have any ideas of your own maybe he was just on his way home for a visit or something maybe he was thinking about a girl back home and so he wasnt paying attention like he should have been maybe thats why he slipped and fell he rubbed his neck again as if he were in pain im sorry i guess im not making much sense im a little tired maybe im not thinking clearly maybe i was only concerned for you for me what do you mean i mean that soldiers belong to units of one sort or another other soldiers know them and know where theyre supposed to be soldiers dont just go off alone when they want to they arent like some lone trapper who could vanish and no one would know or some lone traveler an easy grin softened his expression or some lone traveler the grin withered the point is other soldiers will likely look for him if they come upon his body here theyll bring in troops to prevent anyone from leaving the area once they gather anyone they can find theyll start asking questions from what ive heard about dharan soldiers they know how to ask questions theyll want to know every detail about every person they question jennsens middle cramped in sick churning consternation the last thing in the world she wanted was dharan soldiers asking questions of her or her mother this dead soldier could end up being the death of them but what are the chances im only saying that id not like to have this fellows friends come along and decide that someone has to pay for his death they might not see it as an accident soldiers get stirred up by the death of a comrade even if it was an accident you and i are the only two around id not like to have a bunch of soldiers discover him and decide to blame us you mean even if it was an accident they might seize an innocent person and blame them for it i dont know but in my experience thats the way soldiers are when theyre angry they find someone to blame but they cant blame us you werent even here and i was only going to tend my fishing lines he planted an elbow on his knee and leaned over the dead man toward her and this soldier going about his business for the great dharan empire saw a beautiful young woman strutting along and was so distracted by her that he slipped and fell i wasnt strutting i dont mean to suggest you were i only meant to show you how people can find blame when they decide they want to shed not thought of that they were dharan soldiers such behavior would hardly be out of the question the rest of what hed said registered in her mind jennsen had never before had a man call her beautiful it flustered her coming so unexpectedly and out of place as it did in the middle of such a worry since she didnt have any idea how to react to the compliment and since there were so many more important thoughts commanding her emotions she ignored it if they find him the man said then at the least theyre going to collect anyone around and question them long and hard all the ugly implications were becoming all too real the day of doom was suddenly looming near what do you think we should do he thought it over a moment well if they do come by but dont find him then they wont have any reason to stop and question the people here if they dont find him theyll go somewhere else to keep looking for him he rose and looked around grounds too hard to dig a grave he pulled his hood farther forward to shield his eyes from the mist as he searched he pointed to a spot near the base of the cliff there theres a deep cleft that looks big enough we could put him in there and cover him over with gravel and rocks best burial we can manage this time of year and probably more than he deserved she would just as soon leave him but that wouldnt be wise covering him up was what she had planned on doing before the stranger happened along this would be a better way to do it there would be less chance that animals would uncover him for passing soldiers to discover seeing her trying to hastily weigh the various ramifications and mistaking it for reluctance he spoke in soft assurance the man is dead nothing can be done about it it was an accident why let that accident bring trouble we didnt do anything wrong we werent even here when it happened i say we bury him and go on with our liveswithout dharan soldiers becoming unjustly involved jennsen stood the man might be right about soldiers coming upon a dead friend and deciding to question people there was abundant reason to be worried about the dead dharan soldier without this new concern she thought again about the piece of paper shed found in his pocket that would be reason enoughwithout any other if the piece of paper was what she thought it might be then questioning would only be the beginning of the ordeal agreed she said if were to do it lets be quick he smiled more relief than anything she thought then turning to face her more squarely he pushed his hood back off his head the way men did out of respect for a woman jennsen was shocked to see even though he was at most only six or seven years older than she that his cropped hair was as white as snow she gazed at it with much the same sense of wonder as people gazed at her red hair with the shadows of the hood gone she saw that his eyes were as blue as hers as blue as people said her fathers had been the combination of his short white hair and those blue eyes was arresting the way they both went with his cleanshaven face was singularly appealing it all fit together with his features in a way that seemed completely right he held his hand out across the dead soldier my name is sebastian she hesitated a moment but then offered her hand in return even though his was big and no doubt powerful he didnt squeeze her hand to prove it the way some men did the unnatural warmth of the hand surprised her are you going to tell me your name im jermsen daggett jennsen he smiled his pleasure at the sound of it she felt her face going red again instead of noticing he immediately set to the task by grabbing the soldier under his arms and giving him a tug the body moved only a short distance with each mighty pull the soldier had been a huge man now he was a huge dead weight jermsen seized the soldiers cloak at the shoulder to help sebastian moved his hold to the cloak at the other shoulder and together they dragged the weight of the man who loomed as dangerous to her in death as he would have in life across the gravel and slick patches of smooth rock still panting from the effort and before pushing the soldier into the crevice that was to be his final resting place sebastian rolled him over jermsen saw for the first time that he wore a short sword strapped over his shoulder under his pack she hadnt seen it before because he was lying on it hooked on the weapons belt around his waist at the small of his back hung a crescentbladed battleaxe jennsens level of apprehension rose at seeing how heavily armed the soldier had been regular soldiers didnt carry this many weapons or a knife like he had sebastian tugged the straps of the pack down off the arms he unstrapped the short sword and set it aside he pulled off the weapons belt and tossed it atop the sword nothing too unusual in the pack he said after a brief inspection he added the pack to the short sword the weapons belt and the axe sebastian started searching the dead mans pockets jennsen was about to question what he was doing when she recalled that she had done the same she was somewhat more disturbed when he returned the other items after picking out the money she thought it rather coldblooded stealing from the dead sebastian held the money out to her what are you doing she asked take it he offered the money again more insistently this time what good is it going to do in the ground money is of use to relieve the suffering of the living not the dead you think the good spirits will ask him for the price of a bright and pleasant eternity he was a dharan soldier jennsen expected the keeper of the underworld would have something somewhat more dark in store for this mans eternity but its not mine he frowned a reproving look consider it partial compensation for all youve suffered she felt her flesh go cold how could he know they were always so careful what do you mean the years taken off your life by the fright this fellow gave you today jennsen finally was able to let her breath go in a silent sigh she had to stop fearing the worst in what people said she allowed sebastian to put the coins in her hand all right but i think you should have half for helping me she handed three gold marks back he grasped her hand with his other and pressed all three coins into her palm take it its yours now jermsen thought of what this much money could mean she nodded my mother has had a hard life she could use it i will give it to my mother i hope it helps you both then let it be this mans last good acthelping you and your mother your hands are warm by the look in his eyes she thought she knew why she said no more he nodded and confirmed her suspicion ive got a touch of fever i came down with it this morning when we get finished with this business im hoping to get to the next town and rest up in a dry room for a while i just need some rest to regain my strength town is too far for you to make today you sure i can make good time im used to traveling so am i jennsen said and it takes me most of a day to make it theres only a couple of hours of light leftand we have yet to finish with this task not even a fast horse would get you near town today sebastian let out a sigh well i guess ill make do he knelt again and rolled the soldier partway over in order to unstrap the knife the sheath finegrain black leather was trimmed with silver to match the handle and decorated with the same ornate emblem on one knee sebastian held the gleaming sheathed knife up to her silly to bury such a fine weapon here you go better than that piece of junk you showed me before jennsen stood stunned and confused but you should keep it ill take the others more to my taste anyway the knife is yours sebastians rule sebastians rule beauty belongs with beauty jennsen blushed at the intended compliment but this was not a thing of beauty he had no idea of the ugliness this represented any idea what the r in the hilt stands for oh yes she wanted to say she knew only too well what it represented that was the ugliness it stands for the house of rahl house of rahl lord rahlthe ruler of dhara she said in simple explanation of a nightmare chapter by the time they were finished with the laborious task of covering the troublesome body of the dead dharan soldier jennsens arms were weak with fatigue the damp wind scything through her clothes felt like it cut to the bone her ears and nose and fingers were numb sebastians face was covered in a sheen of sweat but the dead man was at last buried under gravel and then rocks that were in abundance at the base of the cliff animals were not likely to be able to dig through all the heavy stone to get at the body the worms would feast undisturbed sebastian had said a few simple words asking the creator to welcome the mans soul into eternity he made no plea for mercy in his judgment and neither did jennsen as she finished scattering gravel with a heavy branch and her feet obscuring the marks left by their work she gave the area a critical examination and was relieved to see that no one would ever suspect that a person lay buried there if soldiers came through they wouldnt realize that one of their own had met his end here they would have no reason to question local people except perhaps to ask if anyone had seen him that would be a simple enough lie to feed them and one easily swallowed jennsen pressed her hand against sebastians forehead it confirmed her fears youre burning with fever were done now i can rest more easily not having to worry that soldiers will be rousting me out of my bedroll to ask me questions at the point of a sword she wondered where he was going to sleep the drizzle was thickening she expected it would soon be raining given the persistence of the darkening clouds once it started it would likely rain the whole night cold rain soaking him to the skin would only further inflame his fever such a winter rain could easily kill someone who lacked proper shelter she watched as sebastian strapped the weapons belt around his waist he didnt place the axe at the small of his back the way the soldier had worn it but rather positioned it at his right hip after testing its edge and finding it satisfactory he fastened the short sword to the left side of the belt both weapons were placed so as to come readily to hand when hed finished he flipped his heavy green cloak closed over it all he seemed again a simple traveler she suspected he was more he had his secrets he wore them casually almost in the open she wore hers uneasily and held close he handled the sword with the kind of smooth ease that came only with long acquaintance she knew because she handled a knife with effortless grace and such proficiency had come only with experience and continual practice some mothers taught their daughters to sew and cook jermsens mother didnt think sewing would save her daughter not that a knife would either but it was better protection than needle and thread sebastian lifted the dead mans pack and threw back the flap well divide the supplies do you want the pack you should keep the supplies and the pack jennsen said as she retrieved her stringer of fish he agreed with a nod he appraised the sky as he cinched the pack closed id best be on my way then where his weary eyelids blinked at the question no place special traveling i guess ill walk for a while and then i suppose id better try to find some shelter rain is coming she said it doesnt take a prophet to tell that he smiled guess not his eyes bore the prospect of what lay ahead with resigned acceptance he swiped his hand back over his wet spikes of white hair then pulled up his hood well take care of yourself jermsen daggett give my best to your mother she raised a lovely daughter jermsen smiled and acknowledged his words with a single nod she stood facing the damp wind as she watched him turn and start off across the flat expanse of gravel craggy rock walls rose up all around their snowcrusted shoulders disappearing into the low gray overcast that concealed the bulk of the mountains and the nearly endless range of high peaks it seemed so funny so freakish so futile that in all this vast country their paths should cross so briefly at that instant in time for such a tragic moment as one life ended and then that they would both go off again into that infinite oblivion of life jennsens heart pounded in her ears as she listened to his footsteps crunching across the jagged gravel watched his long strides carrying him away with a sense of urgency she debated what she should do was she always to turn away from people to hide was she always to forfeit even small snatches of what it was to live life because of a crime she did not commit dare she risk this she knew what her mother would say but her mother loved her dearly and so would not say it out of cruelty sebastian he looked back over his shoulder waiting for her to speak if you dont have shelter you may not live to see tomorrow i wouldnt like it if i knew you were out here with a fever getting soaked to the skin he stood watching her the drizzle drifting between them i wouldnt like that either ill mind your words and do my best to find some shelter before he could turn away again she lifted her hand gesturing off in the other direction she saw that her fingers were trembling you could come home with me would your mother mind her mother would be in a panic her mother would never allow a stranger despite what help he had been to sleep in the house her mother wouldnt sleep a wink all night with a stranger anywhere near but if sebastian stayed out with a fever he could die jennsens mother would not wish that on this man her mother had a kind heart that loving concern not malice was the reason she was so protective of jennsen the house is small but theres room in the cave where we keep the animals if you wouldnt mind you could sleep there its not as bad as it sounds ive slept there myself on occasion when the house felt too confining id make you a fire near the entrance youd be warm and could get the rest you need he looked reluctant jennsen held up her stringer of fish we could feed you she said sweetening the offer you would at least have a good meal along with a warrn rest i think you need both you helped me let me help you his smile one of gratitude returned youre a kind woman jennsen if your mother will allow it i will accept your offer she lifted her cloak open displaying the fine knife in its sheath which she had tucked behind her belt well offer her the knife she will value it his smile warm and suddenly lighthearted with amusement was as pleasant a smile as jennsen had ever seen i dont think two knifewielding women need lose any sleep over a stranger with a fever that was jennsens thought but she didnt admit it she hoped her mother would see it that way too its settled then come along before the rain catches us out sebastian trotted to catch up with her as she started out she lifted the pack from his hand and shouldered it with his own pack and his new weapons he had enough to carry in his weakened condition chapter wait here jennsen said in a low voice ill go tell her that we have a guest sebastian dropped heavily onto a low projection of rock that made a convenient seat you just tell her what i said that ill understand if she doesnt want a stranger spending the night at your place i know it wouldnt be an unreasonable fear jennsen considered him with a calm and somber demeanor my mother and i have reason not to fear a visitor she was not alluding to common weapons and by her tone he knew it for the first time since she had met him she saw a spark of uncertainty in sebastians steady blue eyesa shadow of uneasiness not elicited by her expertise with a knife a hint of a smile came in turn to jennsens lips as she watched him considering what manner of dark danger she might represent dont worry only those bringing trouble would have cause to fear being here he lifted his hands in a gesture of surrender then im as safe as a babe in his mothers arms jennsen left sebastian to wait on the rock while she made her way up the winding path through sheltering spruce using twisted roots as steps up toward her house set back in a clutch of oak on a small shelf in the side of a mountain the flat patch of grassy ground was on a better day a sunny open spot among the towering old trees there was room enough to yard their goat along with some ducks and chickens steep rock to the back prevented any visitors happening upon them from that direction only the path up the front provided an approach should they be threatened jennsen and her mother had constructed a wellhidden set of footholds up the back to a narrow ledge and out a twisting side way via deer paths that would take them through a ravine and away the escape route was nearly inaccessible as a way in unless you knew the precise course through the maze of rock walls fissures and narrow ledges and even then they had made certain that key passages were well hidden by strategically placing deadwood and brush theyd planted ever since jennsen was young they had moved often never staying in one place too long here though where they felt safe they had stayed for over two years travelers had never discovered their mountain hideaway as sometimes had happened in other places they had stayed and the people in briarton the nearest town never ventured this far into such a dark and forbidding wood the seldomused trail around the lake from where the soldier had fallen was as close as any trail came to them jennsen and her mother had gone into briarton only once it was unlikely that anyone even knew they were living out in the vast trackless mountains far from any farmland or city except for the chance encounter with sebastian down closer to the lake theyd never seen anyone near their place this was the most secure spot she and her mother had ever had and so jennsen had dared to begin to think of it as home since she was six jennsen had been hunted as careful as her mother always was several times they had come frighteningly close to being snared he was no ordinary man the one who hunted her he was not bound by ordinary means of searching for all jennsen knew the owl watching her from a high limb as she made her way up the rocky path could be his eyes watching her just as jennsen reached the house she met her mother throwing her cloak around her shoulders as she came out the door she was the same height as jennsen with the same thick hair to just past her shoulders but more auburn than red she was not yet thirtyfive and the prettiest woman jennsen had ever seen with a figure the creator himself would marvel at in different circumstances her mothers life would have been one of countless suitors some no doubt willing to offer a kings ransom for her hand her mothers heart though was as loving and beautiful as her face and she had given up everything to protect her daughter when jennsen sometimes felt sorry for herself for the normal things in life that she couldnt have she would then think of her mother who had willingly given up all those same things and more for the sake of her daughter her mother was as close as it came to a guardian spirit in the flesh jennsen her mother rushed to her and seized her shoulders oh jenn i was starting to worry so where have you been i was just coming to look for you i thought you must have had some trouble and i was i did mother jennsen confided her mother paused only momentarily then without further question she embraced jennsen in protective arms after such a frightening day jennsen openly welcomed the balm of her mothers hug finally with a comforting arm encircling jennsens shoulders her mother urged her toward the door come inside and get yourself dry i see you have quite the catch well have a good dinner and you can tell me jennsen was dragging her feet mother i have someone with me her mother halted suddenly searching her daughters face for any outward sign of the nature and depth of the trouble what do you mean who would you have with you jennsen flicked a hand back toward the path hes waiting down there i told him to wait i told him id ask you if he could sleep in the cave with the animals what stay here jenn what were you thinking we cant mother please listen to me something terrible happened today sebastian sebastian jennsen nodded the man i brought with me sebastian helped me i came across a soldier who fell from the paththe high trail around the lake her mothers face went ashen she said nothing jennsen took a calming breath and started again i found a dharan soldier dead in the gorge below the high trail there were no other tracksi looked he was an extraordinarily big soldier and he was heavily armed battleaxe sword at his hip sword strapped over his shoulder her mother canted her head with an admonishing expression what arent you telling me jenn jennsen wanted to hold it back until she explained sebastian first but her mother could read it in her eyes hear it in her voice the terrible threat of that piece of paper with the two words on it seemed almost to be screaming its presence from her pocket mother please let me tell it my way her mother cupped a hand to the side of jennsens face tell me then your way if you must i was searching the soldier looking for anything important and i found something but then this man a traveler came upon me im sorry mother i was frightened by the soldier being there and by what i found and i wasnt paying attention as i should have i know i behaved foolishly her mother smiled no baby we all have lapses none of us can be perfect we all sometimes make mistakes that doesnt make you foolish dont say that about yourself well i felt foolish when he said something and i turned around and there he was i had my knife out though her mother was nodding with a smile of approval he saw then that the man had fallen to his death hesebastian thats his namehe said that if we just left him there then more likely than not other soldiers would find him and start questioning us all and maybe blame us for their fellow soldier being dead this man sebastian sounds like he knows what hes talking about i thought so too i had intended to cover the dead soldier to try to hide him but he was bigi could never have dragged him over to a cranny by myself sebastian offered to help me bury the body together we were able to drag him over and roll him into a deep split in the rock we covered him over good sebastian put some heavy rocks atop the gravel i scooped in no one will find him her mother looked more relieved that was wise before we buried him sebastian thought we should take anything valuable rather than let it go to waste in the ground one eyebrow arched did he now jennsen nodded she pulled the money from her pocket the pocket that didnt have the piece of paper in it she dumped all the money in her mothers hand sebastian insisted that i take it all theres gold marks there he didnt want any for himself her mother took in the fortune in her hand then glanced briefly to the trail where sebastian waited she leaned closer jenn if he came with you then perhaps he thinks he can have the money back at any time of his choosing that would give him the opportunity to look generous and win your trustand still be near enough to end up with the money when he chooses i considered that too her mothers tone softened sympathetically jenn its not your faultive kept you so shelteredbut you just dont know how men can be jennsen let her gaze drop from her mothers knowing eyes i suppose it could be true but i dont think so and why not jennsen looked back up more intently this time he has a fever mother hes not well he was leaving without asking to come with me at all he bid me a goodbye as tired and feverish as he is i feared hed die out in the rain tonight i stopped him told him that if it was all right with you he could sleep in the cave with the animals where he could at least be dry and warm after a moment of silence jennsen added he said that if you dont want a stranger near he will understand and be on his way did he well jenn this man is either very honest or very clever she fixed jennsen with an intent look which do you think it is hmm jennsen twined her fingers together i dont know mother i honestly dont i wondered the same things as youi really did she remembered then he said that he wanted you to have this so you wouldnt have to fear a stranger sleeping nearby jennsen drew the knife in its sheath from behind her belt and held it out to her mother the silver handle gleamed in the dim yellow light coming from the small window behind her mother staring in astonishment her mother slowly lifted the weapon in both hands as she whispered dear spirits i know jennsen said i nearly yelped in fright when i saw it sebastian said that this was a fine weapon too fine to bury and he wanted me to keep it he kept the soldiers short sword and axe for himself i told him i would give this to you he said that he hoped it would help you feel safe her mother slowly shook her head this does not make me feel safe at allknowing that a man carrying this was near us jenn i dont like that one bit not one bit her mothers eyes showed that she was on to worries bigger than the man jennsen had brought home with her mother sebastian is sick can he stay in the cave i led him to believe that he has more to fear from us than we from him her mother glanced up with a sly smile good girl they both knew that in order to survive they had to work as a team with wellpracticed roles they fell into without the need for formal discussion she let out a sigh then as if with the burden of knowing all the things her daughter was missing in life she ran a hand tenderly down jennsens hair letting it come to rest on her shoulder all right baby she said at last well let him stay the night and feed him i told him he would have a hot meal for helping me her mothers warm smile widened and a meal then she drew the blade from its sheath finally she gave it a critical appraisal turning it this way and that inspecting its design she tested the edge and then the weight she spun it between her slender fingers to get the feel of it the balance at last she held it in her open palm contemplating the ornate letter r jennsen could not imagine what terrible thoughtsand memoriesmust be going through her mothers mind as she silently considered the emblem representing the house of rahl dear spirits her mother whispered again to herself jennsen didnt say anything she entirely understood it was an ugly evil thing mother jennsen whispered when her mother had looked at the handle for an eternity its almost dark may i go get sebastian and take him back to the cave her mother slid the blade home into its sheath looking to put a panorama of painful memories away with it yes i suppose you had better go get him take him to the cave make a fire for him ill cook some fish and bring some herbs along to help him sleep with his fever wait there with him until i come out keep your eye on him we will eat with him out there i dont want him in the house jennsen nodded she touched her mothers arm halting her before she could go into the house jennsen had one more thing to tell her mother she dearly wished she didnt have to she didnt want to bring her mother such a worry but she had to mother she said in a voice barely above a whisper we are going to need to go from this place her mother looked startled i found something on the dharan soldier jennsen pulled the piece of paper from her pocket unfolded it and held it out in her open palm her mothers gaze took in the two words on the paper dear spirits was all she said was all she was able to say she turned and looked at the house taking it all in her eyes suddenly brimming with tears jennsen knew that her mother had come to think of it as home too dear spirits her mother whispered to herself again at a loss for anything more jennsen thought the weight of it might overcome her and her mother might break down in helpless tears that was what jennsen wanted to do neither did her mother wiped a finger under each eye as she looked back at jennsen and then she did cryone brief inhalation of a gasping sob of hopelessness im so sorry baby it broke jennsens heart to see her mother in such anguish everything that jennsen had missed in life her mother had missed twice over once for herself and once for her daughter on top of it her mother had to be strong well leave at first light her mother said in simple pronouncement traveling at night and in the rain will serve us ill well have to find a new place to hide hes getting too close to this one jennsens own eyes overflowed with tears and her voice came only with great difficulty im so sorry mama that im such trouble her tears flooded forth in a painful torrent she crushed the piece of paper as her hands fisted im so sorry mama i wish you could be free of me her mother caught her up in her arms then cradling jennsens head to a shoulder as she wept no no baby dont ever say that youre my light my life this trouble is caused by others dont you ever wear a cloak of guilt because they are evil youre my wonderful life i would give everything else up a thousand times over for you and then once again and be joyous to do so jennsen was glad that she would never have any children for she knew she didnt have her mothers strength she held on for dear life to the only person in the world who was a comfort to her but then she pushed away from her mothers embrace mama sebastian is from far away he told me he said that hes from beyond dhara there are other placesother lands he knows of them isnt that wonderful there is a place that isnt dhara but those places are beyond barriers and boundaries that cant be crossed then how can he be here it must be so otherwise he could not have traveled here and sebastian is from one of these other lands to the south he said the south i dont see how it could be possible are you sure thats what he said yes jennsen added a firm nod of confirmation he said the south he only mentioned it casually im not sure how its possible but what if it is mother maybe he could guide us there maybe if we asked he would guide us out of this nightmare land as levelheaded as her mother was jennsen could see that she was considering this wild idea it wasnt crazyher mother was thinking it over so it couldnt be crazy jennsen was suddenly filled with a sense of hope that maybe she had come up with something that would save them why would he do this for us i dont know i dont even know if he would consider it or what he would want in return i didnt ask him i didnt dare even to mention it until i talked to you first thats part of why i wanted him to stay hereso you could question him i feared to lose this chance to discover if it really is possible her mother looked around again at the house it was tiny only one room and it was nothing fancy built from logs and wood they had shaped themselves but it was warm and snug and dry it was frightening to contemplate striking out in the dead of winter the alternative of being caught though was far worse lennsen knew what would happen if they were caught death would not come swiftly if they were caught death would come only after endless torture at last her mother gathered herself and spoke thats good thinking jenn i dont know if anything can come of such an idea but well talk to sebastian and see one thing is for sure we have to leave we dare not delay until springnot if theyre this close well leave at dawn mother where will we go this time if sebastian wont lead us away from dhara her mother smiled baby the world is a big place we are only two small people we will simply vanish again i know its hard but were together it will be fine well see some new sights now wont we some more of the world now go get sebastian and take him to the cave ill get started on dinner well all need to have a good meal jennsen quickly kissed her mothers cheek before racing down the trail the rain was starting and it was so gloomy among the trees that she could hardly see the trees were all huge dharan soldiers to her broad powerful grim she knew she would have nightmares after seeing a real dharan soldier up close sebastian was still sitting on the rock waiting he stood as she rushed up to him my mother said it was all right for you to sleep in the cave with the animals shes started on cooking up the fish for us she wants to meet you he looked too tired to be happy but he managed to show her a small smile jennsen seized his wrist and urged him to follow her he was already shivering with the wet his arm was warm though fever was like that she knew you shivered even though you were burning up but with some food and herbs and a good nights rest she was sure he would soon be well what she wasnt sure of was if he would help them chapter betty their brown goat watched attentively from her pen occasionally voicing her displeasure at sharing her home as jennsen quickly collected straw to the side for the stranger in bettys sanctuary bleating her distress betty finally quieted when jennsen affectionately scratched the nervous goats ears patted the wiry hair covering her round middle and then gave her half a carrot from the stash up on a high ledge bettys short upright tail wagged furiously sebastian shed his cloak and pack but kept on the belt with his new weapons he unstrapped his bedroll from under his pack and spread it out over the mat of straw despite jennsens urging he wouldnt lie down and rest while she knelt near the caves entrance and prepared the fire pit as he helped her stack dry kindling she could see by the dim light coming from the window of the house on the other side of the clearing that sweat beaded his face he repeatedly scraped his knife down the length of a branch swiftly building a clump of fluffy fibers he struck a steel to flint several times sending sparks through the darkness into the tinder hed made he cupped the fluff in his hands and with gentle puffs of breath nursed the slow flames until they strengthened then placed the burning tinder beneath the kindling where the flames quickly grew and popped to life among the dry twigs the branches released a pleasing fragrance of balsam as they caught flame jennsen had been planning on running to the house not far off to get some hot coals to start the fire but he had it going before she could even suggest it by the way he trembled she imagined he was impatient for heat even though he was burning with fever she could smell the aroma of the frying fish coming from the house and when the wind among the pine boughs died from time to time she could hear the sizzle the chickens retreated from the growing light into the deep shadows at the back of the cave bettys ears stood at attention as she watched jennsen for any signs that another carrot might be forthcoming her tail wagged in hopeful fits the opening in the mountain was simply a place where in some distant age past a slab of rock had tumbled out like some giant granite tooth come loose to plunge down the slope and leave a dry socket behind now trees below grew among a collection of such fallen boulders the cave only ran back about twenty feet but the overhang of rock at the entrance further sheltered it and helped keep it dry jennsen was tall but the ceiling of the cave was high enough that she could stand in most of it and since sebastian was only a little taller than she his spikes of snow white hair now a mellow orange in the firelight didnt brush the top as he went to the back to collect some of the dry wood stacked there the chickens squawked at being bothered but then quickly settled back down jennsen squatted on the opposite side of the fire from sebastian with her back to the rain that had started so she could see his face in the firelight as they both warmed their hands in the heat of the crackling flames after a day in the frigid damp weather the fires warmth felt luxurious she knew that sooner or later winter would return with a vengeance as cold and uncomfortable as it was now it would get worse she tried not to think about having to leave their snug home especially at this time of year she had known from the first instant she saw the piece of paper though that they might are you hungry she asked starving he said looking as eager for the fish as betty was for a carrot the wonderful smells were making her stomach grumble too thats good my mother always says that if youre ill and you have an appetite then it cant be too serious ill be fine in a day or two a rest will do you good jennsen drew her knife from its sheath at her belt weve never allowed anyone to stay here before you will understand that we will be taking precautions she could see in his eyes that he didnt know what she was talking about but he shrugged his understanding of her prudence jennsens knife wasnt anything like the fine weapon the soldier had been carrying they could afford nothing like that knife hers had a simple handle made of antler and the blade wasnt thick but she kept its edge razor sharp jennsen used the blade to slice a shallow cut across the inside of her forearm with a frown sebastian started to rise to voice a protest her challenging glare stopped him cold before he was halfway up he sank back down and watched with growing concern as she wiped the sides of the blade through the crimson beads of blood welling up from the cut she very deliberately looked him in the eye again before turning her back on him and moving out closer to the edge of the cave where the rain dampened the ground with the knife wetted in blood jennsen first drew a large circle feeling sebastians eyes on her she next pulled the tip of the bloody blade through the damp earth in straight lines to make a square its comers just touching the inside of the circle with hardly a pause she drew a smaller circle that touched the insides of the square as she worked she mummured prayers under her breath asking the good spirits to guide her hand it seemed the right thing to do she knew that sebastian could hear her soft singsong but not make out the words it occurred unexpectedly to her that it must be something like the voices she heard in her own head sometimes when she drew the outer circle she heard the whisper of that dead voice call her name opening her eyes from the prayer she drew an eightpointed star its rays piercing all the way through the inner circle the square and then the outer circle every other ray bisected a comer of the square the rays were said to represent the gift of the creator so as she drew the eightpointed star jennsen always whispered a prayer of thanks for the gift of her mother when she finished and looked up her mother was standing before her as if she had risen from the shadows or materialized from the edge of the drawing itself to be lit by the leaping flames of the fire behind jennsen in the light of those flames her mother was like a vision of some impossibly beautiful spirit do you know what this drawing represents young man jennsens mother asked in a voice hardly more than a whisper sebastian stared up at her the way people often stared when they first saw her and shook his head its called a grace they have been drawn by those with the gift of magic for thousands of yearssome say since the dawn of creation itself the outer circle represents the beginning of the eternity of the underworld the keepers world of the dead the inner circle is the extent of the world of life the square represents the veil that separates both worlds life from death it touches both at times the star is the light of the gift from the creator himselfmagicextending through life and crossing over into the world of the dead the fire crackled and hissed as jennsens mother like some spectral figure towered over the two of them sebastian said nothing her mother had spoken the truth but it was truth used to convey a specific impression that was not true my daughter has drawn this grace as protection for you as you rest this night and as protection for us there is another before the door to the house she let the silence drag before adding it would be unwise to cross either without our consent i understand mrs daggett in the firelight his face showed no emotion his blue eyes turned to jennsen a hint of a smile came to his lips even though his expression remained serious you are a surprising woman jennsen daggett a woman of many mysteries i will sleep safely tonight and well jennsens mother said besides the dinner i brought some herbs to help you sleep her mother holding the bowl full of fried fish in one hand collected jennsen with a hand on her shoulder and guided her around to the back of the fire to sit beside her on the opposite side of her from sebastian by the sober look on his face their demonstration had had the desired effect her mother glanced at jennsen and gave her a smile sebastian couldnt see jennsen had done well holding the bowl out her mother offered sebastian some fish saying i would like to thank you young man for the help you gave jennsen today sebastian please so jennsen has told me i was glad to help it was helping myself too really id not like to have dharan soldiers chasing me she pointed if you would accept it this one on top is coated with the herbs that will help you sleep he used his knife to stab the darker piece of fish coated in the herbs jennsen took another on her own knife after first wiping the blade clean on her skirts jennsen tells me that you are from outside dhara he glanced up as he chewed thats right i find that hard to believe dhara is bordered by impassable boundaries in my lifetime no one has been able to come into or leave dhara how is it possible then that you have with his teeth sebastian pulled the chunk of herbcoated fish off his knife he inhaled between his teeth to cool the bite he gestured around with the blade as he chewed how long have you been out here alone in this great wood without seeing people without news several years oh well then i guess it makes sense that you wouldnt know but since youve been out here the barriers have come down jennsen and her mother both took in this staggering nearly incomprehensible news in silence in that silence they both dared to begin to imagine the heady possibilities for the first time in jennsens life escape seemed conceivable the impossible dream of a life of their own suddenly seemed only a journey away they had been traveling and hiding their whole life now it seemed the journey might at last be near the end sebastian jennsens mother said why did you help jennsen today i like to help people she needed help i could tell how much that man scared her even though he was dead he smiled at jennsen she looked nice i wanted to help her besides he finally admitted i dont much care for dharan soldiers when she gestured by lifting the bowl toward him he stabbed another piece of fish mrs daggett im liable to fall asleep before long why dont you just tell me whats on your mind we are hunted by dharan soldiers why thats a story for another night depending on the outcome of this night you may yet learn it but for now all that really matters is that we are huntedjennsen more so than me if the dharan soldiers catch us she will be murdered her mother made it sound simple he would not let it be so simple it would be much more grisly than any mere murder death would be a reward gained only after inconceivable agony and endless begging sebastian glanced over at jennsen id not like that then we three are of a single mind her mother murmured thats why the two of you are good friends with those knives you keep at hand he said thats why her mother confirmed so sebastian said you fear the dharan soldiers finding you dharan soldiers arent exactly a rarity the one today gave you both a scare what makes you both fear this one today so much jennsen added a stout stick to the fire glad to have her mother to do the talking betty bleated for a carrot or at least attention the chickens grumbled about the noise and light jennsen her mother said show sebastian the piece of paper you found on the dharan soldier taken aback jennsen waited until her mothers eyes turned her way they shared a look that told jennsen her mother was determined to take this chance and if she was to try then they had to at least tell him some of it jennsen drew the crumpled piece of paper from her pocket and handed it past her mother to sebastian i found this in that dharan soldiers pocket she swallowed at the ghastly memory of seeing a dead person just before you showed up sebastian pulled the crumpled paper open smoothing it between a thumb and finger as he cast them both a suspicious look he turned the paper toward the firelight so he could see the two words jennsen lindie he said reading it from the piece of paper i dont get it whos jennsen lindie me jennsen said at least it was for a while for a while i dont understand that was my name jennsen said the name i used anyway a few years back when we lived far to the north we move around oftento keep from being caught we change our name each time so it will be harder to track us then daggett is not a real name either no well what is your real name then that too is part of the story for another night her mothers tone said that she didnt mean to discuss it what matters is that the soldier today had that name that can only mean the worst but you said its a name you no longer use you use a different name here daggett no one here knows you by that name lindie her mother leaned toward sebastian jennsen knew her mother was giving him a look that he would find uncomfortable her mother had a way of making people nervous when she fixed them with that intent penetrating gaze of hers it may no longer be our name a name we used only far to the north but he had that name written down and he was here mere miles from where we are now that means he has somehow connected that name with uswith two women somewhere up in this remote place somehow he connected it or more precisely the man who hunts us connected it and sent him after us now they search for us here sebastian broke her gaze and took a thoughtful breath i see what you mean he went back to eating the piece of fish skewered on the point of his knife that dead soldier would have others with him her mother said by burying him you bought us time they wont know what happened to him we have that much luck we are still a few steps ahead of them we must use our advantage to get away before they tighten the noose we will have to leave in the morning are you sure he gestured around with his knife you have a life here your lives are remote hiddeni would never have found you had i not seen jennsen with that dead soldier how could they find you you have a house a good place life is the word that matters in all that you said i know the man who hunts us he has thousands of years of bloody heritage as guidance in hunting us he will not rest if we stay sooner or later he will find us here we must escape while we can she pulled from her belt the exquisite knife jennsen had brought her from the dead dharan soldier still in its sheath she spun it in her fingers presenting it hilt first to sebastian this letter r on the hilt stands for the house of rahl our hunter he would only have presented a weapon this fine to a very special soldier i dont want a weapon which has been presented by that evil man sebastian glanced down at the knife tendered but didnt take it he gave them both a look that unexpectedly chilled jennsen to the bone it was a look that burned with ruthless determination where i come from we believe in using what is closest to an enemy or what comes from him as a weapon against him jennsen had never heard such a sentiment her mother didnt move the knife still lay in her hand i dont do you choose to use what he has inadvertently given you and turn it against him or do you choose instead to be a victim what do you mean why dont you kill him jennsens jaw dropped her mother seemed less astonished we cant she insisted hes a powerful man he is protected by countless people from simple soldiers to soldiers of great skill at killinglike the one you buried todayto people with the gift who can call upon magic we are but two simple women sebastian was not moved by her plea he wont stop until he kills you he lifted the piece of paper watching her eyes take it in this proves it he will never stop why dont you kill him before he kills youkills your daughter or will you choose to be corpses he has yet to collect her mothers voice heated and how do you propose we kill the lord rahl sebastian stabbed another piece of fish for starters you should keep the knife its a weapon superior to the one you carry use what is his to fight him your sentimental objection to taking it only serves him not youor jennsen her mother sat still as stone jennsen had never heard anyone talk like this his words had a way of making her see things differently than she ever had before i must admit that what you say makes sense her mother said her voice came softly and laced with pain or perhaps regret you have opened my eyes a little anyway i dont agree with you that we should try to kill him for i know him all too well such an attempt would be simple suicide at best or accomplish his goal at worst but i will keep the knife and use it to defend myself and my daughter thank you sebastian for speaking sense when i didnt want to hear it im glad youre keeping the knife at least sebastian pulled the bite of fish off his own knife i hope it can help you with the back of his hand he wiped the sweat from his brow if you dont want to try to kill him in order to save yourself then what do you propose to do keep running you say the barriers are down i propose to leave dhara we will try to make it to another land where darken rahl cannot hunt us sebastian looked up as he stabbed another piece of fish darken rahl darken rahl is dead jennsen having run from the man since she was little having awakened countless times from nightmares of his blue eyes watching her from every shadow or of him leaping out to snatch her when her feet wouldnt move fast enough having lived every day wondering if this was the day he would finally catch her having imagined a thousand times and then another thousand what terrible brutal torturous things he would do to her having prayed to the good spirits every day for deliverance from her merciless hunter and his implacable minions was thunderstruck she realized only then that she had always thought of the man as next to immortal as immortal as evil itself darken rahl dead it cant be jennsen said as tears of deliverance welled up and ran down her cheeks she was filled with a wild heartpounding sense of expectant hope and at the same time an inexplicable shadow of dark dread sebastian nodded its true about two years ago from what i heard jennsen gave voice to the hope then he is no longer the threat we thought she paused but if darken rahl is dead darken rahls son is lord rahl now sebastian said his son jermsen felt her hope being eclipsed by that dark dread the lord rahl hunts us her mother said her voice calm and enduring betraying no evidence of even a moment of exalted hope the lord rahl is the lord rahl it is now as it has always been as it will always be as immortal as evil itself richard rahl sebastian put in hes the lord rahl now richard rahl so now jermsen knew her hunters new name a terrifying thought washed over her she had never before heard the voice say anything more than surrender and her name and occasionally those strange foreign words she didnt understand now it demanded she surrender her flesh her very will if it was the voice of the one who hunted her as her mother said then this new lord rahl must be even more terrifyingly powerful than his wicked father fleeting salvation had left behind grim despair this man richard rahl her mother said searching for understanding amid all the startling news he ascended to rule as the lord rahl of dhara when his father died then sebastian leaned forward a cloaked rage unexpectedly surfacing in his blue eyes richard rahl became the lord rahl of dhara when he murdered his father and seized rule and if you are next going to suggest that perhaps the son is less of a threat than his father then let me set you straight richard rahl is the one who brought down the barriers at that jennsen threw up her hands in confusion but that would only give those who wish to be free their opening to escape dhara to escape him no he brought those ancient protective barriers down so he could extend his tyrannical rule to the lands that were beyond the reach of even his father sebastian thumped his chest once with a tight fist my land he wants lord rahl is a madman dhara is not enough for him to rule he lusts to dominate the entire world jennsens mother stared off into the flames looking dispirited i always thoughthoped i guessthat if darken rahl were dead then maybe we might have a chance the piece of paper jennsen found today with her name on it now tells me that the son is even more dangerous than his father and that i was only deluding myself even darken rahl never got this close to us jennsen felt numb after having been rocked by a turbulent swing of emotions only to be left more terrified and hopeless than before but seeing such despair on her mothers face wounded her heart i will keep the knife her mothers decision said how much she feared the new lord rahl and how frightful was their plight good dim light coming from the house reflected off the swollen pools of water standing beyond the cave entrance but the droning rain churned the light into thousands of sparkles like the tears of the good spirits themselves in a day or two the collection of ponds would be ice traveling would be easier in that cold than in cold rain sebastian jennsen asked do you think well do you think we could escape dhara maybe go to your homeland escape the reach of this monster sebastian shrugged maybe but until this madman is killed will there be anywhere beyond his ravenous reach her mother tucked the exquisite knife behind her belt and then folded her fingers together around one bent knee thank you sebastian youve helped us being in hiding has regrettably kept us in the dark youve at least brought us a bit of light sorry it wasnt better news the truth is the truth it helps us know what to do her mother smiled at her jennsen always was one who sought to know the truth of things ive never kept it from her truth is the only means of survival its as simple as that if you dont want to try to kill him in order to eliminate the threat maybe you can think of some way to make the new lord rahl lose interest in youin jennsen jennsens mother shook her head there are more things involved than we can tell you tonightthings you are in the dark about because of them he will never rest never stop you dont understand the lengths to which the lord rahlany lord rahlwill go in order to kill jennsen if thats so then perhaps youre right maybe the two of you should run and would you help ushelp herto get away from dhara he looked from one of them to the other if i can i guess i could try but im telling you there is no place to hide if you ever want to be free youll have to kill him im no assassin jennsen said not so much out of protest as out of acceptance of her own frailty in the face of such brutal strength i want to live but i just dont have the nature to be an assassin i will defend myself but i dont think i could effectively set out to kill someone the sad fact is i just wouldnt be any good at it hes a killer by birth im not sebastian met her gaze with an icy look his white hair cast red by the firelight framed cold blue eyes youd be surprised what a person can do if they have the proper motivation her mother lifted a hand to halt such talk she was a practical woman not given to wasting valuable time on wild schemes right now the important thing is for us to get away lord rahls minions are too close thats the simple truth of it from the description and this knife the dead man you found today was probably part of a quad sebastian looked up with a frown a what a team of four assassins on occasion several quads will work togetherif the target has proven particularly elusive or is of inestimable worth jennsen is both sebastian rested an arm over his knee for someone on the run and in hiding all these years you seem to know a lot about these quads are you sure youre right firelight danced in her mothers eyes her voice turned more distant when i was young i used to live at the peoples palace i used to see those men the quads darken rahl used them to hunt people they are ruthless beyond anything you could imagine sebastian looked uneasy well i guess you would know better than i in the morning then we leave he yawned as he stretched your herbs are already working and this fever has exhausted me after a good nights sleep ill help you both get away from here away from dhara and on your way to the old world if thats your wish it is her mother stood you two eat the rest of the fish as she moved past her loving fingers trailed along the back of jennsens head im going to go collect some of our things get together what we can carry ill be right in jennsen said soon as i bank the fire chapter the rain was getting worse runoff ran in a rippled sheet over the ledge at the brow of the cave jennsen scratched betty behind her ears to try to stop her bleating the always nervous goat was suddenly inconsolable perhaps she sensed that they were going to be leaving maybe she was just unhappy that jennsens mother had gone into the house betty loved that woman and would often follow her around the yard like a puppy betty would be only too happy to sleep in the house with them both if they would let her sebastian having had his fill of fish rolled himself in his cloak his eyelids drooped as he tried to watch her bank the fire he lifted his head and frowned over at the pacing goat betty will settle down when i go in the house jennsen told him sebastian already half asleep mumbled something about betty that jennsen couldnt even begin to hear over the noise of the rain she knew it wasnt important enough to ask him to repeat it he needed sleep she yawned despite her anxiety over everything that had happened that day and her worry about what the next would bring the din of the downpour was making her sleepy too as much as she ached to ask him about what was beyond dhara she bid him a good nights sleep even though she doubted that he heard her over the rain she would have time enough to ask him all her questions her mother would be waiting for help with selecting what to take and packing it they didnt have much but they would have to leave some of what they had at least the clumsy dead dharan soldier had provided them with money just when they would need it most it was enough money to buy horses and supplies that would help them get out of dhara the new lord rahl the bastard son of a bastard son in an unbroken long line of bastard sons had inadvertently provided them with the means to escape his grasp life was so precious she just wanted her and her mother to be able to live their own lives somewhere over the distant dark horizon lay their new lives jennsen threw her cloak around her shoulders she pulled the hood up to protect herself from the rain but as hard as it was coming down she expected she was likely to get wet on the run to the house she hoped the morning would dawn clear for their first day of travel so they could put distance between them and their pursuers she was pleased to see that sebastian looked dead to the world he needed a good sleep she was thankful that amid all the torment and injustice at least he had come into their lives jennsen picked up the bowl with the few remaining pieces of fish tucked it under her cloak held her breath and lowering her head against the onslaught dove into the roaring rain the cold shock of the downpour made her gasp as she splashed through the dark puddles on her dash to the house she made the house her wet lashes turning the dim light of the oil lamps and firelight coming through the window to a blinking blur without looking up she threw the door open as she ran in its cold as the keepers heart she called out to her mother as she raced in jennsens breath left her lungs in a grunt as she crashed into a solid wall that had never been there before rebounding from the collision she looked up to see a broad back turning to see a huge hand snatching for her the hand caught only her cloak the heavy wool cloak stripped away from her as she fell back the bowl thudded to the floor spinning like a crazy top the door bounced back from hitting the wall banging closed behind her trapping her just before her back slammed into it gasping jennsen reacted it was wild instinct not deliberate thought jennsen terror not technique surrender desperation not design the mans blocky face was clearly lit by the fire from the hearth he plunged toward her a monster with stringy wet hair straining sinew and muscle twisted in rage the knife in her fist whipped around powered by stark terror her cry was a growl of panicked effort her knife slammed into the side of his head the blade snapped at midlength as it hit his cheekbone his head twisted from the impact blood splashed across his face swinging madly his meaty hand walloped her face her shoulder hit the wall a shock of pain lanced her arm she stumbled on something thrown off balance she tumbled past her footing her face smacked the floor beside another of the huge men he was like the dead soldier she had buried her mind grasped at snatches of what she was seeing trying to make sense of it where did they come from how were they in her house her leg was draped over the mans still legs she pushed herself up he was slumped against the wall his dead eyes stared at her the handle with the ornate r sideways below his ear reflected sparkles of firelight the point of the knife jutted from the other side of his bull neck he wore a wet red shirt surrender with cold fright she saw a man coming for her gripping her broken knife she scrambled to her feet turning toward the threat she saw her mother on the floor a man held her by the hair there was blood everywhere nothing seemed real in a nightmare vision jennsen saw her mothers severed arm on the floor fingers slack and open red stab wounds jennsen panic ruled her mind she heard her own short choppy screams wet blood splashed across the floor glistened in the firelight whirling movement a man slammed into her driving her to the wall she lost her breath pain crushed her chest surrender no her own voice seemed unreal she slashed with her broken knife ripping the mans arm he bellowed a vile oath the man holding jennsens mother dropped her and made for jennsen she stabbed wildly frantically at the men around her reaching hands shot toward her from all around a huge hand clamped her thrashing knife arm surrender jennsen gasped a cry she struggled savagely she kicked she bit men cursed the second man seized her throat in iron fingers no breath no breath she triedcouldnt breathetried desperatelybut couldnt draw a breath he sneered as he squeezed her throat pain shot up through her temples his cheek slashed by her knife laid open from ear to mouth ran with gouts of blood she could see glistening red teeth through the gaping wound jennsen struggled but couldnt pull a breath a fist slammed her stomach she kicked him he seized her ankle before she could kick him again one was dead two had her her mother down her vision was narrowing to a black tunnel her chest burned it hurt so much so much sound was muffled she heard a bonejarring thunk the man in front of her squeezing her throat staggered once as his head jerked it made no sense to her his grip went slack she gasped an urgent breath his head tipped forward a crescentbladed axe was embedded in the back of the mans neck severing his spine the axe handle swung in an arc as he dropped sebastian measured fury with white hair stood behind him the last man let go of her arm his other fist brought up a bloodslick sword sebastian was quicker than the man jennsen was quicker even than sebastian surrender she cried out an animal sound savage unbridled terror and fury her broken blade slashed across the side of the mans neck her half blade ripped bonedeep cut the artery severed muscles he cried out blood seemed to float suspended in midair as the man pitched against the far wall on his way down shed swung so hard she fell sprawling with him sebastians short sword struck like lightning slamming through the great barrel chest with bonecracking power jennsen scrambled over the bodies slipping on blood she saw only her mother on the floor half sitting leaning against the far wall her mother watched her come jennsen couldnt stop screaming couldnt breathe through her hysterical cries her mother covered in blood eyelids half closed looked as if she were falling asleep but she had that spark of joy at seeing jennsen always that spark in her eyes her face had bloody streaks from big fingers down the side she smiled her beautiful smile at seeing jennsen baby she whispered jennsen couldnt make herself stop screaming shaking she didnt look down at the awful red wounds she saw only her mothers face mama mama mama one arm embraced her her other was gone her knife arm gone the one around jennsen was love and comfort and shelter her mother smiled a weary smile baby you did good now listen to me sebastian was there working frantically to tie something around what was left of her mothers right arm trying to stem the tide of blood her mother only saw jennsen im here mama everything will be fine im here mamadont dieaont die hold on mama hold on listen her voice was hardly more than a breath im listening mama jennsen cried im listening im gone im crossing to be with the good spirits now no mama no please no cant help it baby its all right the good spirits will take good care of me jennsen held her mothers face in both hands trying to see it through the helpless flood of tears jennsen gasped with frantic sobs mama dont leave me alone dont leave me please oh please dont oh mama i love you love you baby more than anything ive taught you all i can listen now jennsen nodded fearing to miss a single precious word the good spirits are taking me you must understand that when i go this body wont be me any longer understand i dont need it anymore it doesnt hurt at all

useless body it isnt me im in your heart and with the good spirits this body isnt me understand baby yes mama not you youll be with the good spirits not here her mother nodded in jennsens hands good

throw your life away over what is no longer me your life is too precious leave this empty vessel run jenn or hell get you run her eyes turned toward sebastian help her sebastian right there nodded i swear i will she looked back at jennsen and smiled her sweet love ill always be in your heart baby always love you always oh mama you know i love you always her mother smiled as she watched her daughter jennsens fingers caressed her mothers beautiful face for a fleeting eternity her mother watched her until jennsen realized that her mother was no longer seeing anything in this world jennsen fell against her mother dissolving in tears and terror choking in sobs everything had ended the crazy senseless world had ended her arms stretched out toward her mother as she was pulled away jennsen his mouth was close to her ear we have to do what she wanted no please oh please no she wailed he gently pulled jennsen do as she asked we must jermsen pounded her fists against the bloodslicked floor no the world had ended oh please no no it cant be jenn we have to go you go she sobbed i dont care i give up no jenn you dont you cant his arm around her middle lifted her set her on her wobbly legs numb jennsen couldnt move nothing was real everything was a dream the world was crumbling to ash holding her by her upper arms he shook her jennsen we have to get out of here she turned her head and looked at her mother on the floor we have to do something please we have to do something yes we do we have to leave before more men show up his face was dripping she wondered if it was rain as if she were watching herself from some great disconnected distance her own thoughts seemed crazy to her jennsen listen to me her mother had said that it was important listen to me we have to get out of here your mother was right we have to go he turned to the pack beside the lamp on the table at the side of the room jennsen slumped to the floor her knees hit with a thump she was empty of everything but the hot coals of agony from which she could not pull away why did everything have to be so wrong jennsen crawled toward her sleeping mother she couldnt die she couldnt jennsen loved her too much for her to die jennsen grieve later we have to get out of here out the open door the rain poured down i wont leave her your mother made a sacrifice for youso you would have a life dont throw away her final act of courage he was stuffing whatever he could find in a pack you have to do as she said she loves you and wants you to live she told you to run i swore id help you we have to leave before they catch us here she stared at the door it had been closed she remembered crashing into it now it stood open maybe the latch broke a huge shadow materialized out of the rain melting through the doorway into the house the brawny mans eyes fixed on her feral fright surged through her he moved toward her faster and faster jennsen saw the knife with the omate r sticking from the side of a dead mans neck the knife her mother told her to take it wasnt far her mother had lost her armher lifeto kill him the man seemingly oblivious of sebastian dove for jennsen she dove for the knife her fingers greasy with blood seized the handle the worked metal gave good grip art with purpose deadly art with teeth gritted she yanked the blade free and rolled before the man reached her sebastian growled with the effort of burying his axe in the back of the mans head the soldier crashed to the floor beside her his meaty arm falling across her middle jennsen crying out wriggled out from under the arm as blood grew in a dark pool beneath his head sebastian pulled her up get whatever you want to take he ordered she moved through the room walking in a dream the world had gone mad perhaps it was she who had finally gone mad the voice in her head whispered to her in its strange language she found herself listening almost comforted by it tu vash misht tu vask misht grushdeva du kalt misht we have to go sebastian said get what you want to take she couldnt think she didnt know what to do she blocked the voice and told herself to do as her mother said to do she went to the cupboard and rapidly began picking out things that they always took when they traveledthings always at the ready traveling clothes were kept in her pack ready to leave at a moments notice she threw herbs spices and dried food in on top of them she pulled other clothes a brush a small mirror from a simple chest of woven branches her hand paused when she started grabbing her mothers clothes for her she stopped fingers trembling focusing on her mothers orders she couldnt think so she moved like a trained animal doing as she had been taught theyd had to run before she scanned the room four dead dharans one that morning that made five a quad plus one where were the other three in the dark outside the door in the trees in the dark woods waiting waiting to take her to lord rahl to be tortured to death with both hands sebastian seized her wrist jennsen what are you doing she realized she was stabbing at the empty air she watched as he pried the knife from her fist and returned it to its sheath he tucked it behind her belt he scooped up her cloak which the huge dharan soldier had ripped off her as she had first fallen into the nightmare hurry up jennsen grab anything else you want sebastian rifled through the dead mens pockets pulling out money he found cramming it in his own pockets he unstrapped all four knives none as good as the one hed tucked behind her belt the one with the ornate letter r on the handle the one from the fallen dead man the one her mother had used sebastian slipped the four knives down the side of the pack as he yelled at her again to hurry while he took the best sword from one of the men jennsen went to the table she scooped up candles and stuffed them in the pack sebastian attached the scabbard of the sword to his weapons belt jennsen collected small implements cooking utensils potspushing them in her pack she wasnt really aware of what she was taking she was just picking up whatever she saw and putting it in sebastian lifted her pack took one of her wrists and stuffed it through the strap as if he were handling a rag doll he put her other arm through the other strap he held out for her then threw her cloak around her shoulders after he pulled the hood up over her head he stuffed her red hair in the sides he held her mothers pack in one hand he tugged twice and freed his axe from the soldiers skull blood ran down the handle as he hooked the axe on his weapons belt with the heel of his sword hand against the small of her back he urged her onward anything else he asked as they moved toward the door jennsen do you want anything else from your house before we go jennsen looked over her shoulder at her mother on the floor shes gone jennsen the good spirits are taking care of her now shes smiling down on you now jennsen looked up at him really you think so yes shes in a better world now she told us to go from here we have to do what she said in a better world jennsen clung to that idea her world held only anguish she moved toward the door doing as sebastian said to do he scanned in every direction she simply followed stepping over bodies over bloody arms and legs she was too scared to feel anymore too heartsick to care her thoughts seemed completely muddled she had always prided herself on her clear thinking where had her clear thinking gone in the rain he pulled her by her arm toward the path down betty she said digging in her heels we have to get betty he gazed at the path then toward the cave i dont think we need bother with the goat but i should get my pack my things she saw he was standing in the downpour without his cloak he was soaked to the skin it occurred to her that she wasnt the only one who wasnt thinking clearly he was so intent on escaping that he almost left his things that would be the death of him she couldnt let him die betty would help but there was one other thing that she remembered jennsen ran back in the house she ignored sebastians yells inside she wasted no time rushing to a small wooden chest just inside the door she looked at nothing else as she pulled out two bundled sheepskin cloaksone hers one her mothers they kept them there rolled and tied at the ready in case they ever had to leave in a hurry he watched from the doorway impatient but silent when he saw what she was doing without looking death in the eye she rushed back out of her house for the last time together they ran to the cave the fire was still crackling hot betty paced and trembled but was uncharacteristically silent as if knowing something was terribly wrong dry yourself a bit first she said we dont have time we have to get out of here the others could come at any moment youll freeze to death if you dont then what good will running do dead is dead her own reasoned words surprised her jennsen pulled the two rolled sheepskin cloaks from under her wool cloak and started working loose the knots in the thongs these will help keep the rain out but you need to get dry first otherwise you wont stay warm enough he was nodding as he shivered and rubbed his hands before the fire the sense of what she said finally overcoming his urgency to be gone she wondered how he managed to do all he had done with a fever and after having taken herbs fear she guessed starkraving fear that she understood her whole body ached not only had she been banged around but she saw now that her shoulder was bleeding the cut wasnt bad but it throbbed the sustained level of terror had left her drained and exhausted she wanted only to lie down and cry but her mother had told her to get away only her mothers words motivated her now without those last commands jennsen would be unable to function now she simply did what her mother had told her to do betty was beside herself the distraught goat tried to climb the pen to get to jennsen as sebastian hovered over the fire jennsen tied a rope around bettys neck the goat was as thankful to be going as a goat could be they would give betty a chance to return the favor when they had gotten away and found at least simple shelter they would not be able to build a fire on such a wet night if they could find a dry hole a spot under a rock ledge or beneath fallen trees they would hunker down beside the goat betty would keep them both warm so they wouldnt freeze to death jennsen understood the plaintive calls betty made toward the house the goats ears were at attention betty was worried for the woman who wasnt going jennsen collected all the carrots and acorns off the shelf stuffing them in pockets and packs when sebastian was as dry as he was going to allow himself to get they donned their wool cloaks and topped them with the sheepskin with jennsen leading betty by the rope they started out into the drenching darkness sebastian headed for the trail down from the frontthe way he had come in jennsen seized his arm stopping him they might be waiting down there but we have to get out of here i have a better way we made an escape route he gazed at her a moment through the fall of icy rain separating them then without further protest followed her into the unknown chapter oba schalk snatched the chicken by the neck and lifted it from the nest box the chickens head looked tiny above his meaty fist with his other hand he fished a warm brown egg from the bottom of the depression in the straw he gently placed the egg in the basket with the others oba didnt set the chicken back down he grinned as he lifted it closer to his face watching its head twist from side to side its beak open and close open and close he put his own lips close so the beak was touching his lips then with all his might he blew in the chickens open mouth the chicken squawked and flapped madly trying to escape the viselike fist a deep laugh rolled up from obas throat oba oba where are you when he heard his mother hollering for him oba plopped the chicken back on its nest his mothers voice had come from the nearby barn squawking its terror the chicken fled the henhouse oba followed it out of the coop and then trotted toward the door to the barn the week before they had had a rare winter downpour by the following day the standing water had frozen and the rain had turned to snow windswept snow now hid the ice making for treacherous footing despite his size oba negotiated the icy conditions without much difficulty oba prided himself on being light on his feet it was important for a person not to let their body or mind become and dull oba believed it was important to learn new things he believed it was important to grow he thought it was important for a to use what they had learned that was how people grew the barn and house were one small structure made of wattle and woven branches covered with a mixture of clay straw and dung the house and barn were separated by a stone wall after hed built house oba had made the wall inside by stacking flat gray rocks from dw field he had learned the technique from observing a neighbor stack mocks at the side of his field the wall was a luxury most homes didnt bave hearing his mother yell his name again he tried to think of what he could have done wrong as he perused his mental list of the chores shed dd him to do he couldnt recall one in the barn that hed failed to do oba wasnt forgetful and besides they were chores he did often there shouldnt be anything in the barn to have set her off true as all that was none of it shielded him from incurring his mothers ire she could think of things that needed doing that had never before needed doing oba oba how many times do i need to call for you in his minds eye he could see her mean little mouth all pinched up as she said his name expecting him to appear the instant she screeched for him the woman had a voice that could unwind a good rope oba turned sideways to fit his shoulders through the small side door into the barn rats squeaked and scurried away at his feet the barn with a hayloft above housed their milk cow two hogs and two oxen the cow was still in the barn the hogs had been turned loose in the oak stand to rut for acorns under the snow oba could see the hind ends of both oxen through the larger barn door out to the yard on the other side his mother stood on the low hill of frozen muck hands on her hips the cold smoke of her breath rising from her nostrils like a dragons fiery snort mother was a bigboned woman broad in the shoulders and hips broad everywhere even her forehead was broad he had heard people say that when his mother was younger she had been a handsome woman and indeed when he had been a boy she had had a number of suitors year by year though the struggles of life had worn away her looks leaving behind deeply etched lines and sagging folds of flesh the suitors had long ago stopped coming around oba made his way across the black icy ground inside the barn and stood before her hands in his pockets she walloped the side of his shoulder with a stout stick oba he flinched when she whacked him three times more each swat punctuating his name oba oba oba when he had been young such a thrashing would have left him black and blue he was too big and strong now for her stick to hurt him that made her angry too while he wasnt bothered much by the stick now that he was grown the condemnation in her voice whenever she spoke his name still made his ears bum she reminded him of a spider with a mean little mouth a black widow spider he hunched trying not to look so big what is it mama where are you loafing when your mother calls her face screwed up a plum long ago turned to a prune oba the ox oba the dimwit oba the oaf where were you oba lifted his arm defensively as she cracked him with the stick again i was getting the eggs mama getting the eggs look at this mess dont it ever occur to you to do anything round here unless someone with brains tells you to oba looked around but didnt see what needed doingother than the regular workthat would have set her off so there was always work to do rats stuck their noses out from under boards in the stalls whiskers twitching as they sniffed watching with beady black eyes listening with little rat ears he looked back at his mother but had no answer none would suit her anyway she pointed at the ground look at this place dont you ever think to scoop out the muck soon as it thaws itll be running under the wall and into the house where i sleep do you think i feed you for nothing dont you think you have to earn your keep you lazy oaf oba the oaf she had already used the last invective oba was surprised sometimes that she wasnt more creative didnt learn new things when he had been little she had seemed to him a mind reader of inscrutable ability with a talented tongue that could cut him with knowing lashes now that he had grown so much larger than her he sometimes wondered if other aspects of his mother were less formidable than he had once feared wondered if her power over him wasnt somehow artificial an illusion a scarecrow with a mean little mouth yet she still had a way about her that could cut him down to nothing and she was his mother a person was supposed to mind their mother that was the most important thing a person could do she had taught him that lesson well oba didnt think he could do much more to earn his keep he worked from sunup to sundown he prided himself on not being lazy oba was a man of action he was strong and worked as hard as any two men he could best any man he knew men didnt give him any trouble women though stymied him he never knew what to do around women big as he was women had a way of making him feel puny he scuffed his boot against the dark rippled slick mound underfoot assessing the rockhard mass the animals added to it continually much of it freezing before it could all be scooped out allowing it to build in layers throughout the long cold winter periodically oba scattered straw over the top for better footing hed not want his mother to slip and fall it wasnt long though before the layer of straw became slicked over and it was time for another but mama the grounds all frozen in the past he had always scooped it out as it thawed and could be worked in the spring when it got warmer and the flies filled the barn with their constant buzzing it would come off in layers where the straw was but not now now it was welded together into a solid mass always an excuse isnt that right oba always an excuse for your mother you worthless bastard boy she folded her arms glowering at him he couldnt hide from the truth couldnt pretend and she knew it oba peered around in the dark barn and saw the heavy steel scoop shovel leaning against the wall ill scoop it mama you go back to your spinning and ill scoop the barn good he didnt exactly know how he was going to scoop the solid frozen muck only that he had to get started now she huffed use what light is left of the day when it gets dark then i want you to go to town to get me some medicine from lathea now he knew why she had come to the barn looking for him my knees is aching me again she complained as if she wanted to cut off any objection he might voice even though he never did he thought it though she always seemed to know what he was thinking today you can get started in the bam and tomorrow you can go back to scraping the muck all the way down until you clean it all out before the day wears on though i want you to go get my medicine oba pulled on his ear as he cast his gaze toward the ground he didnt like going to see lathea the woman with the cures he didnt like her she always looked at him like he was a worm she was mean as rake worse she was a sorceress if lathea didnt like someone they suffered for it everybody was afraid of lathea so oba didnt feel so singled out still though he didnt like going to see her i will mama ill fetch your medicine and dont you worry ill get to work at scraping the muck out just like you said i have to tell you every little thing dont oba her glare burned into him i dont know why i bothered raising such a worthless bastard boy she added under her breath should have done what lathea told me in the beginning oba heard her say this often when she was feeling sorry for herself sorry that no suitors came around anymore sorry that none had wanted to marry her oba was a curse she bore with bitter regret a bastard child whod brought her trouble from the first if not for oba maybe she would have gotten herself a husband to provide for her and dont you be staying in town with any foolishness i wont mama im sorry that your knees are bad today she whacked him with the stick they wouldnt be so bad if i didnt have to follow around a big dumb ox seeing that he does what he should already be doing yes mama did you get the eggs yes mama she eyed him suspiciously then pulled a coin from her flaxen apron tell lathea to make up a remedy for you too along with my medicine maybe we can yet rid you of the keepers evil if we could get the evil out of you maybe you wouldnt be so worthless his mother from time to time sought to purge him of what she believed to be his evil nature she tried all sorts of potions when he was little she had often forced him to drink burning powder she mixed with soapy water then she would lock him in a pen in the barn hoping the otherworldly evil wouldnt like being burned and locked up both and would flee his restrained earthly body his pen didnt have slats like the pens for the animals did it was made of solid boards in the summer it was an oven when she made him take burning powder and then dragged him by the arm and locked him in the pen he near to died of terror that shed never let him out or never let him have a drink of water he welcomed the beatings she would give him to try to silence his screams just to be let out you buy my medicine from lathea and a remedy for you his mother held up the small silver coin as her eyes narrowed into a spiteful squint and dont you go wasting any of this on women oba felt his ears heating each time his mother sent him to buy something whether medicine or leather work or pottery or supplies she always admonished him not to waste the money on women he knew that when she told him not to waste it on women she was mocking him oba didnt have the courage to say much of anything to women he always bought what his mother said to buy he never once wasted it on anythinghe feared his mothers wrath he hated that she always told him not to waste the money when he never did it made him feel like she thought he was intending to do wrong even though he wasnt it made him guilty even though he had done no wrong it made what was in his thoughts even if he didnt have them a crime he tugged on a burning ear i wont waste it mama and dress respectable not like some dumb ox you already reflect badly enough on me i will mama youll see oba ran around to the house and fetched his felt cap and brown woolen jacket for his journey to gretton a couple miles northwest she watched him carefully hang them on a peg where they would stay clean until he was ready to go to town with the scoop shovel he started in on the rockhard muck the steel shovel rang like a bell each time he rammed it at the frozen ground he grunted with each mighty blow chips of black ice burst forth splattering his trousers each was but an infinitesimal speck from the dark mountain of muck it was going to take a long time and a lot of work he didnt mind hard work though time he had in abundance mother watched from the doorway of the barn for a few minutes to make sure he was working up a sweat as he chipped away at the frozen mound when she was satisfied she vanished from the doorway to go back to her own work leaving him to think about his coming visit to lathea oba oba paused the rats back in the small places stilled their little black rat eyes watched him watching them the rats went back to their search for food oba listened for the familiar voice he heard the door to the house close mother a spinster was going back to spinning her wool mr tuchmann brought her wool which she spun into thread for him to use on his loom the meager pay helped support her and her bastard son oba oba knew the voice well hed heard it ever since he could remember he never told his mother about it she would be angry and think that it was the keepers evil calling to him she would want to force him to swallow even more potions and cures he was too big to be locked in the pen anymore but he wasnt too big to drink latheas cures when one of the fat rats scurried past oba stepped on its tail trapping it oba the rat squeaked a little rat squeak little rat legs scrambled trying to get away little rat claws scratched against the black ice oba reached down and seized the fat furry body he peered at the whiskered face the head twisted futilely beady black eyes watched him those eyes were filled with fear surrender oba thought it was vitally important to learn new things quick as a fox he bit off the rats head chapter frornwhat seemed to her the least troublesome comer of the room jennsen kept an eye on the door as well as the boisterous crowd half a room away sebastian leaned on the thick wooden plank counter speaking to the innkeeper she was a big woman and with a forbidding scowl that made her look like she was as used to trouble as she was prepared to deal with it the roomful of people mostly men were a jovial lot some of the men played at dice or other table games some armwrestled most were drinking and telling jokes that would set tables of them off in peals of fistpounding laughter laughter sounded obscene to jennsen there was no joy in her world there could be none the past week was a blur or was it more than a week she couldnt recall exactly how long they had been traveling what did it matter what did anything matter jennsen was unaccustomed to people people had always represented danger to her groups of them made her nervouspeople at an inn drinking and gambling even more so when men noticed her standing at the end of the counter near the wall they forgot the jokes or paused at their dice and lingered on the sight of her meeting their gazes she pushed the hood of her cloak back letting her thick rings of red hair fall over the front of her shoulders that was enough to turn their eyes back to their own business jennsens red hair spooked people especially those who were superstitious red hair was uncommon enough that it raised suspicion it gave people a worry that she might be gifted or perhaps that she might even be a witch jennsen by boldly meeting their gazes played on such fears it had in the past helped protect her oftentimes better than a knife could have back at her house it hadnt helped one little bit after the men turned away from her and went back to their dice and drinks jennsen looked back down the counter the stout innkeeper was staring at her at her red hair when jermsen met her gaze the woman quickly turned her attention back to sebastian he asked her another question she bent closer as she spoke to him jennsen couldnt hear them over the roar of all the talking joking betting cheering cursing and laughing sebastian nodded to the womans words spoken close to his ear she pointed off over the heads of her customers apparently giving directions sebastian straightened and pulled a coin from his pocket then slid it across the counter toward the woman after taking the coin she traded it for a key from a box behind her sebastian scooped the key off the counter wom smooth by countless mugs and hands he picked up his own mug and bid the woman a good day when he reached the end of the counter he leaned close to jennsen so she could hear him and gestured with his mug you sure you wouldnt like a drink jermsen shook her head he kept an eye on the roomful of people they were all once again engaged in their own business it was a good thing you pushed your hood back until the woman of the house saw that red hair of yours she was playing dumb after that her tongue loosened the woman knows her she is still living here in gretton as my mother said the innkeeper is sure sebastian took a long drink watching a roll of dice bring a cheer for the winner she gave me directions and you got us rooms only one room as he took another swig he saw her reaction better to be together in case of trouble i thought it would be safer with us both in one room id rather sleep with betty realizing how that must have sounded she looked away in embarrassment and added than in an inn i mean id rather be by myself than where there are so many people so close all around id feel safer in the woods than closed in a room here i didnt mean i know what you meant sebastians blue eyes took up his smile it vill do you good to sleep insideits going to be a bitter night and betty will be better sheltered at the stable the man who ran the stable had been a bit surprised to be asked to stable a goat for the night but horses enjoyed the company of goats so he was accommodating that first night betty had probably saved their lives sebastian with his fever might not have survived had jennsen not found a dry place under a jut of ledge the back of the small cleft beneath the overhang narrowed to a point but it was big enough for the two of them jennsen had cut balsam and fir limbs to line the depression lest the cold rock sap their bodies of heat she and sebastian then wedged themselves into the back with jennsens urging and with the aid of the rope betty knelt behind the pine boughs positioned over the opening and then lay down close before them with bettys body against them blocking the cold and providing her warmth they had a dry warm bed jennsen quietly wept the long miserable night away she was at least relieved that sebastian feverish was able to sleep by morning his fever had broken morning had been the first day of jennsens bleak new life without her mother leaving her mothers body there at the house all alone constantly haunted jennsen the memory of the horrifying bloody sight gave her nightmares that her mother was gone brought limitless tears and crushed jennsen with heartache life seemed desolate and meaningless but sebastian and jennsen had escaped they had survived that instinct to survive and knowing all that her mother had done to give jennsen life kept her going at times she wished she were not such a coward and could simply face the end and be done with it at other times the terror of being pursued kept her putting one foot in front of the other at yet other moments she felt a sense of fierce commitment to life to not allowing all her mothers sacrifices to be in vain we should have some supper sebastian said they have lamb stew then maybe you should get a good nights sleep in a warm bed before we go see this old acquaintance of yours ill stand watch while you sleep jennsen shook her head no lets go see her now we can sleep later she had seen people eating thick stew from wooden bowls the thought of food held no appeal for her sebastian studied the look on her face and saw that he wasnt going to talk her out of it he drained the mug and set it on the counter its not far were on the right side of town outside in the gathering dusk she asked why did you want to stay here at this inn there were other places much nicer where the people didnt look so rough his blueeyed gaze swept the buildings the dark doorways the alleys as his fingers touched his cloak seeking the reassurance of the hilt of his sword a rough crowd asks fewer questions especially the kind of questions we dont want to answer he seemed to her a man who was used to avoiding having questions asked of him she stepped along the narrow furrow of a frozen rut following it down the road toward the womans house a woman jennsen only dimly remembered she held on tightly to the hope that the woman might be able to help her mother must have had some reason for not going to this woman again but jennsen could think of nothing else to try but to seek her aid without her mother jennsen needed help the other three members of the quad were surely hunting her five men dead told her that there were at least two quads that would mean at least three of those killers were still after her it was entirely possible there were more it was probable that even if there were not more there soon would be they had escaped by using the hidden trail away from her housethe men probably wouldnt have been expecting thatso she and sebastian had gained the temporary safety of distance the rain would have done a good job of covering any tracks it was possible that the two of them had gotten away cleanly and were for the time being safe but since her pursuer was the lord rahl himself it was also possible that the killers were by some dark and mysterious means moment by moment closing in on her after the horrifying encounter with the huge soldiers at her house the terror of that possibility always loomed in jennsens fears at a deserted comer sebastian pointed to the right down this street they walked past dark buildings square and windowless that suggested to her that maybe they were only used for storage no one seemed to live down the street before long theyd left the buildings behind trees naked before the bitter wind huddled in clumps when they came to a narrow road sebastian pointed by the directions its the house down this road down at the end in that stand of trees the road looked to be little used weak light from a distant window stole through bare branches of oak and alder the light rather than warm invitation shone more like a glowing warning to stay away why dont you wait here she said it might be better if i went alone she was providing him with an excuse most people didnt want anything to do with a sorceress jennsen herself wished she had some other choice ill go with you he had shown a distinct distrust of anything to do with magic the way his eyes watched the dark place off through the branches and brush to the sides he might have been trying to sound more brave than he was jennsen admonished herself for even thinking such thoughts he had fought dharan soldiers who not only had been much bigger than he but had outnumbered him he could have simply stayed out in the cave and not risked his life he could have left the scene of such carnage and gone on with his life fearing magic only proved him of sound mind she of all people could understand fearing magic snow crunched under their boots as the two of them after reaching the end of the road made their way along the narrow path through the trees sebastian watched off to the sides while her attention was mostly fixed on the house behind the small place the woods marched off up foothills jennsen imagined that only those with a strong need dared walk the path toward this door jennsen reasoned that if the sorceress lived this near in to town then she must be someone who helped people someone whom people trusted it was entirely possible that the woman was a valued and respected member of the communitya healer devoted to helping others not someone to fear as the wind moaned through the trees looming around her jennsen rapped on the door sebastians gaze studied the woods to each side off behind them the lights from homes and businesses would at least provide light enough for them to find their way back as she waited jennsens gaze too was drawn to the gloom all around she imagined eyes in the darkness watching her the hairs at the back of her neck lifted the door finally drew in but only as wide as the face of the woman peering out at them yes jennsen couldnt clearly make out the shadowed features of the face but by the light coming out through the partly opened door the woman could see jennsen plainly enough are you lathea she asked lathea the sorceress why we were told that lathea the sorceress lives here if thats you may we come in still the door didnt open any wider jennsen pulled her cloak tighter against the cold night air as well as the chilly reception the womans steady look took in sebastian then jennsens form hidden within a heavy cloak im not a midwife if you want to get yourself out of the trouble you two are in i cant help with that go see a midwife jennsen was mortified thats not why were here the woman peered out for a moment considering the two strangers at her door what sort of medicine do you need then no medicine a spell ive met you before once i need a spell like you once cast for mewhen i was little the face in the shadows frowned when where jennsen cleared her throat back at the peoples palace when i lived there you helped me when i was little helped you what speak up girl helped hide me with some kind of spell i believe i was little at the time so i dont recall exactly hide you from lord rahl there was an awful silence from the house do you remember my name is jennsen i was very little at the time jennsen pushed her hood back so the woman could see her ringlets of red hair lit in the wedge of light coming through the door jennsen dont recall the name but the hair i remember its not often one sees hair like yours jennsens spirits buoyed with relief it has been a while im so glad to hear that dont deal in your kind the woman said never have i cast no spell for you jennsen was stunned speechless she didnt know what to say she was sum the woman had once cast a spell to help her now be gone the both of you the door started to close wait pleasei can pay jennsen reached into a pocket and hurriedly brought out a coin only after she passed it through the door did she see that it had been gold the woman inspected the gold mark for a time perhaps considering if it was worth becoming involved again in what was sure to be a high crime even for what amounted to a small fortune now do you remember sebastian asked the womans eyes turned to him and who are you just a friend lathea i need your help again my mother jennsen couldnt bring herself to say it and started over in a different direction i remember my mother telling me about you and how you helped us once i was very little at the time but i remember having the spell cast over me it wore off years ago i need that help again well you have the wrong person jennsens fists tightened on her wool cloak she had no other ideas this was the only thing she could think of lathea please im at my wits end i need help shes given you a goodly sum sebastian put in if you say that we have the wrong person and you dont want to help then i guess we should save the gold for the right person lathea gave him a sly smile oh i said she had the wrong person but i didnt say i couldnt earn the payment tendered i dont understand jennsen said holding her cloak closed at her throat as she shivered with cold lathea gazed out at her for a moment as if waiting to be sure they were paying close attention you are looking for my sister althea i am lathea she is althea she is the one who helped you not your mother probably got our names mixed up or you recalled it wrong it used to be a common mistake back when we were together althea and i have different talents with the gift it was she who helped you and your mother not jennsen was dumbfounded and disappointed but at least not defeated there was still a thread of hope please lathea could you help me this time in your sisters place no i can do nothing for you i am blind to your kind only althea can see the holes in the world i cannot jennsen didnt know what that meantholes in the world blind to my kind yes i have told you what i can now go away the woman started pulling back from the door wait please can you at least tell me where your sister lives then she looked back at jennsens expectant face this is dangerous business its business sebastian said his voice as cold as the night a gold marks worth for that price we should at the least have the place where we can find your sister lathea considered his words then in a voice as cold as his had been said to jennsen i dont want nothing to do with your kind understand nothing if althea does thats her business inquire at the peoples palace jennsen seemed to remember traveling to a woman not terribly far from the palace she had thought it was lathea but it must have been her sister althea but cant you tell me more than that where she lives how i can find her last time i saw her she lived near there with her husband you can inquire there for the sorceress althea people will know herif she still lives sebastian put his hand against the door before the woman could shut it thats a pretty thin bit of information we should have more than that for the price offered for what i have told you the price is paltry i gave you the inforrnation you need if my sister wants to tempt her doom thats up to her what i dont need for any price is trouble we mean no trouble jennsen said we only need the help of a spell if you cant help with that then we thank you for your sisters name we will seek her out but there are some important things i need to know if you could tell me if you had any decency youd leave althea alone your kind will only bring us harm now go from my door before i set a nightmare upon you jennsen stared at the face in the shadows someone already has she said as she turned away chapter oba feeling fashionable in his cap and brown wool jacket walked down the sides of the narrow streets humming a tune he had heard played on a pipe at an inn hed passed he had to wait for a rider to go by before he turned down latheas road the horses ears swiveled toward him as it passed oba had had a horse once and liked to ride but his mother had decided that they couldnt afford to keep a horse oxen were more useful and did more work but they werent as companionable as he walked down the dark road his boots crunching on the crust of snow a couple came past from the opposite direction from the direction of latheas place he wondered if they had gone to the sorceress for a cure the woman cast a wary look his way on a dark road such a reaction was not undue and too oba knew that his size frightened some women she sidestepped clear of him the man with her met obas gazemany men didnt the way they stared reminded oba of the rat he grinned at that memory at learning new things both the man and the woman thought he was grinning at them oba tipped his cap to the lady she returned a weak smile it was the kind of empty smile oba had often seen from women it made him feel a buffoon the couple melted into the dark streets oba stuffed his hands in his jacket pockets and turned back toward latheas place he hated going there in the dark the sorceress was fearsome enough without the walk down her dark path he let out a troubled sigh into the brisk winter air he wasnt afraid to confront the strength of men but he knew he was helpless against the mysteries of magic he knew how much misery her potions inflicted upon him they burned him going in and coming out they not only hurt they made him lose control of himself making him seem like he was just an animal it was humiliating he had heard tell of others though who had angered the sorceress and suffered worse fatesfevers blindness a slow lingering death one man had gone mad and run off naked into a swamp people said he must have crossed the sorceress somehow they found him snakebit and dead all puffed up and purple floating among the slimy weed oba couldnt imagine what the man had done to earn such a fate from the sorceress he should have known better and been more cautious with the old shrew sometimes oba had nightmares about what she might do to him with her magic he imagined latheas powers could lance him with a thousand cuts or even strip the flesh from his bones boil his eyes in his head or make his tongue swell until he gagged and choked in a slow agonizing death he hurried along the path the sooner started the sooner finished oba had learned that when he reached the house he knocked its oba schalk my mother sent me for her medicine he watched his breath cloud in the air while he waited the door finally opened a sliver so she could peer out at him he thought that being a sorceress she should be able to see him without having to open the door for a look first sometimes when he was there waiting for lathea to mix up medicine someone would come and she would simply open the door whenever oba came though she always peered out first to see it was him oba her voice was as sour with recognition as her expression the door opened to admit him cautiously respectfully oba stepped inside he peered about even though he knew the place well he was careful not to act too forward with her harboring no fear of him she swatted his shoulder to spur him to move deeper into the room to give her the leeway to shut the door your mothers knees again the sorceress asked pushing the door closed against the frigid air oba nodded as he stared at the floor she says theyre aching her and shed like some of your medicine he knew he had to tell her the rest of it she asked for you to to send along something for me as well lathea smiled in that sly way she had something for you oba oba knew that she knew very well what he meant there were only two cures he ever went to her for one for his mother and the one for him she liked to make him say it though lathea was as mean as a toothache a remedy for me too mama said her face floated closer she peered up at him the snaky smile still playing across her features a remedy for wickedness her voice came in a hiss that it oba is that what mother schalk wanted you to fetch he cleared his throat and nodded he felt puny before her thin smile so he looked back down at the floor latheas gaze lingered on him he wondered what was in that clever mind of hers what devious thoughts what grim schemes she finally moved off to fetch the ingredients she kept in the tall cabinet the rough pine door squeaked as she pulled it open she set bottles in the crook of her other arm and carried them to the table in the middle of the room she keeps trying doesnt she oba her voice had gone flat like she was talking to herself keeps trying even though it never changes what is oba an oil lamp on the trestle table lit the collection of bottles as she set them there one at a time her eyes lingering on each she was thinking about something maybe what vile brew she might mix up for him this time what sort of sickly condition she would inflict upon him in an attempt to purge him of his ever present unspecified evil the oak logs in the hearth had checkered in the wavering yelloworange glow of the fire throwing good heat as well as light into the room in the middle of their room oba and his mother had a pit for a fire he liked the way the smoke in latheas fireplace went right up the chimney and out of the house rather than hanging in the room before eventually making its way out a small hole in the roof oba liked a proper fireplace and thought that he should make one for him and his mother every time he went to latheas place he studied the way her fireplace was built it was important to learn things he also kept an eye on latheas back as she poured liquid from bottles into a widemouthed jar she mixed the concoction with a glass rod as each new ingredient was slowly added when she was satisfied she poured the medicine in a small bottle and stoppered it with a cork she handed him the little bottle for your mother oba passed her the coin his mother had given him she watched his eyes as her knobby fingers slipped the coin into a pocket in her dress oba finally let his breath go after she turned back to her table to her work she lifted a few bottles studying them in the light of the fire before she began mixing his cure his cursed cure oba didnt like speaking with lathea but her silence often made him even more uncomfortable made him itch he couldnt really think of anything worthy of saying but he finally decided that he had to say something mama will be glad for the medicine shes hoping it will help her knees and shes hoping for something to cure her son oba shrugged regretting his attempt at casual conversation yes maam the sorceress peered back over her shoulder ive told mother schalk that i dont believe it will do any good oba didnt think so either because he didnt really believe there was anything needing curing when he had been little he thought that his mother knew best and wouldnt give him the cure if he didnt need it but he had since come to doubt that she no longer seemed to him as smart as he had once believed her to be she must care about me though she keeps trying maybe shes hoping that the cure might rid her of you lathea said almost absently as she worked oba obas head come up he stared at the sorceresss back he had never considered such a thought maybe lathea was hoping that the cure would rid them both of the bastard boy his mother sometimes went to see lathea maybe they had discussed it had he ignorantly believed the two women were trying to do good for him to help him when the opposite was actually true maybe both women had hatched a plan maybe they had been conniving all along to poison him if something happened to him his mother would no longer have to help support him she often complained about how much he ate time and again she told him that she worked more to feed him than herself and that because of him she could never put any money away maybe if she had instead put away the money shed spent on his cures over the years shed have a comfortable nest egg by now but if something happened to him his mother would have to do all the work maybe both women just wanted to do it out of simple meanness maybe they hadnt thought it all through as oba would his mother often surprised him with her simplemindedness maybe both women had been sitting around one day and had just decided to be mean oba watched the flickering light play over the thin strands of the sorceresss straight hair today mama said that she should have done what you always told her to do from the beginning lathea pouring thick brown liquid into the jar glanced back over her shoulder again did she now oba what did you say from the beginning that mama should do isnt it obvious oba icy realization prickled his flesh you mean that she should have killed me he had never before come out and said anything so bold he had never once in any way dared to confront the sorceresshe feared her too much but this time the words had just come into his mind much like the voice did and he had spoken them before he had time to consider whether or not it was wise to do so he had surprised lathea even more than he had surprised himself she hesitated at her bottles watching him as if he had changed before her very eyes maybe he had he realized then that he liked the way it felt to speak his mind he had never before seen lathea falter maybe it was because she felt safe dancing around the subject safe in the shadows of the words without having them brought out into the light of day that what you always wanted her to do lathea that it kill her bastard boy a smile pushed its way onto her thin face it wasnt like you make it sound oba all the low slow haughty intonation had evaporated from her voice not at all she addressed him more like a man than she ever had before rather than an evil bastard boy she tolerated she sounded almost sweet women are sometimes better off without a newborn babe it isnt so bad when the babe is newborn theyre not such a such a person yet oba surrender you mean it would be easier thats right she said eagerly latching on to his words it would be easier his own voice slowed and took on an edge that he didnt know had been in him you mean it would be easier before they got big enough to fight back the range of his latent talents amazed him it was a night of new wonders no no thats not at all what i mean but he thought it was her voice reflecting a fresh respect for him quickened became almost urgent i only mean that its easier before a woman comes to love her child you know before the child comes to be a person a real person with a mind its easier then and sometimes its best for the mother oba was learning something new but he hadnt put it all together yet he sensed that all his new learning was profoundly important that he was on the cusp of true understanding how could it be best lathea stopped pouring the liquid and set the bottle down well sometimes its a hardship to have a new baby a hardship on both its best for both really sometimes she walked briskly to the cabinet when she returned with a new bottle she stepped around to the other side of the table so her back was no longer to him most of the ingredients for his cures were powders or liquids and he didnt know what they were the bottle she brought back contained one of the few things he recognized the dried base of mountain fever roses they looked like brown shriveled little circles with stars in the centers she often added one to his cure this time she poured a pile in her cupped hand made a fist to crush them and dumped the fine brown crumbles in the cure she was mixing best for both oba asked her fingers seemed to be looking for something to do yes sometimes she seemed like she didnt want to talk about it anymore but couldnt find a way to make it end sometimes its more of a hardship than a woman can endure thats alla hardship that only endangers her and the rest of her children but mama had no other children lathea went silent for a moment oba surrender he listened to the voice the voice that had become somehow different somehow vastly more important no but all the same you was a hardship on her its difficult for a woman to raise a child by herself especially a child she caught herself then started over i only meant that it would be hard but she did it i guess you were wrong isnt that so lathea you were wrong not mamayou mama wanted me and she never married lathea snapped her flash of anger had put the flame of haughty authority back in her eyes maybe if she maybe if shed married she would have had a chance to have a whole family instead of only a bastard boy lathea didnt answer this time she seemed to regret having taken a stand the spark of anger left her eyes with slightly trembling fingers she dumped another pile of the dried flower buds in her palm hurriedly crushed them in her fist and dumped them in the cure she turned and busied herself studying the flames in the hearth through a liquid in a blue glass bottle oba took a step toward the table her head came up her eyes turning to his dear creator she whispered as she looked into his eyes he realized she was not speaking to him but to herself sometimes when i look into those blue eyes i can see him obas brow drew down above his glare the bottle slipped from her hand thumped on the table and rolled to the floor where it shattered oba surrender surrender your will this was new the voice had never before said that you wanted mama to kill me didnt you lathea he took another step toward the table lathea stiffened stay where you are oba there was fear in her eyes little rat eyes this was definitely new he was learning new things almost faster than he could note them all he saw her hands the weapons of a sorceress lifting oba paused he stood cautiously at attention surrender oba and you will be invincible this was not merely new it was startling i think you want to kill me with your cures dont you lathea you want me dead no no oba that isnt true i swear it isnt he took another step testing what the voice promised her hands rose a glow of light coming to life around her clawed fingers the sorceress was conjuring magic obaher voice was more forceful more surestay where you are now surrender oba and you will be invincible oba felt his thighs bump the table as he advanced the jars rattled and clanked together one of them wobbled lathea watched it teeter and almost right itself only to topple and spill its thick red liquid latheas face abruptly twisted with hatred with rage with effort she cast her clawed hands forward toward him cast the full force of her power at him with a thunderous clap light ignited the flash making everything in the room go white for an instant he saw a flare of a yellowwhite light knife through the air toward himdeadly lightning sent to kill oba felt nothing behind him the light blasted a mansized hole through the wooden wall scattering flaming splinters out into the night all the fire fizzled out in the snow oba touched his chest where the full force of her power had been directed no blood no torn flesh he was unharmed he thought that lathea was even more surprised about it than he her mouth hung open in astonishment her wide eyes stared all his life he had feared this scarecrow lathea quickly recovered and again her face twisted with effort as she drew her hands up this time an eerie blue hiss of light formed the air smelled like burning hair lathea turned her palms up sending forth her deadly magic sending him death power no person could withstand shrieked toward him the blue light scorched the walls behind but again he felt nothing oba grinned again lathea wheeled her arms but this time she also whispered a chant of clipped words he could not understandrattling off a menace of magic a column of light bloomed undulating in the air before him a viper of extraordinary might beyond doubt it was meant to kill oba lifted his hands to feel the snaking rope of crackling death she had spawned he ran his fingers through it but could feel nothing it was like looking at something in a different world there but not it was as if he were invincible with a howl of outrage her hands came up again quick as thought oba seized her by the throat oba she screeched oba no please this was new he had never before heard lathea say please with her neck in his meaty grip he dragged her across the table toward him bottles scattered tumbling to the floor some thudded and rolled some broke like eggs oba closed a fist on latheas stringy hair she clawed at him desperately calling upon her talents she spoke words that had to be a mystical entreaty to magic to her gift to her sorceress power while he didnt recognize the words he understood their lethal intent oba had surrendered thouah and he had become invincible he had watched her unleash her rage now he unleashed his he slammed her up against her cabinet her mouth grew wide with a silent scream why did you want mama to get rid of me her eyes big and round were fixed on the object of her terror oba all his life she had delighted in terrifying others now all that terror had returned to haunt her why did you want mama to get rid of me a series of small panting cries were her only answer why why oba ripped her dress from her body coins spilled from the pocket raining across the floor why he clutched the white shift she wore underneath the dress why she tried to hold the shift to herself but he stripped it away sending her tumbling across the floor bony arms and legs sprawling her wasted breasts hung like shriveled udders this powerful sorceress was now naked before him and she was nothing her cries full and round came to life at last teeth gritted he snatched her by the hair and hauled her to her feet oba rammed her against the cabinet wood splintered bottles cascaded out he seized a bottle as it rolled out and broke it against the cabinet why lathea he brought the neck of a broken bottle up against her body why she shrieked all the louder he twisted it against her soft middle why please a dear creator please no why lathea because she wailed you are the bastard son of that monster darken rau oba hesitated this was stunning newsif it was true mama was forced she told me so she said it was some man she didnt know who fathered me oh she knew him she did she worked at the palace when she was younger your mother had big breasts and bigger ideas back then poorly conceived ideas she wasnt smart enough to realize that she was no more than a nights diversion for a man with a limitless supply of womenthose eager like her and those not this was definitely something new darken rahl had been the most powerful man in the world could that noble rahl blood flow in his veins the heady implications made his head swim if the sorceress was telling the truth my mother would have stayed there at the peoples palace if she carried darken rahls son you arent his gifted heir but still if i was his son despite her pain she managed to give him that smile that said he was but dirt to her you are not gifted your kind were vermin to him he ruthlessly exterminated all he discovered he would have tortured you and your mother to death if he knew of you once she learned this your mother fled oba was overwhelmed with new things they were beginning to become a jumble in his mind he pulled the sorceress close darken rahl was a powerful wizard if what you say is true he would have hunted us he slammed her against the cabinet again he would have hunted me he shook her to elicit an answer he would have he did but he could not see the holes in the world her eyes were rolling her frail body was no match for obas strength blood ran from her right ear what oba reasoned that lathea was babbling nonsense now only althea can she had ceased to make sense he wondered how much of what she had said was true her head lolled to the side i should have saved us all when i had the chance althea was wrong he shook her trying to get her to say more red froth bubbled from her nose despite his yelling his demanding his shaking her no more words came he held her close his heavy hot breath lifting thin strands of her hair as he glared into her aimless eyes he had learned all he would from her he remembered all the burning powder hed had to drink the potions she had mixed for him the days hed spent in the pen he remembered all the times hed vomited his guts out and it still wouldnt stop burning his insides oba growled as he lifted the bony woman with a roar of anger he slammed her against the wall her cries were fuel for the tire of his vengeance he reveled in her helpless agony he smashed her down against the heavy trestle table breaking it and breaking her with each crash she became more limp bloody incoherent but oba had only just begun to rage at her chapter jennsen didnt want to go back to the inn but it was dark and cold and she didnt know what else to do it was disheartening that lathea wouldnt answer their questions jennsen had pinned her hopes on the womans help what shall we do tomorrow sebastian asked tomorrow well do you still want me to help you leave dhara as you and your mother asked of me she hadnt really thought it out in view of what little lathea had told her jennsen wasnt sure what to do she stared absently out into the empty night as they trudged across the crusted snow if we went to the peoples palace i would have some answers she said thinking out loud and hopefully altheas help going to the peoples palace was by far the most dangerous alternative but no matter where she ran where she hid lord rahls magic would haunt her althea might be able to help maybe somehow she would be able to conceal jennsen from him so she could have her own life he seemed to give her words serious thought a long cloud of his breath trailing away in the wind well go to the peoples palace then find this althea woman she felt somehow uneasy when she realized that he wasnt offering any argument or trying to talk her out of it the peoples palace is the heart of dhara its not just the heart of dhara but the home of the lord rahl then he wouldnt be likely to expect you to go there would he expected or not they would still be walking into the enemys lair no predator long neglected to notice the prey in his midst they would be naked before his fangs jennsen glanced over at the shadowed shape walking beside her sebastian what are you doing in dhara you seem to have no love for the place why would you travel to a place you dont like beneath his hood she saw his smile am i that obvious jennsen shrugged ive met travelers before they talk about places theyve been sights theyve seen wonders beautiful valleys breathtaking mountains fascinating cities you dont speak of anywhere youve been or anything youve seen you want the truth he asked his expression now serious jennsen looked away she suddenly felt awkward nosyespecially in light of what she wasnt telling him im sorry i have no right to ask such a thing forget i mentioned it i dont mind he looked over at her with a wry smile i dont think you would be one to report me to dharan soldiers she was appalled at the very idea of course not lord rahl and his dharan empire wish to rule the world im trying to help prevent that im from south of dhara as i told you before i was sent by our leader the emperor of the old world jagang the just i am emperor jagangs strategist then youre someone of high authority she whispered in astonishment a man of high rank the astonishment quickly transformed to tingling intimidation she feared to guess at his importance his rank in her mind it rose by the moment notch by notch how am i to address one such as you as sebastian but youre an important man im a nobody oh youre somebody jennsen daggett the lord rahl himself does not hunt nobodies jennsen felt an odd and unexpected sense of uneasiness she harbored no love for dhara of course but she still felt somewhat uncomfortable to know that sebastian was there to help bring about the defeat of her land the twinge of loyalty confused her after all the lord rahl had sent the men who had murdered her mother the lord rahl hunted jennsen wanted her dead but it was the lord rahl who wanted her dead not necessarily the people of her land the mountains the rivers the vast plains the trees and plant life had always all sheltered and nurtured her shed never really thought it through in that way beforethat she could love her homeland yet hate those who ruled it if this jagang the just succeeded though she would be freed from her pursuer if dhara was defeated lord rahl would be defeatedthe rule of evil men would be ended she would at last be free to live her own life in light of how open he was with her she also felt foolish even ashamed for not telling sebastian who she was and why lord rahl hunted her she didnt know it all herself but she knew enough to know that sebastian would share the same fate as she if they caught him with her as she thought about it it began to make sense why he might not object to going to the peoples palace why he might be willing to risk such a dangerous journey as a strategist for the emperor jagang perhaps sebastian would like nothing better than to sneak a look into the enemys lair here we are he said she looked up and saw the white clapboard face of the inn a metal mug hanging from a bracket overhead squeaked as it swung to and fro in the wind the sounds of singing and dancing spilled out onto the snowcovered silence of the night with an arm around her shoulders sebastian sheltered her as they made their way through the great room shielded her from the prying eyes and led her to the stairs at the far side if possible the place was even more crowded and noisy than before without pause the two of them quickly ascended the stairs partway down the dim hall he unlocked a door to the right inside sebastian turned the wick up on the oil lamp sitting on a small table alongside the lamp was a pitcher and washbasin and near the table a bench looming to the side of the room sat a high bed covered crookedly with a dark brown blanket the room was better than the home she had left but jennsen didnt like it one wall was overlaid with drab painted linen the plastered walls were stained and flyblown since the room was on the second floor the only way down was back through the inn she hated the stink of the rooma sour mixture of pipe smoke and urine the chamber pot beneath the bed hadnt been emptied as jennsen pulled a few things from her pack and went to the table to wash her face sebastian left her to it and went back downstairs by the time she had finished washing and had brushed her hair he returned with two bowls of lamb stew he had brown bread too and mugs of ale they ate sitting close together on the short bench hunched over the table close to the wavering light of the oil lamp the stew didnt taste as good as it looked she picked out the chunks of meat but left the colorless tasteless soft vegetables she sopped up some of the juice with the hard bread she gave her ale to sebastian and drank water instead she wasnt used to drinking ale to her the ale smelled as unpleasant as the lamp oil sebastian seemed to like it when she had finished eating jennsen paced in the confining room the way betty paced in her pen sebastian threw a leg to each side of the bench and leaned back against the wall his blue eyes followed her from the bed to the wall hung with linen and back again as she began wearing a path in the plank floor why dont you lie down and get some sleep he said in a soft voice ill watch over you she felt like a trapped animal she watched him take a long draft of ale from his mug and what will we do tomorrow it wasnt only her dislike of the inn of the room her conscience was eating at her she didnt let him answer sebastian i have to tell you who i am you were honest with me i cant stay with you and endanger your mission i dont know anything about the important things you do but being with me will only put you at great risk youve already helped me more than i could have hoped more than i ever could have asked jennsen im already at risk being here i am in the land of my enemy and youre someone of high rank an important man she rubbed her hands together trying to bring some warmth to her icy fingers if they captured you because you were with me well i couldnt bear it i took the risk of coming here but i havent been honest with youi havent lied to you but i havent told you what i should have long ago youre too important a man to chance being with me when you dont even know why im hunted or what that attack back at my house was about she swallowed at the painful lump in her throat why my mother lost her life he said nothing but simply gave her the time to gather herself and tell him in her own way from the first moment she had met him and he hadnt come close when she had been afraid he always gave her the room she needed in order to feel safe he deserved more than she gave him in return jennsen finally brought a halt to her pacing and looked down at him at his blue eyes blue eyes like hers like her fathers sebastian lord rahlthe last lord rahl darken rahlwas my father he took the news without any outward reaction she couldnt know what he was thinking as he gazed up at her as calmly as he did when she wasnt telling him terrible news she felt safe in his company my mother worked at the peoples palace she was part of the palace staff darken rahl he noticed her it is the lord rahls prerogative to have any woman he wants jennsen you dont she lifted a hand silencing him she wanted the whole thing out before she lost her nerve having always been with her mother she feared being alone now she feared he would abandon her but she had to tell him what she knew she was fourteen jennsen said beginning the story as calmly as she could too young to really understand about the ways of the world of men you saw how beautiful she was at that young age she was already pretty as could be growing into a woman sooner than many her age she had a bright smile and an innocent exuberance for life she was a nobody though and to an extent excited to be noticeddesiredby a man of such power a man who could have any woman he wanted that was foolish of course but at her age and station it was flattering and in her innocence i suppose it might have even seemed glamorous she was bathed and pampered by older women on the palace staff her hair done up like a real lady she was dressed in a beautiful gown for her meeting with the great man himself when she was brought to him he bowed and gently kissed the back of her handher a servant in his great palace and he kissed her hand from all accounts he was so handsome that he shamed the finest marble statues she had dinner with him in a great hall and ate rare and exotic foods he had never tasted before just the two of them at a long dining table with people serving her for the first time in her life he was charming he complemented her on her beauty her grace he poured wine for herthe lord rahl himself when she was at last alone with him she was confronted with the reality of why she was there she was too frightened to resist of course had she not meekly submitted he would have done what he wished anyway darken rahl was a powerful wizard he was easily as cruel as he was charming he could have handled any woman without the slightest difficulty he had but to command it and those who resisted his will were tortured to death but she never gave any thought to resisting for a brief time despite her apprehension that world at the center of such splendor such power had probably seemed exciting when it turned to terror for her she bore it silently it wasnt rape in the meaning of being taken against her will with a knife held to her throat but it was a crime nonetheless a savage crime jennsen looked away from sebastians blue eyes he took my mother to his bed for a period of time before he tired of her and moved on to other women there were as many women as he could want even at that age my mother didnt hold any foolish illusion that she meant something to him she knew he was simply taking what he wanted for as long as he wanted and that when he was finished with her she would soon be forgotten she was doing as a servant did a flattered servant perhaps but still a frightened innocent young servant who knew better than to resist a man above any law but his own she couldnt bear to look at sebastian in a small voice she added the last bit to the tale i was the result of that brief ordeal in her life and the beginning of a far greater one jennsen had never before told anyone the awful story the terrible truth she felt cold and dirty she felt sick most of all she felt deep anguish for what her mother must have gone through for her young life spoiled her mother never told the story all out as jennsen had just done jennsen had pieced snippets and snatches of it together over her whole life until it was finally a whole picture in her mind she wasnt telling sebastian all the snippets eitherthe true extent of the horror of the way her mother had been treated by darken rahl jennsen felt burning shame that she had to be born to remind her mother every day of that terrible memory she could never tell in whole when jennsen looked up through tears sebastian was standing close before her his fingertips gently touched the side of her face it was as tender a thing as she had ever felt jennsen wiped the tears from under her eyes the women and their children mean nothing to him the lord rahl eliminates all those offspring who are not gifted since he takes many women children of these couplings are not uncommon he covets only one his heir the single child born of his seed who carries the gift richard rahl sebastian said richard rahl she confirmed my half brother richard rahl her half brother who hunted her as his father before him had hunted her richard rahl her half brother who sent the quads to kill her richard rahl her half brother who had sent the quads that had murdered her mother but why she could have been no threat to darken rahl and even less of a threat to the new lord rahl he was a powerful wizard who commanded armies legions of the gifted and countless other loyal supporters and she she was nothing but one lone woman who knew few people and wanted only to live her own simple life in peace she was hardly a threat to his rule even the truth of her story would not so much as raise an eyebrow everyone knew that any lord rahl lived by his own laws no one was even remotely likely to disbelieve her story but no one would really care either at most they might wink or give one another a knowing elbow at the lives of powerful men and darken rahl had been the most powerful man alive jennsens whole life seemed suddenly to come down to that central question why would her father a man she never knew have wanted so desperately to kill her and why would his son richard rahl her own half brother and now the lord rahl also be so intent on killing her it made no sense what could she possibly do that could harm either of them what threat could she possibly constitute to such power jermsen checked that the knife at her belther knife displaying the emblem of the house of rahlwas secure she lifted the blade to be sure it was free in its scabbard the steel made a pleasing metallic click as she pushed it home she scooped her cloak off the bed and threw it around her shoulders sebastian swiped a hand back across his white spikes of hair as he watched her quickly tie the cloak shut what do you think youre doing ill be back in a while im going out he reached for his weapons and cloak all right ill no leave me to it sebastian youve put yourself at risk enough on my behalf i wish to go alone ill be back when ive finished finished what she hurried to the door what i have to do he stood in the center of the room fists at his sides apparently hesitant to go against her explicit wishes jennsen quickly pulled the door shut tight behind herself closing off her view of him she took the steps two at a time intent on being quickly out of the inn and gone before he changed his mind and followed the crowd downstairs was as rowdy as they had been before she ignored the men their gambling their dancing their laughter and headed for the door before she made it though a bearded man hooked his arm around her middle and jerked her back into the press of people she let out a small cry that was lost in the gale of revelry her left arm was pinned against her waist he swung her around catching her right hand dancing her across the floor jennsen tried to reach up to pull back her hood to free her red hair in order to give him a scare but she couldnt liberate her arm he held her other hand in an iron grip not only could she not free her hair she couldnt reach her knife to defend herself her breath came in a frightened pant the man laughed with his fellows and swirled her to the music holding her tight lest he lose his dance with her his eyes shown with merriment not menace but she knew that was only because she had not yet forcefully resisted she knew that when he discovered that she was unwilling his pleasant demeanor was sure to change he released her waist and spun her around with only one hand still entrapped in his callused fingers she hoped yet to break the hold with her left hand she fumbled for her knife but it was under her cloak and not handy to her off hand the crowd clapped in time with the tune of the pipes and drums as she turned and stepped away another man caught her up around the waist bumping against her hard enough to knock the wind from her in a grunt he captured her hand away from the first fellow she had wasted her chance to pull back her hood by trying for her knife instead she found herself adrift in a sea of men the few other women serving girls mostly were either willing or laughed and were able to alight briefly and then move away like bugs that were able to walk on water jennsen didnt know how they performed the trick she was in danger of drowning among waves of men who passed her along from one to another when she caught sight of the door she yanked away suddenly breaking the hold of the latest man to have her in his grip he hadnt been expecting her to suddenly break free the men all laughed at the fellow who had lost hold of her his merriment as she had expected died the rest of the men were more goodnatured about it than she had expected and sent up a cheer for her escape instead of showing anger the man from whom she had escaped bowed thank you my beautiful lass for the gracious dance it was a kindness to a lumbering old soul such as me his grin returned and he winked at her before turning back to clap along with his fellows in time to the music jennsen stood stunned realizing that it had not been the danger she had expected the men were having a good time and not really intent on harm none had touched her in an unseemly manner or even spoken any crude words to her they had only smiled laughed and danced with her still jennsen made a quick line for the door before she went out another arm caught her around the waist jennsen started to fight and pull away i didnt know you liked to dance it was sebastian she relaxed and let him usher her out of the inn out in the dark night the cold air was a relief she pulled a long breath happy to be away from the unfamiliar smell of ale pipe smoke and sweaty men happy to be away from the noise of so many people i told you to leave me to it she said leave you to what im going to latheas place stay here sebastian please if you tell me why you dont want me to go she lifted a hand but let it flop back to her side sebastian youre an important man i feel terrible about the danger youve already been in all because of me this is my problem not yours my life is i dont know i dont have a life you do i dont want to get you all tangled up in my mess she started out across the crusty snow just wait here he stuffed his hands in his pockets as he strode along beside her jennsen im a grown man dont decide for me what i should be doing all right she didnt answer as she turned the comer down a deserted street tell me why you want to go see lathea will you she stopped then at the side of the road close to an uninhabited building not far from the comer of the road that turned down to latheas place sebastian my whole life ive been running my mother spent the better part of her life running from darken rahl hiding me she died running from his son richard rahl it was me darken rahl was after me darken rahl wanted to kill and now its richard rahl who is after me who wants to kill me and i dont know why im sick of it my life is nothing but running hiding and being afraid its all i do all i think about thats all my life isrunning from a man trying to kill me trying to stay a step ahead of him and stay alive he didnt argue with her so why do you want to go to the sorceress jennsen pushed her hands under her cloak under her arms to warm them she gazed down toward the dark road to latheas place at the feathery canopy of bare branches moving in the wind some of the limbs creaked and groaned as they rubbed together i even ran from lathea earlier i dont know why lord rahl is chasing me but she does i was afraid to insist she tell me i was going to travel all the way to the peoples palace in order to find her sister althea hoping that maybe as i stand meekly before her door she might deign to tell me to help me what if she doesnt what if she too dismisses me then what what greater danger could there be than for me to go there to the peoples palace and for what the hollow hope that someone will finally volunteer to stoop to help a solitary woman hunted by the mighty force of a nation led by the murderous bastard son of a monster dont you see if i would stop taking no for an answer and insist lathea tell me then maybe i could save a dangerous journey to the even more dangerous heart of dhara and leave instead for the first time in my life i could be free then but i was about to throw away that chance because i was afraid of lathea too im sick to death of being afraid in the dim light he stood considering their options so lets just leave let me take you away from dhara if thats what you want no not until i find out why lord rahl wants to kill me jennsen what difference does it make if no her fists tightened not until i find out first why my mother had to die she could feel bitter tears turning icy cold as they ran down her cheeks finally sebastian nodded i understand lets go see lathea ill help you get an answer from her maybe then youll let me take you away from dhara to where you will be safe she brushed back the tears thank you sebastian but dont you have some kind of job to do here i cant let my problems get in your way any longer this is my trouble you must live your own life he smiled then our peoples spiritual guide brother narev says that our most important job in this life is helping those who need help such a sentiment lifted her spirits when she didnt think they could be lifted he sounds like a wonderful man he is but you are still on a duty from your leader jagang the just arent you brother narev is also a close friend and spiritual guide to emperor jagang both men would want me to help you i know they would after all the lord rahl is our enemy too lord rahl has caused our people untold hardship both men brother narev and emperor jagang would insist i help you thats the truth of it she was choked with emotion and couldnt speak she let him put his arm around her waist and lead her down the road sharing the quiet darkness with him jennsen listened to the soft sound of their boots crunching through the hard crust of snow lathea had to help her jennsen intended to see to it chapter oba hated it to end but he knew it had to he would have to get home his mother would be angry if he stayed too long in town besides he could wring no more enjoyment out of lathea she had given him all the satisfaction she was ever going to give him it had been fascinating while it lasted boundlessly fascinating and he had learned many new things animals simply did not provide the same kind of sensations as those he had gotten from lathea true watching a person die was in many ways much like watching an animal die but at the same time it was oh so very different oba had learned that who knew what a rat was really thinkingor if rats could even think at all but people could think you could see their mind through their eyes and you knew to know they were thinking real people thoughtsnot some chickenrabbitrat thoughtsbehind those human eyes behind that look that said it all was intoxicating witnessing latheas ordeal had been rapture especially as he waited for that singular inspirational instant of ultimate anguish when her soul fled her human form and the keeper of the dead received her into his eternal realm animals did give him a thrill though even if they lacked that human element there was tremendous enjoyment to be had in nailing an animal to a fence or a barn wall and skinning them while they were still alive but he didnt think they had a soul they just died lathea had died too but it had been a whole new experience lathea had made him grin like he had never grinned before oba unscrewed the top of the lamp pulled out the woven wick and dribbled lamp oil across the floor over the broken pieces of the trestle table around latheas medicine cabinet lying facedown in the center of the room as much as he knew he would enjoy it he couldnt just leave her there to be discovered there would be questions if she was found like this he glanced over at her especially if she was found like this that idea did hold a certain fascination he would enjoy listening to all the hysterical talk he would love to hear people tell him all the macabre details of the monstrous death lathea had suffered the very idea of a man who could have taken the powerful sorceress out in such a grisly fashion would cause a sensation people would want to know who had done it to some folk he would be an avenging hero people everywhere would be abuzz as word spread about latheas ordeal and gruesome end the gossip would heat to a fever pitch that would be fun as he emptied the last of the lamp oil he saw his knife where hed left it beside the overturned cabinet he tossed the empty lamp on the heap of ruin and bent to retrieve his knife it was a mess couldnt have an omelet without breaking eggs his mother always said she said it a lot in this case oba thought her tired old saw fit with one hand he took latheas favorite chair and tossed it into the center of the room then began carefully cleaning his blade on the quilted throw from the chair his knife was a valuable tool and he kept it razor sharp he was relieved to see the shine returning when the blood and slop was wiped off hed heard that magic could be troublesome in untold ways oba had briefly worried that the sorceress might be made up of some kind of dreadful acid sorceressblood that once spilled would eat through steel he looked around no just regular blood lots of it yes the sensation this would create would be exciting but he didnt like the idea of soldiers coming around to ask questions they were a suspicious lot soldiers they would poke their noses into it sure as cows gave milk they would spoil everything with their suspicion and questions he didnt think that soldiers appreciated omelets no best if latheas house burned down that wouldnt provide nearly the enjoyment that all the conversation and scandal would but it also wouldnt be so suspicious peoples houses burned down all the time especially in winter logs rolled out of fireplaces spilling flaming coals sparks shot into curtains and set homes ablaze candles melted down and fell catching things on fire happened all the time not really suspicious a fire in the dead of winter with all the lightning and sparks the sorceress sent flying willynilly it was a wonder the place hadnt already burned down the woman was a menace of course someone might notice the blaze way down at the end of the road but by then it would be too late by then the fire would be too hot for anyone to be able to come near the place tomorrow if no one found the place ablaze there would be nothing but ashes he let out a sad sigh for the stillborn gossip for what might have been if not for the tragic fire that would be blamed for latheas end oba knew about fires over the years several of his homes had burned down their animals had been burned alive that was back when they had lived in other towns before they moved to the place where they lived now oba liked to watch a place bum liked to hear the animals scream he liked it when people came running all in a panic they always seemed puny in the face of what he created people were afraid when there was a fire the uproar caused by a burning building always swelled him with a sense of power sometimes as they yelled for more help men would throw buckets of water on the fire or beat at the roaring flames with blankets but that never stopped a fire oba had started he wasnt slipshod he always did good work he knew what he was doing finally finished cleaning and polishing his knife he threw the bloody quilted throw on the oilsoaked wood beside the overturned cabinet what was left of lathea was nailed to the back of the cabinet that lay facedown on the floor she stared at the ceiling oba grinned soon there would be no ceiling for her to stare up at his grin widened and no eyes to stare with oba saw a glint of light on the floor beside the cabinet he bent and recovered the small object it was a gold coin oba had never seen a gold mark before that night it must have fallen from the pocket of latheas dress along with the others he slipped the gold coin into his own pocket where hed put the rest he had collected from the floor hed also found a fat purse under her sleeping pallet lathea had made him rich who knew that the sorceress had been so wealthy some of that money earned by his mother from her spinning and used for his hated cures had at last returned to oba justice finally done as oba started for the fireplace he heard the soft but unmistakable crunch of footsteps in the snow outside he froze in midstride the footsteps were coming closer they were approaching the door to latheas house who would be coming to latheas place this late at night that was just plain inconsiderate couldnt they wait until morning for their cures couldnt they let the poor woman get her rest some people only thought of themselves oba snatched up the poker leaning against the fireplace and quickly spilled the burning oak logs out of the hearth and across the oilsoaked floor the oil the splintered wood the bedsheets and the quilted throw caught flame with a woosh dense white smoke swirled up around latheas pyre quick as a fox oba scurried out the hole that the troublesome sorceress had conveniently blown through the back wall when she had tried to kill him with her magic she didnt know that he had become invincible jennsen was pulled up short when sebastian caught her by the arm she turned to see his face in the dim light coming from the only window that orange glow danced in his eyes she knew immediately by his serious expression that she should remain silent sebastian noiselessly drew his sword as he slipped past her on his way to the door in that smooth practiced movement she saw a professional a man familiar with such business he leaned to the side trying for a look through the window without having to step into the deep snow below it he turned back and whispered fire jennsen rushed to him huffy she might be asleep we have to warn her sebastian considered for only an instant then burst through the door jennsen was right on his heels she had difficulty making sense of what she saw inside the place was washed in whirling orange light that cast monstrous shadows up the walls in that wavering light everything seemed surreal out of scale and out of place when she spotted the debris in the center of the room it became only too real she saw a womans open hand sticking out beyond the top of what looked to be a tall wooden cabinet that had fallen jennsen drew a choking gasp of smoke and the smell of lamp oil thinking that maybe e cabinet had toppled and hurt the old sorceress jennsen rushed to help as she raced around the foot of the splintered chest she caught the full view of what was left of lathea the shock of it stiffened her she couldnt move couldnt blink her wide eyes she gagged on the sickly stench of butchery and blood as jennsen stared her anguished cry was lost in the leaping roar of flames and crackle of burning wood sebastian briefly took in the remains of lathea nailed to the back of the cabinet only one detail of many as his gaze scanned the room by his calculated movements she surmised that he had seen such things enough that the human element no longer arrested his attention as it did hers jennsen jennsens fingers tightened around the hilt of her knife she could feel the ornately worked ridges of metal pressing against her palm the worked metal peaks and whorls that made up the letter r as she gasped her breath past the nausea welling up inside she pulled the blade free surrender theyve been here she whispered the dharan soldiers have been here what she detected in his eyes was more like surprise or confusion than anything else he frowned as he glanced around again do you really think so jennsen she ignored the echo of the dead voice in her head and thought back to the man they had met out on the road after they had come to see the sorceress the first time he was big blond and goodlooking like most dharan soldiers she hadnt thought at the time that he was a soldier could he have been one though no if anything he had seemed more intimidated by them than they were of him soldiers didnt behave the way that man had who else we didnt see all of them before it had to be the rest of the quad from back at my house when we escaped out the back way they must have somehow followed us he was still peering about as the flames grew now licking at the ceiling i guess you could be right surrender sebastian we have to get out of here now or well be next jennsen clutched the cloak at his shoulder pulling him away they may be nearright now but how could they know dear spirits lord rahl is a wizard how does he do anything he does how did he find my house sebastian was still looking prodding at the rubble with his sword jennsen tugged again at his cloak urging him toward the open door your house he said frowning yes i see what you mean we have to get out of here before they catch us he nodded reassuring her where do you want to go they both watched the dark doorway over their shoulders as well as the growing conflagration to their other side weve no choice now jennsen said lathea was our only hope to find an answer we have to go to the peoples palace now find her sister althea shes the only one with any answers shes a sorceress too and the only one who can see the holes in the worldwhatever that means are you sure thats what you want to do she thought about the voice it sounded so cold and lifeless in her head it had surprised her she hadnt heard it since her mothers murder what other choice do we have now if im ever to know why lord rahl wants to kill me why he murdered my mother why im hunted and maybe how to escape his clutches for good then i have to go find this woman althea i have to he hurried with her through the door and out into the bitter night we better go back and get our things together we can get an early start with them this close i fear to be trapped in the inn while we sleep i have the money from my mother you have what you took from the men we can buy horses we have to leave tonight and hope that no one saw us come here earlier or again now sebastian sheathed his sword his breath streamed out into the night as he considered their options he glanced back through the door with the fire at least there wont be any evidence of what happened here we have that much going for us no one saw us come here earlier so no one will have cause to ask us questions no one will know we were here again they wont have any reason to tell soldiers about us as long as we get out of here before its discovered and everyone gets suspicious jennsen said before soldiers start asking about strangers in town he took her arm all right lets be quick then chapter wi wasnt this just something stranger and stranger this night was full of new things one right after another from his hiding place just around the comer of the house oba had been able to hear much of the conversation between the two at first he had been sure they would run off to get help oba didnt think the fire could be extinguished but for a time he had been concerned fearing that the man and woman might pull lathea out of the houserescue her from the blaze so that people could have a look it would be just like the troublesome sorceress to find a way to come back to torment him and after all his work but both the man and the woman wanted to leave lathea to the fire they too hoped the fire would cover the evidence of the sorceresss true end they almost sounded like thieves the woman talking about taking money from her mother and him taking money from men that sounded suspicious if they had found gold and silver there they might have taken it had they worked and slaved their whole lives as he had to finally recover money that was their due or had they been forced to suffer the abuse of swallowing latheas cursed cures their whole life oba didnt think so it had been different for him he had simply recovered money that was rightfully his all along he felt a little indignant to be almost in the company of common thieves this night was just one startling thing after another it seemed amazing to him how his life had gone along day after day month after month year after year always the same same chores same work same everything now in one night all that seemed to have changed first he had become invincible and in so doing unleashed his righteous inner self only to discover that rahl blood coursed through his veins and now this odd pair showed up to help him conceal latheas true end stranger and stranger the startling news that he was in fact the son of darken rahl still had him in a state of astonished shock he oba schalk as it turned out was someone quite important someone of noble blood someone of noble birth he wondered whether or not he should now properly think of himself as oba rahl he wondered if he was in fact a prince that was an intriguing notion unfortunately his mother had raised him simply so he didnt know much about such matters what station or title was rightfully his he also realized that his mother was a liar she had hidden his true identity from her own son her flesh and blood darken rahls flesh and blood she was probably resentful and envious and didnt want oba to know of his greatness that would be just like her she was always trying to beat him down the bitch the smoke coming through the open door no longer smelled of lamp oil it now carried the aroma of roasting meat oba grinned as he peeked through the doorway to see latheas hand sticking above the cabinet blackening in the flames waving to him from the world of the dead sneaking across the snow to hide behind the fat trunk of an oak oba watched as the couple hurried down the path through the trees toward the road when they had passed out of sight he followed in their tracks staying hidden he was a pretty big man to hide behind a tree but in the darkness it wasnt difficult he was puzzled and troubled by certain aspects of the encounter he had been surprised that the couple wouldnt want to call for help and instead ran away the woman especially was eager to escape thinking that because of latheas death someone was after them a quad she had said that was part of what troubled him oba had vaguely heard of quads before assassins of some sort assas sins sent by the lord rahl himself assassins sent after important people or people who were especially dangerous maybe that was it they were dangerous people and not common thieves after all oba had heard her namejennsen but the thing that had really perked up his ears was that lathea had a sister named altheayet another cursed sorceressand althea was the only one who could see the holes in the world that was most troubling of all because that was the very same thing that lathea had said to him at the time he had thought the old sorceress was already conversing with the spirits in the world of the dead or maybe with the keeper of the underworld himself but as it turned out she was speaking the truth somehow this jennsen woman and oba were both what lathea called holes in the world that sounded important this jennsen was somehow like him they were somehow connected that fascinated him he wished he had gotten a better look at her the first meeting had been in darkness the second time he saw her just now the fire had provided only enough light for a dim and shadowed view as she had turned away he only had time for a quick glimpse from that fleeting look hed seen that she was a remarkably beautiful young woman he paused behind a tree before making his way across the open snow toward the concealment of a more distant tree these people like jennsen like oba who were holes in the world were important quads were sent after important peoplepeople who were especially dangerous to the lord rahl lathea had said that if he knew of oba the lord rahl would want to exterminate him oba didnt know if he believed lathea she would be jealous of anyone more important than herself still he might be in some kind of danger without even knowing ithunted because he was an important man that seemed pretty farfetched but in view of all the other new things he had learned this night he didnt think it was entirely out of the question an important man a man interested in leaming new things didnt just dismiss such new information without giving it due consideration oba was still trying to connect together all the things he had learned it was all very complicatedthat much he did know he had to take everything into account if he was to put it all together as he scurried to the next tree he decided that it might be best if he went to the inn and got a better look at jennsen and sebastian the man with her his eyes tracked them as they reached the road that headed back into town even though the couple kept looking around it wasnt difficult in such darkness for oba to follow them without being seen once they were back among the buildings it was even easier from around the corner of one building oba saw the light spill out into the road when they opened the door below a metal mug swinging in the wind laughter and music spilled out toolike a celebration of the sorceresss demise too bad everyone didnt know that oba was the hero who had done away with the bane of all their lives if people knew what he had managed to accomplish he would probably have all the free drinks he could want he watched as jennsen and sebastian were swallowed inside the door thudded shut the stillness of the winter night returned oba never got a chance to go to an inn for a drink he never had any money he had money now he had had a hard night but he had emerged a new man a rich man wiping his nose on his jacket sleeve he made for the door it was time for him to go to a cozy inn and have a drink if anyone deserved one it was oba rahl jennsen suspiciously scanned the faces at the inn looking for any that might betray murderous design she still felt sick from the sight of what had been done to lathea this night there were monsters about men looked her way but the twinkle in their eyes seemed merry not murderous but how would she know before it was too late she ached to take the stairs two at a time easy sebastian whispered apparently believing she was on the verge of panicked flight maybe she was his grip on her arm tightened lets not make people suspicious they took the stairs one at a time moving at a measured pace just a couple going to their room in their room jermsen burst into motion gathering the few items they had removed from their packs replacing them securing the straps and buckles even sebastian checking his weapons beneath his cloak seemed unnerved by what had happened to lathea jennsen made sure that her knife was free in its scabbard you sure you wouldnt like to get some sleep lathea couldnt have told them anythingshe didnt know we were staying here at the inn it might be better to start fresh at dawn she shot him a look as she shouldered her pack right he said he caught her arm jennsen slow down if you run people will want to know why youre running he was in enemy territory he would know how to go about the business of not raising suspicion jennsen nodded what should i do just act like were going down for a drink or to listen to the music if you insist on going directly out walk dont call attention to us by running maybe were just going to visit a friend or relativewhos to say but we dont want people to wonder if theres something wrong people forget normal they remember when things look wrong abashed she nodded again i guess im not very good at this closeup running i mean ive been running and hiding my whole life but not like this when theyre so close i can almost feel their breath on my neck he smiled that warm smile of his the one that looked so good on him you arent trained in this kind of thing i wouldnt expect you to know how to act even so i dont think ive ever met another woman who was as good as you are under such pressure youre doing fineyou really are jennsen felt a little better to know that she wasnt acting like a complete fool he had a way about him that gave her confidence put her at ease made her able to do things she didnt think she could he let her decide on her own what it was she wanted to do and then he backed up her decision not many men would do that for a woman down the steps once again for the last time she could feel the door on the other side of the room as if she were drowning and it was the only air people so close brushing against her still made her uneasy made her feel the desperate need for that air she had learned earlier though that the men werent the threat she had thought she was somewhat humbled by how wrong she had been about them where before she had seen thieves and cutthroats she now saw farmers craftsmen laborers joining together for company companionship and some harmless recreation still there were killers somewhere close this night after seeing lathea there could be no doubt of that jennsen could never have imagined that anyone could be that perverted she knew that if they caught her they would eventually do those kinds of things to her too before she was allowed to die she felt her stomach roil with nausea at the vivid memory of what she had seen she held back her tears but she needed the air of outdoors and the solitude of the night as she and sebastian wound their way through the crowd and toward that air she bumped into a big man as they crossed paths stopped by the human wall she looked up into the handsome face she remembered him he was the man they had seen on the road to latheas place earlier he lifted his cap in greeting evening he grinned at her good evening she said she told herself to smile and make it believable normal she wasnt sure if she was doing a good job of it but he seemed to find it convincing he didnt act as shy as she thought he had seemed before even the way he carried himself his movements were more sure maybe it was just that her smile was working as she had hoped you two look like you could use a drink when jermsen frowned not knowing what the man meant he gestured at her face and then at sebastian your noses are red with the cold may i buy you an ale on this chill night before sebastian could accept which she feared he might she said thank you no we have to go to check on some business but it was very kind of you to offer she made herself smile again thank you the way the man stared at her made her nervous the thing was she found herself staring back into his blue eyes just as intently and she didnt know why finally she broke the gaze and after a bow of her head to bid the big man a good night made her way toward the door something about him look familiar she whispered to sebastian yes we saw him earlier out on the streets when we were on our way to latheas house she looked back over her shoulder peering between the milling throng i guess maybe thats all it is then before she went out the door the man as if he sensed her looking at him turned when their eyes met and he smiled it was as if no one else existed for either of them his smile was polite no more but it made her go cold and tingly all over the way the dead voice in her head sometimes did there was something frightening familiar about the feeling she got looking at him and the way he looked at her something about the look in his eyes reminded her of the voice it was as if she remembered him from a deep dream she had completely forgotten until that very instant the sight of him in her awake life left her shaken she was relieved to make it out into the empty night and be on their way she bundled her cloaks hood close around her face against the bitter wind as they hurried across the snow and down the street her thighs stung with the cold she was glad the stable was not far but she knew that would be only a brief respite it was going to be a long cold night but there was no choice lord rahls men were too close they had to run while sebastian went to rouse the stableman jennsen squeezed through the barn door a lantern hanging from a beam provided enough light for her to make her way to the pen where betty was tied up for the night the shelter from the wind along with the warm bodies of the horses and the sweet smell of hay and dusty wood made the stable a cozy haven betty bleated plaintively when she saw jennsen as if she feared she had been abandoned for all time bettys upright tail was a happy blur as jermsen sank to one knee and hugged the goats neck jennsen stood and stroked her hand along the silken ears a touch betty mooned over as the horse in the next stall put her head over the rail to watch her stablemate betty stood on her hind legs joyful to be reunited with her lifelong friend and eager to be closer jermsen patted the wiry hair on bettys fat middle theres a good girl she urged the lovable goat down glad to see you too betty jennsen at ten had been there for bettys birth and had named her betty had been jennsens only childhood friend and had listened patiently to any number of worries and fears when her short horns first began to come in betty had in turn rubbed and comforted her head against her faithful friend other than her worry of being abandoned by her lifelong companion bettys fears in life were few jennsen groped through her pack until her fingers located a carrot for the everhungry goat betty danced about as she watched then with her tail wagging in excitement accepted the treat for reassurance after the torment of an unusual separation she rubbed the top of her head against jermsens thigh while chewing the carrot the horse in the next stall her bright intelligent eyes watching neighed softly and tossed her head jennsen smiled and gave the horse a carrot along with a rub on her white blaze jermsen heard the jangle of tack as sebastian returned along with the stableman both carrying saddles each man in turn laid his load over the rail of bettys stall betty still wary of sebastian backed a few steps sorry to lose the company of your friend there the man said indicating the goat as he came up beside sebastian jennsen scratched bettys ears i appreciate her care not much care the night isnt over the mans gaze shifted from sebastian to jennsen why do you two want to leave in the night anyway and why do you want to buy horses especially at this hour jennsen froze in panic she hadnt expected to have anyone question her and so she had no answer prepared its my mother sebastian said in a confidential tone he let out a convincing sigh we just got word that shes taken ill they dont know if shell last until we can get there i wouldnt be able to live with myself if i didnt well well just have to make it in time thats all the mans suspicious expression softened with sympathy jennsen was surprised at how credible sebastian sounded she tried to imitate his look of concern i understand son im sorryi didnt realize what can i do to help which two horses can you sell us sebastian asked the man scratched his whiskered chin you going to leave the goat sebastian said yes at the same time jennsen said no the mans big dark eyes looked from one to the other betty wont slow us down jennsen said she can keep up well make it to your mother just the same sebastian leaned a hip against the rail i guess the goat will be leaving with us with a sigh of disappointment the man gestured to the horse jennsen was scratching behind the ear rusty here gets on well with that goat of yours i guess shed be as good to sell as any of the others youre a tall girl so she would fit you well jermsen nodded her agreement betty as if she had understood every word bleated hers i have a strong chestnut gelding that would better carry your weight he said to sebastian petes down the way there on the right id be willing to let you have him along with rusty here whys she called rusty jennsen asked dark as it is in here you cant see so well but shes a red roan about as red as they come all except that white blaze on her forehead rusty sniffed betty betty licked rustys muzzle the horse snorted softly in response rusty it is sebastian said and the other then the stableman scratched his stubble again and nodded to seal the agreement ill go get pete when they returned jermsen was pleased to see pete nuzzle a greeting against rustys shoulder with danger close on their heels the last thing she wanted to have to worry about was handling bickering horses but these two were friendly enough the two men hurried at their work a mother lay dying after all riding with a blanket on her lap promised to be a welcome relief from traveling on foot a horse would help keep her warm and make the night ahead more tolerable they had a long rope for betty who tended to get distracted by things along the way edible things especially jennsen didnt know what sebastian had to pay for the horses and tack nor did she care it was money that had come from her mothers killers and would get them away getting away was all that mattered with a wave to the stableman as he held the big door open for them they rode out into the frigid night both horses apparently pleased at the prospect of activity despite the hour stepped briskly along the street rusty turned her head back making sure that betty at their left was keeping up it wasnt long before they passed the last building on their way out of town thin clouds raced before the rising moon but left enough light to turn the snowcovered road to a silk ribbon between the thick darkness of the woods along each side bettys rope suddenly jerked tight jennsen looked over her shoulder expecting to see the goat trying to nibble at a young branch instead betty her legs stiff had her hooves dug in resisting any progress betty jennsen whispered harshly come on whats wrong with you come on the goats weight was no match for the horse so she was dragged down the snowy road against her will when sebastians horse stepped over jostling rusty jennsen saw the trouble they were overtaking a man walking down the road in his dark clothing they hadnt seen him at the right side against the dark of the trees knowing that horses didnt like surprises jennsen patted rustys neck to assure her that the man wasnt anything to be frightened of betty though remained unconvinced and used all the rope available to swing a wide arc jennsen saw then that it was the big blond man from the inn the man who had offered to buy them a drinkthe man she thought for some reason should dwell only in her dream life rather than in her waking life jennsen kept an eye on the man as they passed him as cold as she was it felt as if a door opened into the infinitely colder eternal night of the underworld sebastian and the stranger exchanged a brief greeting in passing once beyond the man betty scampered ahead pulling at her rope eager to put distance between her and the man grushdeva du kalt misht jennsen her breath caught fast at the end of a gasp turned to stare wideeyed at the man walking down the road behind it sounded like it had been he whod spoken the words that was impossible those were the strange words from inside her head sebastian made no notice of it so she didnt say anything lest he think her crazy with bettys agreement jennsen urged her horse to pick up the pace just before they rounded a bend and were away jennsen looked back one last time in the moonlight she saw the man grinning at her chapter oba was throwing a hay bale down from the loft when he heard his mothers voice oba where are you get down here oba scurried down the ladder he brushed hay from himself as he straightened before her waiting scowl what is it mama wheres my medicine and your cure her glare swept across the floor i see you still havent gotten the mess out of the barn i didnt hear you come home last night what took you so long look at that stanchion rail havent you fixed that yet what have you been doing all this time do i have to tell you every little thing oba wasnt sure which question he was supposed to answer first she always did that to him confused him before he could answer her when he faltered she would then insult and ridicule him after all he had learned the night before and all that had happened he thought that he might feel more confident when he faced his mother in the light of day standing back in the bam with his mother gathered before him like a thunderhead he felt much the same as he always did before her storming onslaught ashamed small worthless he had felt big when he came home important now he felt as if he were shrinking her words shriveled him well i was you was dawdling thats what you was doingdawdling here i am waiting for my medicine my knees aching me and my son oba the oaf is kicking a rock down the road forgetting what i sent him for i didnt forget then wheres my medicine where is it mama i didnt get it i knew it i knew you was spending the money i gave you i worked my fingers to the bone at spinning to earn that and you go wasting it on women whoring thats what you was doing whoring no mama i didnt waste it on women then wheres my medicine why didnt you get it like i told you to i couldnt because you mean you wouldnt you worthless oaf you only had to go to latheas lathea is dead there hed said it it was out and in the light of day his mothers mouth hung open but no words rained out he had never seen her go silent like that before seen her so shocked that her jaw just hung he liked it oba fished a coin from his pocket one he had set aside to return so she wouldnt think hed spent her money amid the drama of such a rare silence he handed her the coin dead lathea she stared at the coin in her palm what do you mean dead she went ill oba shook his head feeling his confidence build as he thought about what he had done to lathea how hed handled the troublesome sorceress no mama her house burned down she was killed in the fire her house burned his mothers brow drew together how do you know she died lathea isnt likely to be caught unawares by a fire the woman is a sorceress oba shrugged well all i know is that when i went to town i heard a ruckus people were running toward her house we all found the place ablaze a big crowd gathered around but the fire was so hot that there was no chance of saving the place that last part was to a degree true he had started to leave town headed home because he figured that if no one had spotted the fire maybe they wouldnt until morning he didnt want to be the one to start yelling fire in light of history that might look suspicious especially to his mother she was a suspicious woman one of her many peevish traits oba had planned on simply telling his mother the story of what he knew was bound to happen anyway the blazing ruins the charred body found but as he had been walking home after his visit to the inn not long after that jennsen woman and the man with her sebastian passed by leaving town on their journey to find althea he heard people yelling that there was a fire down at latheas place oba ran down the long dark road with the rest of the people toward the orange glow off in the trees he was just a bystander same as everyone else there was no reason to suspect him of anything maybe lathea escaped the flames his mother sounded more like she was trying to convince herself than him oba shook his head i stayed hoping the same as you mama i knew youd want me to help her if she was hurt i stayed to do what i could thats why i was so late that too was partly true he had stayed along with the crowd watching the fire listening to the talk he had savored the crowds anticipation the gossip the speculation shes a sorceress fire isnt likely to catch such a woman his mother was starting to sound suspicious oba had figured on this he leaned a little toward her when the fire burned out enough some of us men threw snow down so we could get in over the smoking rubble inside we found latheas bones oba pulled a blackened finger bone from his pocket he held it out offering it to his mother she stared down at the grim evidence but folded her arms without taking it pleased with the effect it had oba finally returned the treasure to his pocket she was in the middle of the room with one hand lifted above her head like she had tried to make it to the door but was overcome by the smoke the men said that a fires smoke was what put folks down and then the fire got at them that must have been what happened to lathea the smoke got her then laying there on the floor reaching toward the door the fire burned her to death his mother glared at him her mean little mouth all pinched up but silent for once she had no words he found her glare though was just as bad in the daggers of that glare he could tell that she was thinking he was no good her bastard boy darken rahls bastard son almost royalty her arms slipped from their sullen knot as she turned away i have to get back to my spinning for mr tuchmann you get this mess scooped off the floor you hear i will mama and you had better get that stanchion fixed before i come back and see that youve been loafing away the day for several days oba worked at the frozen muck on the floor but made little headway the weather had stayed bitterly cold so the frozen mound if anything had only hardened his efforts at wearing it down seemed interminable like trying to chip away granite ledge or his mothers stony disposition he had his other chores of course and he couldnt let them go he had fixed the stanchion and a broken hinge on the barn door the animals had to be attended to along with a hundred other small things in his head as he worked he planned the construction of their fireplace he would use the back wall between the house and barn since it was already existing mentally he stacked stones against it creating the shape of the firebox he already had his eye on a long stone to use for the lintel he would mortar everything all together properly when oba set his mind to doing something he put his all into it he didnt do any job he started just halfway in his minds eye he pictured how surprised and happy his mother would be when she saw what hed built them she would recognize his worth then she would finally acknowledge his value but he had other work to do before he could begin to build a fireplace one job in particular loomed before him the surface of the mound of frozen muck in the barn showed the scars of the battle it was now pocked with holes places where he had been able to find a weakness a place with air or dry straw underneath that had allowed him to break out a chunk each time a piece went pop and came lose he was sure that he had at last found a way into the formidable tomb of ice but each time had been a false hope chipping away with the scoop shovel was slow going but oba was not a quitter the worry had come to him that perhaps a man of his importance should not be wasting his time on such menial labor frozen manure hardly seemed the province of a man who was in all likelihood something akin to a prince at the least he now knew he was an important man a man with rahl blood in his veins a direct descendantthe sonof the man who had ruled dhara darken rahl there probably wasnt a single person who had not heard of darken rahl obas father sooner or later he would confront his mother with the truth she had been keeping from himthe truth of the man he really was he just couldnt figure how to do it without her discovering that lathea had spilled the news before she spilled her blood winded from a particularly spirited attack on the frozen mound oba rested his forearms on the shovels handle while he caught his breath despite the cold sweat trickled down from his matted blond hair oba the oaf said his mother as she strode into the barn standing around doing nothing thinking nothing worth nothing thats you isnt it oba the oaf t she glided to a stop her mean little mouth all puckered up as she peered down her nose at him mama i was just catching my breath he pointed around at the chips of ice littering the floor evidence of his strenuous efforts ive been working at it mama i have she didnt look she was glaring at him he waited knowing she had something more on her mind than the mound of frozen muck he always knew when she was on a mission to trouble him to make him feel like the muck he stood in from the dark crevices and hideyholes around the barn the rats watched with their little black rat eyes with her critical gaze locked on him his mother held out a coin she held it between her thumb and first finger not simply to convey the coin itself but its importance oba was a little bewildered lathea was dead there was no other sorceress anywhere close none that he knew of anyway who could provide his mothers medicineor his cure he obediently turned his palm up anyway look at it she commanded dropping the coin into his hand oba held it out to the light of the doorway scrutinizing it with care he knew she expected him to find somethingwhat he didnt know he turned it over as he cautiously stole a glance at her he carefully inspected the other side but still saw nothing out of the ordinary yes mama notice anything unusual about it oba no mama it doesnt have a scratch along the edge oba puzzled that over for a moment then looked again at the coin this time carefully inspecting the edge no mama thats the coin you gave back to me oba nodded having no reason to doubt her yes mama the coin you gave me for lathea but i told you lathea died in the fire so i couldnt buy your medicine thats why i gave you your coin back her hot glare was murderous but her voice was arrestingly cool and collected it isnt the same coin oba oba grinned sure it is mama the coin i gave you had a mark on the edge a mark i put there obas grin withered as his mind raced he tried to think of what to saywhat he could saythat she would believe he couldnt contend that he put the coin in a pocket and then pulled out a different coin when he gave it back to her because he never had any money of his own she knew very well that he didnt have any money she wouldnt allow it she thought he was no good and that he might waste it but he had money now he had all the money from latheaa fortune he remembered hurriedly gathering up all the coins that had spilled from latheas pocket including the coin hed only just given her when he later set aside a coin to return to his mother he hadnt known that she had marked the one shed given him oba had the bad luck of returning a different coin than the one she had originally given him but mama are you sure maybe you only thought you marked the coin maybe you forgot she slowly shook her head no i marked it so that if you spent it on drinking or on women i would know because i could go look for it if i had to and see what you had done the conniving bitch she didnt even trust her own son what kind of mother was she anyway what proof did she have other than a missing tiny scratch on the edge of a coin none the woman was a lunatic but mama you must be wrong i dont have any moneyyou know i dont where would i get a different coin thats what id like to know her eyes were frightening he could hardly breathe under their blistering scrutiny her voice though remained composed i told you to buy medicine with that money how could i lathea died i gave you your coin back she looked so broad and powerful standing there before him like an avenging spirit in the flesh come to speak for the dead maybe latheas spirit had returned to tell on him he hadnt considered that possibility that would be just like the troublesome sorceress she was sneaky this miht be just what she had done intent on denying him his importance his due prestige do you know why i named you oba no mama its an ancient dharan name did you know that oba no mama his curiosity got the best of him what does it mean it means two things servant and king i named you oba hoping you might someday be a king and if not then you would at least be a servant of the creator fools are rarely made kings you will never be a king that was just a silly dream of a new mother that leaves servant who do you serve oba oba knew verv well who he served in so doing he had become invin cible where did you get this coin oba i told you mama i couldnt get your medicine because lathea had died in the fire at her place maybe the mark on your coin rubbed off against something in my pocket she seemed to consider his words are you sure oba oba nodded hoping that maybe he was at last turning her mind away from the coin mixup of course mama lathea died thats why i gave you your coin back i couldnt get your medicine his mother lifted an eyebrow really oba she slowly drew her hand from the pocket of her dress he couldnt see what it was she had but he was relieved that he was finally bringing her around thats right mama lathea was dead he found he liked saying that really oba you couldnt get the medicine you wouldnt lie to your mother would you oba e shook his head emphatically no mama then whats this she turned over her hand and held out the bottle of medicine lathea had oven him before he had dealt with her i found this in your jacket pocket oba oba stared at the cursed bottle at the troublesome sorceresss revenge he should have killed the woman right off before she gave him the telltale bottle of medicine he had completely forgotten that he had put it in a pocket of his jacket intending to toss it in the woods on his way home that night what with all the important new things he had been leaming he had completely forgotten about the cursed bottle of medicine well i think i think it must be an old bottle and old bottle its full her razoredged voice was back how did you manage to get a bottle of medicine from a woman who was deadin her house that had already burned down how oba and how is it that you gave me back a different coin than the one i gave you to pay with how she took a step closer how oba oba backed a step he couldnt pull his eyes away from the cursed cure he couldnt look up into his mothers fierce eyes if he did he just knew she would wither him to tears under her deadly glare well i well i what oba well i what you filthy bastard boy you worthless lazy lying bastard boy you wretched scheming vile bastard boy oba schalk obas eyes turned up he was right she had him fixed in her deadly glare but he had become invincible oba rahl he said she didnt flinch he realized then that she had been goading him into admitting he knew it was all part of her scheme that name rahl screamed out how he had come to know it betraying everything to his mother oba stood frozen his mind in a wild state of turmoil like a rat with a foot on his tail the spirits curse me she said under her breath i should have done what lathea always told me i should have spared us all you killed her you loathsome bastard you contemptible lying quick as a fox oba whipped the shovel around putting all his weight and strength behind the swing the steel shovel rang like a bell against her skull she dropped like a sack of grain pushed out of the loftwhump oba rapidly retreated a step fearful she might skitter toward him spiderlike and with her mean little mouth bite him on the ankle he was positive that she was fully capable of it the conniving bitch lightning quick he darted forward and whacked her again with the shovel right on the same place on her broad forehead then retreated out of range of her teeth before she could bite him like a spider he often thought of her as a spider a black widow the ring of steel on skull hung in the otherwise still air of the barn slowly slowly slowly dying away silence like a heavy shroud settled around him oba stood poised shovel cocked back over his shoulder ready to swing again he watched her carefully nearly clear pinkish fluid leaked from both her ears out across the frozen muck in a frenzy of fear and rage he ran forward and swung the shovel at her head over and over the ringing blows of steel on bone echoed around the barn creating one long clangorous din the rats watching with their little black rat eyes scurried for their holes oba staggered back gasping for air after the violent effort of silencing her he panted as he watched her still form sprawled atop the mound of frozen muck her arms were spread out wide to each side as if asking for a hug the sneaky bitch she might be up to something trying to make amends probably offering a hug as if that could make up for the times hed spent in the pen her face looked different she had an odd expression he tiptoed closer for a look her skull was all msshapen like a ripe melon broken on the ground this was so new that he couldnt gather his thoughts mama her melon head all broke open for good measure he whacked her three more times quick as he could then retreated to a safe distance shovel at the ready should she suddenly spring up to start yelling at him that would be just like her sneaky the woman was a lunatic the barn remained silent he saw his breath puffing out in the cold air no breath came from his mother her chest was still the crimson pool around her head oozed down the muck mound some of the holes hed chopped filled with the runny contents of her curious melon head all broken open on the ground oba began to feel more confident then that his mother was not going to say hateful things to him anymore his mother not being too smart had probably gone along with latheas nagging and had been talked into hating him her only son the two women had ruled his life he had been nothing but the helpless servant of the two harpies fortunately he had finally become invincible and had rescued himself from them both do you want to know who i serve mama i serve the voice that made me invincible the voice that rid me of you his mother had nothing more to say at long last she had nothing more to say then oba grinned he pulled out his knife he was a new man a man who pursued intellectual interests when they arose he thought he should have a look at what other odd and curious things might be found inside his lunatic mother oba liked to learn new things oba was eating a nice lunch of eggs cooked in the hearth he had started to build for himself when he heard a wagon rumbling into the yard it had been over a week since his sneaky mother had opened her mean little mouth for the last time oba went to the door opened it a crack and stood eating his eggs as he peered out to see the rear of a wagon pulled up close by a man climbed down it was mr tuchmann who regularly brought wool obas mother was a spinster who made thread for mr tuchmann he used the thread on his loom with so many new things demanding his attention lately oba had forgotten all about mr tuchmann oba glanced over to the comer to see how much thread his mother had ready not much bales of wool sat to the side waiting to be spun into thread the least his mother could have done would be to attend to her work before she started in causing trouble oba didnt know what to do when he looked back to the doorway mr tuchmann was standing right there looking in he was a tall man thin with a big nose and ears his hair was graying and as curly as the wool he dealt in he was recently widowed oba knew that his mother liked mr tuchmann maybe he could have leached some of the venom from her fangs softened her a bit it was an interesting theory to contemplate afternoon oba his eyes eyes that oba had always found curiously liquid were peering in the crack searching the house is your mother about oba feeling a little violated by the mans roving eyes stood holding the plate of eggs trying to think what to do what to say mr tuchmanns gaze settled on the fireplace oba standing ill at ease behind the door reminded himself that he was a new man an important man important men werent unsure of themselves important men seized the moment and created their own greatness mama oba set down his plate as he glanced to the fireplace oh shes about somewhere woolheaded mr tuchmann stared stonefaced at obas grin for a time you heard about lathea what they found at her place oba thought the man had a mouth kind of like his mother had mean sneaky lathea oba sucked at a piece of egg stuck between his teeth shes dead what could they find more precisely what they didnt find i guess you could say money lathea had money everyone knew that but they found none in her house oba shrugged must have burned up melted mr tuchmann grunted his skepticism maybe maybe not some folks say maybe it was gone before the fire started oba felt indignant that people just couldnt let a thing go didnt they have their own business to mind why couldnt they leave well enough alone they should rejoice that the sorceress was out of their lives and leave it at that they had to keep picking at it though peck peck peck like a gaggle of geese at the grain busybodies thats what they were ill tell mama you were here i need the thread shes spun i have another load of wool for her i need to be on my way got other people waiting the man had a whole bevy of women who spun wool for him didnt he ever give his poor spinsters a chance to catch their breath well im afraid that mama hasnt had time to mr tuchmann was staring at the fireplace again only more intently this time the look on his face was more than curious it bordered on anger the man accustomed to ordering people around and always more bold than oba felt comfortable around stepped through the door and into the house to the center of the room still staring at the fireplace his arm rose pointing whats whats that dear creator oba looked where he was pointingat the new fireplace being built against the stone wall that separated the house from the barn oba thought his work was quite well donesturdy and straight he had studied other fireplaces and learned how they were done even though the chimney wasnt built all the way up yet he was using it he had put it to good advantage oba saw then what mr tuchmann was really pointing at mamas jawbone well wasnt this just something oba hadnt expected visitors especially snoopy visitors what gave this man the right to poke his nose into other peoples houses just because they spun wool for him mr tachmann started backing toward the door oba knew that mr tuchmann would talk about what hed seen the man was a gossip already flapping his tongue to anyone who would listen about latheas missing moneywhich after all was really obas when you considered the lifetime of trouble he had endured to earn it who were all these people coming out of the woodwork to stick up for the troublesome sorceress when mr tuchmann started blabbing about what he saw in the fireplace there were sure to be questions everyone would have to stick their noses in it and want to know whose it was they would probably start fretting over his mother now just like they were doing over the sorceress oba a new man a man of action could hardly let that happen oba was an important man hed learned rahl blood coursed through his veins after all important men actedhandled problems as they arose quickly efficiently decisively oba seized mr tuchmann by the back of his neck halting his retreat the man struggled fiercely he was tall and wiry but he was no match for obas strength or speed with a grunt of effort oba plunged his knife up into mr tuchmanns middle the mans mouth opened wide his eyes always so liquid always so curious went wide as well filled now with a look of terror oba followed the obnoxious mr tachmann to the ground they had work to do oba was never afraid of hard work first there was the struggling woolheaded snoop to deal with then there was the matter of his wagon people would probably come looking for him obas life was getting complicated mr tuchmann called for help oba rammed his knife up into the soft part under mr tuchmanns chin oba leaned over him watched the man struggle knowing he was going to die oba had nothing against mr tuchmann reallyeven though the man was impertinent and bossy this was all that troublesome sorceresss fault she was still making obas life difficult she had probably sent some message to his mother and then to mr tuchmann from beyond in the underworld the bitch then his mother had to get all sneaky and suspicious and now this irksome pest mr tuchmann they were like a swarm of locusts come from nowhere to plague him it was because he was important he knew it was probably time for changes oba couldnt stay around and keep having people who knew him pestering him with questions he was too important to be in this little nothing of a place anyway mr tuchmann grunted in his futile effort to escape it was time for the unhappy widower to join obas lunatic mother and the troublesome sorceress with the keeper of the underworld the world of the dead and then the time had come for oba to take up his important life as a new man and to move on to better places just as the realization struck him that he would never again have to go in the barn and see the mound of frozen muck that he hadnt been able to dislodge with the scoop shovel despite the ranting insistence of his lunatic mother it occurred to him that if he had used the pickaxe that would have made quick work of it well wasnt that just something chapter wh an easy but flawlessly precise turn of his wrist friedrich gilder lifted a leaf of gold on the fine hairs of his brush and laid it over the gold light enough to float on the gentlest breath of air drew down onto the wet gesso as if by magic leaning over his workbench in concentration friedrich used a sheepswool pad to carefully rub the freshly gilded surface of the small stylized carving of a bird checking for any flaws outside the rain occasionally tinktinktinked against the window though midday when the prowling clouds passed bearing fits of rain it darkened as if to dusk from the back room where he worked friedrich glanced up looking out through the doorway into the main room watching the familiar movements of his wife casting her stones over the grace many years ago he had gilded the lines of her grace the eightsided star within a circle within a square within another circleafter she had properly drawn it all out of course the grace would have been useless had he drawn it a grace to be real had to be drawn by one with the gift he enjoyed doing whatever he could to make the things in her life a little more beautiful she was what made his life beautiful he thought that her smile had been gilded by the creator himself friedrich saw too the woman who had ventured to their home for a telling lean forward expectantly absorbed in watching the fall of her fate the pillars of creation if they could really see such things people would not come to althea for a telling yet they always watched intently as the stones rolled from his wifes long slender fingers and out across the board upon which was drawn the grace this woman middleaged and widowed was a pleasant sort and had been to see althea twice before but that had been several years back as he had concentrated on his own work hed absently heard her tell althea about her several grown children who were married and lived close to her and that her first grandchild was on the way now though it was the drop of stones not a child that held the womans interest again she asked it was not a question so much as astonishment they did it again althea said nothing friedrich burnished the freshly laid gold as he listened to the familiar sounds of his wife gathering up her stones from the board do they do that often the woman asked her wide eyes turning from the grace to altheas face althea didnt answer the woman rubbed her knuckles so hard that friedrich thought the skin might come off what does it mean hush althea murmured as she rattled the stones friedrich had never heard his wife be so uncommunicative with a customer the stones clacking in altheas loose fist seemed to have an urgency to their bony knock the woman rubbed her knuckles awaiting her destiny again the seven stones rolled out across the board come to divulge the holy secrets of the fates from where he sat friedrich couldnt see the stones fall but he could hear the familiar sound of their uneven shapes rolling across the board after all these years he rarely watched althea practice her profession that is watched the stones themselves he did though despite the years savor watching althea as he looked out seeing the side of her strong jaw her hair still mostly a golden sweep down past her jaw falling like sunlight over her shoulder he smiled the woman gasped again as if to make the womans point thunder in the distance rolled over the house mistress althea what could it mean her voice carried the unmistakable timbre of apprehension althea on her pillow on the floor leaning on one arm her withered legs out to the side used the arm against the floor to straighten herself she finally looked at the woman terry goodkind it means margery that you are a woman of strong spirit thats one of those two stones me a strong spirit thats right althea confirmed with a nod and the other then it cant be good not there it can only mean the worst i was about to tell you that the other stone which follows with each throw is also a strong spirit a man of strong spirit margery peered again at the stones on the board she rubbed her knuckles but but they both she gestured they both keep going out there to beyond the outer circle to the underworld her troubled eyes searched altheas face althea pulled on her knees drawing her legs before herself to cross them though her legs were withered and nearly useless crossing them before her pillow on the floor helped her sit up straight no no my dear not at all dont you see this is good both strong spirits going through life together and together ever after its the best possible outcome of a telling margery cast another worried look at the board really really mistress althea you think its good then that they keep doing that of course margery good it is two strong spirits joining margery touched a finger to her lower lip as she peered up at althea who is it then who is this mystery man im to meet althea shrugged too soon to tell but the stones say you will meet a manshe made a show of putting her first and second fingers tight togetherand you two will be fast with each other congratulations margery it looks as if you are close to finding the happiness you seek when how soon again althea shrugged too soon to tell the stones only say will not when maybe tomorrow maybe next year but the important thing is that you are near to meeting a man who will be good with you margery you must now keep your eyes open dont hide yourself away in your house or you will miss him but if the stones say the stones say he is strong and he is open to you but they dont fix it sure thats up to you and the man keep yourself open to him when he comes into your life or he may pass without seeing you i will mistress althea the conviction in her voice strengthened i will ill stay prepared so when he happens into my life ill see him and hell see me just as the stones foretell the pillars of creation good the woman fished around in the leather purse hanging from her belt until she found a coin she handed it over eagerly pleased with the outcome of her telling friedrich had watched althea give tellings for nearly four decades in all that time he had never before seen her lie to someone the woman stood holding out her hand may i help you mistress althea thank you my dear but friedrich will help me later i want to stay with my board for now the woman smiled perhaps daydreaming of the new life waiting for her well then id best be on my way before it gets any later in the day before nightfall and then its a long ride back she leaned to the side and waved through the doorway good day master friedrich the rain rattled against the window in earnest the sky he noticed had darkened casting a gray gloom over their place in the swamp rising from his bench friedrich waved let me see you to the door margery you do have someone waiting to take you back dont you my soninlaw is up at the rim of the canyon where the path starts down in waiting with our horses she paused in the doorway and gestured to his work on the bench thats a fine piece youve made friedrich smiled i hope to find a customer at the palace who thinks so too you will you will you do fine work everyone says so those who own a piece of your work count themselves as lucky margery curtsied happily to althea thanking her again before retrieving her lambsskin cloak from the hook by the door she smiled out at the angry sky and donned the cloak drawing its hood over her head eager to be on her way to find her new man it would be a long journey back before closing the door friedrich warned margery to be absolutely certain to stay on the path and to watch her step up out of the canyon she said she remembered the instructions and promised to follow them with care he watched her hurry off disappearing into the shadows and mist before closing the door tight against the foul weather silence settled once more inside the house outside thunder rumbled in a deep voice as if in discontent friedrich shuffled up behind his wife here let me help you to your chair terry goodkind althea had gathered up her stones once again they rattled in her hand like the bones of spirits as considerate as she always was it was unlike her not to acknowledge him when he spoke it was even more unlike her to cast her stones again after a customer left casting her stones for a telling called upon her gift in ways he could not fully understand but he did understand how it fatigued her casting her stones for a telling drew down her strength so that it left her detached from the world and wanting anything but to cast them again for a while now though she was in the spell of some tacit need she turned her wrist and opened her hand casting the stones at her board as easily as gracefully as he handled his ethereal leaves of gold smooth dark irregularshaped stones rolled forth bouncing on the board tumbling across the gilded grace in their life together friedrich had seen her cast her stones tens of thousands of times there were times when much like her customers he had tried to discern a pattern in the fall of the stones he never could althea always did she saw meaning no mere mortal could see she saw in the random fall of the stones some obscure omen only a sorceress could decipher patterns of magic there was no pattern expressed through the act of the throw it was the fall of the stones that was touched by powers he dared not consider powers that spoke only to the sorceress through her gift in that random motif of disorder she could read the flow of powers through the world of life and even he feared the world of the dead although she never spoke of it despite how close they were in body and soul this was one thing they could not share in their life together this time as the stones rolled and wobbled across the board one stopped in the exact center two stopped on opposite comers of the square where it touched the outer circle two ended up at opposite points where the square and the inner circle touched the final two stones came to rest beyond the outer circle which represented the underworld lightning flashed and seconds later thunder clapped friedrich stared in disbelief he wondered what the odds were of the stones coming to the end of their tumble at these specific points on the grace he had never before seen them end in any discernible pattern althea too was staring at her board have you ever seen anything like that before he asked the pillars of creation im afraid so she said under her breath as she raked the stones up with her graceful fingers really he was sure he would have recalled such an unlikely event such a startling orderliness when was that she rattled the stones in her loose fist the four previous throws that casting made five all the same each individual stone coming to rest in the identical place it had before again she cast the stones at the board at the same time the sky seemed to open letting rain roar down on the roof the noise reverberated through the house involuntarily he glanced toward the ceiling briefly before watching along with althea as the stones rolled and bounced across the board the first stone rolled to a halt in the exact center of the grace lightning flashed the other stones rolling in what looked to be a completely natural manner came to rest in what appeared a perfectly normal way except that they stopped in the exact same places they had before six althea said under her breath thunder boomed friedrich didnt know if she was speaking to him or to herself but the first four throws were for that woman margery you were casting them for her this is for her telling even to himself it sounded more like a plea than reason margery came for a telling althea said that does not mean the stones chose to give her one the stones have decided that this telling is for me what does it mean then nothing she said not yet anyway at this point it is only potentiala thunderhead on the horizon the stones may yet say this storrn is to pass us by watching as she gathered up her stones he was overcome with a sense of dread enough of thisyou need to rest why dont you let me help you up now althea ill make you something to eat he watched her pluck the last stone the one in the center off the board leave your stones for now ill make you some nice hot tea he never before thought of the stones as anything sinister now he felt as if they were somehow inviting menace into their lives he didnt want her to cast the stones again he sank down beside her althea hush friedrich she spoke the words in a flat tone not in anger or reproach but simple necessity the rain drummed against the roof with terry goodkind rabid intensity water cascading off the eaves roared darkness out the windows faltered in fits of lightning he listened to the stones rattle like the bones of the dead speaking to her for the first time in their life together he felt a kind of defensive hatred for the seven stones she held as if they were some lover come to steal her away from him from her seat atop her gold and red pillow on the floor althea cast the stones down onto the grace as they tumbled across the board he watched with resignation as they came to rest natural as could be in the exact same places he would have been surprised only if they had fallen differently seven she whispered seven times seven stones thunder rumbled in a deep resonant tone like the voice of discontent of spirits in the underworld friedrich rested a hand on his wifes shoulder a presence had come into their homeinvaded their lives he couldnt see it but he knew it was there he felt a great weariness as if all his years had come at once to weigh him down making him feel very old he wondered if this was in some small way what she felt all the time when she became so weary from casting a telling he shuddered to contemplate always swimming in such emotionally turbulent waters his world his work of gilding seemed so simple so blissful in its ignorance of the swirl of tempestuous forces all around the worst of it though was that he could not protect her from this unseen threat in this he was helpless althea what does it mean she hadnt moved she was staring at the smooth dark stones setting on her grace one who hears the voices is coming lightning ignited in a blinding angry flash illuminating the room with white incandescence the scintillating contrast between bright light and smothering shadow was dizzying the intense strike flickered on as thunder crashed with a boom that shook the ground a ripping crash followed on its heels the clamor adding a confusion of sound to match the flashing of light friedrich swallowed do you know which one she reached up and patted his hand resting on her shoulder tea you say the rain gives me a chill id like some tea he looked from the crinkled smile showing in her eyes to the stones the pillars of creation on the grace for whatever reason she wasnt going to answer that question for now he asked another instead why did your stones fall like that althea what does something like that mean lightning struck nearby the crack of thunder felt as if it split air made of solid stone fists of rain beat against the window in petulant fits althea finally looked away from the window from creations fury and turned back to the board she reached out and placed her forefinger on the stone in the center the creator he guessed aloud before she could name it she shook her head lord rahl but the star in the center represents the creatorhis gift it does in the grace but you must not forget this is a telling this is different a telling only uses the grace and in this telling the stone in the center represents the one with his gift then it could be anyone friedrich said anyone with the gift no the lines coming from the eight points of the star represent the gift as it passes through life through the veil between the worlds and beyond the outer circle into the underworld thus it represents the gift in a sense that it conveys with no other person the gift for magic of both worlds the world of life and the world of the dead additive and subtractive this stone in the center touches both he glanced back at the stone in the center of the grace but why would that mean lord rahl because he is the only one born in three thousand years with both aspects of the gift in all that time until he came into his gift no stone i have cast has ever landed in that place none could what has it been two years now since he succeeded his father less since his gift came to life in himwhich in itself leaves questions with only troubling answers but i recall you telling me years ago that darken rahl used both sides of the gift gazing off into dark memories althea shook her head he also used subtractive powers but he did not do so by birth he offered the pure souls of children to the keeper of the underworld in return for the keepers favors darken rahl had to trade for the limited use of such powers but this man this lord rahl has been born with both sides of the gift as those of old were friedrich wasnt sure what to make of that what danger it could be terry goodkind that he so strongly felt he remembered quite distinctly the day the new lord rahl had risen to power friedrich had been at the palace to sell his small gilded carvings when the great event had taken place that day he had seen the new lord rahl richard it had been one of those moments in life never to be forgottenonly the third rahl to rule in friedrichs lifetime he remembered quite clearly the new lord rahl tall strong with a raptor gaze striding through the palace seeming completely out of place and at the same time belonging and then there was the sword he carried a legendary sword not seen in dhara since friedrich had been a boy way back before the boundaries had been brought into existence cutting dhara off from the rest of the new world the new lord rahl had been walking through the corridors of the peoples palace along with an old mana wizard people saidand a sublime woman the woman with long lush hair wearing a satiny white dress made the grandeur and majesty of the palace seem dull and common by comparison richard rahl and that woman seemed right together friedrich recognized the special way they looked at each other the commitment loyalty and bond in the gray eyes of that man and the green eyes of that woman was as profound as it was unmistakable what of the other stones he asked althea gestured out past the larger circle of the grace where only the gilt rays of the creators gift dared go to the two dark stones sitting in the world of the dead those who hear the voices althea said he nodded at having his suspicions confirmed in such things dealing with magic it wasnt often that he was able to guess the truth from what appeared to be obvious and the rest staring at the four stones resting at the cusps of lines her voice came softly mingling with the rain these are protectors they protect lord rahl they protect us all he saw then the tears rolling down her weathered cheeks pray she whispered that they are enough or the keeper will have us all you mean to say there are only these four who protect us the pillars of creation there are others but these four are pivotal without them everything is lost friedrich licked his lips fearful of the fate of the four sentinels standing against the keeper of the dead althea do you know who they are she turned then putting her arms around him pressing the side of her face to his chest it was as childlike a gesture as he could imagine one that touched his heart and made him ache with his love for her gently he put protective arms around her comforting her in spite of the fact that in truth he could do nothing to protect her from such things as she rightly feared carry me to my chair friedrich he nodded lifting her in his arms as she hugged his neck her withered useless legs dangled a woman of such power as could enforce a warm and rainswept swamp around them in winter yet she needed him to carry her to a chair him friedrich a mere man she loveda man without the gift a man who loved her you didnt answer my question althea her arms tightened on his neck one of the four protective stones she whispered is me friedrichs wide eyes turned back to the grace with the stones upon it his jaw fell open when he saw that one of the four stones had crumbled to ash she had no need to look one was my sister althea said cradled in his arms he felt her grieving sob and now there are three chapter jermsen moved out of the way of the flood of people flowing up the road from the south huddling close to sebastian for shelter from the wind she briefly considered simply curling up on the frozen ground off to the side and going to sleep her stomach grumbled with hunger when rusty stepped sideways jennsen slid her grip up on the reins closer to the bit betty her eyes ears and tail alert pressed up against jennsens thigh for reassurance the footsore goat occasionally huffed her annoyance at the passing throngs when jennsen patted her fat middle bettys upright tail instantly became a wagging blur she glanced up at jennsen swiped her tongue out for a brief lick of rustys muzzle and then folded her legs to lie down at jennsens feet as his sheltering ann enclosed her shoulders sebastian eyed the wagons carts and people moving past on their way toward the peoples palace the sound of the wagons rumbling by people talking and laughing feet shuffling and horses clopping all melted together into a steady drone punctuated by jangling metal and the rhythmic squeaking of axles the clouds of dust lifted by all the movement carried the aroma of food along with the stink of people and animals and left the taste of dirt on her tongue what do you think sebastian asked in a low voice the cold sunrise bathed the distant sheer cliffs of the huge plateau in glowing lavender light the cliffs themselves rose what seemed thousands the pillars of creation of feet from the azrith plains but what man had made atop them rose higher yet countless roofs behind imposing walls collected together into the massive structure that was a city founded on the plateau low winter sunlight lent the soaring marble walls and columns a warm glow jennsen had been little when her mother had taken her away her childhood memory of having lived here had not prepared her adult sensibilities for the actual splendor of the palace the heart of dhara stood noble and proud triumphant above a barren land her awe was dimmed only by the taint of it also being the ancestral home of the lord rahl jennsen swiped a hand over her face closing her eyes briefly against her pounding headache against what it meant to be the prey of lord rahl it had been a difficult and exhausting journey after they had stopped each night sebastian used the cover of darkness to scout while she started to make camp a number of times he had rushed back with the horrifying news that their pursuers were closing in despite exhaustion and her tears of frustration they had to pack up and keep running i think we came here for a reason she finally answered now is a poor time to lose courage now is the last chance to lose courage she studied the note of caution in his blue eyes for only a moment before answering by wading back into the moving river of people betty sprang to her feet peering up at the strangers as she pressed in close to jennsens left leg sebastian moved in close on the other side an older woman in a cart beside them smiled down at jennsen care to sell your goat dear jennsen one hand grasping bettys rope along with rustys reins her other holding the hood of her cloak closed against a cold gust of wind smiled but shook her head firmly to decline as the woman in the horsedrawn cart returned a disappointed smile and started to move away jennsen saw a sign on the cart proclaiming sausages for sale mistress are you here selling your sausages today the woman reached behind pushed aside a lid and stretched her hand into one of the kettles nestled snugly in blankets and cloth she came up holding a fat coil of sausage fresh cooked this morning could i interest you only a silver penny and well worth it when jennsen nodded eagerly sebastian passed the woman the coin requested he cut the sausage in two and handed half to jennsen it was wonderfully warm she quickly devoured a few bites hardly taking the terry goodkind time to chew it was a relief to dull the sharp edge of her gnawing hunger only after those bites were down did she begin to appreciate the taste its delicious she called up to the woman the woman smiled seeming not at all surprised at the compliment walking abreast with the cart jennsen asked would you happen to know of a woman by the name of althea sebastian swept a furtive gaze around at the people walking within earshot the woman not at all shocked by the question leaned down toward jennsen youve come for a telling then although she couldnt be sure jennsen thought it easy enough to guess what the woman meant yes thats right would you know where i can find her well dear i dont know her but i know of her husband friedrich he comes to the palace to sell his gilded carvings many of the people moving up the road looked to have come to sell their wares jennsen dimly recalled when she was very young the palace being a buzz of activity with throngs coming every day to sell everything from food to jewelry many towns near where jennsen had lived when she was older had a market day the peoples palace though was a city with the buying and selling of goods taking place every day she recalled her mother taking her to booths to buy food and once cloth for a dress would you know where we can find this man friedrich or someone else who knows the way the woman gestured ahead toward the palace friedrich has a small booth in the marketplace up top as i hear told youll need to be invited out to see althea id advise you to talk to friedrich up top sebastian put a hand on jennsens back as he leaned past her up top he asked the woman she nodded you know up top where the palace is i dont go up there myself then where do you sell your sausages he asked oh i have my cart and horse so i stay down along the road selling to those going to and from the palace they wont let you take those horses of yours up if it be your intention to go look for altheas husband your goat neither for that matter there are ramps for horses inside for the soldiers and those with official business but wagons with supplies and such mostly use the cliff road on the east side they dont let just anyone ride their horses up only the soldiers keep horses up top the pillars of creation well jennsen said i guess well need to stable them if were to go up to find altheas husband friedrich doesnt come often youll be lucky to catch him on a day hes here best though if you could talk to him jennsen swallowed another mouthful of sausage do you know if he would be here today or what days he does come to the palace sorry dear but i dont the woman pulled an oversized red scarf over her head and fastened it tight with a knot under her chin i see him now and then thats all i know i sold him sausages a time or two to take home to his wife jennsen glanced up at the looming peoples palace i guess well just have to go for a look then they werent even inside yet and already jennsens heart was pounding at a furious pace she saw sebastians fingers glide over his cloak touching the hilt of his sword she couldnt resist brushing her forearm against her side checking for the reassuring presence of her knife under her own cloak jennsen hoped not to be in the palace long when they found out where althea lived they could be on their way the sooner the better she wondered if lord rahl was at the palace or off making war on sebastians homeland she felt great empathy for his people being at the mercy of lord rahla man she knew to be without a shred of mercy on their journey to the peoples palace she had asked sebastian about his homeland he had shared with her some of the convictions and beliefs of the people in the old world their sensitivity for the plight of their fellow man and their longings for the blessings of the creator sebastian spoke passionately about the beloved spiritual leader of the old world brother narev and his disciples of order who taught that the welfare of others was not only the responsibility but also the sacred duty of all people she had never imagined a place with people who were so compassionate sebastian said that the imperial order was fighting back valiantly against lord rahls invaders she of all people understood what it was to fear the man it was that fear that worried jennsen about going into the palace she feared that if lord rahl was there his powers might somehow tell him that she was near an orderly column of soldiers in chain mail and dark leather armor rode out headed in the opposite direction their weaponsswords axes lancesflashed menacingly in the morning sunlight jennsen kept her terry goodkind eyes turned to the ground ahead and tried not to stare at the soldiers she feared they could pick her out of the throng by sight as if she were glowing with some mark only they could see she kept the hood of her cloak pulled up to cover her red hair fearing that it would attract unwanted attention as they drew near the great portals into the plateau the crowds grew thicker spread out on the azrith plains to the south of the cliffs vendors had set up their stalls in makeshift streets those newly arrived settled in wherever they found room despite the cold everyone seemed in a good mood as they went about setting out their wares many were already doing a brisk business dharan soldiers seemed to be everywhere they were all big men all wearing the same orderly leather chain mail and wool uniforms all were armed with at least a sword but most carried additional weaponsan axe spiked mace or knives while the soldiers were alert and watchful they didnt appear to be bothering the merchants or hampering their business the woman selling sausages waved her good wishes to jennsen and sebastian before she pulled her cart off the road at an empty space beside three men setting out casks of wine on a short table the three men with the same strong jaws broad shoulders and tousled blond hair were obviously brothers careful who you leave your animals with she called after them many of the people who set up their stands down on the plain had animals and it seemed easy enough to conduct business where they were rather than go up to the palace other people roamed the crowds hawking items to passersby perhaps their simple wares sold better to those come to the openair market some like the woman with the cart came to sell food they had cooked and since there were plenty of people down below they had no need to go up inside jennsen suspected that others were content to be away from what was sure to be the greater scrutiny of officials and yet more guards in the palace proper sebastian took it all in without looking obvious she imagined in his gaze a running tally of troops to others it would appear he was merely looking about at the merchants enticed by the variety of wares for sale but jennsen saw that his vision focused beyond to the great portals between towering stone columns what should we do with the horses she asked and betty the pillars of creation sebastian gestured to one of the enclosures where horses were picketed were going to have to leave them in addition to being so close to the home of the man trying to kill her jennsen didnt like being among the press of so many people she felt so flush with the sense of danger that she couldnt think straight leaving betty at a stable in a town was one thing but leaving her lifelong friend out here among all these people was something else she pointed with her chin to the scruffy men minding the livestock enclosure they were busily engaged in a game of dice do you think we can trust the animals to people like that they could be thieves for all we know maybe you could stay with the horses while i go look for altheas husband sebastian turned back from his survey of the soldiers near the entrance jenn i dont think its a good idea to separate in a place like this besides i dont want you going in there alone she gauged the concern in his eyes and if we get into trouble do you really think we could fight our way out no you have to use your headkeep your wits about you ive brought you this far im not going to abandon you now and let you go in there alone and if they draw swords on us if it came to that fighting wouldnt save us in a place like this its more important to give people a worry make them think twice about how dangerous you might be so that you dont end up fighting in the first place you have to bluff im not any good at that kind of thing he grunted a short laugh you do it well enough you did it with me that first night when you drew the grace but that was just with you and with my mother there thats different than in a place with so many people you did it at the inn in the way you showed the innkeeper your red hair your manner loosened her tongue and you kept the men at bay with nothing but your bearing and a look all by yourself you gave all those men worry enough that they left you alone she had never thought about it in that way she viewed it more as simple desperation than calculated deception as betty rubbed the top of her head against jennsens leg she idly stroked the goats ear and watched as the men left their game of dice to terry goodkind take horses from travelers she didnt like the rough way the men handled the horses using switches instead of a steady hand jennsen scanned the crush of people until she spotted the red scarf she coiled the slack out of bettys rope and started off pulling rusty along with her surprised sebastian stepped quickly to catch up the woman in the red scarf was setting out pots with her sausages when jennsen reached her mistress she squinted in the sunlight yes dear some more sausages she lifted a lid they are good arent they delicious but i was wondering if you would accept a payment to watch our horses and my goat the woman replaced the lid the animals im not a stableman dear jennsen holding the rope and the reins in one hand rested her forearm on the side of the cart betty folded her legs and laid down beside the wheel i thought you might like the company of my goat for a while betty is a fine goat and wouldnt cause you any trouble the woman smiled as she peered down over the edge of her cart betty is it well i could watch your goat i guess sebastian handed the woman a silver coin if we could picket our horses with yours it would put our minds at ease that they were in good hands and that you were keeping an eye on them the woman carefully inspected the coin then appraised sebastian more critically how long will you be when i sell my sausages ill want to be heading home after all not long jennsen said we just want to go find the man you told us aboutfriedrich sebastian in an offhand manner pointed at the coin the woman was still holding when we get back ill give you another to thank you for watching our animals if we dont get back until after your sausages are all sold then ill give you two for your trouble of waiting on us finally the woman nodded all right then ill be here selling my sausages tie your goat to the wheel there and ill keep my eye on her until you get back she gestured over her shoulder and you can put your horses with mine there my old girl would enjoy the company betty eagerly took the small chunk of carrot from jennsens fingers rusty nudged her shoulder insistent that she not be left out so jennsen let the horse have a piece of the rare treat then passed a chunk to sebastian so an evereager pete wouldnt be left out the pillars of creation if you lose track of where i am just ask around for irma the sausage lady thank you irma jennsen smoothed bettys ears i appreciate your help well be back before you know it as they mingled into the crowd funneling toward the great plateau sebastian put his arm around her waist to keep her close beside him as he escorted her into the gaping maw of lord rahls palace jennsen could hear in the distance bettys plaintive bleating at being abandoned chapter s oldiers in polished breastplates all caff ying upright pikes with razorsharp edges glinting in the sunlight silently studied the people entering between the great columns as their scrutiny turned toward jennsen and sebastian she made sure not to look them in the eye she kept her head down and moved in step with the other people shuffling past the ranks of soldiers she didnt know if they paid any particular attention to the two of them but none reached out to seize her so she kept moving the huge cavelike entrance was lined in a lightcolored stone giving jennsen a sense of passing into a grand hall rather than through a tunnel into a plateau the size of a mountain hissing torches in iron brackets set into the walls lit the way with a dotted line of light the air smelled of burning pitch but it felt warm inside out of the winter wind to the sides cut into the rock were rows of rooms most were simple openings with a short front wall behind which vendors sold their wares walls in many of the small rooms were decorated with brightly colored cloth or painted planks offering a welcoming touch it had appeared that anyone outside could set up shop and sell their goods jennsen imagined the vendors inside had to pay rent for the rooms but in return they had a warm and dry place in out of the weather to do business where customers were more willing to linger clumps of chatting people waited near the shoemaker to have their the pillars of creation shoes repaired while others lined up to buy ale or bread or steaming bowls of stew another man with a singsong voice that attracted throngs to his booth sold meat pies at one jammed and noisy place women were having their hair pinned up or curled or decorated with bits of colored glass set in fine chains at another they were having their faces made up or their nails painted other places sold beautiful ribbons some cut to look just like fresh flowers to adorn dresses by the nature of many of the businesses jennsen realized that a lot of the people wanted to look their best before going up to the palace where they meant to be seen as much as they meant to look sebastian seemed to find it all as astonishing as she did jennsen stopped at a booth with no customers where a small man with a lasting smile was setting out pewter mugs could you tell me sir if you know of a gilder named friedrich no man by that name down here finer work like that is usually sold up top as they were swallowed deeper into the underground entrance sebastians arm returned to enclose her waist she found comfort in his close presence his handsome face and those times he smiled at her his spikes of white hair made him different from everyone elseunique special his blue eyes seemed to hold so many answers to the mysteries of the larger world she had never seen he almost made her forget her heartache at missing her mother a succession of massive iron doors stood open admitting the advancing throng it was intimidating going through such doors knowing that if they closed she would be trapped inside beyond wide marble stairs paler than straw and swirled through with white veins led up to grand landings edged with massive stone balustrades in contrast to the immense iron doors into the plateau finely crafted wooden doors closed off some of the rooms whitewashed corridors well lit by reflector lamps distracted from the feeling of being inside the plateau the stairs seemed endless in some places branching off in different directions some of the landings opened into spacious passageways the destination for many of the people it was like a city in eternal night lit by the wall lanterns with reflectors and pole lamps by the hundreds along the way were beautiful stone benches where people could rest on some levels were more small shops selling bread cheeses meats some with tables and benches set outside rather than feeling dark and forbidding it seemed cozy inside perhaps even romantic terry goodkind some passageways barred by huge doors and blocked by guards appeared as if they might be barracks in one place jennsen glimpsed a spiral ramp with troops moving down on horseback from her childhood jennsen only dimly recalled the city under the palace now with the endless new sights it was a place of wonder as her legs grew weary from the effort of climbing the stairs and traversing passageways it occurred to her then why many of the people chose to remain down on the plain to do business it was a long way up both in distance and in time and quite the labor from the conversations she overheard many of the people who came would lengthen their stay at the palace that was a city by taking rooms jennsen and sebastian were finally rewarded for their effort when they emerged once again in the daylight three tiers of balconies fronted with roped columns supporting arched openings looked down on the marble hall overhead glassed windows let in the light creating a bright corridor unlike anything she had ever seen if jennsen was moved by the marvel of it sebastian seemed thunderstruck how could any people build a place such as this he whispered why would they even want to jennsen didnt have an answer to either question yet in spite of how much she loathed those who ruled her land the palace still filled her with awe this was a place built by people with vision and imagination beyond anything she could conceive of with all the need in the world he murmured to himself the house of rahl builds this marble monument to themselves she thought that there seemed to be many thousands other than the lord rahl himself who benefited from the peoples palace those who derived their living from what the palace brought together people of all kinds even down to irma the sausage lady but jennsen didnt want to just then break her spell of astonishment to try to explain it the corridor stretching off in both directions was lined with rows of shops set back under the balconies some were open with a single craftsman but many were glassfronted and quite ornate with doors signs hung out and a number of people working inside the variety was overwhelming shopkeepers cut hair pulled teeth painted portraits made clothes and sold every sort of thing as could be imagined from common produce and herbs to priceless perfumes and jewels the aromas from the wide variety of foods were distracting the sights were dizzying as she was taking in those sights while looking for the gilders place the pillars of creation jermsen spotted two women in brown leather uniforms each wore her long blond hair in a single braid she clutched sebastians arm and hauled him into a side passageway without a word she rushed him along trying not to go so fast as to make people suspicious but at the same time get them out of sight as quickly as possible as soon as she reached the first of the huge pillars lining the side hall she ducked behind it pulling sebastian along with her when people glanced their way they both sat down on the stone bench against the wall trying to look as normal as possible a statue of a naked man across the way stared down at them as he leaned on a spear cautiously casually they both peeked out just enough to see jennsen watched the two leatherclad women stroll past the intersection their gazes cool penetrating intelligent took in the people to both sides these were the eyes of women that in an instant and without regret could decide between life and death when one woman looked toward the side hall jennsen sank back behind the pillar pressing herself up against the wall she was relieved to finally see the backs of the two as they continued down the main corridor what was that all about sebastian asked as she let out a relieved sigh mordsith what those two women they were mordsith sebastian carefully peered out for another look but the two were gone i dont know much about them except that theyre guards of some kind she realized then that being from another land he might not know much about those women yes in a way mordsith are very special guards they are the lord rahls personal guards i guess they protect him and more they torture information out of gifted people he gauged the demeanor in her eyes you mean those with simple magic any magic even a sorceress even a wizard he looked skeptical a wizard commands powerful magic he could simply use his power to crush those women jennsens mother had told her about mordsith how dangerous they were and that she must avoid them at all cost her mother never tried to hide the nature of deadly threats no mordsith have a power that enables them to appropriate anothers terry goodkind magiceven a wizard or a sorceress they capture not only the person but their magic as well there can be no escape from a mordsith unless she releases the person sebastian seemed only more confused what do you mean they appropriate anothers magic that makes no sense what could they do with such magic if it were anothers power that would be like pulling out someones teeth and trying to eat with them jermsen swept her hand back over her head under her hood replacing the red ringlets that had fallen out i dont know sebastian ive heard that they use the persons own magic against them to hurt themto give them pain then why should we be afraid of them they may torture information out of the gifted enemies of lord rahl but they can hurt anyone did you see the weapon they carry no i saw no weapon on them they only carried a small red leather rod that is their weapon its called an agiel they keep it on a chain around their wrist so it is always at hand its a weapon of magic he considered what she said but clearly didnt yet understand it what do they do with it with their agiel his manner had turned from incredulity to a more calm analytical questioning for information he was once again doing the job jagang the just had sent him to do im no expert on the subject but from what ive heard the mere touch of an agiel can do anything from causing inconceivable pain to breaking bones to instant death the mordsith decides how much pain if the bones are to break and whether or not you are to die by the touch he watched out toward the intersection as he considered what shed said why are you so afraid of them and if you have only heard these things why do you fear them so now she was the one who was incredulous sebastian lord rahl has been hunting me my whole life these women are his personal killers dont you think they would love to bring me to the feet of their master i suppose at least they were wearing their brown leather they wear red leather when they sense a threat or when they torture someone in red leather the blood doesnt show so much he slid both hands over his eyes and then back over his white spikes of hair this is a nightmare land you live in jennsen daggett the pillars of creation jennsen rahl she almost corrected out of selfpity jennsen from her mother rahl from her father do you think i dont know it and what if this sorceress doesnt want to help you she picked at a thread on her knee i dont know he will come after you lord rahl will never let you be you will never be free unless you kill him were the words she could hear left off althea must help me im so sick of being afraid jennsen said near tears so sick of running he put a gentle hand on her shoulder i understand no two words could have been more meaningful at that moment she could only nod her appreciation his tone turned more impassioned jennsen we have gifted women like althea theyre from a sect the sisters of the light that used to live at the palace of the prophets in the old world richard rahl when he invaded the old world destroyed their palace it was said to be a beautiful and special place but he destroyed it now the sisters are with emperor jagang helping him maybe our sorceresses would be able to help you too she looked up into his caring eyes really maybe those with the emperor would know a way to hide me from my murderous half brothers wizardry but hes always only a half step behind waiting for me to stumble so he can pounce sebastian i dont think i could make it that far althea helped hide me from lord rahl once i must convince her to help me again if she wont i fear ill have no chance before im caught he leaned out again checking then gave her a confident smile well find althea her magic will hide you and then you can get away feeling better she returned the smile judging that the mordsith were gone and it was safe they returned to the hall to search for friedrich they each inquired at several places before jennsen found someone who knew of the gilder with fresh hope she and sebastian moved deeper into the palace following the directions they were given to a juncture of grand passageways there in the center of the intersection of two central corridors she was surprised to see a quiet plaza with a square pool of dark water tiles rather than the usual marble surrounded the pool four columns at the outer edge of the tiles supported the soaring opening to the sky covered terry goodkind since it was winter by leaded glass panels the beveled glass gave the light cast down across the tiles a shimmering liquid quality in the pool off center in a way that seemed right without jennsen understanding exactly why it felt right stood a dark pitted rock with a bell atop it it was a remarkably quiet sanctuary in the center of such a busy place seeing the square with the bell sparked her memory of similar places when the bell tolled she recalled the people came to such squares to bow down and chant a devotion to the lord rahl she suspected that such homage was one price paid for the honor of being allowed in his palace people sat on the low wall around the edge talking in hushed tones watching orange fish gliding through the dark water even sebastian stared for a few minutes before moving on everywhere there were alert soldiers some seemed to be stationed at key spots squads of guards moved through the halls watching everyone stopping some people to speak with them what the soldiers asked jennsen didnt know but it worried her greatly what do we say if they question us she asked its best not to say anything unless you have to but if you have to then what tell them that we live on a farm to the south farmers are isolated and dont know much about anything but life on their farm so it wouldnt sound suspicious if we say we dont know about anything else we came to see the palace and perhaps buy a few small thingsherbs and such jennsen had met farmers and didnt think they were as ignorant of things as sebastian seemed to think farmers grow or collect their own herbs she said i dont think they would need to come to the palace to buy them well then we came to buy some nice cloth so you could make clothes for the baby baby what baby your baby you are my wife and only recently found yourself pregnant you are with child jennsen felt her face flush to red she couldnt say she was pregnantthat would only lead to more questions all right were farmers here to buy a few small thingsherbs and such rare herbs we dont grow ourselves his only answer was a sideways glance and a smile his arm returned to her waist as if to banish her embarrassment the pillars of creation beyond another intersection of wide passageways following the directions theyd been given they turned down another hall to the right it too was lined with vendors jennsen immediately spotted the booth with a gilded star hanging before it she didnt know if it was intentional or not but the gilded star had eight points like the star in a grace she had drawn the grace often enough to know with sebastian at her side she rushed over to the booth her heart sank when they found the place occupied only by an empty chair but it was still morning and she reasoned that maybe he hadnt come in yet the closest businesses werent yet open either she stopped several stalls down at a place selling leather mugs do you know if the gilder is here today she asked the man working behind the bench sorry dont know he said without looking up from his work at cutting decorations with a fine gouge i just started here she hurried down to the next occupied booth a place that sold hangings with colorful scenes sewn on them she turned to say something to sebastian but saw him inquiring at another booth not far away the woman behind the short counter was sewing a blue brook through mountains stitched on a stretched square of coarsely woven cloth some of the scenes were made up into pillows displayed on a rack to the back mistress would you know if the gilder is here today the woman smiled up at her sorry but far as i know he wont be in today oh i see thwarted by the disappointing news jennsen hesitated not knowing what to do next would you know when he will return at least the woman pushed her needle through making a blue stitch of water no cant say as i do last time i saw him over a week ago he said he may not be back for a while why is that do you know cant say as i do she pulled the long thread of the water out taut sometimes he stays away for a spell working at his gilding doing up enough to make it worth his time to travel to the palace would you happen to know where he lives the woman glanced up from under a crinkled brow why do you wish to know jennsens mind raced she said the only thing she could think ofwhat terry goodkind she had learned from irma the sausage lady watching betty for her i wish to go for a telling ah the woman said her suspicion fading as she pulled another stitch through its althea then that you really want to see jennsen nodded my mother took me to althea when i was young since my mother passed away id like to visit althea again i thought it might be a comfort if i went for a telling sorry about your mother dear i know what you mean when i lost my mother it was a hard time for me too could you tell me how to find altheas place she set her sewing down and came to the low wall at the front of her booth its a goodly ways to altheas placeto the west through a desolate land the azrith plains thats right going west the land turns rugged with mountains around the other side of the largest snowcapped mountain due west of here if you turn north staying just the other side of the cliffs you will find following the low land down lower yet you will come into a nasty place a swampy place althea and friedrich live there in a swamp but not in the winter the woman leaned close and lowered her voice yes even in the winter people say altheas swamp a vile place it is too some say it isnt a natural place if you know what i mean her magic you mean she shrugged some say jennsen nodded in thanks and repeated the directions other side of the largest snowcapped peak west of here stay below the cliffs and go north down in a swampy place a nasty dangerous swampy place the woman used a long fingernail to scratch her scalp but you dont want to be going there unless youre invited jennsen glanced around briefly to signal to sebastian but she didnt see him right off how does one get invited most people ask friedrich i see them come here to talk to him and leave without even looking at his work i guess he asks althea if she will see them and the next time he returns with his gilding he invites them sometimes people give him a letter to take to his wife some people travel out there and wait i hear that sometimes he comes out of the swamp to meet those people and pass along altheas invitation the pillars of creation some people return from the edge of the swamp without ever being invited in their long wait for nothing none dare venture in uninvited though least none that did ever came back to tell about it if you know what i mean are you saying ill have to go there and just wait wait until she or her husband comes to invite us in guess so but it wont be althea who comes out she never comes out of her swamp as i hear it you could come back here each day until friedrich finally returns to sell his gilding hes never been away for more than a month id say hell be back to the palace within a few weeks at most weeks jennsen couldnt stay in one place waiting weeks while lord rahls men hunted her closing in day by day from as close as sebastian said they were she didnt think she even had days much less weeks before they would have her thank you then for all your help i guess ill come back another day to see if friedrich has returned and ask him if i might go for a telling the woman smiled as she sat back down and picked up her sewing that might be best she looked up sorry to hear about your mother dear its hard i know she nodded her eyes watery fearing to test her voice just then the vivid scene flashed through her mind the men the blood everywhere the terror of them coming for her seeing her mother slumped on the floor stabbed her arm severed with effort jennsen pushed the memory away lest it consume her in grief and anger she had immediate worries they had made a long and difficult journey in winter to find althea to obtain her help they couldnt wait around hoping to be invited to visit althealord rahls men were close on their heels the last time jennsen had wavered in her determination she had missed her chanceand lathea had been murdered the same thing could happen again she had to get to althea before those men did at least to tell her about her sister to warn her if nothing else jennsen scanned the vast hallway searching for sebastian he couldnt have gone far she saw him then his back to her across the broad corridor just turning away from a place that sold silver jewelry before she took two steps she saw soldiers swarm in and surround him jennsen froze in her tracks sebastian did too one of the soldiers used his sword to carefully lift back sebastians cloak uncovering terry goodkind his array of weapons she was too frightened to move to take another step half a dozen gleaming razoredged pikes lowered at sebastian swords came out of sheaths people nearby backed away others turned to look in the center of a ring of dharan soldiers towering over him sebastian held his arms out to the sides in surrender surrender just then a bell the one back at the square tolled chapter the single long peal of the bell calling people to the devotion echoed through the cavernous halls as two of the big men seized sebastian by the arms and started bearing him away jennsen watched helplessly as the rest of the dharan soldiers surrounded him in a tight formation bristling with steel meant not only to keep their prisoner at bay but to ward any possible attempt to extricate him it was immediately clear to her that these guards were prepared for any eventuality and took no chances not knowing if this one armed man might signify a force about to storrn the palace jennsen saw that there were other men visitors to the palace like sebastian also carrying swords perhaps it was that sebastian carried a variety of combat weapons and they were all concealed that so raised the soldiers suspicions but he wasnt doing anything it was winterof course he was wearing a cloak he was causing no harm jennsens urge was to yell at the soldiers to leave him be yet she feared that if she did they would take her too the people who had spread back away from the potential trouble along with everyone else strolling the halls all began moving toward the square people in the shops set down their work to join them no one paid much attention to the soldiers business in response to that single chime still hanging in the air laughter and talking trailed off to respectful whispers terry goodkind panic clawed at jermsen as she saw the soldiers muscling sebastian down a hall to the side she could see his white hair amid the dark armor she didnt know what to do this wasnt supposed to happen they only came to find a gilder she wanted to scream for the soldiers to stop she dared not though jennsen jennsen stood her ground against the current of bodies trying to keep sebastian and his captors in sight the lord rahl was after her and now they had sebastian her mother had been murdered and now they were taking sebastian it wasnt fair as she watched afraid to do anything to stop the soldiers her own fear shamed her sebastian had done so much for her he had made so many sacrifices for her he had risked his life to save hers jennsens breath came in ragged pulls but what could she do surrender it wasnt fair what they were doing to sebastian to her to innocent people anger welled up through her fear tu vash misht he was only there because of her she had asked him to come tu vask misht now he was in trouble grushdeva du kalt misht the words sounded so right they flared through her carried on flames of igniting rage people pushed against her she growled through gritted teeth as she squeezed her way among the crush of people trying to follow the soldiers who had sebastian it wasnt fair she wanted them to stop just stop stop her helplessness frustrated her she was sick of it when they wouldnt stop when they kept going it only further enraged her surrender jennsens hand slid inside her cloak the touch of cold steel welcomed her her fingers tightened around the hilt of her knife she could feel the worked metal of the symbol of the house of rahl pressing into the flesh of her palm a soldier gently pushed her turning her in the direction of the rest of the crowd the devotion square is that way maam it was spoken as a suggestion but wrapped around the core of command the pillars of creation through the rage she looked up into his hooded eyes she saw the dead mans eyes she saw the soldiers at her housemen on the floor dead men coming for her men grabbing her she saw flashes of movement through a crimson sheen of blood as she and the soldier stared into each others eyes she felt the blade at her waist coming out of its sheath a hand under her arm tugged at her this way dear ill show you where it is jennsen blinked it was the lady who had given her directions to altheas place the woman who sat in the palace of the murdering bastard lord rahl and sewed the peaceful scenes of the mountains and brooks jennsen stared at the woman at her inexplicable smile trying to make sense of her jennsen found everything around her strangely incomprehensible she only knew that her hand was on the hilt of her knife and she longed for the blade to be free but for some reason the knife stubbornly remained where it was jennsen at first convinced that some malevolent magic had seized her saw then that the woman had a tight motherly arm around her without realizing it the woman was keeping jennsens blade in its sheath jennsen locked her knees resisting being pulled along the womans eyes now were set with warning no one misses a devotion dear no one let me show you where it is the soldier his expression grim watched as jennsen yielded allowing herself to be guided by the woman jennsen and the woman swept into the current of people moving toward the square left the soldier behind she looked up into the womans smiling face the whole world seemed to jennsen to be swimming in a strange light the voices around her were a smear of sound that in her mind was pierced by the echoes of screams from her house jennsen through the murmuring around her the voice sharp and distinct caught her attention jennsen listened alert to what it might tell her surrender your will jennsen it made sense in a visceral way surrender yourflesh nothing else seemed to matter anymore nothing she had tried in her whole life had brought her salvation or safety or peace to the contrary everything seemed lost there seemed nothing else to lose here we are dear the woman said terry gdknd jennsen looked around what here we are jennsen felt her knees touch the tiled floor as the woman urged her down people were all around before them was the square with the pool of quiet water at its center she wanted only the voice jennsen surrender the voice had grown harsh commanding it fanned the flames of her anger her rage her wrath jennsen bent forward trembling in the grip of rage somewhere in the far comers of her mind screamed a distant terror despite that remote sense of foreboding it was rage that was carrying her will away surrender she saw strings of her saliva hanging dripping as she panted through parted lips tears dropped to the tiles close beneath her face her nose ran her breath came in gasps her eyes were opened so wide it hurt she shook all over as if alone in the coldest darkest winter night she couldnt make herself stop people bowed forward deeply hands pressed to the tiles she wanted her knife out jennsen lusted for the voice master rahl guide us it was not the voice it was the people all around in one voice chanting the devotion as they began they all bowed farther forward until their foreheads touched the tile floor a soldier moved past close behind patrolling watching as she knelt bent over hands to the floor quaking uncontrollably inch by halting inch as she gasped panted shook jennsens head lowered until her forehead touched the floor master rahl teach us that was not what she wanted to hear she wanted the voice she raged for it she wanted her knife she wanted blood master rahl protect us the people all chanted in unison jennsen pulling ragged jerking breaths consumed with loathing wanted only the voice and her blade free but her palms were flat on the tiles she listened for the voice but heard only the chant of the devotion in your light we thrive in your mercy we are sheltered in your wisdom we are humbled we live only to serve our lives are yours the pillars of creatn at first jennsen only vaguely remembered it from her youth from when she had lived at the palace hearing it now that memory came flooding back she had known the words she had chanted them when she was little when they fled the palace running from lord rahl she had banished the words of the devotion to the man who was trying to kill her and her mother now hungering for the voice that wanted her to surrender almost unbeknownst to her almost as if it were someone else doing it her trembling lips began moving with the words master rahl guide us master rahl teach us master rahl protect us in your light we thrive in your mercy we are sheltered in your wisdom we are humbled we live only to serve our lives are yours the cadence of those murmured words filled the great hall many people but one voice resounding powerfully off the walls she listened with all her strength for the voice that had been her companion for nearly as long as she could remember but it wasnt there now jennsen was helplessly carried along with all the others she clearly heard herself speaking the words master rahl guide us master rahl teach us master rahl protect us in your light we thrive in your mercy we are sheltered in your wisdom we are humbled we live only to serve our lives are yours over and over jennsen softly spoke the words of the devotion along with everyone else over and over without pause but for breath over and over yet without haste the chant filled her mind it beckoned to her spoke to her it was all that filled her thoughts as she chanted it over and over and over it filled her so completely that it left no room for anything else somehow it calmed her time slipped by incidental inconspicuous unimportant somehow the soft chant brought her a sense of peace it reminded her of how betty calmed when having her ears smoothed jennsens rage was being smoothed she fought against it but bit by bit she was pulled into the chant into its promise smoothed and gentled she understood then why it was called a devotion despite everything it drained her and then filled her with a profound calm a serene sense of belonging she no longer fought the words she allowed herself to whisper them letting them lift away the shards of pain for that time as she knelt her terry goodkind head to the tiles with nothing to do but say the words she was free of anything and everything as she chanted along with everyone else the shadow cast on the floor from the mullions of the leaded glass overhead moved past her leaving her in the glow of the full sun it felt warm and protective it felt like her mothers warm embrace her body felt light the soft radiance all around reminded jennsen of how she pictured the good spirits an instant in time later the hours of chanting were ended jennsen uncurled slowly pushing away from the floor to sit up with the others without warning a sob poured forth anything wrong here there was a soldier towering over her the woman to the side put an arm around jennsens shoulders her mother passed away recently the woman quietly explained the soldier shifted his weight looking ill at ease im sorry maam my heartfelt sympathy to you and your family jennsen saw in his blue eyes that he meant every word stunned speechless she watched as he turned huge and muscular layered in leather lord rahls killer continuing on his patrol empathy in armor if he knew who she was he would deliver her into the hands of those who would see to it that she suffered a long and lingering death jennsen buried her face in the strangers shoulder and wept for her mother whose embrace had felt so good she missed her mother beyond endurance and now she was terrified for sebastian chapter jennsen thanked the woman who sewed country scenes and gave directions only after jennsen had started down the hall did she realize that she didnt even know the womans name it didnt really matter they both had mothers both understood and shared the same feelings now that the devotion was over the noise of all the people in the palace rose again to resound off marble walls and columns laughter could be heard ringing out across the hall people had gone back to their own concerns buying trading discussing their wants and needs guards patrolled and palace staff most in lightcolored robes went about their business carrying messages seeing to matters jennsen could only guess at in one place workers were at the task of repairing the hinges on a huge oak double door to a side passageway the cleaning staff was back too busy at dusting mopping polishing jennsens mother had once been one of those women seeing to the work in the sections of the palace closed off to the public official rooms where matters of governance were conducted the sections that housed the officials and palace staff and of course lord rahls rooms after chanting the devotion for hours jennsens mind was as clear as if she had had a long and needed rest in that calm but refreshed and wideawake state a solution had come to her she knew what she had to do terry goodkind she moved quickly back the way she had come there was no time to lose on balconies above people who lived at the peoples palace gazed down on the hall as they went about their work watching those who had come to marvel at the great place jennsen focused on keeping her wits about her as she moved through the throngs sebastian had warned her not to run and cause people to wonder if there was something wrong he had cautioned her to act normal lest she give people reason to take note yet so acute was the danger of being at the palace that he had been captured despite knowing how to act if she raised suspicion then soldiers would surely stop her if the soldiers got ahold of her and found out who she was jennsen ached to have sebastian back her fear for him urged her down the hall she had to get him away from the dharan soldiers before they did something terrible to him she knew that every minute they had him he was in mortal danger if they tortured him he might not be able to hold out if he confessed to who he was they would put him to death the thought of sebastian being executed almost made her knees give out under torture people would confess to anything whether true or not if they decided to torture him to make him confess to something he was doomed the mental image of sebastian being tortured made her sick and dizzy she had to rescue him but to do that she had to have the sorceresss help if althea would help her cast jennsen a protective spell then she could try to get sebastian back althea had to help her jennsen would convince her sebastians life hung in the balance she reached the stairs where they had come up people were still emptying up into the hall some sweating and buffing with the effort of the climb few were going down yet standing at the edge hand on the marble rail she took a careful look around making sure she wasnt being followed or observed despite her urge to run she made herself look around casualty some people looked at her but no more than they looked at anyone patrolling soldiers were a good distance off jennsen started down she went as quickly as possible without looking like she was running for her lifefor sebastians life but she was if not for jennsen he would not be in this trouble she thought that going down would be easy but after hundreds of steps she found that going down was tiring on the legs her legs burned with the pillars of creation the effort she told herself that if she couldnt run she could at least not stop but keep going and in that way make better time on the landings she cut the comers saving steps when no one was looking she took the stairs two at a time when she had to traverse passageways she tried to screen herself behind clumps of people as she went past watchful guards people sitting on benches eating bread and meat pies drinking ale talking with friends casually noted her along with everyone else who passed just another visitor going by lord rahls half sister among them on the steps again she went quickly her legs trembling from the nonstop effort her muscles burned with the need of a rest but she gave them none instead she pushed faster when she had the chance on an empty flight of stairs between two landings screened from sight because they turned from different directions jennsen raced recklessly down she slowed again when a couple arm in arm their heads close together as they giggled over whispered words reached the landing below and headed up the air grew colder as she descended on one level with guards thick as flies in a barn in spring one of the soldiers looked right into her eyes and smiled stunned to a stop for an instant she realized that he was smiling at her as a man smiled at a woman not as a killer smiled at his victim she returned the smile polite warm but not so much as to give the impression that she was encouraging him jennsen pulled her cloak tight and turned down the next flight of stairs when she glanced over her shoulder as she turned the comer on a landing he stood above one hand on the rail watching her he smiled again and waved a farewell before turning back to his duties unable to contain her fear jennsen sprinted down the stairs two at a time and ran down the hall past small stands selling food brooches and finely decorated daggers past visitors sitting on stone benches set before the marble balustrade on toward the next flight of stairs until she realized that people were staring at her she stopped running and fell casually into walking trying to flounce to make it look as if she had just been dashing from youthful vivacity the tactic worked she saw the people who had been eyeing her seem to chalk it up as nothing more than a spirited girl dashing along they turned back to their own business since it worked jennsen intermittently used the same trick and was able to make better time breathing hard from the long descent she finally made it to the cavelike entrance with the hissing torches since there were so many soldiers terry goodkind at the portal into the great plateau she slowed and walked close behind an older couple to make it look as if she might be a daughter with her parents the couple was engaged in a spirited debate of a friends chances of making a go of it with his new shop selling wigs up in the palace the woman thought it a good business the man thought his friend would run out of willing sellers of their hair and would end up spending too much of his time looking for more jennsen could imagine no more foolish conversation when a man had been taken prisoner and was about to be tortured and probably put to death to jennsen the dharan palace was nothing more than a vile death trap she had to get sebastian out of there she would get him out neither one of the couple noticed jennsen close behind head bowed matching their slow pace the gaze of guards skimmed over the three of them at the mouth of the opening cold wind swept in to take the breath from jennsens lungs after being in the lamplit darkness for so long she had to squint at the expanse of bright daylight as soon as they were in the openair market she turned down one of the makeshift streets hurrying to find irma the sausage lady stretching her neck she looked about for the red scarf as she rushed down the rows of stalls the places that before had seemed so splendid now looked shabby after she had been in the palace in the whole of her life jennsen had never seen anything like the peoples palace she could not imagine how a place of such beauty could hold such ugliness as the house of rahl a hawker pushed in close charms for the lady good luck for sure jennsen kept walking his breath stank special charms with magic cant go wrong for a silver penny no thank you he walked sideways right close in front of her but off to the side a bit just a silver penny my lady she thought she would trip over the mans feet no thank you please leave me be now a copper penny then no jennsen shoved him each time he bumped into her as he pushed in close yammering about his charms he kept putting his face in front of hers looking back up at her as he stooped and shuffled along grinning at her good charms they are my lady he kept bumping her as she tried the pillars of creation to walk as she craned her neck looking for the red scarf good luck for you no i said almost stumbling over the man she gave him a stiff shove please leave me be jennsen sighed in relief as an older man came past going in the opposite direction and the hawker turned to him she could hear his voice fade behind trying to sell the man a magic charm for a silver penny she thought about the irony that here this man was offering magic and she turned it down because she was in a hurry to be off to try to get magic from someone else past an empty space before a table with wine casks jennsen halted abruptly she looked up and saw the three brothers one was pouring wine into a leather goblet for a customer while the other two were lifting a full cask from the back of their wagon jennsen turned and stared at the empty place that was where irma had been her heart felt as if it came up in her throat irma had their horses irma had betty in a panic she seized the arm of the man behind the table as the customer departed please could you tell me where irma is he looked up squinting in the sunlight the sausage lady jennsen nodded yes where is she she couldnt be gone already she had her sausages to sell the man grinned she said that being beside us selling our wine had helped sell her sausages faster than she ever sold them before jennsen could only stare shes gone too bad too having sausages for sale next to us really helped sell wine people ate those spicy goat sausages of hers and had to have some of our wine her what jennsen whispered the mans smile flagged her sausages whats wrong maam you look as if a spirit from the underworld just tapped you on the shoulder what did you say she sells goat sausages he nodded looking concerned among others i tried them all but i liked the spicy goat sausages best he lifted a thumb over his shoulder indicating his two brothers joe liked her beef sausages best and clayton well he liked the pork but i favored her goat sausages jennsen was shivering and it wasnt the cold where is she i have to find her terry goodkind the man scratched his head of disheveled blond hair im sorry but i dont know she comes here to sell sausages most folks around here have seen her before shes a nice lady always a smile and a good word jennsen felt freezing tears run down her cheeks but where is she where does she live i have to find her the man grasped jennsens arm as if fearing she might fall sorry maam but i dont know why whats wrong she has my animals my horses and betty betty my goat she has them we paid her to watch them until we got back oh he looked gloomy to have no better news for her sorry her sausages pretty much sold steady till they were gone it usually takes her all day long to sell what she cooks up but sometimes it just goes better i guess after her sausages were gone she sat around and talked to us for a long spell finally she let out a sigh and said she had to get home jennsens mind raced the world felt as if it were spinning around her she didnt know what to do she felt dazed confused jennsen had never felt so alone please she said her voice choked with tears please could i rent one of your horses our horses then how would we get our wagon home besides theyre draft horses we dont have any saddle or tack for riding or any please i have gold jennsen groped at her belt i can pay feeling around at her waist she couldnt find her small leather pouch with her gold and silver coins jennsen threw back her cloak searching there on her belt beside her knife she found only a small piece of a leather thong parted cleanly my purse my purse is gone she couldnt get her breath my money the mans face sagged with sorrow as he watched her pull the remnant of the drawstring from her belt there are wicked people prowling around looking to steal but i need it he fell silent she looked back behind searching for the hawker selling charms it all flashed back through her mind he had bumped into her jostled her he was really cutting her purse she couldnt even recall what he looked likejust that he was scruffy and ill kept she hadnt wanted the pillars of creation to look at his face meet his eyes she couldnt seem to get her breath as she frantically looked this way and that trying to find the man who had stolen her money no she whined too overcome to know what to say no oh please no she sank down sitting on the ground beside the table i need a horse dear spirits i need a horse the man hurriedly poured wine in a cup and squatted down beside her as she sobbed here drink this i have no money she managed to get out as she wept no charge he said giving her a sympathetic lopsided smile of straight white teeth itll help drink it down the other two blondheaded brothers joe and clayton stood behind the table hands in their pockets heads lowered with regret for the woman their brother was tending to the man tipped the cup up trying to get her to drink as she cried some spilled down her chin some went in her mouth and she had to swallow it why do you need a horse the man asked i have to get to altheas place althea the old sorceress jennsen nodded as she wiped wine from her chin and tears from her cheeks have you been invited out there no jennsen admitted but i have to go why its a matter of life or death i need altheas help or a man could die crouching beside her still holding the cup hed used to give her a drink his eyes turned from looking into hers to take in her ringlets of red hair under her hood the big man put his hands on his knees and stood going back to his brothers to let her be as she tried but failed to halt her desperate tears jennsen wept with worry for betty too betty was jennsens friend and companion and a connection to her mother the poor goat probably felt abandoned and unloved jennsen would give anything just then to see bettys little upright tail wagging she told herself that she couldnt just sit there acting like a child it would accomplish nothing she had to do something there could be no help in the shadow of lord rahls palace and she had no money to help her she couldnt depend on anyone except sebastian and he had no terry goodkind hope of help but from her now his life depended on her actions alone she couldnt sit there feeling sorry for herself if her mother had taught her anything she had taught jennsen better than this she had no idea what to do to rescue betty but she at least knew what she had to attempt in order to help sebastian that was what was most important and what she had to do she was wasting precious time jennsen stood angrily wiping the tears from her face and then put a hand to her brow to shield her eyes from the sun she had been in the palace a long time so it was hard to judge but she figured it to be late afternoon taking into account the suns position in the sky at the time of year she judged which way was west if only she had rusty she could make better time if only she had her money she could rent or buy another horse no sense yearning for what was gone and couldnt be recovered she would have to walk thank you for the wine jennsen said to the blondheaded man standing there fidgeting as he watched her not at all he said as he cast his gaze downward as she started away he seemed to gather his courage he stepped out into the dusty road and grabbed her by the arm hold on there maam what are you thinking of doing a mans life depends on my getting out to altheas place ive no choice i have to walk what man whats going on that his life would hinge on you seeing althea jennsen looking up into the mans sky blue eyes gently pulled her arm away big and blond with his strong jaw and muscular build he reminded her of the men who had murdered her mother im sorry but i cant say jennsen held the hood of her cloak tight against a bitter gust of wind as she struck out again before she had taken a dozen steps he took several long strides and gently grasped her under her upper arm again to drag her to a halt look he said in a quiet voice when she scowled at him do you even have any supplies jennsens scowl withered and she had to fight back the tears of frustration everything is with our horses the sausage lady irma has everything except my moneythe cutpurse has that the pillars of creation so you have nothing it wasnt a question so much as scorn for so simpleminded a plan i have myself and i know what i must do and you intend to strike out for altheas in the winter on foot without any supplies ive lived in the woods my whole life i can get by she pulled but his big hand held her ann securely maybe so but the azrith plains arent the woods theres nothing to help you make a shelter not a stick of wood to make a fire after the sun sets itll get as cold as the keepers heart you dont have any supplies or anything what are you going to eat this time she more forcefully jerked her arm away and succeeded in freeing it i dont have any other choice you may not understand that but there are some things that you have to do even if it means risking your own life or else life means nothing and isnt worth living before he could stop her again jennsen ran into the river of people moving along the makeshift streets she pushed her way through the crowds past people selling food and drink she could not buy it all served to remind her that she had not eaten since the sausage that morning the knowledge that sebastian might not live to have another meal gave urgency to her steps she turned down the first road going west with the southern winter sun on the left side of her face she thought about the sunlight in the palace when she had been at the devotion and how much it felt like her mothers embrace chapter ennsen wove her way among the people below the plateau making her way down the haphazard streets imagining she was stepping among trees moving through the forests where she felt most at home that was where she wished she were in a quiet forest sheltered among the trees with her mother the both of them watching betty nibble on tender shoots some of the people pausing at stalls or the merchants behind tables or those strolling along cast a gaze in jermsens direction but she kept her head bowed and continued along at a brisk pace she was worried sick about betty the sausage lady irma sold goat meat that was no doubt why she wanted to buy betty in the first place the poor goat was probably heartsick and terrified at being taken away by a stranger as sick as jennsen was over betty though and as much as she ached to go find her and have her back she couldnt put that desire ahead of sebastians life passing stands selling food only served to remind her of how hungry she was especially after the effort of climbing all the stairs up to the palace she hadnt eaten since that morning and wished she could buy something to eat now but there was no hope of that people cooked over open fires made with wood they no doubt had brought with them pans sizzled with butter garlic and spices smoke from roasting meats drifted past the aromas were intoxicating and made her hunger nearly unbearable when her mind wandered to her hunger jennsen thought about sebastian every moment she delayed could mean another lash of a whip for him another cut another twist to a limb another broken bone another moment of agony the thought of it made bile rise in the back of her throat no wonder he was here to help in the struggle to defeat dhara a thought even more terrifying abruptly jotted her mordsith wherever jennsen had traveled with her mother throughout dhara no one feared anything or anyone more than they feared the mordsith their ability to inflict pain and suffering was legend it was said that this side of the keepers hand a mordsith existed without peer what if the dharans used one of those women to torture sebastian even though he had no magic that wouldnt matter with that agiel of theirsand who knew what elsethe mordsith could hurt anyone they simply had the added ability to capture a person with magic a person without magic like sebastian would be nothing but a brief blood sport to a mordsith the crowds thinned as she reached the edge of the openair market the temporary lane she was on dwindled to nothing as it reached the last stall occupied by a lanky man selling leather tack and piles of used wagon fittings there was nothing beyond his heavily loaded wagon full of pieces and parts but desolate open land an endless file of people moved along the road going south she could see a haze of dust in the air marking the more distant sections of the road south along with others branching off to the southwest and southeast no road went west a few people at the fringe of the marketplace glanced her way as she struck out alone toward the lowering sun while some people might have looked her way none followed into the wasteland that was the azrith plains jennsen was relieved to be alone being around people had proven as dangerous as she had always feared the market scene was quickly left behind as she marched west jennsen slid her hand in under her cloak feeling the reassuring presence of her knife lying against her body it was warm to the touch as if it were a living thing rather than silver and steel at least the thief had taken her money and not her knife given a choice of the two she would rather have the knife she had lived her whole life without much money her and her mother providing for themselves but terry goodkind a knife was vital to that means of survival if you lived in a palace you needed money if you lived outofdoors you needed a knife and she had never seen a better knife than this one despite its provenience her fingers idly traced the ornate letter r on the silver handle some people needed a knife even if they lived in a palace she guessed she turned back to look and was relieved to see that no one followed her the plateau had shrunk in the distance until all the people below it looked like slow little ants moving about it was good to be away from the place but she knew she would have to return after seeing althea if she was to rescue sebastian as she walked backward for a spell to gain a reprieve from the icy wind in her face her gaze rose along the road switching back and forth up the steep cliffs to the massive stone wall surrounding the palace itself coming in from the south she hadnt seen the road at one place along its length a bridge spanned a particularly treacherous gap in the rock the bridge was pulled up as if the cliff itself were not deterrent enough the high stone walls around the peoples palace would defeat any attempt to get inside unless you were allowed in she hoped it would not be that hard to get in to see althea somewhere in that vast complex sebastian was held prisoner she wondered if he thought himself forever abandoned as betty probably did she whispered a prayer to the good spirits asking that he not give up hope and that the good spirits somehow let him know she was going to get him out when she tired of walking backward and of seeing the peoples palace she turned around then she had to endure the wind buffeting her sometimes ripping the breath right out of her mouth sharp gusts kicked the dry gritty ground up into her eyes the land was flat dry and featureless mostly hardpan cut through here and there with a swath of coarse sandy soil in places the tawny landscape was stained a darker brown as if strong tea had been stirred through there was only occasional vegetation and that was a low scruffy plant now winter brown and brittle gathered to the west lay a ragged line of mountains the one in the center looked like it might have snow on top but it was hard to tell against the sun she had no guess at how far it was being unfamiliar with such land she found it difficult to judge distances out on the plain it could be hours or even days for all she knew at least she didnt have to trudge the pillars of creation through snow as they often had to do on their way up to the peoples palace jennsen realized that even in winter she was going to need water she guessed that in a swamp there would be water aplenty she realized too that the woman who had given her directions said that it was a long way but hadnt described what was to her a long way maybe to her a long way was what jennsen would consider only a brisk walk of a few hours maybe the woman had meant days jennsen whispered a prayer under her breath that it wouldnt be days even though she didnt at all relish the idea of going into a swamp when a sound rose to rattle through the wind she turned and saw a plume of dust rising in the distance behind her she squinted finally recognizing that it was a wagon coming her way jennsen turned all the way around scanning the barren country trying to see if there was any place she could hide she didnt like the idea of being caught out in the open all alone it occurred to her that men from back in the openair market might have watched her leave and then planned to wait until she was all alone with no one around to come out and attack her she started running since the wagon was coming from the palace she ran the direction she had been walkingwesttoward the dark slash of mountains as she ran she sucked frigid gasps of air so cold it hurt her throat the plain stretched out before her without so much as a crack to hide in she focused on the dark line of mountains running for them with all her effort but even as she ran she knew they were too far before long jennsen forced herself to stop she was acting foolish she couldnt outrun horses she bent at her waist hands on her thighs catching her breath watching the wagon come for her if someone was coming out to attack her then running using up her strength was about as senseless a thing as she could do she turned back to face the sun and kept walking but at a pace that wouldnt wear her out if she was going to have to fight she should at least not be winded maybe it was only someone going home and they would turn in a different direction she had only spotted them because of the noise of the wagon and the dust it raised they probably didnt even see her walking the chilling thought washed through her maybe a mordsith had already tortured a confession out of sebastian maybe one of those merciless women had already broken him she feared to think what she would terry goodkind do if someone were methodically going about snapping her bones in two jennsen could not honestly say what she would do under such excruciating torture maybe under unendurable agony he had given them jennsens name he knew all about her he knew darken rahl was her father he knew richard rahl was her half brother he knew she wanted to go to the sorceress for help maybe they had promised him they would stop if sebastian gave her up could she blame him for a betrayal under such conditions maybe the wagon racing toward her was full of big grim dharan soldiers come to capture her maybe the nightmare was only about to begin in earnest maybe this was the day she lived in fear of as tears of fright stung her eyes jennsen slipped her hand under her cloak and checked to be sure that her knife was free in its scabbard she lifted it slightly then pushed it back down feeling its reassuring metallic click as it seated in its sheath the minutes dragged as she walked waiting for the wagon to catch her she fought to keep her fear in check and tried to run through in her mind everything her mother had taught her about using a knife jennsen was alone but she was not helpless she knew what to do she told herself to remember that if there were too many men though nothing would help her she recalled only too vividly how the men at her house had grabbed her and how helpless she had then been they had caught her by surprise but of course it mattered not how reallythey had caught her that was all that mattered if not for sebastian when she turned again to check the wagon was bearing down on her she planted her feet keeping her cloak lifted open slightly so she could reach in and snatch her knife surprising her attacker surprise could be her valuable ally too and the only one she could hope to summon she saw then a lopsided grin of straight teeth beaming at her the big blond man drew his wagon close scattering gravel and raising dust as he set the brake the dust drifted away it was the man from market the man beside irmas place the man who had given her the drink of wine he was alone unsure of his intent jermsen kept her tone curt and her knife hand at the ready what are you doing out here he still wore the grin i came out to give you a ride what about your brothers the pillars of creation i left them back at the palace jennsen didnt trust him he had no reason to come give her a ride thank you but i think you had better go back to your own business she started walking he hopped down off the wagon landing with a thud she turned to be ready should he come at her look i wouldnt feel right about it he said about what i could never forgive myself if i just stood by and let you go out here to your deathwhich is what it will be with no food no water no nothing i thought about what you said that there are some things that you have to do or else life means nothing and isnt worth living i couldnt live with myself if i knew you were out here going to your death his tenacity faltered and his voice turned more pleading come on climb up in the wagon and let me give you a ride what about your brothers before i found out id lost my money you wouldnt rent me a horse because you said you had to get back he hooked a thumb behind his belt resigned to having to explain himself well weve been doing so well at selling wine today that we made a goodly sum joe and clayton were wanting to stay at the palace anyway and have a little fun for a change it was that irma selling her spicy sausages right beside us that did it he shrugged so since she helped us do so well it gives me a chance to come help you since she took your horses and supplies i figure that giving you a ride is the least i can do kind of makes it even out a little its just a ride its not like im risking my life or something just a bit of help im offering someone who i know needs it jennsen surely could use help but she feared to trust this stranger im tom he said as if reading her thoughts id be grateful if you would let me do this to help you what do you mean like you saidsome things you have to do to make life a little more meaningful the briefest of glances took in her ringlets of red hair beneath the cloaks hood before turning solemn thats the way it would make me feel grateful to have done something like that she broke the gaze first im jennsen but i dont come along then i have some wine i dont like wine it only makes me thirsty terry goodkind he shrugged i have plenty of water i brought along some meat pies too theyre still hot i bet if you hurry and have some now she studied his blue eyes blue like her bastard fathers even so this mans eyes had a simple sincerity about them his smile wasnt cocky but modest dont you have a wife to get back to this time it was tom who broke the gaze to look at the ground no maam im not married i travel around a lot i dont imagine a woman would much take to that kind of life besides it doesnt afford me much of a chance to come to know anyone well enough to be thinking about marriage someday though i dearly hope to find a woman who would want to share life with me a woman who makes me smile a woman i can live up to jennsen was surprised to see that the very question made his face go red it seemed to her as if his boldness in talking to her and offering her this ride might be more forward than was his customary conduct as affable as he was he appeared painfully shy something about a man that big and strong being intimidated by her a lone woman in the middle of nowhere by her question about matters of the heart put her at ease if im not harming you your business at earning a living no he put in no youre notnot at all he gestured back toward the plateau we made a good profit today and we can afford a short rest my brothers dont mind at all we travel all over and buy whatever goods we can find at a reasonable price everything from wine to carpets to spring chickens and then we haul it back here to sell it would really be doing my brothers a favor giving them a break jennsen nodded i could use the ride tom he turned serious i know a mans life is at stake tom scrambled up onto the wagon and held down a hand careful maam she took his big hand and put a boot in the iron rung im jennsen so you said maam he gently drew her up to the seat as soon as she was seated he pulled a blanket from behind and placed it in a pile in her lap apparently not wanting to be so presumptuous as to spread it out over her as she arranged it on her lap she smiled her appreciation for the warm wool cover reaching behind again he rooted around under a pile of wellworn packing blankets and came up with a small bundle tom grinned his lopsided smile as he presented her with the pillars of creation the pie wrapped in a white cloth he was as good as his word it was still warm he recovered a waterskin too and set it on the seat between them if youd prefer you can ride in back i brought plenty of blankets to keep you warm and they might be more comfortable to sit on than a wooden seat im fine up here for now she said she lifted the pie in gesture when i get my supplies back and my money i want to pay you back for everything you keep a tally and ill pay you back for it all he released the brake and flicked the reins if thats your wish but i dont expect it i do she said as the wagon lurched ahead as soon as they were under way he turned from her westerly course to a more northwest line she instantly reverted to her suspicion what are you doing where do you think youre going he looked a little startled at her renewed mistrust you said you wanted to go to altheas didnt you yes but i was told to go west until i reached the tallest snowcapped mountain and then on the other side to turn north and follow cliffs oh he said realizing then what she was thinking and why thats if you want it to take an extra day why would that woman tell me to go a way that would take more time probably because thats the way everyone goes to altheas and she didnt know you were in a hurry why send people that way if it takes more time people go that way because they fear the swamp that way puts you in closest to altheas at the end meaning you have to go through the least amount of the swamp it was probably the only way she knew about jennsen had to grab the rail for support as the wagon bounced over a crease in the rocky ground he was right the wooden seat was hard sitting and with a wagon made for hauling heavy loads it bounced more when empty but shouldnt i fear the swamp too she finally asked i suppose well then why should i go this other way he looked over again taking the briefest glance at her hair it was a behavior she was used to most people couldnt help but to look you said a mans life was at stake he said his timidity gone it terry goodkind takes a lot less time this way cutting the comer off the route by going this side of that peak she told you about and not having to go up that twisting canyon beneath the cliffs the problem is you have to go in the swamp from the back so youll have more of the swamp to go through to get in to altheas and that doesnt take more time going through more swamp yes but even with having to go through more swamp im betting youll still save a day each way thats two days saved jennsen didnt like swamps more to the point she didnt like the kinds of things that lived in swamps is it much more dangerous you wouldnt strike out alone with no supplies if it wasnt pretty importanta matter of life and death if you were willing to risk your life to do that then i figured youd be looking to save any time you can if youd rather though i can take you the long way with less distance through the swamp up to you but if time is important its two days more by going that way no youre right the meat pie on her lap was warm it felt good to have her fingers around it he was a thoughtful man for bringing it thank you tom for thinking to save time who is it thats at the other end of life and death a friend she said must be a good friend id be dead now if not for him he was silent as they rolled toward the dark band of mountains in the distance she brooded about what might lie in the swamp worse she worried about what would happen to sebastian if she didnt get altheas help soon enough how long jennsen asked how long till we get to the swamp depends on how much snow is in the pass and on a few other things i dont go this way often so i cant say for sure if we ride all night though im reasonably sure we can be to the back reaches of the swamp by morning how long to get to altheas then through the swamp i mean he glanced over uneasily sorry jennsen but i dont know for sure ive never been in altheas swamp before any guess just knowing the lay of the land i dont think it should take more than a day to go in and come back but im guessing and that doesnt the pillars of creation count how much time youll be spending in there with althea his uneasiness returned ill get you in to altheas as quickly as i can jennsen had to talk to althea about the lord rahlboth her father and the present lord rahl richard her half brother it would not be good if tom were to discover who she was or her purpose his helpfulness would evaporate at the least she also thought that a reason for him to stay behind might be in order lest he get suspicious she shook her head i think it would be best if you stayed with the wagon and horses if you drive all night then youll need to get some rest to be ready as soon as i come out it will save us time he nodded as he considered her words that makes sense but i could still no i appreciate the ride the food and water and the warm blanket but i wont let you risk your life in there too it would be the most help if you waited with the wagon and were ready to drive back when i come out she watched the wind in his blond hair as he thought it over all right if those are your wishes im glad you let me help you with my part of it where to after you see althea back to the palace she said then with good fortune ill have you back at the palace day after tomorrow that was three days for sebastian she didnt know if he had three days or three hours or even three minutes as long as there was a chance he was still alive though she had to go into the swamp despite jennsens misgivings about the job ahead of her the meat pie tasted wonderful hungry as she was nearly anything would have tasted good she pulled a big piece of meat out of the pie and holding it between a finger and thumb fed it to tom after he chewed he said the moon will be up not long after sundown so by the time i reach the pass through the mountains i should be able to see well enough to keep going theres plenty of blankets in back when night comes you should probably crawl back there and if you can get some sleep for tomorrow youll be needing the rest in the morning ill catch a nap while you go in to see althea when you come back ill drive all night and get you right back to the palace i hope that way we can save enough time for you to help your friend she swayed in the seat along with the big man she had only just met who was doing all this for a stranger thank you tom youre a good man terry goodkind he grinned my mama always said so just as she took another bite he added i hope lord rahl thinks so too youll tell him when you see him wont you she didnt know what he could possibly mean and feared to ask him as her mind raced she chewed using her mouthful as an excuse to delay saying anything might inadvertently get her into trouble sebastians life was at stake jennsen decided to smile and play along she finally swallowed the mouthful of course by the slight but sublime smile that lent a curve to the line of his mouth as he tended the reins and watched out ahead it had been the right answer chapter light suddenly hurt her eyes jennsen held a hand up against the brightness and saw that tom was pulling the blankets back off her she stretched and yawned but then realizing fully why she was in the back of a wagon where they were and why they were there her yawn cut short she sat up the wagon was stopped at the edge of a grassy meadow jennsen put a hand on the side of the wagon on the coarse plank worn smooth along the top edge and blinked as she looked about behind them craggy gray rock rose up holding in its cracks and fissures low stalwart bushes gnarled and hunkered low as if against an enduring wind her gaze rose up the weathered rock to where it dissolved into mist tangled growth lay at the foot of the walls beyond the edges of the meadow and beside the narrow chasm that cut through the rock tom had somehow jockeyed the wagon between those steep cliffs the two big draft horses still standing in their harnesses cropped at the shaggy grass ahead beyond the meadow the ground descended into the gloom among spreading trees trailers of vine and hanging moss strange calls clicks and whistles came from under the verdant shroud in the middle of winter was all she could think to say tom lifted the feed bags from the back of the wagon might be a nice place to spend the winter toohe gestured with a nod down the hill under the tangle of growthwere it not for what people say comes out terry goodkind of there if it werent true id bet there would be some fool who by now would have tried to give it a go here but if they have they were pulled in there by some nightmare creature and never made it back out you mean you really think here are monsters or something in there he rested his forearms on the wagons sides as he leaned in right over her jennsen i dont hold with scaring ladies when i was a boy some of the other boys enjoyed waving a wriggling snake at the girls just to hear them scream i never did im not trying to frighten you but i wouldnt be able to live with myself if i just allowed you to go bounding in there as if it were some lark and then you ended up never coming out maybe its just talk i dont know ive never gone in there i dont know anyone who has ever gone in there without being invited inand thats from the other side people say you cant go in the back and live to tell about it if anyone would insist on attempting it it would be you i know youre here for an important reason so i dont expect youre going to sit around for days waiting for an invitation jennsen swallowed her tongue tasted sour she nodded her thanks not knowing what to say tom swiped back his fall of blond hair i just wanted to tell you the truth of what i know he hoisted the feed bags on his way to the horses whatever was in there was in there she had to go in that was all there was to it she didnt have any choice if she wanted to get sebastian away from his captors she had to go in if she ever wanted to be free of lord rahl she had to go in she reached under her cloak and touched the hilt of her knife she wasnt some town girl scared of her own shadow unable to defend herself she was jennsen rahl jennsen pushed the blankets the rest of the way off her and climbed out of the wagon bed using a rear wheel spoke for a step tom was coming back around carrying a waterskin drink its wateri kept it hooked over the hame so the horses would keep it from freezing the cold had dried her out and she drank eagerly she saw tom wipe sweat from his brow and realized only then how warm it really was she supposed no proper selfrespecting swamp full of monsters would allow itself to be frozen over the pillars of creation tom pulled back the folds of cloth of something he held in one hand breakfast she smiled at seeing a meat pie youre a thoughtful man besides being a good man he grinned as he handed her the pie and then turned to undo the trace chains from the horses dont forget you promised to tell lord rahl he called back to her rather than be pulled into any kind of a conversation having to do with her hunter she diverted him from the subject youll be right here then when i come back i mean youll be waiting so we can get back he peered back as he lifted the breaching strap over the horses rump you have my word jennsen i wont desert you here by his expression he was swearing an oath she smiled her appreciation you should get some rest youve driven all night ill try she took another bite of the meat pie it was cold but good and it was filling as she chewed she glanced at the wall of green beyond the meadow at the darkness within then appraised the iron gray sky any idea what time of day it is suns been up an hour at most he said as he checked the joints on the leather straps he gestured back the way they had come in before we started down into this low place we were up above this fog and mist it was sunny up there as somber as it was below the dark overcast such a notion amazed her it looked like dawn had yet to arrive it was hard to believe that the sun was shinning not far off but she had seen such heavy blankets of fog before as she looked down from high places after she was finished eating the meat pie and had brushed the crumbs from her palm jennsen stood waiting until tom turned from unbuckling the girth strap from around the deep powerful chest of one of his horses both big wellkept animals were gray with black manes and tails they were horses as big as any she had ever seen they seemed out of scale until she took in tom working beside them he made them seem not quite so imposing especially as he gave them affectionate strokes they appeared to welcome his familiar touch both horses looked back occasionally at tom as he removed all their gear or rolled a dark eye toward jennsen but both kept much closer watch on the shadows beyond the edge of the meadow their ears were at attention and fixed on the swamp terry goodkind id better get going theres no time to waste he offered a single nod thank you tom if i dont get another chance to say it thank you for helping me not many people would have done as you did his shy grin appeared again to show his teeth most anyone would have helped you but im pleased to be the one who was able to she was sure he meant something that she didnt quite understand whatever it was she had bigger worries her eyes turned toward the echoing calls coming out of the swamp there was no telling how big the trees were because the tops disappeared up into the mist as large as they looked the trunks would have to be enormous vines descended out of the mist along with any number of other twisting climbing plants enshrouding the limbs of the huge trees as if trying to wrestle them down into the darkness below jermsen searched the rim and found a ridge descending from the edge of the meadow like the spine of some huge beast beneath the ground it ran down in under the spreading limbs it wasnt a path exactly but a place to start she had lived in the woods her whole life and could find a trail others would never know existed there was no trail into this place nothing it appeared ever went in she would have to find her own way jermsen turned back from the edge of the meadow and shared a long look with the big mans blue eyes he offered her a small smilerespect for what she was doing may the good spirits be with you and watch over you and you tom get some sleep when i get back well need to ride hard back to the palace he bowed by your command she smiled at his surprising manner and then turned to the gloom and headed down in the swamp held heat gathered under its skirts the humidity was like a presence waiting to push intruders back with every step it grew darker the quiet was as thick as the damp air and the few calls reverberating through the darkness beyond only accentuated the hush and the vast distance that lay below jennsen followed the spine of the ridge as it twisted this way and that going ever lower branches of trees off to each side drooped with the weight of mosses and vines draped over them in some places as she stepped along the exposed rock of the ridge she had to squat down to duck under the limbs in other places she had to push vines aside to make progress the stink of decay drifted up to her through the dead still air the pillars of creation turning looking back she saw a tunnel of light back up to the meadow in the center of the circle of dull light at the end she could see the silhouette of a big man standing hands on hips watching down at her as dark as it was he had no hope of seeing her she could only see him because he stood against the light but he stood watching anyway jennsen couldnt decide what she thought about him he was difficult to figure out he seemed a kindhearted man but she trusted no one except sebastian she trusted him as her eyes adjusted to the dim light she saw looking back that the way she had come in was the only way to enter at least anywhere close that she could see there were steep walls where the rock dropped downward the meadow had been like a mere shelf in the mountainsides descent into the swamp below the meadow the walls held a wealth of plants that used the rock for support as they climbed upward from the swamp below the ridge she used for her descent was a mere fold of rock that provided a way for her to climb down without it the walls were too steep taking a deep breath for resolve as she gazed about jennsen started back down following the ridge of rock as it twisted its way down deeper and deeper in among the trees in places there were frightening drops to each side of where she walked in one place there was only darkness to each side below as if she were on a thread of stone spanning a rupture in the world after peering down into the depths and imagining the keeper of the underworld below awaiting the unwary she trod more carefully she soon came to realize that many of the trees she had seen up higher had only been the canopy of towering ancient oaks rising up from ledges in the rock she realized that she had mistaken some of their upper limbs for trunks jennsen had never seen trees so big her fear was almost replaced by awe she gaped at the layer upon layer of massive limbs as she climbed down past them in the distance she saw nests large clumps of twigs and stalks draped with downy moss and lichen perched in the crotch of limbs if the nests were occupied she didnt see what sort of bird could have built such imposing havens but she guessed they had to be raptors as she stooped while clambering over rock to squeeze herself under a tightly woven net of limbs drooping down close over the spine of the ridge the vista opened onto a vast land hidden under the thick leafy layers of the upper canopy it was like a whole new world hidden away unvisited by anyone before shafts of muted light hardly dared penetrate down this terry goodkind far here and there vines hung down out of the dark growth above birds drifted silently through the cavernous gloom an animal she had never heard before called from the distance a faraway answer returned from another direction as primitive and foreboding as the place seemed she also thought it was darkly beautiful it put her in mind of being in a garden of the underworld where plants basked in eternal gloom the underworld might be the keepers cold domain but the creators everlasting light nourished and warmed good souls in a way the swamp reminded her of so much about dharadark threatening and dangerous but at the same time achingly beautiful in the same way her knife embodied the ugliness of the house of rahl yet it was undeniably exquisite trees clung to the rocky slope around her with clawlike roots as if fearing to be dragged down to what might lurk in the lower reaches some of the ancient pines long dead lay partly fallen caught by their brethren before they could topple to the ground the nearby trees embraced them as if trying to help them up dead gray wood was visible in places under the covering of growth climbing up the tilted trunks many though had collapsed to the ground one old tree lay across her way as if it had melted there conforming to every contour every rise and fall of the ridge the disintegrating wood was spongy underfoot and teeming with insects up in the branches an owl watched as she scrambled ever downward ants marched along the ground carrying bits of treasures from the damp forest roaches big hard and glossy brown skittered across the leaf litter things off in the dense undergrowth disturbed branches as they moved away from her jennsen had spent a lifetime in forests and had seen everything from huge bears to newborn fawns birds to bugs bats to newts there were things that worried her like snakes and bears with cubs but she knew the animals well for the most part they feared people and usually wanted only to be left alone so they generally didnt frighten her but she didnt know what animals might be lurking in this dark and damp place what poison things with fangs she didnt know what conjured beasts might prowl the nether reaches of this sorceresss lair beasts that feared nothing she saw spiders fat dark and hairy their legs slowly raking the dank air descending smoothly on threads anchored somewhere above they vanished into the ferns growing in sprawling mats across the ground as warm and humid as it was jennsen kept her cloak closed around her and the pillars of creation the hood covering her head to better protect herself from the likes of spiders the bite of a spider could be as deadly as any animal dead was dead no matter the cause the keeper of the dead gave no special dispensation because the deadly poison came from something small and seemingly insignificant the keeper of the dead embraced with eternal darkness those come into his domainfor whatever reason no grace was granted for how you came to be dead as at home as jennsen felt in the outofdoors and as hauntingly beautiful as the swamp was the place still kept her eyes wide and her pulse racing every vine or green wisp she touched seemed threatening and more than once made her jump the whole place felt as though death skulked nearby and then before her the spine of rock her only path down ended in a still flat rank moldering mossy place crisscrossed with a tangle of roots it looked like the trees feared the murky wet and tried to keep their roots up out of it to the sides the ground was grown over with every sort of spreading vegetation she spotted the distinctive shape of a leg bone sticking up from the muddy expanse to the side the bone was covered with fuzzy green mold but the general shape remained recognizable what sort of animal it could be from she didnt know at least she hoped it was an animal bone she was surprised to come upon muddy spots that actually looked as if the mud were boiling gooey bubbles of dark brown mud bubbled as if at a slow boil throwing globs of the thick mud and releasing steam nothing grew in the sunken areas of bubbling mud in some places the mud had hardened into collections of short cones from which rose yellowish vapor as jennsen carefully picked a path among the tangle of roots between steaming vents and boiling mud wending her way deeper into the shadows at the bottom she saw that the muddy stretches began to be replaced by standing water at first it was pools and puddles that boiled and hissed and released plumes of acrid vapor as she left the hot springs behind the water grew in size to ponds surrounded by tall reeds reaching up toward clouds of tiny bugs flitting together in balls stagnant water finally took over in earnest a forest floor that was dark and liquid dead trunks stood in the black water sentinels watching over a land reeking of rot the whoops and calls of animals carried across the water from places darker still duckweed grew in some areas near the edges under leafy banks welcoming the unwary with the look of green terry goodkind ground to tread more easily across jennsen noticed eyes poked up through the duckweed watching her pass near by the mossy ground became spongy until it too gradually lowered beneath the motionless water at first she could see the bottom just inches below the glassy surface but it went deeper until she could see only darkness below through that darkness she saw shapes darker yet glide by jennsen stepped from root to root trying to keep her balance without having to put her hands to the often slimy trunks of trees for support by staying on the protruding curves of roots she didnt have to step down into water she feared the water might hide a hole that could swallow her with each step as the roots standing above the surface of the water grew farther and farther apart the knot in the pit of her stomach drew tighter she hesitated fearing she was going too far that she would reach a place where she couldnt turn around she couldnt really question her judgment that this was the best way in because there had been no opportunity to make a choice this had been the only way she leaned down squinting into the gloom peering ahead past trailers of moss and leafy vines through the mist and shadows and undergrowth she thought that not far ahead the ground rose up again offering a drier path taking a deep breath of the sultry air jennsen extended her leg to step across to the next fat root but she couldnt reach it she squatted slightly and stretched harder trying to span the patch of still water but it was just too far she straightened to reconsider she was going to have to jump to the distant thick bulge of root it was more of a hop really than a jump she just didnt like what would be under her if she slipped and fell she also didnt want to have to balance on the lone root out in the expanse of water if she jumped with enough speed and hit the root just right she could spring off it to the far bank she put her fingertips against the smooth but sticky trunk of a tree for support at least it wasnt slimy which could make her hand slip at the worst possible moment she studied the distance as much of a reach as it was it was the closest place that offered a firm dry step with enough momentum she could hop to the next root beyond on drier ground jennsen took a deep breath and then with a grunt of effort shoved away from the tree bounding out over the span of open water just as she landed on the curve of tree root the root moved underfoot her weight was committedshe couldnt reverse direction the root thicker than her ankle suddenly writhed beneath her and disap the pillars of creation peared in an instant a thick coil twisted back around grasping her calf as another length of cold scales whipped up to seize her around her knee it was all so fast that part of her was still going for the root that had grabbed her as another part of her was trying to recoil caught between where shed left and where she was going she had nothing to help her stay upright instinctively jennsen grabbed for her knife but as she did the thing twisted violently flinging her down facefirst she threw her arms out to break her fall water frothed under her she just caught the distant roots at the waters edge real roots wet but rough and woody under her clutching fingers but even as she broke her fall by desperately seizing the roots barely at the limit of her reach she was welcomed into the embrace of an enormous snake surfacing from beneath her through the churning water chapter jennsen strained with all her might using the roots to try to pull herself free she cried out as living coils wrenched her around breaking her grip on the roots and flipped her onto her back she frantically reached behind splashing groping trying to snatch for another handhold she reached then stretched again catching hold of thick roots with first one hand and then the other just in time to prevent herself from being dragged under the water the head came out of the depths to slink up across her stomach as if to inspect its stubborn prey it was the biggest snake jennsen had ever seen the body covered in iridescent green scales shimmered in the weak light as muscles along the powerful trunk flexed the light intermittently played gleaming stripes along the length of it black bands sweeping back across the fierce yellow eyes made it look as if it were wearing a mask red tongue flicking the dark green head glided up between her breasts coming for her face crying out she shoved the head aside in response the muscular body twisted and contracted grappled with her drawing her out into the deeper water jennsens fingertips held fast to the roots with all her might she tried to pull herself out of the water but the snake was too heavy and too strong she tried to kick her legs but the snake had them both now the the pillars of creation coils compressed tugged and dragged her in deeper coughing up water jennsen fought panic that clawed at her just as fiercely just as tenaciously as if it too were a thing alive she needed her knife but to get the knife she would have to let go of the roots but if she let go the beast would pull her down under the black water and drown her one hand she told herself that was all she needed one hand she could get her knife if she let go with one hand but as the unrelenting snake undulated steadily working itself up her body gripping her now around the middle her panic locked her fingers all the tighter to the root as the broad flat head of the snake emerged from the water and once again began slinking up along her body jennsen gripped the root as tight as she could in her left hand with desperate resolve she let her right hand go and thrust it in under her cloak wet cloth bunched as she pushed she couldnt get under it the snakes jaw pressed against her chest as if to let her know that next it was going to compress her lungs so she couldnt breathe she sucked in her stomach and pushed with her fingers trying to get them in under the snake but the heavy body squeezed with paralyzing power against the length of her torso preventing her from getting her hand in under her cloak to get her knife as she struggled madly to get to the weapon wriggling worming her fingers the snake suddenly lurched lifting heavy coils higher pinning her arm to her body with her one hand she still tightly gripped the root behind the weight of the thing though felt as if it would pull her arm from the socket if she didnt let go she was absolutely certain that letting go would be the worst thing she could do but the weight was too much the snake was pulling her so hard that she feared the skin was going to strip from her fingertips despite her best effort she felt her fingers slipping from the root as tears of pain stung her eyes she had no choice she let go of the root she plunged into the dark depths of deeper water her feet at last contacted the bottom she used her momentum to go where she was pulled letting her legs bend and then with strength powered by terror she pushed off the submerged roots as her body flicked around she seized the roots on the far side the snake rolled with her turning her on her back she cried out as her shoulder twisted but in all the movement the splashing the rolling the terry goodkind choking on water there was a brief opening in the snakes grip on her she didnt waste it she seized the silver handle as the broad head with the thin red tongue flicking was again coming toward her face she brought her knife up wedging the tip of the blade up under the snakes jaw the snake paused seeming to recognize the threat that the razorsharp point represented both were still staring at each other she felt giddy relief to at last have her knife in hand even if it was a deadlock she was on her back lying in water with the heavy snake wrapped around her she wouldnt be able to balance or use her weight to help her her arm was weak from the struggle and ached from being twisted she was exhausted with all that working against her it would be no easy matter to dispatch an animal so big and powerful even if they were on dry land such a task would be difficult the yellow eyes watched her she wondered if it was a venomous snake she hadnt yet seen its fangs if it went for her face she wondered if she could be quick enough to stop it im sorry i stepped on you she said she didnt actually believe the snake could understand her she was in a way talking to herself reasoning out loud weve both scared each other the snake remained stone still as it watched her the tongue remained inside the mouth its head lifted several inches by the tip of the knife could probably feel the sharp point maybe it conceived the threat of the blade as a fang jennsen didnt know she just knew that it would be better not to have to battle such a creature she was in the water the snakes domain and out of hers knife or no knife the outcome was not certain even if she killed it the weight of the creature its coils locked around her in a death grip could still drag her under and drown her better to part without a battle if possible go now she whispered with deadly seriousness or i will have to try to kill you she lifted the point of the knife to make herself understood in a language she was more confident the snake might possibly understand her legs began to throb as she felt the constriction ease inch by inch the head drew back scaled coils loosened and slipped away from her body and legs leaving her to feel suddenly buoyant jennsen followed the head as it backed away keeping the point of her knife under the things jaws prepared at the slightest sign of threat to thrust with all her strength finally it slipped back into the water the pillars of creation as soon as she was free of the weight she scrambled up onto solid ground she rested on her hands and knees knife gripped in her fist gasping for air getting her breath letting her frayed nerves settle she had no idea what the snake thought or why or if the same thing might work in another time and place but this day it had and she whispered a prayer of thanks to the good spirits if indeed they had anything to do with her deliverance from deaths scaly grip she didnt want to fail to express her gratitude with the back of her trembling hand jennsen wiped tears of fright from her cheeks before rising up on shaky legs she turned and looked out at the still black water lying beneath the overhanging leaves and mosses in retrospect she recalled her feet touching submerged roots looking back at the expanse of water she had crossed she could see that perhaps the water had risen a few feet to cover the ground there maybe the land had sunk either way if she had just carefully walked through the shallow area rather than tried to jump to the rootturnedsnake it might have proven much less troublesome on the way back she planned to cut herself a walking stick to help her wade through the low place to feel ahead and she would take care not to step on a snake still catching her breath jennsen turned back to the dark way ahead she had yet to get to the sorceresss place and she was wasting time standing around feeling sorry for herself sebastian needed her help not for her to feel sorry for herself she struck out once more soaked to the skin fortunately though it was winter it was warm in the swamp at least she wouldnt freeze she remembered being wet when she and sebastian fled her house after the quad murdered her mother the ground was mere inches above the expanses of stagnant water but with the profusion of roots woven through it firm enough to hold her weight where the water came over the ground it was only for short expanses and shallow even though the water was only inches deep jennsen stepped carefully watching that the roots just below the surface were not lurking snakes she knew that water snakes were some of the most dangerous a poison snake even if it was only a foot long could kill a person like a spider the size was immaterial if its venom was deadly she came to another area where steam rose from fissures in the ground colored deposits mostly yellow crusted around the openings where the terry goodkind vapor rose the smell gagged her and she had to seek a way around that would allow her to breathe the brush was thorny and thick with her knife she was able to cut several of the heavier branches and make it through to a shelf of rock against a rock wall following the narrow ledge she skirted a dark pool of water the surface moved with slow ripples as something beneath followed her movement she kept her knife to hand trying to watch her footing and keep an eye out for anything that might lunge at her out of the water when she grabbed for a handhold and loose rock came away almost making her lose her footing she threw the rock in the water at the thing she couldnt see it continued to follow her until she reached the far end where she was able to climb up onto higher ground that took her into dense growth of tall shoots with broad leaves it reminded her of moving through a field of cornstalks off through the stalks she could see slow movement she didnt know what it could be but by the size of it she didnt want to find out and picked up the pace before long she was running through the thick growth dodging stems and ducking under branches the trees grew in close again and she was soon back to treading among the tangle of roots they seemed endless and progress was agonizingly slow the day was wearing on when she came to open areas or at least open enough she trotted to save time she had been in the swamp for hours it had to be close to the middle of the day tom had told her that he thought it might be a day of travel in and back out of the swamp but she had been at it so long that she began to worry that she might have missed the sorceresss house after all there was no telling how wide the swamp was she could easily have passed it by and never have seen it she began to worry that that was exactly what had happened what if she couldnt find the house what would she do then she didnt relish the idea of spending the night in the swamp there was no telling what manner of creature would come out at night she didnt think there was any chance of making a fire the thought of being in this place in the dark with no hope of even the light of the moon or stars gripped her with fear when she emerged at last on the shore of a broad lake jennsen paused to catch her breath trees fat at the bottom where they emerged from the water stood like a series of poles supporting a low roof of green the light was slightly brighter over the lake to the right side was a wall of the pillars of creation rock that provided not so much as a handhold much less a way to traverse it it dropped straight down into the water suggesting how deep that end might be scanning the shore to the left she was startled to see footprints jennsen ran over and went to one knee to inspect the depressions in the soft ground by the size of them they looked to be made by a man but were not fresh she followed the prints along the shore and in a few places found fish scales from a catch that had been cleaned on the spot the growth beyond was thick and tangled but the grass and dry ground at the edge of the lake provided a good path and the footprints hope at the far side of the still lake she followed the footprints along a wellworn path through a dense stand of willow and up onto higher ground when she peered through an open place in the vegetation she spotted off through the trees beyond the tangled growth of brush and the veil of vines up on a rise ahead a distant house wood smoke curled from a chimney to blend into the gray fog overhead almost as if the smoke itself were creating the ashen overcast in the gray gloom of the dark swamp the light coming from a window at the side of the house shone like a golden jewel a beacon to welcome the lost the desperate the forsaken and defenseless the sight of her journeys end after so much terror and loss brought tears of relief the tears might have been joy were it not for her dire need jennsen hurried along the path among the willow and oak up through the tangled undergrowth past curtains of vines and soon reached the house it was set on a foundation of stone painstakingly fit without mortar the walls were made of cedar logs the roof overhung a narrow porch running around the side with steps down the back to the path to the nearby lake from where she had come taking the steps two at a time up to the narrow porch and following it around the house brought her to a door flanked by pillars of stout logs supporting a simple but welcoming portico from the door down wide steps was a broad and wellmaintained path out through the swamp in front that was the way people came when they were invited to visit the sorceress after the way she had come in it looked like a road wasting no time jermsen knocked impatient she rapped her knuckles again her knocking was interrupted when the door swung inward an older man stood staring out at her in surprise gray hair was taking over from the dark brown and looked to have receded some but it was still thick he was neither lean nor stout and average height his clothes were terry goodkind not the clothes of a trapper or a man of a swamp but those of a craftsman his brown trousers clean and well kept were not coarse but a more expensive tightly woven fabric flecks of gold sparkled from his green shirt he was the gilder friedrich his discerning face scrutinized her more carefully taking in the red hair under her hood what are you doing here he asked his deep voice fit well with the rest of him but it was none too friendly i came to see althea if i may his eyes turned to the path then back to her how did you get here by his suspicious expression after checking she reasoned that he had some way of knowing if someone had been up the path jennsen knew of such telltales she and her mother used them all the time to be sure that no one had sneaked up on them jennsen gestured off around the house i came in the other way in the back from beyond the lake no one can go beyond the lake not even me his brow of wiry black and gray hairs drew down without so much as considering her words or questioning her further youre lying jennsen was stunned im not i came the back way its urgent that i see your wife althea you have not been invited to come here you must leave you will not wander off the trail this time if you know whats good for you now go away but its a matter of life and death i must the door slammed shut in her face chapter jennsen stood unmoving with the suddenly closed door inches from her face she didnt know what to do at that moment she was too stunned for any other emotion to yet flood in from inside she heard a womans voice who is it friedrich you know who it was friedrichs voice was nothing like it had been when he had spoken to jennsen it was now tender respectful familiar well let her in but althea you cant let her in friedrich her voice was scolding without being at all harsh jennsen felt relief wash through her the knot of arguments burgeoning inside her as she prepared to knock again melted away the door opened more slowly this time friedrich gazed out at her not as a man defeated or reprimanded but as a man come to face fate with dignity please come in jennsen he said in a quieter more kindhearted voice thank you jennsen said in a small voice of her own somewhat astonished and slightly troubled that he knew her name she took in everything as she followed him into the home despite how warm it was in the swamp the small fire crackling in the stone fireplace gave the air a sweet smell along with a welcome dry feel that was the sense of it more than heatdryness the furnishings were simple but well made and embellished with carved designs the main room had only two small windows on opposite side walls there were rooms to the back and in one of them a workbench lined with orderly tools sat before another small window jennsen didnt remember the house if indeed this was the same place her memory of coming to altheas home was more of an impression of friendly faces than an actual memory of a place the walls decorated with things for her eyes to feast upon seemed familiar as a child she would have noticed such visual treats there were carvings of birds fish and animals everywhere either hanging by themselves or grouped on small shelves that would be the most captivating to a small child some of the carvings were painted some left plain but the feathers scales and fur had been carved with such fine texture that they looked like animals magically turned to wood other carvings were more stylized and beautifully gilded a mirror on one wall down low was framed with a starburst each ray alternately gilded gold and silver toward the fireplace a large red and gold pillow sat on the floor jennsens eye was drawn to a square board with a gilded grace upon it sitting on the floor before the pillow it was just like the grace she often drew but this one she knew was real small stones rested in a pile to the side in a beautifully made chair with a high back and carved arms sat a slight woman with big dark eyes made all the more striking by golden hair flecked through with gray the fall of hair surrounded her face and swept down to lie about her shoulders her wrists rested over the arms of the chair while her long slender fingers gracefully traced the curve of the spiral carved in the end i am althea her voice was gentle but carried a clear ring of authority she didnt get up jennsen curtsied mistress please forgive my bursting in uninvited and unexpected like this perhaps uninvited but not unexpected jennsen you know my name jennsen realized too late how foolish the question sounded the woman was a sorceress there was no telling what her powers could discern althea smiled and a pleasant look it was on her i remember you one does not forget meeting one like you jennsen wasnt sure what that meant but said thank you anyway the smile on altheas face widened crinkling her eyes my but you look just like your mother were it not for the red hair i would think i had flown back in time to when i saw her last when she was just the age you are now she held a hand out level before her and you were only this big jennsen felt her face going as red as her hair her mother had been beautiful not just wise and loving jennsen didnt believe she could compare to such a attractive woman or ever live up to the kind of example her mother set and how is she jennsen swallowed my mother my mother is gone in anguish jennsens gaze sank to the floor she was murdered im so sorry said friedrich standing behind her he put a hand to her shoulder in sympathy i truly am i knew her some from the palace she was a good woman how did it happen althea asked they finally caught up with us caught up with you altheas brow twitched who why the dharan soldiers lord rahls men jennsen drew her cloak back showing them both the handle of the knife this came from one of them altheas gaze took in the knife then returned to jennsens face im so sorry dear jennsen nodded but i have to warn you i went to see your sister lathea did you see her before she died jennsen stared in surprise yes i did althea shook her head with a sad smile poor lathea how was she i mean did she have a good life i dont know she had a nice house but i only saw her briefly i got the impression she lived alone i went to her because i needed help i recalled my mother mentioning the name of a sorceress who had helped us but i guess i got the names wrong i ended up at your sisters she didnt even want to talk to me she said she could do nothing that it had been you who had helped me before thats why i had to come here how did you get in friedrich asked as he gestured to the path out front you must have wandered off the path not that way i came from the back way now even althea frowned there is no back way well there was no path as such but i made my way through no one can come in from that side althea insisted there are things back there that ward that side i know i had a runin with a huge snake you saw the snake friedrich asked jennsen nodded i stepped on it accidentally i thought it was a root we had a time of it and i had a swim they were both peering at her in a way that made jennsen nervous yes yes althea said sounding unconcerned about the snake waving a hand as if to brush away such petty news but surely you had to see the other things jennsen looked from friedrichs wide eyes to altheas frown i never saw anything but the snake the snake is just a snake althea said dismissing the fearsome beast with another impatient wave of her hand there are dangerous things back there things that would let no one through no one how in the name of creation were you able to get past them what sort of things things of magic althea said in a grim tone im sorry but all i can tell you is that i got through and i never saw anything but the snake she frowned toward the ceiling as she thought again although i did see things in the waterdark things under the water fish friedrich scoffed and in the bushesi saw things in the bushes well i didnt see them exactly but i saw the bushes move and i know something was in there they remained hidden though these things althea said do not hide in bushes they fear nothing they hide from nothing they would have come out and torn you apart i dont know why they didnt jennsen said her gaze darted out through the window at the side to the stagnant expanses of murky water beneath a shadowy tangle of vines feeling a pang of worry about her return journey with sebastians life at stake she felt frustration at the sorceresss pointless talk about what was in the swamp after all she had made it through so it wasnt as impossible as the two of them wished her to believe why do you live out here anyway i mean if youre so wise and all then why do you live out here in a swamp with snakes althea lifted an eyebrow i prefer my snakes without arms and legs jennsen took a breath and started again althea i came because im in desperate need of your help althea shook her head as if she didnt want to hear it i cant help you jennsen was stunned to have her request dismissed so out of hand but you must really please you helped me before i need that help again lord rahl is getting closer all the time ive only just escaped with my life on more than one occasion im at my wits end and dont know what else to do i dont even really know why my father wanted to kill me in the first place because you are an ungifted offspring there youve just spoken the very reason why it makes no sense im ungifted so what possible threat could i represent if he was a powerful wizard what harm could i cause him what threat could i possibly represent why did he want so badly to kill me the lord rahl destroys any offspring he discovers who are not gifted but why that he does is the result not a reason there must be a reason if i at least knew that much of it i might be able to figure out how to do something about it she shook her head again i dont know it isnt like the lord rahl came to discuss his business with me after i saw your sister and she wouldnt help me i went back to ask her about that very thing but she had been murdered by the same men who are after me they must have feared she could tell me something so they murdered her jennsen smoothed her hair back over her head im soff y about your sister i really am but dont you see youre in danger too for what you know about it i cant imagine why they would harm her frowning althea stared off as she considered what youre saying that she might know something makes no sense she was never involved in any of it lathea knew less than she wouldnt have known anything of why darken rahl would have wanted to rid the world of you she could have told you nothing well even if he thought those of us born without the gift were inferior and just plain worthlessif he wanted to exterminate the runts of the litter so to speakwhy would his son my half brother want just as badly to kill me i couldnt harm my father and i cant harm his son yet richard too sends quads to hunt me althea still didnt looked convinced are you sure they are lord rahls men doing this i just dont see in the stones they came into my house they killed my mother i saw them fought them they were dharan soldiers she drew the knife from its sheath at her belt and held the handle up for the woman to see one was wearing this altheas gaze took it in with care the way one would look upon anything deadly but she said nothing why would lord rahl kill my mother why does the house of rahl want me dead i dont know the answer althea lifted her hands and let them fall back to her lap im sorry but thats the truth jennsen went to her knees before the woman althea please even if you dont know why i still need your help your sister wouldnt help she said only you could she said that only you can see the holes in the world i dont know what that means but i know it has something to do with all this with magic please i need help the sorceress appeared puzzled and what is it you wish me to do hide me like you did when i was little cast a spell over me so that they wont know who i am or where to find meso they cant follow me i just want to be left alone i need the spell that will hide me from lord rahl but its not just for me i need it to help a friend too i need the spell to hide my true identity so that i can go back into the peoples palace and get him out get him out what do you mean who is this friend his name is sebastian he helped me when the men attacked and murdered my mother he saved my life he brought me here to see you your sister said we should ask at the palace where we could find you he traveled all that way with me helped me get here so i could come to see you to get the help i need we went to the palace to find friedrich so i could know where you lived and while we were there the guards took sebastian prisoner dont you see he helped me and because of that they have him they will surely torture him he was helping meits my fault hes in this trouble please althea i need your help to get him out i need a spell to hide me so i can go back in and rescue him incredulous althea stared why do you think a spell could accomplish this i dont know i dont know anything about how magic works i just know that i need its helpthat i need a spell to hide my true identity the woman shook her head as if she were dealing with a complete lunatic jennsen what you are envisioning is not how magic works do you think i can cast a web and you will then be able to walk into the palace and guards will somehow fall under this spell and start unlocking doors for you well i dont know of course you dont that is why im telling you that it doesnt work that way magic is not a key that opens doors for you magic is not something thatpoofspontaneously solves problems magic would only compound the problems if you have a bear in your tent you dont invite another in two bears will not be better than the one but sebastian needs my help i need the help of magic in order to get him that help were you to go in there as you think and use some kind ofshe waved a hand around as if trying to think of a word to describe iti nt know magic dust or something to open prison doors to get your friend out what do you suppose would happen that you two could then go off happily and that would be the end of it well i dont know exactly althea leaned forward on an elbow dont you suppose that the people who run the palace would want to know how this happened so they could prevent it from happening again dont you suppose that some perfectly innocent people whose job it is to guard doors there would be in a great deal of trouble for allowing a prisoner to escape and that they might suffer because of it dont you suppose that the palace officials would want their escaped prisoner back dont you suppose since such measures were used to get him out that whatever threat they feared this friend of yours might represent after such an escape they would think that he must be even more dangerous than they originally believed dont you suppose that some perfectly innocent people might be hurt during the extreme measures taken to apprehend such an escaped prisoner dont you suppose they would send out an army and the gifted to comb the countryside before he could get far dont you even suppose the sorceress finally said in the gravest of tones that a wizard as powerful as the lord rahl of all of dhara might have some decidedly nasty and painfully protracted fatal surprise in store for anyone daring to use a pitiful old sorceresss spell against himand within his very own palace walls on top of it jennsen stared at the dark eyes fixed on her i never thought of all that you are telling me something i already know but how can i get sebastian back how can i help him i would suppose you must figure a way to get him outif he can be gotten out in the first placebut it must be done in a way that takes all that i have said and more into account breaking a hole in the wall for him to step through to freedom would bring out the hounds now wouldnt it it would bring you trouble much like magic would you must instead think of a way that convinces them to turn him out on their own then they wont be chasing you to have him back that all made sense to her how can i accomplish such a thing the sorceress shrugged if it can be done i would wager that you can do it after all you have so far lived to grow into a fine young woman escaped quads found me and got yourself in here now didnt you youve accomplished much you must only set your mind to it but you dont start out by picking up a stick and whacking a hornets nest but i cant see how i can do it without the help of magic im a nobody a nobody althea scoffed as she leaned back she was becoming a teacher impatient with a student doing poorly on a lesson you are somebody you are jennsen a smart girl with a brain you should not kneel before me and plead ignorance telling me what you cannot do while asking instead for others to do for you if you want to be a slave in life then continue going around asking for others to do for you they will oblige but you will find the price is your choices your freedom your life itself they will do for you and as a result you will be in bondage to them forever having given your identity away for a paltry price then and only then you will be a nobody a slave because you yourself and nobody else made it so but maybe in this case its different the sun rises in the cast there are no special exceptions just because you wish it i know of what i speak and i am telling you magic is not the answer what do you think if you had a spell that they didnt know you were darken rahls daughter then they would fall over themselves to open doors for you they will open the door of your friends cell for no one unless they think it should be opened it would make no difference if there were a spell to turn you into a sixlegged rabbitthey would still not open the doors you want opened just because you were now a sixlegged rabbit by the hand of magic but magic magic is a tool not a solution jennsen reminded herself to remain composed even though she wanted to seize the woman by the shoulders and shake her until she agreed to help unlike with lathea she did not intend to lose this chance for that help what do you mean magic is not a solution magic is powerful you have a knife you showed it to me thats right and when you are hungry do you wave your knife in someones face and demand their bread no you entice them to give you bread by giving them a coin in exchange you mean you think they can be bribed another sigh no of all i know i can tell you that they cannot be bribedat least not in the conventional sense however the principle is not entirely without some parallel when friedrich wishes bread he doesnt use his knife to take the bread from those who have itat least not in the sense of how you wish to use magic he uses his knife as a tool to carve figures and then he gilds them he sells what he made with his knife and then exchanges that coin for the bread you see if he would use the knifethe toolto directly solve the problem of getting bread it would do him more harm in the end he would be a thief and hunted as such he uses his head instead and uses the knife as a tool to create something with the aid of his mind thus solving the problem of obtaining bread with his knife you mean then that i need to use magic indirectly i must somehow use magic as a tool to help me althea sighed heavily no child forget magic you must use your head magic is trouble use your head i did jennsen said it wasnt easy but i used my head to come to you to get help its a spell i need now as a tool to help meto hide me in that way it will be a tool as you suggest althea looked away into the hearth watching the wavering flames i cannot help you in that way i dont think you understand im hunted by powerful men i just need a spell to hide my identitylike you did when i was little when i lived at the palace with my mother still the old woman stared off into the hearth i cannot do that i dont have the power but you do youve already done it once a lifetime of frustration fear loss and futility surfaced bringing with it bitter tears i didnt travel all this way suffer all this hardship to have you tell me no lathea told me no told me that only you can see the holes in the world and that only you could help me i must have your help your spell to hide me please althea im begging for my life althea would not look her in the eyes i cannot cast a spell like that for you jennsen choked back the tears please althea i just want to be left alone you have the power i do not have what youve invented in your mind for me i have helped you in the only way i can how can you sit here knowing that other people are suffering and dyingand not help how can you be so selfish althea how can you not help when i need it friedrich put a hand under jennsens arm lifting her to her feet im sorry but youve asked what you would youve heard what althea has to say if youre wise you will use what youve learned to help yourself now its time for you to leave jennsen pulled away all i want is the help of a spell how can she be so selfish friedrichs eyes blazed with fury even if his voice did not you have no right to speak to us in that manner you dont know anything about it about the sacrifices shes made its time for you to friedrich althea said in a soft voice why dont you make us some tea althea there is no reason you should have to explain any of itleast of all to her althea smiled up at him its all right explain what jennsen asked my husband may sound harsh to you but its because he doesnt want me to burden you he knows that some people leave here unhappy with the knowledge i give them her dark eyes turned up to her husband make us some tea friedrichs face twisted with a longsuffering expression before he nodded in resignation what do you mean jermsen asked what knowledge what is it you arent telling me as friedrich went to a cupboard and retrieved a kettle and cups setting the cups on the table althea gestured for jennsen to sit on the pillow before her chapter jennsen made herself comfortable on the red and gold pillow on the floor in front of the sorceress many years ago althea began clasping her hands in her lap atop her blackandwhite print dress more than you might believe i traveled with my sister to the old world beyond the great barrier to the south jennsen decided that for the time being it might be best just to keep quiet and learn what she could rather than bring up what she already knewthat the new lord rahl bent on conquest had destroyed the great barrier to the south in order to invade the old world and that sebastian had come up from the old world to try to find a way to help the emperor jagang the just stop the invading dharans she thought that maybe if she understood it all a little better herself then she might be able to come up with a way of convincing althea to help her i went to the old world to go to a place called the palace of the prophets althea said this too jennsen had heard of from sebastian i have a gift for a very primitive form of prophecy i wanted to learn what i could about it while my sister wished to learn about cures and such i also wanted to learn things about people like you me jennsen said what do you mean the ancestors of darken rahl were no different than he they all eliminated any ungifted offspring they discovered had been born lathea and i were young and full of fire to help those in need and also those we felt were unjustly persecuted we wanted to use our gift to help change the world for the better while we each hoped to study different things we both went for much the same reasons jennsen thought that seemed pretty close to how she felt and was just the kind of help she was talking about but she also knew that right then was not the moment to say it she asked instead why did you have to travel all the way to the palace of the prophets to learn these things the sorceresses there are renowned to have experience with many things with wizards and magic and most of all with matters to do with this world and with the worlds beyond worlds beyond jennsen gestured to the space outside the outer gilded ring on the grace setting not far away you mean the world of the dead althea leaned back as she reflected well yes but not exactly you understand the grace althea waited for jennsens nod the sorceresses at the palace of the prophets have knowledge about the interactions of the gift the veil between worlds and their interdependent relationshipshow it all fits together they are called the sisters of the light jennsen recalled with a jolt that sebastian had said that the sisters of the light were with emperor jagang now sebastian had offered to take jennsen to the sisters of the light hed said he thought they might be able to help her it had to be that they had something to do with the creators light and especially the gift in the center of the grace another thought came to her this has something to do with what lathea said that you could see the holes in the world as she called it althea smiled with the pleasure of a teacher seeing a student flirting with discovery thats the tip of the tooth you see the ungifted offspring of the lord rahlof every lord rahl going back thousands of yearsare different than anyone else you are holes in the world to those of us with the gift what does that mean exactlyholes in the world we are blind to you blind but you see me lathea could see me too i dont understand not blind with our eyes blind with our gift she swept an arm out toward friedrich at the fire with an iron kettle and then toward the window there are living things all around you see them with your eyes you see friedrich and the trees and suchjust as i do just as everyone does she held up a finger to make her point but through my gift i also see them while our eyes may perceive you those of us with the gift cannot see you with that aspect of ourselves darken rahl could not see you any more than i can neither can the new lord rahl to those of us with the gift you are a hole in the world but but jennsen stammered in confusion that makes no sense hes been hunting me he sent men after methey had my name on a piece of paper they may hunt you but only in the conventional sense they cannot find you with magic his gift is blind to you he has to use spies bribes and threats to locate you in addition to his wits and cunning were it not so he might send some magic beast to reap your bones for him and be done with it instead of sending out men with your name written down on a piece of paper you mean im already invisible to him no i know you i remember your red hair i recognized you because i remember your mother and you look like her i know you in those waysthe ways anybody knows and recognizes someone darken rahl were he alive might recognize you if he remembered your mother others who knew him might well see some of him in you as i do in addition to your mothers looks he could know you in all those same ways common to one without the gift he can find you by ordinary means of course if he or one with the gift were to actually lay eyes on you they would realize you are an ungifted offspring of a rahlbecause they could see you but he could not find you with magic that he cannot do to those of us with the gift you are in many ways like everyone else except that you are a hole in the world jennsen was frowning she only realized it when althea tapped her thumbs together thinking in response to that face when i was at the palace of the prophets althea finally said i knew a woman there a sorceress like me named adie she had traveled alone to the old world from a faroff land in order to learn what she could but adie was blind blind she could travel alone when she was blind althea smiled at the memory of the woman oh yes with the use of her gift rather than her eyes all sorceressall people with the gifthave unique abilities on top of that in some the gift is stronger like people who have big muscles are stronger than me like friedrich he is stronger in muscles you have hair like other people but yours is red some have blond or black or brown despite what things people have in common each person has different attributes its like that with the gift its not only different in its aspects but the power of those aspects differ with some its very strong with some weak each of us is an individual were all unique in our ability our gift the same as you are unique in other ways and what about your friend adie ali well adies eyes were completely whiteblindbut she had learned the trick of seeing with her gift the gift told her more about the world around her than my eyes told me adle could see people better with her gift than i could with my eyes much like when people who dont have the gift go blind they depend more on their hearing so they learn to hear more than you or adie did that with her gift she saw by sensing that infinitesimal spark of the creators gift that everything haslife itself and more creation the point is that to me to darken rahl to adie you do not exist you are a hole in the world for reasons jennsen could not at first comprehend terror washed through her and then the sense of her terror began to take shape she could feel her eyes filling with tears the creator didnt give me life like everyone else i came to exist in some other way im some kind of monster my father wanted to have me killed because im some monstrosity of nature no no child althea said as she leaned forward and stroked a comforting hand down jennsens hair that is not at all what i mean jennsen tried mightily to contain the new shape of dread through watery vision she saw altheas concerned face gazing down at her im not even part of creation thats why the gift cant sense me the lord rahl only wanted to rid the world of an error of nature an evil thing jennsen dont put words where i have not listen to me now jennsen nodded as she wiped under her eyes im listening just because youre different that doesnt make you evil just what am then if not a monster untouched by creation my dear child you are a pillar of creation but you said i said that those with the gift cannot see you with it i did not say that you dont exist or that you are not as the rest of us a part of creation then why am i one of those things one of those holes in the world althea shook her head i dont know child but our lack of knowledge does not prove something evil an owl can see at night does it make you evil because people cant see you while the owl can one persons limitations dont confer wickedness on another it shows only one thing the existence of limitations but all the offspring of the lord rahl are like this she considered carefully before answering the genuinely ungifted ones yes those who are born with at least some tiny aspect of the gift are not that aspect can be so infinitesimal and unusable that it would not even be recognized to exist by anyone in any other way aside from this one for all practical purposes those offspring would be thought of as ungifted except that they would have this quality that would keep them from being like youholes in the world it also makes them vulnerable this kind of offspring can be found with magic and thus eliminated could it be that most of the offspring of lord rahl are like that and those like me holes in the world are actually the ones who are more rare yes althea admitted quietly jennsen sensed an undercurrent of tension in the single word answer are you suggesting that there is something more to all of this than just that we are holes in the world to the gifted yes that was one of the reasons i went to study with the sisters of the light i wanted to better understand the interrelationship of the gift with life as we know itwith creation did you discover anything were the sisters of the light able to help you unfortunately no althea gazed off in reflection few if any would agree with me but i have come to suspect that all people with the single exception of those like youoffspring of a lord rahl born wholly without the gifthave this imperceptible spark of magic that while intangible in every other way connects them to the gifted and thus to the greater world of creation i dont understand what this would mean for me or for anyone else althea slowly shook her head there is more to this jennsen than i know i suspect there is something far more important involved jennsen couldnt imagine what that could be how many offspring are born entirely without the gift as far as ive learned its exceedingly rare for more than one offspring of each lord rahl to be born with the gift as we think of ithis seed conceives but one true heir althea held up a finger as she leaned forward but it is possible that while the others are ungifted in the conventional sense many have this otherwise invisible and sterile spark of the gift so that they are detected and destroyed before others like me know of them it is entirely possible that those like you are the ones who are truly rare as is the single formally gifted heir and thats why you survived for those like me to notice thus slanting our idea of which kind is rare and which common as i said i think there is far more to this than i know or can understand but of those truly like you devoid of even this otherwise imperceptible glimmer of the gift all are pillars of creation jennsen said sarcastically althea chuckled perhaps that sounds better but to the gifted we are holes in the world altheas smile withered it is so were adie here blind as she is with her eyes and seeing only with her gift were you to stand before her she would see everything but you she would be blind to you to adie able to see with the gift only you would truly be a hole in the world that doesnt make me feel very good about myself altheas smile returned dont you see child it proves only the limitation to one who is blind everyone is a hole in the world jennsen thought it over then its only a matter of perception some people are simply lacking the ability to perceive me in one narrow way althea gave her a single nod thats right but because those with the gift often use their ability without conscious thought like you use your vision its very disturbing to those with the gift to encounter one such as you disturbing why is it disturbing its troubling when your senses do not agree but they can still see me so why do i trouble them well imagine if you heard a voice but you could see no source for it jennsen didnt have to imagine that she understood quite well how troubling that was or imagine the sorceress said if you could see me but when you reached out to touch me your hand passed through me as if i wasnt here wouldnt that trouble you i suppose jennsen conceded is there anything else about us thats different other than that we are holes in the world to those with the gift i dont know its exceedingly rare to come across one such as you who is still alive while its possible that others exist and i once heard a rumor that one lived with the healers called the raugmoss i only know of you for certain when jennsen had been very young she had visited the healers the raugmoss with her mother do you know the name drefan was the name whispered but i dont know if its true even if it is the likelihood of him still being alive would be remote the lord rahl is the lord rahl he is his own law darken rahl like most of his ancestors probably fathered many children hiding the knowledge of such a childs paternity is dangerous few would risk it so most of your kind were known and immediately put to death the rest are eventually found thinking out loud jennsen asked could it be that were like this as a form of protection there are animals that have special traits when theyre born that help them survive fawns for example have spots to hide them to make them invisible to predatorsmake them holes in the world althea smiled at the notion i suppose that could be as good an explanation as any knowing magic though i would expect the reason to be more complex everything seeks balance the deer and the wolves strike a balancethe fawns spots help them survive but that threatens the existence of wolves who need food such things go back and forth if the wolves ate all the fawns then the deer would die out and the wolves if they had no other source of food would also die out because they had altered the balance between them and the deer they coexist in a balance that allows both species to survive but at the cost of some individuals with magic balance is critical what on the surface may seem simple often turns out to have much more complex causes i suspect that with those like you an elaborate form of balance is being struck and that being a hole in the world is merely an ancillary indication and maybe some of the balance is that like some fawns are caught despite their spots some with the gift are able to see me your sister said you could see the holes in the world no i cant really i simply learned a few tricks with the gift in much the same way adie did jennsen frowned feeling bewildered again so althea asked can you see a bird on a moonless night no if theres not even a moon its impossible impossible no not entirely althea pointed skyward moving her hand as if suggesting something passing overhead you will see the stars go dark where the bird passes if you watch the holes in the sky you will in a way be seeing the birds just a different way of seeing jennsen smiled at such a clever notion so thats how you see those like me that comparison is the easiest way i can explain it to you both though have limitations it only works to see the bird at night if theyre flying against a background of stars if there are no clouds and so on with those like you its much the same i simply learned a trick to help me see those like you but its very limited when you went to the palace of the prophets did you learn about your ability for prophecy maybe that could somehow help with what i need to do nothing in relation to prophecy would be of any use to you but why not althea tilted her head forward as if to question whether or not jennsen had been paying attention where does prophecy come from prophets and prophets are strongly gifted with that ability prophecy is one form of magic but the gifted cannot see you with their gift remember to them you are a hole in the world therefore prophecy since it comes through prophets cannot see you either i have a wisp of ability for prophecy but i am no prophet when i was with the sisters of the light since such things were one of my fields of interest i spent decades in their vaults studying prophecy they had been written down by great prophets throughout the ages i can tell you both from personal experience and from all that i read that the prophecies are as blind to you as would be adie as far as the prophecies are concerned your kind never existed do not exist now and never will exist jennsen sat back on her heels hole in the world indeed at the palace of the prophets i met a prophet nathan and while i learned nothing about those like you i learned some about my talent mostly i only learned how limited it is eventually the things i learned there came to haunt me what do you mean the palace of the prophets was created many thousands of years ago and is like no other place that i know of a unique spell surrounds the entire palace and grounds it distorts the way in which those under the spell age it changed you then in some way oh yes it changes everyone aging is slowed for those living under the spell of the palace of the prophets while those outside the palace went about their lives and aged roughly ten to fifteen years those of us in the palace aged only one year jennsen made a skeptical face how could such a thing be nothing ever stays the same the world is always changing the world back in the great war three thousand years ago was much different the world has changed since then when the great barrier to the south of dhara was put up wizards were different they had vast power back then darken rahl had vast power no darken rahl as powerful as he was was nothing compared to the wizards of that time they could control powers darken rahl only dreamed of so wizards like that with that kind of vast power all died out there have been no wizards like them born since althea stared off as she answered in a grave tone not since that great war has there been one like that born even wizards themselves have come to be born less and less often but for the first time in three thousand years one has again been born your half brother richard is such a man it turned out her pursuer was far more fearsome than jennsen had given him credit for even in her all too vivid imagination small wonder that her mother had been murdered and lord rahls men were so close on jennsens heels this lord rahl was altogether more powerful and dangerous than had been their father because this was such an epochal event some of those at the palace of the prophets knew of richard long before he was born there was much anticipation over this one this war wizard war wizard jennsen didnt like the sound of that yes there was much controversy as to the meaning of the prophecy of his birth even to the meaning of the term war wizard while at the palace i had a chance on two brief occasions to meet the prophet i mentioned nathan nathan rahl jennsens mouth fell open nathan rahl you mean a real rahl althea smiled not only at the memory but at jennsens surprise oh yes a real rahl commanding powerful clever charming and inconceivably dangerous they kept him locked away behind impenetrable shields of magic where he could cause no harm yet he sometimes managed it yes a real rahl over nine hundred years old he was too thats impossible jennsen insisted before she had time to think better of it friedrich standing over her harrumphed he handed a steaming cup of tea to his wife and then passed one down to jennsen with the question in her eyes jennsen looked back at althea i am close to two hundred years old althea said jennsen just stared althea looked old but not that old in part this business with my age and how the spell slowed my aging is how i came to have dealings with you and your mother when you were young althea sighed heavily and took a sip of tea which brings me back to the story at hand to what you wanted to knowwhy i cannot help you with magic jennsen sipped then glanced up at friedrich who looked about as old as althea are you that age too no he gibed althea robbed the cradle for me jennsen saw the looks that passed between them the kind of intimate glances between two people who were close jennsen could see in the eyes of these two that they could read each others slightest expression she and her mother had been like that able to see thoughts in the slightest movement of the eyes of the other it was the kind of communication she thought was facilitated not only through familiarity but through love and respect i met friedrich when i returned from the old world i had aged only about the same as friedrich i had lived a much longer time of course but my body had not aged to show it because i had been under the spell of the palace of the prophets when i came back i became involved in a number of things and one of them was how i might help those such as you jennsen hung on every word thats when you met my mother yes you see the spell at the palace the spell that altered time sparked an idea of how i might help those like you i knew that regular means of casting websmagicaround your kind never seemed to work out others had tried but failed the offspring were killed i struck on the idea instead to cast the web not on you but on those who came into contact with you and your mother jennsen leaned forward expectantly feeling sure that she was finally getting to the core of what might prove to be the help she sought what did you do what sort of magic i used magic to alter peoples perception of time itself i dont understand what did that do well the only way darken rahl could search for you was as ive explainedby using regular means i tinkered with those regular means i made it so that those who knew of you perceive time differently i still dont understand howwhatdid you make them perceive time is time althea leaned forward with a cunning smile i made them think you were just born when all the time whenever they found out some thread of news about you as a child fathered by darken rahl they perceived you and reported you as newborn when you were two months ten months four years five years six years old they were all still looking for a newborn despite how long they had known of you the spell slowed their perception of time in relation to you alone so that they were always looking for a newborn baby rather than a girl growing up in this way until you were six i hid you right under their noses that threw everyones calculations off by six years to this day anyone who suspected your existence would believe you to be around fourteen or so when you are actually more than twenty because they thought you were newborn when the spell ended when you were six thats when they began to mark your age jennsen rose up onto her knees but that could work you must only do it again if you were to cast a spell like that for me now like you did when i was little it would work the same wouldnt it then they wouldnt know i was grown up they wouldnt be hunting me they would be looking for a newborn please althea just do that again do what you did once before from the corner of her eye jennsen saw friedrich now sitting at his bench in a back room turn away by the look on altheas face jennsen knew that she had somehow said the wrong thing and precisely what the sorceress had planned on her saying jennsen realized that this had been a trap of sorts and she had just talked herself right into it i was young and masterful in my skill with magic althea said in her dark eyes glimmered the spark of recollection of that grand time in her life in thousands of years few had been through the great barrier and back i had i had studied with the sisters of the light had audiences with their prelate and with the great prophet i had accomplished such things as few others had i was well over a hundred years old and still young with a handsome and charming new husband who believed i could walk to the moon and back if the fancy struck me i was well over a hundred years of age yet still youthful with a full life ahead of me wise with age yet still young i was clever oh so clever and powerful in my gift i was experienced knowledgeable and attractive with many friends and a circle of people who hung on my every worldly pronouncement with long graceful fingers althea pulled up the hem of her skirt uncovering her legs jennsen drew back at the sight she saw then why althea had not stood before her legs were withered deformed shriveled bones covered with a dry veneer of pallid flesh as if they had died years ago but never been buried because the rest of her was still living jennsen didnt know how the woman could keep from screaming in constant anguish you were six the sorceress said in a terribly calm and quiet voice when darken rahl finally discovered what i had done he was a very ingenious man much more shrewd as it turned out than a young sorceress of a hundredodd years in age i only had time to tell my sister to warn your mother before he caught me jennsen remembered running when she was little she and her mother had fled the palace it had been night it had been shortly after a visitor had come to their door in the dark hall there had been whispering and then they had fled but he he didnt kill you jennsen swallowed he showed you mercyhe spared your life althea chuckled without humor it was an empty laugh at encountering a profoundly naive notion darken rahl did not always believe in simply killing those who displeased him he preferred instead that they should live a good long time death would have been a release you see if they were dead how could they regret how could they suffer how could they serve as an example to others you cannot imagine and i could not begin to tell you the terror of such a capture of the long walk to be taken before him of what it was like being in the grip of that man of what it was like to look up into his calm face his cold blue eyes and know you were at the mercy of a man who had none you cannot imagine what it was like to know in that single terrible instant that everything you were everything you had everything you had hoped for in life was about to forever change the pain was what you might expect i suppose perhaps my legs can partly attest to it im so sorry jennsen whispered through her tears hands pressed over her heartache but the pain was not the worst of it not the worst by far he stripped me of everything i had but took for granted he did to my power to my gift worse than he did to my legs you just cannot see ityou are blind to it every day i see it that hurt i assure you you cannot begin to imagine even all that though was not enough for darken rahl his displeasure at what i had done to hide you had only begun he banished me here to this sunken foul place of hot springs and sickening vapors he imprisoned me here filling in about me a swamp with monstrosities created by the very power he had stripped from me he wanted me close you see several times he visited just to behold me in my prison im at the mercy of those things out there that are given life by my own gift a gift to which i no longer have access i could never drag myself out by my arms alone but even if i were to try or if i had the help of another those beasts created from my own power would rip me apart i cant call them back even to save myself he left a path in the front so that provisions and supplies could be brought in so i would be sure to have the things i needed friedrich had to build a home for us here because i cannot ever leave darken rahl wished me a long lifea life i could spend suffering for displeasing him jennsen trembled as she listened unable to say anything althea lifted a hand to point with one long graceful finger toward the back room that man who loves me had to witness it all friedrich was thus condemned to a life of tending to a crippled wife he loved who could no longer be a wife to him in ways of the flesh she ran a hand over her bony limbs tenderly as if seeing them as they they once were i have never again had the joy of being with my husband as a woman is with a man my husband never again was able to share and enjoy the intimate charms of the woman he loves she paused to regain her composure before going on as part of my punishment darken rahl left me with the power to use my gift in the one way which would haunt me every day prophecy jennsen could not help herself from asking thinking that this must be one thread of possible comfort left to the woman its part of your giftcant it bring you some joy dark eyes fixed on her again did you enjoy the last day with your motherthe day before she died yes jennsen finally said did you laugh and talk with her yes what if you had known that the next day she was to be murdered what if you saw it all long before it happened days weeks or even years before knew what was to happen when every ghastly detail saw by the power of your magic the horrifying sight of it the blood the agony the dying would that please you would you still have experienced that joy that laughter jennsen answered in a small voice no so you see jennsen rahl i cannot help you not because i am selfish as you put it but because even if i were willing i have no power left to cast you a spell you must find within yourself the ability to help yourself the free will to accomplish what you must only in that way can you truly succeed in life i cannot give you a spell to solve your problems i have spent a good deal of my life suffering for the last spell i cast for you were it only me i would endure it willingly for i was doing what i believe in this is the fault of an evil man not the fault of an innocent child yet i suffer each day because it was not just my life forfeit but friedrich s too he might have i might have nothing he had come up behind jennsen i have considered each day of my life a privilege because you are in it your smile is the sun gilded by the creator himself and brightens my small existence if this is the price for all of that i have gained then i paid it willingly dont devaluate the quality of my joy althea by minimizing it or trivializing it althea looked back down at jennsen you see this is my daily torture knowing what i have not been able to be to do for this man jennsen withered sobbing at the womans feet magic althea whispered from above is trouble you dont need chapter jermsens thoughts were lost in a forlorn fog the swamp was only there because it was beneath her feet around her above her but her mind was in a more confused and tangled jumble than all the twisted things around her so much of what she believed had turned out to be wrong that meant that not only were many of her hopes lost but her solutions too worse yet jennsen had come facetoface with the misery hardship and heartbreak her existence had ended up causing others who had tried to help her through the tears she could hardly see her way she moved almost blindly through the mire she stumbled at times crawled when she fell sobbing in racking agony when she paused supported by the limb of an old gnarled tree it was like the day of her mothers murder all over againthe anguish the confusion the insanity of it all the bitter despairbut this time for altheas tortured life staggering through the dense growth jennsen grasped vines for support as she wept since her mothers death finding the sorceress and getting her help had given jermsens life a direction a goal she didnt know what to do now she felt lost in the midst of her life jermsen wound her way through an area where steam rose from fissures all about her angry vapor bellowed as it was unleashed from un derground in billowing clouds she plodded past the stench of the boiling vents and back into the thick growth thorny bushes scratched her hands broad leaves slashed at her face reaching a dark pool she vaguely remembered jermsen shuffled along the ledge gripping rocks for handholds weeping as she made her way along the brink rock crumbled and came away in her hand she fought to keep her balance as she snatched for another handhold catching on just in time to keep herself from falling she gazed over her shoulder through blurry vision at the dark expanse of water jennsen wondered if it might be better were she to fall better to be swallowed into the depths and be done with it it looked a sweet embrace a gentle end to it all it looked like the peace she sought peace at last if she could just die there on the spot the impossible struggle would be over the heartache and sorrow would be ended maybe then she could be with her mother and the other good spirits in the underworld she doubted though that the good spirits took people who murdered themselves to take a life except to defend life was wrong if jermsen were to give up all that her mother had done all her sacrifices would be for nothing her mother waiting in eternity might not forgive jennsen for throwing her life away althea too had lost nearly everything to help her how could jennsen ignore such braverynot just altheas but friedrichs too despite how miserably responsible she felt she could not throw her only life away she felt though as if she had stolen altheas chance at life despite what the woman had said jennsen felt a sense of burning shame for what althea had suffered althea would be imprisoned in this miserable swamp forever every day paying the price of having tried to hide jennsen from darken rahl jennsens mind might have been telling her that it was darken rahls doing but her own heart said otherwise althea would never have her own life back be free to walk free to go where she would free to have the joy of her own gift what right had jennsen to expect others to help her anyway why should others forfeit their life their freedom for her sake what gave her the right to ask such sacrifice of them jennsens mother was not the only one to suffer because of her althea and friedrich were chained to the swamp lathea had been murdered and sebastian was now held prisoner even tom waiting for her up in the meadow had set aside earning his living to come to her aid so many people had tried to help her and paid a terrible price where had she ever gotten the idea that she could shackle others to her wishes why should they have to relinquish their lives and needs for hers but how could she go on without their help free of the ledge and deep pool jennsen trudged on through an endless tangle of roots they seemed to deliberately catch her feet twice she fell sprawling both times she got up and continued on the third time she fell she hit her face so hard the pain stunned her jennsen ran her fingers over her cheekbone her forehead thinking something surely must be broken she found no blood nor protruding bone lying there among the roots like so many snakes coiled all about her she felt shame for all the trouble she had brought to peoples lives and then she felt anger jennsen she recalled her mothers words dont you ever wear a cloak of guilt because they are evil jennsen pushed herself up on her arms how many others might have tried to help those like jennsen the offspring of a lord rahl and paid with their lives how many more would why should they like jennsen not have their own lives it was the lord rahl who bore the responsibility for lives ruined jennsen surrender would it never stop grushdeva du kalt misht sebastian was only the latest was he being tortured that very moment because of her was he paying with his life too for helping her surrender poor sebastian she felt a pang of longing for him he had been so good to help her so brave so strong tu vash misht tu vask misht grushdeva du kalt misht the voice insistent commanding echoed around in her head whispering the words that made no sense she staggered to her feet could she never have her own lifenot even her own mind must she always be pursued by lord rahl by the voice jenn leave me be she had to help sebastian she was moving again putting one foot in front of the other pushing vines and leaves and branches aside cutting through the underbrush the thick mist and dense canopy of leaves made it dark as dusk she had no idea how late in the day it was it had taken a lot of time to reach altheas place she had been there a long time for all jennsen knew it might be near dusk at best it could be no earlier than late afternoon she had hours left before she made it back to the meadow where tom waited she had come for help but that help had been an illusion invented in her own mind she had relied on her mother her whole life and then she had expected althea to help her she had to accept that it was up to her to do what was necessary to help herself jennsen surrender no leave me alone she was so very tired of it all now she was angry too jennsen plunged onward through the swamp splashing through water stepping along roots and rocks when they were available she had to help sebastian she had to get back to him tom was waiting tom would take her back but what then how was she going to get him out she had depended on althea to help her with some kind of magic now she knew there could be no such help panting from the effort of running through the swamp she halted when she came to the expanse of water where the snake had been before jennsen gazed out at the silent still expanse of water but didnt see anything no roots that were really a snake protruded above the surface it was getting gloomy she couldnt tell if anything lurked in the dark shadows beneath leaves drooping over the banks sebastians life hung in the balance jennsen waded into the water halfway in she remembered that she had promised herself that she was going to take a staff to help keep her balance when she returned through the open water she paused debating whether or not she should go back to cut a staff going back was just as far as going on so she kept going feeling with her feet she found a firm bottom of roots real roots and stepped carefully along them surprisingly as long as she stayed on the roots the water came up only to her knees and she was able to hold up her skirts to keep them dry as she waded through the murky water something bumped her leg jennsen flinched she saw the flash of scales her foot slipped she saw with heady relief that it was only a fish darting away trying to get her balance to regain her footing jennsen stepped heavily into the bottomless black depths she only had time for a short gasp before she was under the water darkness surrounded her she saw a whirl of bubbles as she went under surprised she kicked frantically trying to find bottom something anything to stop her descent there was nothing she was in deep water weighted down by wet clothes rather than support her now her heavy boots dragged her under jennsen flailed her arms splashing at the surface just long enough to gasp a breath before she was under again the shock of it was startling with all her strength she moved her arms trying to swim to the surface but her clothes were like a net around her dampening and hampering any effective action eyes wide in fright red hair floating she could see shafts of the dim light wavering and glittering piercing the murky depths around her it was all happening so shockingly fast in spite of how she was trying to seize life it was slipping through her fingers it didnt seem real jennsen shapes moved closer around her her lungs aching for air althea said that no one could come through the swamp by the back way there were beasts back here that would tear people apart jennsen had been lucky once in the grip of terror she saw a dark shape moving closer she was not to be lucky twice she didnt want to die she knew she had thought that she did but she knew now that she didnt it was her only life her precious life she didnt want to lose it she tried to swim toward the surface toward the light but everything seemed so slow so thick so heavy jennsen the voice sounded urgent jennsen something bumped her she saw flashes of iridescent green it was the snake could she she would have screamed struggling but unable to get away she could only watch as the dark length of the thing underneath rolled up around her jermsen was too exhausted to fight her lungs burned for air as she saw herself sinking down through the shafts of light getting farther and farther from the surface from life she tried to swim to that light and air but her leaden arms merely waved like weed drifting in the water it was surprising to her since she could swim jennsen now she was going to drown dark coils surrounded her with all her clothes on her heavy cloak her knife her boots and as weary as she had been not to mention her surprise and her half breath before going under her ability to swim had been overwhelmed it hurt she had thought drowning would be the sweet embrace of gentle waters it was not it hurt worse than anything had ever hurt the feeling of helpless suffocation was horrifying the pain crushing her chest was sharp and unbearable she desperately wanted it to stop she struggled in the water against the pain the panic consumed with the urgent need of air her throat was locked tight terrified she might gasp in water so badly did she need a breath it hurt jennsen felt the coils of the snake under her touching her caressing her she wondered if she should have tried to kill it when shed had the chance she supposed she could pull her knife now but she was so weak it hurt the coils pushed against her in the silent darkness she had stopped struggling there was no reason jennsen she wondered why the voice didnt ask her to surrender the way it always did she thought it ironic since she was at last resigned that the voice didnt ask but only called her name jennsen felt something bump her shoulder something hard another bumped her head then her thigh she was being pushed against the bank where the roots went down into the water almost without realizing what she was doing she seized the roots and pulled with sudden desperation the thing under her continued its gentle push up jennsen broke the surface water sluiced off her head in a sudden rush of sound mouth open wide she gasped wildly at the air she pulled herself up enough to throw her shoulders up onto the knotted roots she couldnt drag herself the rest of the way out of the water but at least her head was up and she could breathe her le s dangled drifting floating in the water panting with her eyes closed jennsen clung to the roots with trembling fingers to keep herself from slipping back into the water the desperate pulls of air felt wonderful as they filled her lungs with each breath she could feel her strength returning finally inch by inch hand over hand pulling against the roots she managed to drag herself up onto the bank she flopped on her side panting coughing shivering watching the water lapping only inches away she felt giddy with the simple joy of breathing air she saw then the snakes head break the surface easily gracefully silently yellow eyes in the black band watched her they stared at each other for a time thank you jennsen whispered the snake having seen her there on the bank seen her breathing seen her living slipped back into the water jennsen had no idea what it had thought or why it hadnt tried to kill her again when it had an easy chance at it maybe after the first time it thought she might be too big to eat or might suddenly fight back but why help her could it be a sign of respect maybe it simply viewed her as competition for food and wanted her out of its territory but didnt want to fight her again jennsen had no idea why it had pushed her to the surface but the snake had saved her life she hated snakes and this one had saved her from drowning one of the things that she had feared most had been her salvation still trying to catch her breath to say nothing of recovering her wits after coming so close to passing through the veil into death she began moving again on her hands and knees crawling up higher water ran from her clothes and hair she couldnt get to her feet yet didnt trust her legs yet so she crawled it felt good just to be able to move before long she had recovered enough to stagger her feet she had to keep going her time was running out walking revived her further she had always liked to walk it made her feel alive again like her old self she knew she wanted to live she wanted sebastian to live too huff ying through the tangle of vines and thorny shrubs over the twisted roots and among the trees her worry eased when she came at last to the place where the rock began to rise up from the mossy ground she started up the spine of rock relieved to have found the landmark among the trackless swamp and to be climbing out of the wet boggy bottom it was getting darker by the moment and she remembered that it was a long way up jennsen desperately didnt want to spend the night in the swamp but she didnt want to be scaling the spine of rock in the dark either those fears spurred her on while there was still light enough she had to keep moving when she stumbled she recalled how in places the ground dropped off precipitously to the sides she admonished herself to be more careful no helpful snake would catch her if she plummeted off a cliff in the dark while she made her way up she kept going over in her mind everything that althea had told her hoping that something in it might be helpful jermsen didnt know how she could get sebastian out but she knew she had to tryshe was his only hope he had saved her life before she had to help save his now she wanted desperately to see his smile his blue eyes his spikes of white hair she couldnt bear the thought of them torturing him she had to get him out of their clutches but how was she to accomplish such an impossible task first she had to get back there she decided hopefully by then she would think of a way tom would get her back to the palace tom would be waiting worrying tom why had tom helped her the nugget of that question stuck out in her mind like a landmark to an answer like the spine of rock lead up and out of the swamp she just didnt know where it led tom had helped her why she focused her mind on that question as she trudged up the steep rise he said he couldnt live with himself if he watched her go out onto the azrith plains alone with no supplies he said she would die and he couldnt let that happen that seemed a decent enough sentiment she knew there was more though he seemed determined to help her almost as if he was duty bound he never really questioned what it was she had to do only her method of going about it then did what he could to assist her tom said that she should tell lord rahl about his help that he was a good man that memory kept nagging at her even though it had been an offhand comment hed been serious but what had he meant she kept turning it over in her mind as she ascended the rise of rock up among the trees among the limbs and leaves animals distant strange creatures called out through the humid air others more distant answered with the same echoing whoops and whistles the smell of the swamp rose to her on hot waves of air jennsen recalled that tom had seen her knife when shed been looking for her purse that had been stolen she had pulled back her cloak only to find that the leather thong from her purse of coins had been cut he had seen the knife then jennsen paused in her climb and straightened could it be that tom thought she was some kind of some kind of representative or agent of the lord rahl could it be that tom thought she was on an important mission on behalf of lord rahl could it be that tom thought she knew lord rahl was it the knife that made him think she was someone special perhaps it had been her pressing determination to go on a seemingly impossible journey he certainly knew how important she thought it was perhaps it was that she had told him it was a matter of life and death jennsen moved on ducking under heavy limbs drooping down close over the rock on the other side she stood and looked around realizing that darkness was quickly descending with a renewed sense of urgency she scrambled up the steep slope she recalled how tom had looked at her red hair people were often worried about her because of her red hair many thought she had the gift because of it she had often encountered people who feared her because of her red hair she had used that fear deliberately to help herself stay safe that first night with sebastian she had made him think she had some kind of magical ability to protect her if he harbored hostile intent she had used peoples fear to ward the men at the inn all of those things churned together in jennsens mind as she climbed ever upward gasping for breath at the strenuous effort darkness was enveloping her she didnt know if she could still make it through in such conditions but she knew she had to try for sebastian she had to keep going just then something dark swept up right at her face jennsen let out a clipped cry and nearly fell as the dark thing fluttered away bats she put a hand over her racing heart it was beating as fast as their wings the little creatures had come out to snatch the bugs that were so thick in the air she realized then that in her surprise she might easily have stepped back and fallen it was frightening to think how a lapse of attention in the dark a fright a loose rock or a slip could put her over an edge from which there could be no return she knew though that remaining in the swamp at night might be just as fatal weary from the days struggles the sudden scares she climbed stumbling in the dark feeling the rock groping her way trying to stay on the ridge and not wander off what she knew to be steep drops to either side she worried too what creatures might still come out in the darkness to seize her just as she thought she was nearly free of the swamp althea had said that no one could come into the swamp by the back way a new worr y gripped her maybe after dark tom would be in danger under cover of night one of the creatures might venture out of the swamp to snatch him what if she reached the meadow only to discover tom and his horses mauled by the monsters created out of altheas magic what would she do then she had worries enough she told herself not to come up with new ones jennsen stumbled suddenly out into the open there was a fire burning she stared trying to reconcile it jennsen tom jumped up and rushed over he put his big arm around her shoulders to steady her dear spirits are you all right she nodded too exhausted to speak he didnt see the nodhe was already running for the wagon jermsen sank down to sit heavily on the grassy ground catching her breath surprised to be there at last and relieved beyond words to be free of the swamp tom ran back with a blanket youre soaking wet he said as he threw the blanket around her what happened i went for a swim he paused at mopping her face with the comer of the blanket to frown at her i dont want to tell you your business but i dont think that was a good idea the snake would agree with you his frown tightened as his face drew closer to hers snake what happened in there what do you mean the snake would agree with me still struggling to get her breath jennsen waved a hand dismissing it she had been so afraid of being caught down there in the dark that she had virtually been running up the steep hillside for the last hour on top of the exertion of the rest of it she was spent the fear of it all was catching up with her her shoulders began to tremble she realized then that she was clutching toms muscular arm for dear life he seemed not to notice or if he did he didnt comment on it she drew back despite how good it felt to feel his strength his solid reliable form his sincere concern tom protectively bunched more of the blanket around her did you make it through to altheas she nodded and when he handed her a waterskin drank greedily i swear ive never heard of anyone ever making it back out of that swarnpexcept going in the other side when they were invited did you see any of the beasts i had a snake bigger round than your leg wrapped around me i got a pretty good look at itmore of a look than i wanted actually he let out a low whistle did the sorceress help you then did you get what you needed from her is everything all right then he halted abruptly and seemed to rein in his curiosity sorry youre all cold and wet i shouldnt be asking you so many questions althea and i had a long talk i cant say that i got what i needed but just knowing the truth is better than chasing illusions concern showed in his eyes and the way he made sure the warm blanket was covering her if you didnt get the help you needed then what will you do now jennsen drew her knife along with a breath to steel herself holding the knife by the blade she held it up before toms face so that the handle was lit by the firelight the worked metal that made up the ornate letter r glimmered as if it were covered in jewels she held it out before her like a talisman like an official proclamation cast in silver like a demand from on high that could not be denied i need to get back to the palace without pause tom scooped her up in his massive arms as if she were no more weight than a lamb and carried her to the wagon he lifted her over the side and gently set her in the back among the nest of blankets dont worryill get you back there you did the hard part now you just rest in those warm blankets and let me get you back there jennsen was relieved to have her suspicions confirmed in a way though it made her feel slimy like falling into the swamp again she was lying to him using him that wasnt right but she didnt know what else to do before he turned away she seized his arm tom arent you afraid to be helping me when im involved in something so dangerous he finished for her what im doing is nothing much compared to the risk you took in there he gestured to her matted red hair im nothing special like you but im glad you allowed me to do the small part i could do im not nearly as special as you think i am she suddenly felt very small im just doing as i must tom pulled blankets from the back up toward her i see a lot of people i dont need the gift to tell youre special you know that this is secret business and i cant tell you what it is im doing im sorry but i cant of course you cant only special people carry such a special weapon id not expect you to say a word and id not ask thank you tom feeling even more detestable to be using him as she was and when he was such a sincere man jennsen squeezed his arm in gratitude i can tell you its important and youre a huge help in it all he smiled you wrap yourself in those blankets and get yourself dry well soon be back out on the azrith plains in case you forgot its winter out there wet as you are youll freeze thank you tom youre a good man jennsen slumped back into the blankets too exhausted from the ordeal to sit up any longer im counting on you to tell lord rahl he said with his easy laugh tom quickly doused the fire and then climbed up into the wagon seat without guile he was helping her at what he had to believe was at least some risk she feared to think what they might do to him were he to be caught helping darken rahls daughter here he thought he was helping the lord rahl and he was doing the opposite without even knowing the chance he was taking before it was over she would put him at greater risk yet despite her fear that they were racing back to the palace of the man who wanted to kill her the stomachchurning anxiety of what lay ahead the disappointment of failing to get the help she had hoped for the heartbreak of learning all she had from althea the cold that was making her wet clothes feel like ice and the bouncing wagon jennsen was soon fast asleep chapter swaying atop the seat of the wagon jermsen watched the immense plateau gradually drawing closer the morning sun lit the soaring stone walls of the peoples palace warming them in a pastel glow although the wind had died down the morning air remained bonechilling cold after the reeking rot of the swamp she welcomed the flat dry stony scent of the open plain with her fingertips jermsen rubbed her forehead trying to soothe her dull throbbing headache tom had driven all night and she had slept in the back of the bouncing wagon but not well nor nearly long enough at least she had slept some and they had made it back too bad lord rahl isnt there shocked out of her private thoughts jennsen opened her eyes what lord rahl tom gestured off to the right to the south its too bad he isnt here to help you he had pointed south the direction of the old world on occasion jermsens mother had spoken of the bond connecting the dharan people with the lord rahl through its ancient and arcane magic dharans were somehow able to sense where the lord rahl was while the strength of the bond varied among dharan people they all shared it to some degree what the lord rahl accrued from the bond jennsen didnt know she thought of it as yet more chains of domination around his people in her mothers case though it helped them avoid darken rahls clutches from her mothers descriptions jennsen was aware of the bond but for some reason never felt anything of it perhaps it was so weak in her as it was with some dharan people that she simply couldnt feel it her mother said it had nothing to do with ones level of devotion to the lord rahl that it was purely a link of magic and as such it would be governed by criteria other than her feelings about the man jennsen remembered times when her mother would stand in the doorway of their home or at a window or pause out in the forest and stare off toward the horizon jennsen knew at those times that her mother was sensing darken rahl through the bond where he was and how close it was a shame that it told her only where the lord rahl himself was and not the brutes he sent after them tom being dharan took that bond to the lord rahl for granted and had just given jennsen a valuable bit of information lord rahl was not at his palace that news buoyed her hopes it was one less obstacle one less thing to worry about lord rahl was off to the south probably in the old world making war on the people there as sebastian had told her yes she finally said too bad the marketplace below the plateau was already busy wisps of dust drifted above the crowds gathered there and over the road south she wondered if irma the sausage lady was there jennsen missed betty she wanted so much to see the goats little tail wagging furiously to hear her bleating with elation at being reunited with her lifelong friend tom pointed his team toward the market to where he had been set up selling his load of wine maybe irma would go to the same place jennsen would have to leave betty again in order to go up through the entrance and into the plateau it would be a long climb up all those stairs and then she had to find where sebastian was being held as the wagon rumbled across the hardpan of the azrith plains jennsen stared at the empty road that wound its way up the side of the plateau take the road she said what take the road up to the palace are you sure jennsen i dont think thats wise its only for official business take the road in answer he urged the horses to the left away from their course toward the market and toward the base of the road instead from the comer of her eye she saw him snatch glances at his inscrutable passenger soldiers stationed at the base of the plateau where the road began its ascent watched them approach as the wagon rolled closer jennsen drew out her knife dont stop she said to tom he stared over at her what i have to they have bows you know jennsen continued to stare ahead just keep going when they reached the soldiers jennsen held the knife out holding it by the blade so that the handle stuck up above her fist she kept her arm out straight and stiff pointed down at the cluster of men so that they might see what she was announcing she didnt look at them but watched the road ahead showing them the knife as if she couldnt be bothered to talk to them every pair of eyes watched that knife handle with the omate letter r upon it as it flashed past their eyes none moved to stop the wagon or to nock an arrow tom let out a low whistle the wagon shook and rattled as it rolled onward the road switched back and forth as it made its way steadily up the plateau in some places there was ample room but occasionally the road narrowed forcing the wagon to ride close to the dizzying drop each tight bend offered them a new vista a new view of the expanse of the azrith plains spread out far below off in the distance the plains were rimmed by dusky blue mountains when they arrived at the bridge they finally did have to stop the bridge was pulled up her faith in herself and her plan faltered as she realized that this and not her bold bluff was probably the reason the soldiers below had let her pass so easily they knew she couldnt get over the chasm unless the guards lowered the bridge they knew she couldnt simply barge into the palace and at the same time they didnt have to challenge a woman who had what very well might be an official pass of sorts from the lord rahl himself worse yet she now saw how the soldiers had also isolated in a place without escape or hope of rescue by reinforcements people they deemed potential intruders any hostile foray would be stopped cold here and in all likelihood captured or killed on the spot it was no wonder tom had advised against using the road up stimulated by the effort of the climb the big horses tossed their heads at the interruption one man stepped in front and took control of the horses bits to keep them still soldiers approached the side of the wagon jermsen sat on the cliff side and although she saw men guarding the rear quarter on her side most of the men approached on toms side good day sergeant tom called out the man scrutinized the inside of the wagon and after finding it empty looked up at the two in the seat good day jennsen knew that this was no time for her to become timid if she failed here everything would be lost not only would sebastian have no hope but she would likely join him in a dungeon she could not afford to lose her nerve when the soldiers were close enough she reached past tom to hold the knife down toward the sergeant of the guards showing him the handle as if she were flashing a royal pass drop the bridge she said before he had a chance to ask them anything the sergeant took in the knife handle before meeting her glare whats your business sebastian had told her how to bluff he had explained how she had done it her whole life that she was a natural at it now she had to do it with deliberate intent if she was to save him and get out alive herself despite how fast her heart pounded she showed the man a stem but empty expression lord rahls business lower the bridge she thought that he was taken back a bit by her tone or possibly he was worried by her unexpected words she could see his level of caution rise tensing his features nevertheless he stood his ground i need a little more than that maam jennsen twirled the knife weaving it over and under and between her fingers the polished metal flashing in the sunlight as it spun until it came to an abrupt halt with the handle upright in her fist once more the ornate letter r showing to the soldier in a deliberate manner she pushed the hood of her cloak back exposing her fall of red hair to the morning sunlight and the mens stares she could see in their eyes that her implication had been clearly understood i know you have a job to do jennsen said with terrible calm but so do im on official business for lord rahl im sure you can appreciate how displeased lord rahl would be with me were i to discuss his business with everyone who asked about it therefore i have no intention of doing so but i can tell you that i wouldnt be here were it not a matter of life or death you are wasting my precious time sergeant now lower the bridge and what might be your name maam jennsen leaned farther past tom in order to more directly scowl at the sergeant unless you lower that bridge sergeant and right now you will forever after remember me as trouble sent by lord rahl himself the sergeant backed by a few dozen men with pikes along with crossbows swords and axes didnt flinch he looked at tom whats your part in this tom shrugged just driving the wagon were i you sergeant this is one lady id not want to be delaying is that so it is tom said with conviction the sergeant gazed long and hard into toms eyes finally he considered jennsen again then turned and rolled his hand motioning a man to lower the bridge jermsen gestured with her knife toward the palace up the road how may i find the place where we hold prisoners as the gears started clattering and the bridge began to descend he turned back to jennsen inquire with the guards at the top they can direct you maam thank you jennsen said with finality sitting back up straight and putting her eyes ahead waiting for the bridge to lower once it had thudded into place the sergeant signaled them ahead tom nodded his thanks and flicked the reins jennsen had to play the part through the whole way if this were to have a chance of working she found that her performance was aided by her very real anger she was disturbed though that tom had played some part in the success of the bluff she wouldnt have his help for all of it she decided that it would be wise to keep her anger out and in plain view of the other guards you want to see the prisoners tom asked she realized that she never had said why she had to return to the palace yes theyve taken a man prisoner by mistake ive come to see that hes released tom checked the horses with the reins keeping them wide to negotiate the wagon around a switchback ask for captain lerner he said at last jennsen glanced over at him surprised that he had offered a name rather than an objection a friend of yours the reins moved ever so slightly with practiced precision guiding the horses around the bend i dont know if id call him a friend ive dealt with him a time or two wine tom smiled no other things he apparently didnt intend to say what other things jennsen watched the sweep of the azrith plains and distant mountains as they rode up the side of the plateau somewhere beyond those plains those mountains lay freedom at the top the road leveled out before a great gate through the massive outer wall of the palace the guards stationed before the gate there waved them through then blew whistles in a short series of notes to others unseen beyond the walls jennsen realized that they had not arrived unannounced she nearly gasped as they cleared the short tunnel through the massive outer wall inside expansive grounds spread out before them lawns and hedges bordered the road that curved toward a hill of steps well over a half mile away the grounds inside the walls were teeming with soldiers in smart uniforms of leather and chain mail covered with wool tunics many with pikes held upright at precisely the same angle lined the route these men were not loafing about they werent the kind to be surprised by what came up the road tom took it all in casually jennsen tried to keep her eyes pointed ahead she tried to look indifferent amid such splendor before the hill of steps awaited a reception party of guards over a hundred strong tom pulled the wagon into the pocket theyd formed blocking the road jennsen saw standing on the steps overlooking the soldiers three men in robes two wore silvercolored robes between them one step higher stood an older man wearing white both hands held in the opposite sleeves trimmed in goldencolored braiding that shimmered in the sunlight tom set the brake on the wagon as a soldier took control of the horses to keep them from moving before tom could begin climbing down jennsen put a hand on his arm to stop him this is as far as you go but you youve done enough you helped with the part i needed i can handle it from here on out on my own his measured blueeyed gaze swept over the guards standing around the wagon he seemed reluctant to accede i dont think it could hurt if i went along id rather you go back to your brothers he glanced to her hand on his arm before looking up into her eyes if thats your wish his voice lowered to little more than a whisper will i see you again it sounded more like a request than a question jennsen could not bring herself to deny such a simple thing not after all he had done for her well need to go down to the market to buy some horses ill stop by your place first right after im done inside with getting my friend released promise under her breath she said i have to pay you for your servicesremember his lopsided grin reappeared ive never met anyone like you jennsen i he noticed the soldiers remembering then where he was and cleared his throat im thankful you let me do my small part maam i will hold you to your word on the rest of it he had risked enough by bringing her this fara risk he hadnt known he was taking jennsen fervently hoped that in her brief smile he would see how genuinely grateful she was for his help since she didnt think she could afford to keep her promise to see him before they left with his powerful hand gripping her arm to halt her for a final word he spoke in a low but solemn voice steel against steel that he may be the magic against magic jennsen had absolutely no idea what he meant staring into his intense gaze she answered with a single firm nod not wanting to let the soldiers suspect that she might really be mildmannered jennsen turned away and climbed down from the wagon to stand before the man who looked to be in charge she allowed him only a perfunctory look at the knife before replacing it in the sheath at her belt i need to see the man in charge of any prisoners youre holding captain lerner if memory serves me his brow drew together you want to see the captain of the prison guards jennsen didnt know his rank she didnt know much of anything about military matters except that for most of her life soldiers like these had been trying to kill her he could be a general or for all she knew a corporal as she considered the man his dress his age his bearing she reasoned that he definitely looked more than a corporal she feared to make a mistake with his rank though and decided it would be healthier to ignore it jennsen dismissed his question with a curt flick of her hand i havent got all day ill need an escort of course you and some of your men will do i suppose as she started up the steps she glanced over her shoulder and saw tom wink at her it lifted her heart the soldiers had parted to let his wagon leave so he flicked the reins and urged his big horses away jennsen hated to see his comforting presence go she turned her mind from her fears you she said gesturing to the man in the white robes take me to where you hold prisoners the man the top of his head showing through his thinning gray hair lifted a finger sending most of the milling guards back to their posts the officer of mysterious rank and a dozen of his soldiers remained behind her may i see the knife the man in the white robes asked in a gentle voice jennsen suspected that this man able to dismiss guards of rank must be someone important important people in lord rahls palace might have the gift it occurred to her that if he did have the gift he would see her as a hole in the world it also occurred to her that this was a very poor time to blurt out a confession and an even worse time to try to bolt for the gate she had to hope that he was a palace official and that he wasnt gifted many of the soldiers were still watching jennsen casually pulled her knife from the sheath at her belt without a word but showing a face that clearly said she was running out of patience she held the knife up before the mans eyes so he could see the ornate r on the handle he looked down his nose at the weapon before returning his attention to her and this is real no jennsen snapped i smelted it while sitting around the campfire last night are you going to take me to where you hold prisoners or not showing no reaction the man graciously held out a hand if you would follow me this way madam chapter the palace officials white robes flowed out behind him as he ascended the hill of steps flanked by the two men in silver robes jennsen remained what she judged to be an imperious distance behind the men when the man in white noticed how she had lagged behind he slowed to allow her to catch up she slowed her pace accordingly maintaining the distance he nervously checked behind then slowed more she slowed yet more until the three robed men jennsen and the soldiers behind her were all pausing ponderously on each step when they reached the next landing on the broad sunlit marble steps the man glanced over his shoulder again jennsen gestured impatiently he finally understood that she had no intention of walking with him but expected him to lead the procession the man acceded quickening his steps allowing her to have the distance she demanded resigned to being what amounted to her lowly crier the officer of unknown rank and his dozen soldiers climbed the stairs with mincing steps trying to duplicate the distance she maintained in front of her it was unanticipated and awkward for her escorts she wanted it to be like her red hair the distraction gave them something to think about something to worry about at intervals the smooth ascent of marble stairs was broken by broad landings that gave the legs a rest before continuing up at the top of the stairs tall embossed brass doors were set back beyond colossal columns the entire front of the palace looming over them was one of the grandest sights jennsen had ever seen but her mind was not on the intricate architecture of the entrance she was thinking about what lay inside they passed the shadows of the towering columns and swept on through the doorway the dozen soldiers still trailed in her wake their weapons belts and mail jangling the sound of their boots on the polished marble floor echoed off the walls of a grand entry lined with fluted pillars deeper into the palace people going about their business or standing in twos and threes talking or strolling the balconies paused to watch the unusual procession paused to see the officials in their white and silver robes and a dozen guards at a respectful distance escorting a woman with red hair by her outfit especially in comparison to the neat clean dress of the others it was obvious that she had just traveled in rather than being embarrassed by her clothes jennsen was pleased that they added to the sense of urgent mystery the reaction of the people too was bound to infect her escort after the man in white whispered to the two in silver robes they nodded and ran on ahead vanishing around a comer the guards followed at her measured distance the procession wound through a maze of small passageways and funneled down narrow service stairs jennsen and her escorts made a number of turns through intersecting halls along dim corridors to doors opening onto wide halls and intermittently descended a variety of stairs until she could no longer keep track of their route by the dusty condition of some of the dingy stairs and mustysmelling apparently littleused halls she realized that the man in white robes was taking her on a shortcut through the palace in order to get her to where she wanted to go as swiftly as possible this too was reassuring because it meant they took her seriously that helped her confidence in playing the part she told herself that she was important she was a personal representative of lord rahl himself and she was not going to be deterred by anyone they were here for no other purpose but to assist her it was their job their duty since it was hopeless trying to keep track of all the turns and twists they took she put her mind instead to the matter at hand to what she would do and say going over it all in her head jennsen reminded herself that no matter what condition sebastian was in she had to keep to her plan acting surprised bursting into tears fall ing on him wailing would do neither of them any good she hoped that when she saw him she could remember all that the man in white checked his charge before turning down a stone stairwell dull red rust showed through chipped paint on the iron railing the uncomfortably steep flight of stairs twisted downward finally ending in a lower passageway lit by the eerie wavering light from torches in short floor stands rather than by lamps and reflectors that were used to light the way above the two men in silver robes who had gone on ahead were waiting for them at the bottom hazy smoke hung near the low beams of the ceiling leaving the place reeking of burning pitch she could see her breath in the cold air jennsen felt viscerally how deep they were in the peoples palace she had a brief unpleasant memory of what it felt like sinking down beneath the dark bottomless water of the swamp she felt a similar pressure on her chest in the depths of the palace as she imagined the inconceivable weight overhead down the murky stone corridor to the right she thought she could see evenly spaced doors in some of the doors it looked like there might be fingers gripping the edge of small openings from down that hall in the darkness came a dry echoing cough as she looked off toward the unseen source of the sound she had the feeling that this was a place where men were sent not for punishment but to die before an ironbound door sealing off the corridor to the left stood a powerfully built man feet spread hands clasped behind his back chin held high his bearing his size the way his cutstone gaze locked on her made jermsens breath falter she wanted to run why did she think she could do this after all who was she just a nobody althea said that wasnt true unless she made it so herself jennsen wished she had as much faith in her own abilities as althea seemed to have in her looking jennsen in the eye the man in white robes held a hand out in introduction captain lerner as you requested he turned to the captain and held his other hand out toward jennsen a personal envoy of lord rahl so she says the captain gave the man in white a grim smile thank you she said to the men who had escorted her that will be all the man in white opened his mouth to speak then as he met the look in her eyes thought better of it and bowed with his arms held out like a hen herding chicks he ushered the other two in silver and then the soldiers away with him im looking for a man i heard was taken prisoner she told the big man standing before the door for what reason someone messed up he was taken prisoner by mistake who says it was a mistake jennsen lifted the knife from its sheath at her belt and held it by the blade nonchalantly showing the man the handle i do his iron eyes briefly took in the design on the handle still he stood in the same relaxed stance barring the iron door to the passageway beyond jennsen twirled the knife through her fingers caught it by the handle and returned it smoothly to its sheath at her belt i used to carry one too he said with a nod toward the knife she had returned to its sheath few years back but not any longer she applied gentle pressure to the crossguard until she felt the knife click home the soft sound echoed back from the darkness behind her he shrugged it gets wearing having your life at risk for lord rahl all the time jermsen feared he might ask her something about the lord rahl something she couldnt answer but should be able to she sought to block that possibility you served under darken rahl then that was before my time it must have been a great honor to have known him obviously you didnt know the man she feared she had just failed her first test she had thought that everyone who served would be a loyal follower she thought it would be safe to go with that assumption it wasnt captain lerner turned his head and spat he looked back at her with challenge darken rahl was a twisted bastard id have liked to put his knife between his ribs and twisted it good despite her anxiety she showed him no more than a cool expression then why didnt you when the whole world is crazy it doesnt pay to be sane i finally told them i was getting too old and took a job down here someone far better than i ever was finally sent darken rahl to the keeper jermsen was thrown off by such an unexpected sentiment she didnt know if the man had really hated darken rahl or if he was only saying he did in front of her so as to show loyalty to the new lord rahl richard who had killed his father and assumed power she tried to gather her wits without being obvious well tom said you werent stupid i guess he knew what he was talking about the captain laughed a spontaneous deep rolling sound that unexpectedly made jennsen smile at the incongruity of it coming from a man who otherwise looked like deaths darling tom would know he clapped a fist to his heart in salute his face softened to an easy smile tom had helped her again jennsen clapped a fist to her heart returning the salute it seemed the right thing to do im jennsen pleased jennsen he let out a sigh maybe if id have known the new lord rahl like you do i might still be serving with you but id already given it up by then and come down here the new lord rahl has changed everything all the ruleshes turned the whole world upside down i guess jennsen feared she was treading on dangerous ground she didnt know what the man meant and feared to say anything in response she simply nodded and forged ahead with her reason for being there i can see why tom said that youd be the one to see whats this about jennsen she took a deep casual breath preparing herself she had thought it out a hundred different ways forward and backward she was ready to come at it from any angle you know that those of us who serve lord rahl in this capacity cant always allow everyone to know what were doing or who we are captain lerner was nodding of course jennsen folded her arms trying to look relaxed despite how her heart pounded she had made it past the riskiest assumption she had guessed correctly well i had a man working with me jennsen went on i heard he was taken prisoner it wouldnt surprise me the fellow sticks out in a crowdbut for what we were doing that was what we needed unfortunately the guards must have noticed him too because of the mission and the people we were dealing with he was well armed so that would have put the men who stopped him on edge he hasnt been here before so he wouldnt know who to trust and besides its traitors were hunting the captain was frowning in thought as he rubbed his jaw traitors in the palace we dont know for certain we suspect infiltrators are aboutthats who were huntingso he wouldnt dare to trust anyone here if the wrong ears heard who he really was it would imperil the rest of us i doubt he would even give you his real name though he might havesebastian with the danger were in he would know that the less he says then the less risk there is to the others on our team he stared off seeming to be caught up in her story no no prisoner has admitted to that name his brow bunched in earnest reflection whats he look like a few years older than me blue eyes short white hair the captain instantly recognized the description that one my information was correct then you have him she wanted to grab the man by his leather and shake him she wanted to ask if theyd hurt sebastian she wanted to scream at him to let sebastian out yes we have him if its the same man youre talking about that is matches your description anyway good i need him back i have urgent business for him i cant afford to delay we need to leave at once before the trail gets any colder it would be best if we not make a big show of him being released we need to slip out with as little notice as possible as little contact with soldiers as possible the ring of infiltrators might have managed to place themselves in the army captain lerner folded his arms and sighed as he leaned down toward her a little looking at her as a big brother might look at a little sister jennsen are you sure hes one of your men jennsen feared to overplay the bluff he was chosen for this assignment specifically because soldiers would not suspect he was one of us looking at him youd never guess sebastian has a proven knack for being able to get close to the infiltrators without them getting wind that hes one of our men but are you sure of this mans heart are you really sure hed not bring lord rahl into harms view sebastian is one of minethat much i knowbut im not sure the man you have is my sebastian i guess id have to see him to be sure why the captain stared off as he shook his head i dont know i spent a lot of years carrying the knife like youre starting out doing and going places where you cant carry the knife so you wont be known for who you really are i dont have to tell you how being in such danger all the time sometimes gives you a sense about people something about that fellow with the white hair makes mine stand on end jennsen didnt know what to say the captain was twice the size of sebastian so it wasnt sebastians physical presence that would worry the man of course size was no valid indicator of potential threat jennsen very well might be able to beat the captain in a knife fight maybe captain lerner sensed how deadly sebastian was with weapons the captains eyes had been heedful of the way her fingers handled the knife perhaps the captain was able to tell by various small things that sebastian was not dharan that could be troublesome but jennsen had thought out a plan to explain that too just in case tom still up to his trouble the man asked oh you know tom hes selling wine along with the help of joe and clayton the captain stared incredulously tomand his brothers selling wine he shook his head as a grin spread wide id like to know what hes really up to jennsen shrugged well thats just what hes selling at the moment of course the three of them travel around buying goods bringing them back to sell he laughed at that and slapped her shoulder that sounds like hed want it told small wonder he trusts you jennsen was completely confused and desperately didnt want to be dragged any further into a dangerous discussion about tom or she could soon be found out she didnt really know much about tom this man apparently did i guess id better see this fellow you have if it is sebastian i need to kick his tail and get him on his way right captain lerner said with a firm nod if he is your man at least ill finally know his name he turned to the ironbound door as he rooted around in his pocket for a key if it is him hes lucky you came for him before one of them women in red showed up to ask him questions hed be spouting more than his name then hed have saved himself and you a lot of trouble if hed have told us what he was about in the first place jennsen felt giddy relief to hear that a mordsith hadnt tortured sebastian when youre doing lord rahls business you keep your mouth shut she said sebastian knows the price of our work the captain grunted his agreement as he turned the key the latch unlocked with a cavernous clang for this lord rahl id keep my mouth shut even if it was a mordsith asking the questions but youd have to know the new lord rahl better than so i guess i dont need to tell you jennsen didnt understand but didnt ask anything either as the captain tugged on the door it slowly swung open revealing a long hallway lit by a few candles along the length of the corridor to each side were doors with small barred openings as they passed some of those openings as many as half a dozen arms stretched out imploring reaching grabbing from the darkness through others came the clamor of voices calling out vile curses and oaths from the reaching hands and the collection of voices she knew that each room beyond held groups of men jennsen followed behind the captain deeper into the fortress prison when eyes peered out and saw it was a woman the men called out obscenely to her she was shocked by the lewd and vulgar things yelled at her the jeering laughter she hid her feelings her fears and wore a calm mask captain lerner kept to the center of the passageway occasionally batting aside a reaching hand watch yourself he cautioned jennsen was about to ask why when someone threw something sloppy at her it missed splattering on the opposite wall she was appalled to see that it was feces several more men joined in jennsen had to duck and dodge to miss it the captain suddenly kicked a door of a man about to throw more the bang of the kick echoed up and down the corridor serving as warning enough to cause men to retreat back into the depths of their cells only when the glaring captain was sure his threat was understood did he start out once again jennsen couldnt help but to ask in a whisper what are all of these men accused of the captain glanced back over his shoulder various things murder rapethings like that a few are spiesthe kind of men youre hunting the stench of the place gagged her the raw hatred of the prisoners was understandable she supposed but no matter how much she sympathized with captives of lord rahls soldiers men fighting against his brutal rule their behavior only served to support any accusations of perversity jennsen stayed close to captain lerners heels as he turned down a side passageway from a shelf built into the stone he collected a lamp then lit it from a nearby candle the light from the lamp only served to throw a little more light into a nightmare and make it all the more frightening she had terrifying visions of being found out and ending up in this place she couldnt keep from imagining being locked in a room with men like these she knew what they would do to her jennsen had to remind herself to slow her breathing another door had to be unlocked taking them beyond to a low passageway with doors spaced much closer she guessed that they were cells holding a single man a grasping hand grimy and covered with open sores shot out of an opening to catch her cloak she shrugged the hand off her and kept moving captain lerner unlocked another door at the end and they entered a space smaller yet hardly wider than his shoulders the twisting cramped opening like a fissure in the rock made jennsens skin crawl no hands reached out of the door openings in this place the captain stopped and held up the lamp to look through the small hole in the door to the right satisfied with what he saw he handed her the lamp and then unlocked the door we put special prisoners in this section he explained he had to use both hands and all his weight to pull on the door it moved with grating protest inside jennsen was surprised to see it was only a tiny empty room with a second door that was why there were no hands reaching in this hall the cells had double doors to make escape even more improbable after unlocking the second door he took back the lamp the captain ducked through the short doorway pushing the light in before him his bulk in the door momentarily throwing her into the darkness once through he extended a hand out to help her so she wouldnt trip over the high sill jennsen held the mans big hand and stepped into the cell it was larger than she expected looking to be carved out of the solid stone of the plateau tooled gouges in the rock walls testified to how difficult the work had been no prisoner was going to die his way out of n such a secure place on a bench carved in the opposite wall sat sebastian his blue eyes were on her from the instant she entered in those eyes she thought she could see how much he wanted out nevertheless he showed no emotion and said nothing from outward appearances no one would even know that he knew her he had neatly folded his cloak and used it as a cushion on the cold stone nearby sat a water cup his clothes were orderly showing no evidence that they abused him it was so good to see his face his eyes his spikes of white hair again he licked his lips his beautiful lips that so often had smiled at her now though he dared not smile jennsen had been right she did want to fall on him to throw her arms around him to wail with her relief at seeing him alive and unhurt the captain gestured with his lamp this him yes captain sebastians eyes were fixed on her as she stepped forward she had to pause to be sure she had her voice under control its all right sebastian captain lerner here knows youre one of my team she patted the handle of her knife you can trust him to keep your identity confidential captain lerner extended a hand glad to meet you sebastian sorry about the mixup we didnt know who you were jennsen explained your mission i used to serve so i understand the need for secrecy sebastian rose to his feet and clasped hands with the man no harm done captain i cant fault our men for doing their job sebastian didnt know her plan he appeared to be waiting for her lead she gestured impatiently and asked a question she knew he wouldnt be able to answer and in that way let him know what it was she intended him to say did you make contact with any of the infiltrators before you were stopped by the guards did you find out who any of them are and gain their confidence did you at least get any names sebastian took her lead and sighed convincingly im sorry no id only just arrived and didnt have a chance before the guards his gaze drifted to the floor sorry captain lerners eyes shifted between the two of them jennsen assumed a tone of forbearance well i cant blame guards for not taking chances in the palace we need to be on our way though i made some headway in our search and uncovered some important new contacts it cant wait these men are wary and i need you to approach them they arent likely to let a woman buy them drinkstheyd get the wrong ideaso im going to leave it to you ive got other snares to set sebastian was nodding as if he were entirely familiar with the imaginary work all right the captain held an arm out lets get you both on your way then sebastian following jennsen out glanced back ill need my weapons captain and all the coins that were in the purse thats lord rahls money and i need it to do his bidding i have it all nothing is missingmy word on that outside in the confining passageway captain lerner pulled the cell door shut he had the light so jennsen and sebastian waited on him as she started out the captain gently reached past sebastian to grasp her arm stopping her jennsen froze fearing to breathe she felt sebastians hand slip around her waist to the handle of her knife is it true what people say the captain asked jennsen looked back into his eyes what do you mean i mean about lord rahl about how hes i dont know different ive heard men talkmen who have met him fought with him they talk about how he handles that sword of his how he fights and all but more than that they talk about him as a man is it true what they say jennsen didnt know what he meant she feared to move to say anything not knowing how to answer such a question she didnt know what people especially dharan soldiers said about the new lord rahl she knew that she and sebastian could kill this man here now they would have the element of surprise sebastian with his hand on her knife was surely thinking that very thing but they would still have to make it out of the palace if they killed him it was likely that the body would soon be discovered the dharan soldiers were anything but lax even if they hid the dead captain of the prison guards a check of the prisoners would soon reveal that sebastian was missing their chances of escaping then became remote worse though she didnt think she could kill this man despite the fact that he was a dharan officer she held no ill feeling for him he seemed a decent sort not a monster tom liked him and the captain respected tom stabbing a man who was trying to kill them was one thing this would be entirely different she couldnt do this we would lay down our lives for the man sebastian said in an ear nest voice id have let you torture and kill me before i would have said a word for fear it would endanger lord rahl i too jennsen added in a soft voice think of little else but lord rahl i even dream about him she had spoken the truth but a truth calculated to deceive the captain smiled staring off with an inner satisfaction as his fingers released her arm jennsen felt sebastians hand slip away from her knife i guess that tells it plain the captain said in the near darkness ive served a long time i had lost hope of daring to dream such a thing he hesitated then spoke again and his wife is she really a confessor like they say ive heard tales about the confessors from back before the boundaries but i never knew if it was really true wife jennsen didnt know anything about lord rahl having a wife jennsen couldnt picture him with a wife or imagine what such a woman would be like jennsen couldnt even conceive of why the lord rahl a man who could possess any woman he wanted and then discard her at will would bother to take a wife and what a confessor could be was a complete mystery to jennsen but the very title confessor certainly sounded ominous sorry jennsen said ive not met her nor i sebastian said but ive heard much the same about her as you have the captain smiled distantly im glad ive lived to see a lord rahl like this finally come to command dhara as it should be commanded jennsen started out again troubled by the mans words troubled that he was pleased this new lord rahl was going to conquer and rule the whole world in the name of dhara jennsen was eager to get out of the prison and out of the palace the three of them moved quickly back through the narrow passageways back through iron doors and past the reaching prisoners the captains growled warning silenced them this time when they rushed through the last ironbound door before the stairs they all came to an abrupt halt a tall attractive woman with a single long blond braid stood waiting for them blocking their escape route the look on her face was lightning waiting to strike she was wearing red leather it could be nothing other than a mordsith chapter the womans hands were clasped casually behind her back her expression was anything but casual boot strikes echoed off the stone walls as she stepped forward a dark thundercloud approaching a thundercloud that didnt know fear a wave of gooseflesh tingled up jennsens body from her knees to the nape of her neck where downy hair stiffened in a steady measured pace the woman strode one full turn around them looking them up and down a hawk circling inspecting mice jennsen saw an agiel the weapon of a mordsith hanging from a fine chain at the womans right wrist lethal as jennsen knew such a weapon could be it looked like nothing more than a thin leather rod not a foot in length a very agitated official came to see me the mordsith said in a quiet silken voice her deadly glare moved very deliberately from sebastian to jennsen he thought i needed to come down here and see what was going on he mentioned a woman with red hair he seemed to think she might be trouble of some sort what do you think he was so worried about the captain who was behind jennsen stepped out to the side theres nothing going on that you need concern yourself with a flick of her wrist the agiel spun up into her fist and was pointing at the captains face i didnt ask you i asked this young woman the glare turned back to jennsen why do you suppose he would say that i needed to come down here hmm jennsen because jennsen said unable to look away from the cold blue eyes hes a pompous dolt and he didnt like it that i wouldnt pretend he wasnt just because he wore white robes the mordsith smiled it was not humor but grim respect for the verac ity of what jennsen had said the smile evaporated as she glanced at sebastian when her gaze re turned to jennsen it looked as if it could cut steel pompous or not that doesnt change the fact that there is a prisoner being released for no more cause than your word jennsen my word is sufficient jennsen irritably lifted the knife at her belt and flashed the handle at the woman this backs my word that the mordsith said in her silken hiss means nothing jennsen could feel her face going red it means do you think were stupid the mordsiths skintight red leather creaked as she leaned closer that if you come in here and merely wave that knife handle in our faces that our faculty of reason will evaporate the tight leather outfit revealed a body as shapely as it was powerful jennsen felt small and ugly before this flawless creature worse she felt totally inadequate faking a story before a woman as confident as this woman was a woman who seemed able to see right through their invented tale but jennsen knew that if she dared to waver now she and sebastian were as good as dead jennsen put as much of an edge to her voice as she could manage i carry this knife for lord rahl in his name and you will yield to it really why because this knife shows the trust lord rahl has placed in me ah so just because you happen to carry it were supposed to believe that lord rahl gave it to you that he trusts you how are we to know you didnt find the knife hmm find it are you out of your or perhaps you and this prisoner here ambushed the knifes true ownermurdered himfor no reason but to get your hands on a coveted object hoping it would give you credibility i dont know how you can possibly believe such a or maybe youre a coward and murdered the knifes owner in his sleep or maybe you didnt even have that much courage and you bought if from cutthroats who murdered him is that what you did simply got it from the real murderer of course not the mordsith leaned closer yet until jennsen could feel the womans breath on her own face maybe you enticed the man it belong to into lying between your sweet legs while your partner here stole it or maybe youre just a whore and it was the gift of a murderous thief in exchange for your womanly favors jennsen backed away ii wouldnt showing us such a weapon proves nothing the fact is we dont know who the knife belongs to surrender its mine jermsen insisted the mordsith straightened and lifted an eyebrow really the captain folded his arms sebastian standing to jermsens side didnt move jennsen fought to contain tears of panic trying to surface she endeavored to show a defiant face instead jennsen surrender i have important business on behalf of lord rahl jennsen said through gritted teeth i dont have time for this ah the mordsith mocked business on behalf of lord rahl well that does sound important she folded her arms what business its my affair not yours the cool smile returned magic business that it magic its not any of your concern im doing lord rahls bidding and you would do well to remember that hed not be pleased to know you were meddling the eyebrow lifted again meddling my dear young lady it is impossible for a mordsith to meddle if you were who you say you are you would know that much at least mordsith exist only to protect lord rahl it would be a dereliction of my duty dont you think were i to ignore such curious goingson noi told you and if lord rahl finds himself bleeding his life away and asks me what happened before he dies i can tell him that a girl with a pretty knife danced in here and demanded to have a very suspicious and tightlipped prisoner released and well we were so dazzled by the knife and by her big blue eyes that we all just thought we ought to let her have her way that about it of course you have to do some magic for me the mordsith reached out and tested some of jennsens red hair between a finger and thumb hmm a bit of magic to prove yourself a spell a charm a dazzling show of your craft call some lightning down if you will if not that maybe then just a simple flame fluttering in midair i dont do some magic witch her voice was a deadly command surrender angry at the voice but more so at the mordsith jennsen slapped the hand away from her hair stop it faster than seemed possible sebastian went for the woman faster yet her agiel spun into her hand she rammed the tip against sebastians shoulder as he was still flying at her sebastian cried out as the weapon stopped him cold the woman calmly pressed the agiel against his shoulder driving him to the ground sebastian screamed as he lay crumpled on the floor jennsen rushed toward the mordsith in one swift movement the woman stood and had the agiel before jermsens face halting her at their feet sebastian writhed in agony thinking only of sebastian only of getting to him only of helping him jermsen grabbed the agiel pushing it and the womans hand away she went to one knee beside sebastian he had rolled to his side holding himself trembling as if hed been struck by lightning he calmed under her gentle touch as she told him to lie still as he recovered somewhat and tried to sit up jennsen put an arm behind his shoulders and helped him he leaned against her panting clearly suffering the lingering effect of the pain of the weapon he blinked trying to clear his watering eyes struggling to focus his vision jennsen horrified by what the touch of the agiel could do stroked a hand down sebastians face she lifted his chin trying to see if he recognized her if he was all right he could hardly sit up on his own but he gave her a little nod stand up the mordsith towered over them both of you sebastian couldnt yet jennsen shot to her feet defiantly facing the woman ill not tolerate this when i tell lord rahl about this hell have you horsewhipped the woman was frowning she held the agiel out touch it again jennsen seized the weapon and shoved it aside stop it it works the mordsith muttered to herself i know it doesi can feel it she turned and experimentally pressed the awful thing to the captains arm he cried out and went to his knees stop it jermsen caught hold of the red rod pulling it back away from the captain the mordsith stared how do you do that do what touch it without being hurt no one is immune to the touch of an agielnot even lord rahl himself jennsen realized then that something unprecedented had happened she didnt understand it but she knew that while the situation was confused she had to seize the opportunity you wanted to see magicyou saw it but how do you think that lord rahl would allow me to carry the knife if i wasnt competent but an agiel the captain was coming to his feet whats the matter with you i fight for the same cause as you and that cause is protecting lord rahl the woman snapped she held her agiel up this is my means of protecting him i have to know whats wrong lest i fail him jennsen reached up and curled her fingers around the weapon holding it tight as she met the mordsiths gaze she told herself that she had to remember who she was supposed to be and to maintain the pretense she tried to think of what she would do if she really were one of lord rahls elite i understand your concern jennsen said with resolve determined not to miss her unexpected chance even if she didnt fully understand it herself i know you want to protect lord rahl we share that devotion and sacred duty our lives are his i have vital business doing the same as youprotecting lord rahl you dont know all thats involved in this and i dont have the time to even begin to explain it to you ive had enough of this lord rahls life is in danger i have no more time to spare if you dont let me do my job of protecting him then you are imperiling him and i will remove you as i would any threat to his life the mordsith considered jennsens words what she could be thinking jennsen had no idea but that very notionthoughtwas one jennsen had never ascribed to the mordsith she had always considered them to be mindless killers in this womans eyes jennsen could see cognition finally the mordsith reached down and with a hand under sebastians arm helped him to his feet when he was standing steadily she turned back to jennsen id gladly suffer the horsewhippingand far worseif it would help protect this lord rahl get goingand be quick about it she gave jennsen a small but warm smile and then a firm clap on the side of the shoulder may the good spirits be with you she hesitated but i need to know how it is that you dont feel the power of an agiel such a thing is simply not possible jennsen was taken aback that a person this evil dared to invoke the name of the good spirits jennsens mother was a good spirit now im sorry but thats part of what i have no time to begin to tell you and besides lord rahls safety hinges on me keeping it secret the woman stared long and hard i am nyda she said at last swear to me personally that you will do as you say and protect him i swear nyda now i have to go i cant spare any more timenot for anything before jennsen could move the mordsith seized a fistful of her dress and cloak at her shoulder this is one lord rahl we cannot afford to lose or we all lose everything if i ever find out youre lying to me i promise you two things first there will never be a hole deep enough for you to hide in that i wont find you and second your death will be beyond anyones worst nightmare do i make myself clear jennsen could only nod dumbly at the look of fierce resolve in nydas eyes the woman turned and started up the steps get going then are you all right the captain asked sebastian sebastian brushed dirt off his knees as he headed for the steps id have rather had the horsewhipping than that but i guess ill live the captain grimaced his sympathy as he comforted his own arm i have your things up there locked away your weapons and your money lord rahls money sebastian corrected jennsen wanted nothing so much as to be out of the palace she hurried up the steps forcing herself not to break into a dead run oh the mordsith called back down the steps she had paused her hand on the rusty rail as they rushed up after her i forgot to tell you forgot to tell us what jennsen asked were in a hurry that official who came to get me the one in white robes yes jennsen asked as she reached the woman after he came for me he was going to go looking for wizard rahl to bring him down to see you too jennsen felt the blood drain from her face lord rahl is far to the south the captain scoffed as he came up the stairs behind them not lord rahl nyda said wizard rahl wizard nathan rahl chapter jennsen remembered that name nathan rahl althea had said she met him in the old world at the palace of the prophets he was a real rahl she said she said he was powerful and inconceivably dangerous so they kept him locked away behind impenetrable shields of magic where he could cause no harm yet he sometimes still managed it althea had said that nathan rahl was over nine hundred years old somehow the old wizard had escaped those impenetrable shields of magic jennsen seized the mordsith by the elbow nyda whats he doing here i dont know ive not met him its important he not see us jennsen nudged nyda ahead urging her to hurry i dont have time to explain but hes dangerous at the top of the stairs nyda looked both ways before meeting jennsens gaze dangerous are you sure about this yes all right come with me then i need my things sebastian said here the captain pointed at a door not far away while nyda stood guard sebastian followed captain lerner inside jennsen her knees trembling stood in the doorway watching as the cap tain set the lamp down and unlocked a second door inside he and sebastian went into the room beyond taking the lamp jennsen could hear brief words and the sounds of things being dragged off shelves with every passing moment jennsen could almost hear the wizards footsteps bringing him ever closer if he caught them sebastians weapons would do them no good if wizard rahl saw them he would recognize jennsen for what she wasa hole in the world the ungifted offspring of darken rahl there would be no bluffing her way out of that they would have her at last sebastian emerged ahead of the captain lets go he simply looked like a man in a dark green cloak the same as before few would suspect the collection of weapons he carried his blue eyes and spikes of white hair made him look different from other people maybe that was why the guards had stopped him the captain caught jennsen by the arm as she saidhe nodded toward the mordsithmay the good spirits be with you always he handed her the lamp jennsen whispered her sincere gratitude before rushing to follow the other two down the passageway leaving the captain of the guards behind nyda led them down dark halls and through empty rooms they raced through a narrow cleft without a ceilingat least when jennsen looked up she could see nothing but darkness above the floor appeared to be bedrock the wall to the right was rather unremarkable fitted stone to the left though the passageway was lined with colossal speckled pink granite blocks each smoothfaced block was larger than any house jennsen had ever lived in yet the joints were so tight that no blade could have slipped between them at the end of the passageway beside the huge stone blocks they ducked through a low door and out onto a narrow walkway made of iron and laid with planks to cross on the thread of a footbridge spanned a wide chasm in the bedrock of the plateau jennsen could see by the light of her lamp that the walls of sheer rock to each side dropped straight down fading away far below the light of the lamp wasnt enough for her to see the bottom standing there on the slender stretch of walkway suspended over the enormous void made her feel as tiny as an ant the mordsith a hand on the iron rail as she moved across the bridge paused and looked back over her shoulder why is wizard rahl dangerous it was obvious that the question had been playing on her mind what trouble can he cause you the brittle tone of her voice reverberated off the surrounding rock walls stopped there in the center of the walkway over the black abyss jennsen could feel the bridge swaying underfoot it was making her dizzy the mordsith waited jennsen tried to think of something to say a glance back at sebastians blank expression told her that he had no ideas she quickly decided to mix in some of the truth in case nyda knew anything about the man hes a prophet he escaped from a place where he was held a place where he couldnt hurt anyone they had him there because hes dangerous the mordsith pulled her long blond braid over her shoulder drawing her hand down its length as she considered jennsens words she clearly didnt intend to move yet ive heard hes quite an interesting man in her eyes was awakened challenge hes dangerous jennsen insisted why he can harm my mission how ive already said ithes a prophet prophecy could be a benefit it might help you in your mission to protect lord rahl the mordsiths frown darkened why wouldnt you want such help jennsen recalled what althea said about prophecy he might tell me how ill die even the very day what if you were the one who had to protect lord rahl against an approaching threat and you knew that the very next day you were going to die in some horrifying fashion knew the exact hour the agonizing details it might put you in a state of paralyzing fear and in that panic of knowing exactly when and how you were to die you would naturally be ill suited to protect lord rahls life nydas frown eased only slightly do you really think that wizard rahl would tell you such a thing why do you think they had him locked away hes dangerous prophecy could be dangerous for those like me who protect lord rahl or maybe it could help nyda said if you knew that something bad was going to happen you could stop it then it wouldnt be prophecy now would it nyda ran her hand down her braid as she considered the implications but if you knew of some dire foretelling then maybe you could turn the prophecy aside and avert the disaster if you could turn prophecy aside that would make it wrong if it were wrong if it were prophecy unfulfilled then it would just be the foolish empty words of an old man wouldnt it then how could prophecy be distinguished from the ranting of any lunatic who claimed he was a prophet but its not empty ranting jennsen insisted its prophecy if this prophet wanted to harm my mission he might tell me something terrible about my future if i knew something terrible i might fail lord rahl you mean nyda asked that you think it would be like if i were to jab my agiel at someone it would make them flinch yes only if we know a prophecy and flinch as it were its lord rahl who would be put at risk because of our weakness and fear nyda released her braid and put her hand back on the railing but i would not flinch knowing how i was to die especially if it was lord rahls life i was saving as a mordsith im always prepared to die every mordsith wishes to die fighting for the lord rahl not old and toothless in bed jennsen wondered if the woman was mad or if she could really be that dedicated a brave boast sebastian put in but are you willing to bet lord rahls life on it nyda looked him in the eye if it were my life on the line yes i would not flinch knowing how and when i was to die then i admit that youre a better woman than i jennsen said nyda nodded grimly i would not expect you to be the same as you may carry the knife but are not mordsith jennsen wished nyda would move on if she couldnt convince the woman and had to fight her this would be a very bad place to have to do it the mordsith was strong and quick with sebastian behind he could be little help besides that hanging on to the swaying bridge over the chasm jennsens head was spinning she didnt like high places and had never prided herself in her sense of balance id do my best not to fail lord rahl in a situation like that jennsen said but i cant swear i wouldnt id not like lord rahls life to hang on the answer nyda nodded in resignation thats wise she finally turned and started out once more across the footbridge i would still try to change the prophecy though jennsen let out a silent sigh as she shuffled along following close behind in some manner she didnt understand her words were swaying the mordsith more than seemed possible she glanced over the edge but still saw no bottom prophecy cant be changed or it would cease to be prophecy prophecy comes from prophets who are gifted with it nyda had her braid over her shoulder again stroking it but if hes a prophet then he knows the future and like you said that cant be changed or it wouldnt be prophecyso he would only be telling you what is going to happen he cant change it you cant change it its already going to happen whether he tells you or not if telling you would make you fail to protect lord rahl then he would already see such an event so it is preordained to happen and would be part of the prophecy to begin with jennsen pulled a strand of her hair out of her eyes as she advanced along the bridge gripping the rail tightly in her mind she furiously raced to come up with a logical answer she had no idea if the things she was saying were true or not but she thought they sounded convincing and seemed to be working the problem was nyda kept asking questions jennsen had more and more trouble answering she felt almost as if she were descending into the void below each attempt to climb out only letting her slip deeper she did her best to keep any trace of desperation out of her voice but dont you see prophets dont see everything about everyone as if the whole world and every single thing that happens is some grand play to be acted out according to a script the prophet has already read a prophet would only see some thingsmaybe even some things of his choosing but other things things he doesnt see he might try to influence nyda frowned back at them what do you mean jennsen sensed that her only safety was to keep nyda worried for her lord rahl i mean if he wanted to harm lord rahl he might tell me something that would make me flinch just to make me flinch even if he didnt see such an event nydas frown grew more serious you mean he might lie yes but why would wizard rahl want to harm lord rai what possible reason would he have i told you hes dangerous thats why they had him locked away in the palace of the prophets who knows what other things they knew about him that we dont things that made them feel it was necessary to lock such a man away that still doesnt answer why wizard rahl would wish to harm lord rahl jennsen felt as if she were in a knife fighttrying to protect herself from this womans razorsharp verbal blade its not just prophecyhes a wizard hes gifted i dont know if hes interested in harming lord rahlmaybe hes notbut i dont want to risk lord rahls life to find out i know enough about magic to know i dont like messing around with things of magic that are beyond me i have to put lord rahls life first im not saying that i believe nathan rahl is bent on harm im just saying that its my job to protect lord rahl and i dont want to take the chance with such magic magic i cant ward the woman shouldered open the door at the end of the foot bridge i cant argue that i dont like anything to do with magic but if lord rahl is in danger from this prophet of a wizard maybe you had better stay here so we can look into it i dont know if nathan rahl represents a threat but i have pressing business that i know for certain is a grave danger to lord rahl my responsibility is to tend to that nyda tried a door but found it locked she continued on down the dingy hallway but if your suspicions about nathan rahl are correct then we must nyda im hoping you can keep your eye on this nathan rahl for me i cant do it all myself watch him for me do you wish me to kill him no jennsen was surprised at how ready the mordsith seemed to be to commit to such an act of course not im just saying to pay attention keep an eye on him thats all nyda reached another door this time the lever lifted before she opened it she turned back to the two of them jennsen didnt like the look in her eyes as her gaze shifted between them this is all crazy nyda said too much of it makes no sense too many things dont fit i dont like it when things dont make sense this was a dangerous creature who could at any moment turn on them jennsen had to find a way to close the subject for good she remembered what captain lerner had said how filled with conviction he had been and spoke the words softly to nyda the new lord rahl has changed everything all the ruleshes turned the whole world upside down nyda finally let out a deep breath a wistful smile came to her lips yes he has she said in a soft voice wonder of wonders thats why i would lay down my life to protect him why i worry so me too i need to do my job nyda turned away and led them to a dark spiral of stairs tunneling down through the rock jennsen knew that the tale she was spinning wasnt entirely convincing she was perplexed that it worked anyway a long journey down seemingly endless stairs and along dark corridors occasionally cutting through passageways crowded with soldiers took them ever lower in the plateau below the peoples palace sebastians hand on her back for much of the journey was a reassuring comfort and a relief jennsen could hardly believe that she had managed to get him free soon they would be out of the palace and safely away somewhere within the interior of the plateau they emerged into the central public area nyda had taken them down a more direct route and saved them time jennsen preferred staying within the hidden passageways but apparently those shortcuts ended at this place within the common area they would have to finish their descent among the crowds small stands selling food lined the way along the route as throngs of people shuffled past on their long ascent to the palace above jennsen recalled passing the vendors opposite the stone balusters overlooking the level below on her first visit to the palace the smells after the dusty places they had been were temptation almost beyond endurance soldiers patrolling nearby noticed them on their way down moving against the crowds like all the soldiers she had seen in the palace these were big men muscular fit eyes alert in their leather and chain mail weapons hanging from their belts they were an intimidating sight as soon as they realized that nyda was escorting them the soldiers turned their scrutiny to other people when jennsen saw sebastian pull up his hood she realized it would be a good idea to hide her hair and followed suit the air inside the plateau was frosty and a number of people had their heads covered with hoods or hats so it wouldnt raise suspicions as they reached the far end of a long landing in the lower reaches inside the plateau just as they turned to descend the next flight of stairs jennsen looked up at the opposite end of the landing a tall older man with a full head of straight white hair hanging to his broad shoulders was just coming down off the stairs even though he was old he was still a strikingly handsome man despite his age he moved with vigor he looked up his gaze met jennsens the world seemed to stop in the mans dark azure eyes jennsen froze there was something about him that looked vaguely familiar something in those eyes that seized her attention sebastian had stopped two steps below her nyda was at her side the mordsiths gaze followed jennsens the mans hawklike glare was fixed on jennsen as if they were the only two people in the entire palace dear spirits nyda whispered that has to be nathan rahl how do you know sebastian asked she stepped up beside jennsen her attention fixed on the man he has the eyes of a rahl of darken rahl ive seen those eyes in enough nightmares nydas gaze slid to jennsen her brow drew together jennsen realized where she had seen the mans eyesin the mirror chapter in the distance across the landing jennsen saw the wizards eyes going wide his hand came up pointing across the throng of people stop he called out in a deep powerful voice even above the racket around her jennsen could clearly hear that voice ring out stop nyda was staring at her as if the spark of recognition was but an instant away jennsen seized her arm nyda you have to stop him nyda broke the gaze to look over her shoulder at the man rushing toward them she looked back at jennsen jennsen remembered althea saying that she could see some rahl in jennsens looks and that others who knew darken rahl might recognize her jennsen gripped red leather in her fist stop him dont listen to anything he says but he might only gripping the fistful of red leather tightly jennsen shook the woman havent you heard anything ive said he might keep me from helping lord rahl he might try to trick you stop him please nydalord rahls life is in grave danger invoking the name of lord rahl tipped the balance back go nyda said hurry jennsen nodded and dashed down the steps she only had time for a brief look she saw the prophets long legs striding toward them his hand held out calling for them to stop nyda agiel in her fist ran for him jennsen scanned the area for soldiers then turned back for a look trying to see if nathan rahl was still coming trying to see if nyda was stopping him sebastian snatched her hand pulling her in a headlong rush down the steps jennsen didnt get a chance for another glimpse of her wizard kin she hadnt realized how it would affect her to see someone who was related to her she hadnt expected to see it in his eyes there had only been her mother and her before it was the strangest feelinga kind of pensive longingseeing this man who was in some way her blood but if he caught her her doom would be sealed together she and sebastian raced down the steps dodging people who were on their way up some people grumbled at them to watch where they were going or cursed them for running at each landing she and sebastian skirted the crowds and flew down the next flight of stairs when they reached a level where soldiers were stationed they slowed jennsen pulled her hood up a little tighter making sure that her hair was hidden along with some of her face fearing people might recognize her for being the daughter of darken rahl anxiety knotted her insides at having discovered that there was that too she now had to worry about sebastians arm around her waist held her close as he wound his way through the flowing river of people to avoid soldiers on patrol moving by near the balusters he had to guide jennsen to the side with benches taking them closer among the stands weaving through lines of people the landing was choked with people buying trinkets and treasures of their visit to the peoples palace the air was filled with the aroma of meats and spices from some of the stands couples sat on benches eating drinking smiling talking excitedly others simply watched people pass there were shadowy spaces between stands and pillars where some couples sat tight together on short benches or where there were no benches stood close in the dark cuddling kissing when jennsen and sebastian reached the edge of the landing about to head down they spotted a large patrol of soldiers coming up the steps sebastian hesitated she knew he had to be thinking about the last time soldiers took notice of him this was a large group it would be impossible to pass them without being within an arms length as they marched up the steps the men looked carefully at everyone jennsen doubted that she would ever again be able to talk sebastian out of a prison cell it was likely since she was with him that this time they might take her in to be questioned if they detained her nathan rahl would seal her fate she felt the sense of panic of doom closing in on her jennsen not wanting to separate from sebastian instead grabbed his arm and pulled him back across the landing past couples on benches past those in lines at counters past people standing back in the shadows embracing and into one of the dark empty niches panting from the effort of their long run she put her shoulders into the narrow nook back between the rear of a stand and a pillar she drew sebastian around in front of her so that his back would be to the soldiers with his hood up as it was they wouldnt see much of him if they noticed them at all they would only see enough to notice she was a woman they would look like nothing more than a couple of completely unremarkable people jennsen put her arms around sebastians waist so they would took like any of the other ordinary couples spending a few moments alone with each other it was quieter back in their small sanctuary the sound of their heavy breathing drowned out the voices not far away most people couldnt see them and the ones who could have were turned to other things it had made jennsen uncomfortable and awkward to watch couples snuggled together as she and sebastian were now so she imagined it would be the same for other people it looked to her that she was right no one paid any attention to a young couple embracing and obviously wanting to be by themselves sebastians hands were on her waist her hands held his back so that they would look the part as they waited for the soldiers to pass she was grateful beyond words that the good spirits had helped her get sebastian out i never thought id see you again he whispered for the first time alone with her since hed been released for the first time able to say what he wanted jennsen looked away from the passing people into his eyes and saw how earnest he was i couldnt leave you there he shook his head i cant believe what you did i cant believe how you talked your way into that place you had them wrapped around your will how did you manage such a thing jennsen swallowed feeling at the edge of tears from the rush of emotion the fear the elation the panic the triumph i had to thats all i had to get you out she checked to be sure that no one was near before she went on i couldnt stand the thought of you being in there or of what they might do to you i went to althea the sorceress for help thats how you managed it then her magic jermsen shook her head as she gazed up into his eyes no althea couldnt help meits a long story she told me how shes been to your homeland to the old world she smiled like i said its a long story for another time it has to do with the pillars of creation one eyebrow lifted you mean shes actually been there what the pillars of creationshe really went there when she was in the old world his gaze followed a distant soldier for a moment you said it has something to do with how she helped you she actually saw the place what no she couldnt help me she said that i had to do it on my own i was terrified for you i didnt know what to do then i remembered what you told me about bluffing jennsen frowned with a curious squint what do you mean about her seeing the but then her words her very thought trailed off as he gazed into her eyes and smiled that wonderful smile of his ive never seen anyone pull off anything like that it felt unexpectedly wonderful knowing that she had surprised himpleased him his arms felt so good so powerful pressed back into the shadows he was holding her close she could feel his warm breath on her cheek sebastian i was so afraid i was so afraid id never see you again i was so afraid for you i know were you afraid too he nodded i could only think about how id never see you again his face was so close she could feel the warmth radiating from his skin she could feel the entire length of his body his legs his torso pressed against her as his lips gently brushed hers her heart pounded at a furious pace but then he pulled back as if having second thoughts she was thankful for his arms because realizing that he had almost kissed her she wasnt sure her legs would hold her up just then what a heady notion a kiss stolen in the shadows like this would have been almost a kiss feet shuffled past nearby but the people seemed miles away jennsen felt completely alone with sebastian weak in his arms safe in his arms he drew her closer then as if overcome as if he was in the grip of something he could no longer control she saw in his eyes a kind of helpless surrender he kissed her jennsen stood rock still surprised that he was actually doing it kissing her holding her in his arms just like she had seen lovers doing and then her arms tightened and she was holding him too kissing him back she had never imagined that anything could feel so wonderfully intoxicating in all her life jennsen had never thought such a thing could happen to her she had dreamed of it of course but she knew it was only a fantasy something for other people she never thought it could happen to her to jennsen rahl and now magically it was a helpless moan escaped her throat as he held her tight hugging her fiercely kissing her with passionate abandon she was acutely aware of his arm encircling the small of her back his other arm behind her shoulders her breasts mashed against the hard muscles of his chest his mouth pressed to hers his own needful moan in answer to hers unexpectedly it ended it was almost as if he had recovered his composure and forced himself back jennsen panted catching her breath she liked the way it felt to be held by him inches apart they gazed into each others eyes it was all so startling so quick so unexpected so confusing so right she wanted to melt into another embrace another delicious kiss but when he checked who was around who might be watching she gathered herself remembering where they were and why they were pressed back into the dark niche nathan rahl was after them only nyda stood between them if he told her who jennsen was and she believed him then the entire army would be after them they had to get out of the palace when sebastian pulled away from her doubts washed into the void his gaze swept the crowd as he looked to make sure no one was watching them lets go his hand found hers and he was suddenly pulling her away from the sanctuary of the shadowy fold in the palace jennsen felt lightheaded with a flood of confusing emotions everything from fear and shame to giddy excitement he had kissed her a real kiss a manwoman kiss her jennsen rahl the most hunted woman in dhara she almost didnt notice the steps as they descended she tried to look normal to look like any other person simply leaving the palace after a visit she didnt feel normal though she felt as if everyone who looked at her would know that he had just kissed her when a soldier unexpectedly turned their way she held sebastians arm in both hands pressing her head to his shoulder and smiled at the man as if in casual greeting it was enough of a distraction that they passed him and were away before he even thought to look at sebastian that was quick thinking sebastian whispered letting out a breath once past the soldier they picked up their pace again the sights she had seen on the way in were now a blur she didnt care about any of it she just wanted out she wanted away from the place where they had imprisoned sebastian where the two of them were in constant danger she was more exhausted from the unremitting tension of being in the place than she had been from the dangers in the swamp at last the stairs finally ended the light coming in the huge maw of the grand entrance made it difficult to see but the opening out of the plateau was a welcome sight together hand in hand they rushed toward the light crowds of people milled about stopping at stands watching passersby gawking at the size of the place while still others flowed past on their way up to the stairs soldiers near the sides watched people going in so she and sebastian moved toward the middle the soldiers didnt seem as interested in those leaving as those entering cold daylight greeted them outside the tower of rock the marketplace below the plateau was a bustle of activity just as it had been before the makeshift streets past the tents and stands teemed with people looking or sometimes stopping to make a purchase others moved toward the entrance to the peoples palace with business with hopes with small goods with money hawkers strolled among the visitors calling out the wonders of their wares she had told him that the horses and betty were missing so sebastian led her instead to a nearby enclosure filled with horses of every variety the man watching the horses was sitting on a crate that made up part of the rope fence rubbing his arms in the cold saddles sat in a line along the edge of the makeshift fence wed like to buy some horses sebastian said as he approached checking the condition of the animals the man looked up squinting in the sunlight good for you well are you selling or not not the man said he turned and spat with the back of his hand he wiped his chin these horses belong to people im paid to watch them not to sell them i go selling someones horse im liable to be skinned alive do you know who might sell horses sorry cant say as i do check around they thanked him and moved down the makeshift streets looking for open areas where horses might be picketed jennsen didnt mind walkingthat was usually how she and her mother traveledbut she understood sebastians urgency to find a horse with such a narrow escape and then with the wizard nathan rahl trying to stop them they needed to get far away from the peoples palace as fast as they could at a second place they got the same answer as the first jennsen was hungry and wished she could get something to eat but she knew that they would be better off making good their escape than lingering to have a meal and end up dying on a full stomach sebastian holding her hand tight pulled her between stands cutting across the crowded streets toward horses picketed in a dusty enclosure you able to sell horses sebastian asked a man watching over them the man his arms folded was leaning against a post no ive none to sell sebastian nodded thanks anyway the man caught sebastians cloak before they moved on he leaned closer you be leaving the area sebastian shrugged going back south thought wed like to pick up a horse while we were visiting the palace the man leaned out a little and checked both ways after dark come see me plan on being around that long i may be able to help you sebastian nodded i have some business that will keep me here the day ill be back after its dark he took jennsens arm and moved her down the crowded street they had to step out of the way of two sisters fawning over necklaces theyd bought as the father walked behind with a load of goods they had pur chased the mother watched her girls as she pulled a couple of sheep along behind it gave jennsen a pang of heartache for betty are you crazy she whispered at sebastian confused as to why he would tell the man that they would be back after dark we cant stay here all day of course we cant the man is a cutthroat since i had to ask if he was selling horses he knows i have the money to buy one and would like to relieve me of it if we go back there after dark hell likely have friends hiding in the shadows waiting to do us in hes a thief are you serious this place is full of thieves sebastian leaned in with a stem look this is dharaa land where the greedy and perverse prey on the weak where people care nothing about the welfare of their fellow man and even less about the future of mankind jennsen understood what he meant on their way to the peoples palace sebastian had told her about brother narev and his teachings his hope for a future where mankinds lot was not suffering a future where there was no starvation or sickness or cruelty where every man cared for his fellow man sebastian said that along with the help of jagang the just and the will of good and decent people the fellowship of order would help to bring it about jennsen had trouble imagining such a wonderful world a world away from lord rahl but if that man was a thief why would you tell him that youll come back because if i didnt if i told him i couldnt wait then he might signal his partners we wouldnt know who they are but they would know us and likely find a spot they could surprise us you really think so like i said the place is full of thieves watch yourself or you might get your purse cut right off your belt without even knowing it she was just about to confess that that very thing had already happened when she heard her name being called jennsen jennsen it was tom big as he was he stood out like a mountain among foothills yet he was holding up his hand waving for her as if he feared she would have trouble spotting him sebastian leaned closer you know him he helped me get you out jennsen had no time to explain any more than that before smiling her acknowledgment to the big man waving his arm at her tom happy as a puppy at seeing her rushed out to meet her in the middle of the street she saw his brothers back at their table tom wore a wide grin i knew youd come just like you promised joe and clayton said i was nuts to think you would but i told them you would keep your promise to stop before you left i i just came from the palace just now she patted her cloak where it concealed the knife im afraid that were in a rush and need to be on our way tom nodded knowingly he seized sebastians hand and pumped it as if they were friends long separated im tom you must be the friend jennsen was helping thats right im sebastian tom tilted his head in gesture toward jennsen shes something isnt she ive never seen anyone like her sebastian assured him a man couldnt want for more than a woman like this on his side tom said he stepped between them putting an arm around their shoulders preventing any escape and guided them back to his stand ive got something for you both what do you mean jennsen asked they didnt have time for any delay they needed to get away before the wizard came out looking for themor sent troops after them now that nathan rahl had seen her he could describe her to guards everyone would know what they looked like oh so
