hey chandler said lany grantz the jailer i can get fifty to one for a conviction what dyou think go to hell said chandler come on let me in on it you got any surprises for the judge chandler didnt answer he didnt even look at the jailer a man who was on his way to hell didnt have to worry about what people thought of him now look said the jailer you could maybe use a friend or two before long what do you say listen i can get five for one if youre going to plead guilty are you why should i im innocent oh yeah all right but if you plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court no the hell with you then the jailer stood in the doorway picking his nose and looking at chandler with dislike that was all right chandler was getting used to it it was hard to believe that this was the late th century the third decade of the atomic age the era of spaceffight of course there hadnt been much of that lately chandler wondered what the mars expedition must be thinking these days waiting for the reliefandrotation ship that must be a year or two overdue by now assum ing they were still alive of course youre gonna go in there in a minute chandler said grantz and then its too late why dont you be a sport and let me know whats up chandler said ive got nothing to tell you im inno cent you gonna plead that way pressed the jailer im going to plead that way ah cripes theyll shoot you sure chandler shook his head meaning thats not up to me grantz stared at him irresolutely chandler changed position gently since he still hurt pretty badly he wished he had a watch although there was no particular reason for him to worry about the time any more five years before back in the old days before the demons came when he was helping design telemetry equipment for the ganymede probe chandler would not have believed his life would be at stake in a witchcraft trial not even that he wasnt accused of being involved in witchcraft he was about to go on trial for his life for the far more serious crime of not being involved in witch craft it was hard to believebut believe it or not it was happening it was happening to him it was happening right now grantz cocked an ear to a voice from outside the door nodded ground out his cigarette under a heel and said all right fink just remember when theyre pulling the trigger on you you could have had a friend on the firing squad and he opened the door and marched chandler out because of the crowd that was attracted by the sensa tional nature of the charges against him they held chan dlers trial in the allpurpose room of the high school it smelled of leather and stale sweat there was a mob there must have been three or four hundred people present they all looked at him exactly as the jailer had chandler walked up the three steps to the stage with the jailers hand on his elbow and took his place at the defendants table his lawyer was there already the lawyer who had been appointed by the court over his vigorous protests looked at him without emotion he was willing to do his job but his job didnt require him to like his client all he said was stand up the judge is coming in chandler got to his feet and leaned on the table while the bailiff chanted his call and the chaplain read some verses from john he did not listen the bible verses came too late to help him and besides he ached when the police arrested him they had not been gentle there were four of them they were from the plants own security force and carried no guns they didnt need any chandler had put up no resistance after the first few momentsfliat is he stopped fighting as soon as he could stopbut the police hadnt stopped he remembered that very clearly he remembered the nightstick across the side of his head that left his ear squashed and puffy he remembered the kick in the gut that still made walking painful he even remembered the pounding on his skull that had knocked him out the bruises along his rib cage and left arm though he did not remember getting obviously the police had been mad enough to keep right on subduing him after he was already unconscious chandler did not blame themexactly he supposed he would have done the same thing the judge was having a long mumble with the court stenographer apparently about something which had hap pened in the union house the night before chandler knew judge ellithorp slightly he did not expect to get a fair trial the previous december the judge himself while possessed had smashed the transmitter of the towns radio station which he owned and set fire to the building it occupied his soninlaw had been killed in the fire since the judge had had his own taste of hell he would not be kind to chandler laughing the judge waved the reporter back to his seat and glanced around the courtroom his gaze touched chandler lightly like the flick of the hanging strands of cord that precede a railroad tunnel the touch carried the same warning what lay ahead for chandler was destruc tion read the charge ordered judge ellithorp he spoke very loudly there were more than six hundred persons in the auditorium the judge didnt want any of them to miss a word the bailiff ordered chandler to stand and informed him that he was accused of having on the seventeenth day of june last committed on the person of margaret flershem a minor an act of rapelouder ordered the judge testily yes your honor said the bailiff and inflated his chest an act of rape under threat of bodily violence he cried and did further commit on the person of said margaret flershem an act of aggravated assault chandler rubbed his aching side looking at the ceiling he remembered the look in peggy flershems eyes as he forced himself on her she was only sixteen years old and at that time he hadnt even known her last name the bailiff boomed on and did further commit on that same seventeenth day of june last on the person of ingovar porter an act of assault with intent to rape the foregoing being a true bill handed down by the grand jury of marecel county in extraordinary session assembled the eighteenth day of june last judge ellithorp looked satisfied as the bailiff sat down quite winded while the judge hunted through the papers on his desk the crowd in the auditorium stirred and murmured a child began to cry the judge stood up and pounded his gavel what is it whats the matter with him you dundon the court attendant the judge was looking at hurried over and spoke to the childs mother then reported to the judge i dunno your honor all he says is something scared him the judge was enraged well thats just fine now we have to take up the time of all these good people proba bly for no reason and hold up the business of this court just because of a child bailiff i want you to clear this courtroom of all children under he hesitated calculat ing voting blocks in his headall children under the age of six dr palmer are you there well you better go ahead with theprayer the judge could not make him self say the exorcism im sorry madam he added to the mother of the crying twoyearold if you have someone to leave the child with ill instruct the attendants to save your place for you she was also a voter dr palmer rose very grave as he was embarrassed he glared around the allpurpose room defying anyone to smile as he chanted domina pythonis i command you leave leave hel leave heloym leave sother and thetragrammaton leave all unclean ones i command you in the name of god in all of his manifestations he sat down again still very grave he knew that he did not make nearly as fine a showing as father lon with his resonant in nomina lesu christi et sancti ubaldi and his censer but the post of exorcist was filled in strict rotation one month to a denomination ever since the troubles started dr palmer was a unitarian exorcisms had not been in the curriculum at the seminary and he had been forced to invent his own chandlers lawyer tapped him on the shoulder last chance to change your mind he said no im not guilty and thats the way i want to plead the lawyer shrugged and stood up waiting for the judge to notice him chandler for the first time allowed himself to meet the eyes of the crowd he studied the jury first he knew some of them casuallyit was not a big enough town to command a jury of total strangers for any defendant and chandler had lived there most of his life he recognized pop mathe son old and very stiff who ran the railroad station cigar stand two of the other men were familiar as faces passed in the street the forewoman though was a stranger sb sat there very composed and frownmg and all he knew about her was that she wore funny hats yesterdays had been red roses when she was selected from the panel todays was of all things a stuffed bird he did not think that any of them was possessed he was not so sure of the audience he saw girls he had dated in high school long before he met margot men he worked with at the plant they all glanced at him but he was not sure who was looking out through some of those familiar eyes the visitors reliably watched all large gatherings at least momentarily it would be surprising if none of them were here all right how do you plead said judge ellithorp at last chandlers lawyer straightened up not guilty your honor by reason of temporary pandemic insanity the judge looked pleased the crowd murmured but they were pleased too they had him dead to rights and it would have been a disappointment if chandler had plead ed guilty they wanted to see one of the vilest criminals in contemporary human society caught exposed convicted and punished they did not want to miss a step of the process already in the playground behind the school three deputies from the sheriffs office were loading their rifles while the school janitor chalked lines around the handball court to mark where the crowd witnessing the execution would be permitted to stand all this as chandler very reasonably told himself was quite insane there were satellites in orbit in the skies overhead every home in the town owned a television set although to be sure they now did nothing but serve as receptacles for the holding of seashells and flowers and hopes for a better world this was the th century but they gave every sign of being about to kill him as dead as though it were the seventeenth the prosecution made its case very quickly mrs porter testified that she worked at mckelvey bros the antibiotics plant where the defendant also worked yes that was him she had been attracted by the noise from the culture room lastlets seewas it the seventeenth day of june last prompt ed the prosecutor and chandlers attorney instinctively gathered his muscles to rise hesitated glanced at his client and shrugged that was right it was the seventeenth incautiously she went right into the room she should have known better she admitted she should have called the plant police right away but well they hadnt had any trouble at the plant you know andwell she didnt she was a stupid woman for all that she was rather good looking and insatiably curious she had seen peggy fler shem on the floor she was all blood and her clothes wereand she was i mean herher body was with relentless tact the prosecutor allowed her to stammer out her observation that the girl had clearly been raped and she had seen chandler laughing and breaking up the place throwing racks of cultures through the windows upsetting trays of course she had crossed herself and tried a quick exorcism but there was no visible effect then chandler had leaped at her he was hateful he was just foul but as he began to attack her the plant police came drawn by her screams chandlers attorney did not question peggy flershems deposition was introduced without ob jection from the defense but she had little to say anyway having been dazed at first and unconscious later the plant police testified to having arrested chandler a doctor de scribed in chaste medical words the derangements chan dler had worked on peggy flershems virgin anatomy there was no question from chandlers lawyerand for that matter nothing to question chandler did not hope to pretend that he had not ravished and nearly killed one girl then done his best to repeat the process on another sitting there as the doctor testified chandler was able to tally every break and bruise against the memory of what his own body had done he had been aspectator then too as remote from the event as he was now but that was why they had him on trial that was what they did not believe at twelvethirty the prosecution rested its case judge ellithorp looking very pleased he recessed the court for one hour for lunch and larry grant tookk chandler back to the detention cell in the basement of the school two swiss cheese sandwiches and a wax paper carton of chocolate milk were on the desk they were chandlers lunch as they had been standing the sandwiches were crusty and the milk lukewarm he ate them anyway he knew what the judge looked pleased about at onethirty chandlers lawyer would put him on the stand and no one would pay very much attention to what he had to say and the juiy would be out at most twenty minutes and the verdict would be guilty the judge was pleased because he would be able to pronounce sentence no later than four oclock no matter what they had formed the habit of holding the executions at sundown as at that time of year sundown was after seven it would all go very wellfor everyone but chan dler lasry grantz looked m eating a wedge of pie from the diner across the street you want anything else he demanded coffee ah you wont have time to drink it grantz licked his fingers of course if you wasnt such a bastard about tipping me off he waited a moment and when chan dler did not reply closed the door chandler looked out the window it was a nice day far outside above and away a thin pale line of cloud stretched itself across the horizon contrail chandler watched it listening and caught the distant thundering mumble of a transsonic jet he wondered what sort of hand was at its controls where they came from no one knew where they were going no one could tell none had ever landed in this little part of the world in a long time not even at the air force base not anywhere in the years since that day of disaster when the old world came to an end every once in a while one rasped across the sky on what errands chan dler could not guess in any event he had more pressing problems the odd thing about his dilemma was not merely that he was innocentin a way that isbut that many who were guilty were free and honored citizens chandler himself was a widower because his own wife had been murdered he had seen the murderer leaving the scene of the crime and the man he had seen was in the courtroom today watching chandlers own trial of the six hundred or so in the court at least fifty were known to have taken part in one or more provable acts of murder rape arson theft sod omy vandalism assault and battery or a dozen other offenses indictable under the laws of the state of course that could be said of almost any community in the world in those years chandlers was not unique what had put chandler in the dock was not what his body had been seen to do but the place in which it had been seen to do it for everybody knew that medicine and agriculture were never molested by the demons chandlers own lawyer had pointed that out to him the day before the trial if it was anywhere but at the mc kelvey plant all right but theres never been any trouble there you know that the trouble with you laymen is you think of lawyers in terms of perry mason right rabbit out of the hat stuff well i cant do that i can only present your case whatever it is the best way possible and the best thing i can do for your case right now is tell you you havent got one at that time the lawyer was still trying to be fair he was even casting around for some thought he could use to convince himself that his client was innocent though he had frankly admitted as soon as he introduced himself that he didnt have much hope there chandler protested that he didnt have to commit rape hed been a widower for a year but wait a minute said the lawyer listen you cant make an ordinary claim of possession stick but what about good oldfashioned insanity chandler looked puz zled so the lawyer explained wasnt it possible that chandler wasconsciously subconsciously unconscious ly call it what you willtrying to get revenge for what had happened to his own wife no said chandler certainly not but then he had to stop and think after all he had never been possessed before in fact he had always retained a certain skepti cism about possessionit seemed like such a conven ient way for anyone to do any illicit thing he choseuntil the moment when he looked up to see peggy flershem walking into the culture room with a tray of agar disks and was astonished to find himself striking her with the wrench in his hand and ripping at her absurdly floral printed slacks maybe his case was different maybe it wasnt the sort of possession that struck at random maybe he was just off his rocker margot his wife had been cut up cruelly he had seen his friend jack souther leaving his home hurriedly as he approached and although he had thought that the stains on his clothes looked queerly like blood nothing in that prepared him for what he found in the rumpus room it had taken him some time to identify the spreadout dis section on the ffoor with his wife margot no he told his lawyer i was shaken up of course the worst time was the next night when there was a knock on the door and i opened it and it was jack hed come to apologize iwell i got over it i tell you i was pos sessed thats all and i tell you that defense will put you right in front of a firing squad said his lawyer and thafs all five or six others had been executed for hoaxing chandler was familiar with the ritual he even understood it in a way the world had gone to pot in the previous two years the real enemy was out of reach when any citizen might run wild and when caught relapse into his own self terrified and sick there was a need to strike back but the enemy was invisible the hoaxers were only whip ping boysbut they were the only targets vengeance had the real enemy had struck the entire world in a single night one day the people of the world went about their business in the gloomy knowledge that they were likely to make mistakes but with at least the comfort that the mis takes would be their own the next day had not such com fort the next day anyone anywhere was likely to find himself seized possessed working evil or whimsy without ever having formed the intention to do so and helpless ly demons martians no one knew whether the invad ers of the soul were from another world or from some djinns bottle all they knew was that they were helpless against them chandler stood up kicked the balledup wax paper from his sandwiches across the floor and swore violently he was beginning to wake from the shock that had gripped him damn fool he said to himself he had no particular reason like the world he needed a whipping boy too if only himself damn fool you know theyre going to shoot you he stretched and twisted his body violently alone in the middle of the room in silence he had to wake up he had to start thinking in a quarter of an hour or less the court would reconvene and from then it was only a steady quick slide to the grave it was better to do anything than to do nothing he examined the windows of his improvised cell they were above his head and barred standing on the table he could see feet walking outside in the paved playyard of the school he discarded the thought of escaping that way there was no one to smuggle him a file and there was no time he studied the door to the hall it was not impossible that when the guard opened it he could jump him knock him out run run where the room had been a storage place for athletic equipment at the end of a hall the hall led only to the stairs and the stairs emerged into the courtroom it was quite likely he thought that the hall had another flight of stairs somewhere farther along or through another room what had he spent his taxes on these years if not for schools designed with more than one exit in case of fire but as he had not thought to mark an escape route when he was brought in it did him no good the guard however had a gun chandler lifted up an edge of the table and tried to shake one of the legs they did not shake that part of his taxes had been well enough spent he thought wryly the chair could he smash the chair to get a club which would give him a weapon to get the guards gun before he reached the chair the door opened and his lawyer came in sorry im late he said briskly well as your attor ney i have to tell you theyve presented a damaging case as i see it what case chandler demanded i never denied the acts what else did they prove oh god said his lawyer not quite loudly enough to be insulting do we have to go over that again your claim of possession would make a defense if it had hap pened anywhere else we know that these cases exist but we also know that they follow a pattern some areas seem to be immunemedical establishments pharmaceutical plants among them so they proved that all this happened in a pharmaceutical plant i advise you to plead guilty chandler sat down on the edge of the table controlling himself very well he thought he only asked would that do me any good at all the lawyer reflected gazing at the ceiling no chandler nodded so what else shall we talk about want to compare notes about where you were and i was the night the president went possessed the lawyer was irritated he kept his mouth shut for a moment until he thought he could keep from showing it outside a vendor was hawking amulets st ann beads witch knots fresh garlic local grown best in town the lawyer shook his head all right he said its your life well do it your way anyway times up sergeant grantz will be banging on the door any minute he zipped up his briefcase chandler did not move they dont give us much time anyway the lawyer add ed angry at chandler and at hoaxers in general but not willing to say so grantz is a stickler for promptness chandler found a crumb of cheese by his hand and absently ate it the lawyer watched him and glanced at his watch oh hell he said picked up his briefcase and kicked the base of the door grantz whats the matter with you you asleep out there chandler was sworn gave his name admitted the truth of everything the previous witnesses had said the faces were still aimed at him every one he could not read them at all any more could not tell if they were friendly or hating there were too many and they all had eyes the jurors sat on their funeralparlor chairs like cadavers em balmed and propped the dead witnessing a wake for the living only the forewoman in the funny hat showed signs of life looking alertly at chandler at the judge at the man next to her around the auditorium maybe it was a good sign at least she did not have the frozeninconcrete guiltyashell look of the others his attorney asked him the question he had been wait ing for tell us in your own words what happened chandler opened his mouth and paused curiously he had forgotten what he wanted to say he had rehearsed this moment again and again but all that came out was i didnt do it i mean i did the acts but i was possessed thats all others have done worse under the same circumstances and been let off just as fisher was acquitted for murdering the leamards as draper got off after what he did to the cline boy as jack souther over there was let off after he murdered my own wife they should be they couldnt help themselves whatever this thing is that takes control i know it cant be fought my god you cant even try to fight it he was not getting through the faces had not changed the forewoman of the jury was now searching systemati cally through her pocketbook taking each item out and examining it putting it back and taking out another but between times she looked at him and at least her expres sion wasnt hostile he said addressing her thats all there is to it it wasnt me running my body it was someone else i swear it before all of you and before god the prosecutor did not bother to question him chandler went back to his seat and sat down and watched the next twenty minutes go by in the wink of an eye rapid rapid they were in a hurry to shoot him he could hardly believe that judge ellithorp could speak so fast the jurymen rose and filed out at a gallop zip whisk and they were back again too fast he cried silently time had gone into high gear but he knew that it was only his imagination the twenty minutes had been a full twelve hundred seconds and then time as if to make amends came to a stop abrupt brakes on the judge asked the jury for their verdict and it was an eternity before the forewoman arose she was beginning to look rather disheveled beaming at chandlersurety the woman was rather odd it couldnt be just his imaginationshe fumbled in her pocketbook for the slip of paper with the verdict but she wore an expression of suppressed laughter i knew i had it she cried triumphantly and waved the slip above her head now lets see she held it before her eyes and squinted oh yes judge we the jury and so forth and so on she paused to wink at judge ellithorp an uncertain worried murmur welled up in the auditorium all that junk judge she explained anyway we unanimously but unanimously lovefind this son of a bitch innocent why she giggled we think he ought to get a medal you know i tell you what you do love you go right over and give him a big wet kiss and say youre sorry she stood drunkenly swaying laughing at the courtroom the murmuring became something more like a mass scream stop her stop her bawled the judge dropping his glasses bailiff sergeant grantz oh cool it cried the woman in the floppy hat hi there that you love a man in the front row leaped to his feet and waved to her the scream became a shout a single word possessed i tell you what shrieked the woman lets all sing everybody for hes a fairly good fellow for hes a fairly good fellow come on now loves all together for his honor the bailiff half a dozen policemen the ludge himself were scrambling toward her but they were fighting a tide of terrified people flowing away possessed she clearly was and she was not alone the man in the front row sang raucously along with her then he flopped like a rag doll and someone behind him leaped to his feet and carried along with the song without missing a beat then another another it was like some distant sorcerer at a selector switch turning first one on then another the noise was bedlam as the police closed in on her the woman blew them kisses they fell away as from leprosy then buried themselves grimly back like a lynch mob she was giggling as they fell on her from under their scrambling bodies her voice gasped oh now not so rough say got acigarette ive been wanting the voice choked and spluttered and then it screamed it was a sound of pure hysteria the police separated themselves and helped her up still screaming eyes weep ing with terror oh she gasped oh i couldnt stop chandler stood up and took one step toward the door so much confusion such utter disorganization there was a chance he stopped and turned they would catch him before he got outside the door he made a decision caught his lawyer by the arm jerked at it until he got the mans attention all of a sudden he felt alive again there was hope tiny insubstantial but listen he said rapidly you damn it listen to me the jury acquitted me right the lawyer was startled dont be ridiculous its a clear case of be a lawyer man you live on technicalities dont you make this one work for me the attorney gave him a queer thoughtful look hesi tated shrugged and got to his feet he had to shout to be heard your honor i take it my client is free to go he made almost as much of a stir as the sobbing woman but he outshouted the storm the jurys verdict is on record granted there was an apparent case of possession nevertheless judge euithorp yelled back no nonsense you listen to me young man the lawyer snapped permission to approach the bench granted chandler sat unable to move watching the brief stormy conference it was painful to be coming back to life it was agony to hope at least he thought detachedly his lawyer was fighting for him the prosecutors face was a thunder cloud the lawyer came back with the expression of a man who has won a victory he did not expect and did not want your last chance chandler change your plea to guilty but dont push your luck boy the judge has agreed to accept a plea theyll throw you out of town of course but youll be alive chandler hesitated make up your mind the best i can do otherwise is a mistrial and that means youll get convicted by another jury next week chandler said testing his luck youre sure theyll keep their end of the bargain the lawyer shook his head his expression that of a man who smells something unpleasant your honor i ask you to discharge the jury my client wishes to change his plea in the schools chemistry lab an hour later chan dler discovered that the lawyer had left out one little detail outside there was a sound of motors idling the police car that would dump him at the towns limits inside was a thin hollow hiss it was the sound of a bunsen burner and in its blue flame a crudely shaped iron changed slowly from cherry to orange to glowing straw it had the shape of a letter h h for hoaxer the mark they were about to put on his forehead would be with him wherever he went and as long as he lived which would probably not be long h for hoaxer so that a glance would show that he had been convicted of the worst offense of all no one spoke to him as larry grantz took the iron out of the fire but three husky policemen held his arms while he screamed the pain was still burning when chandler awoke the next day he wished he had a bandage but he didnt and that was that he was m a freight carhad hopped it on the run at the yards daring to sneak back into town long enough for that he could not hope to hitchhike with that mark on him anyway hitchhiking was an invitation to trouble the railroads were safefar safer than either cars or air transport notoriously a lightning rod attracting posses sion chandler was surprised when the train came crashing to a stop each freight car smashing against the couplings of the one ahead the engine jolting forward and stopping again then there was silence it endured chandler who had been slowly waking after a night of very little sleep sat up against the wall of the boxcar and wondered what was wrong it seemed remiss to start a day without signing the cross or hearing a few exorcismal verses it seemed to be midmoming time for work to be beginning at the plant the lab men would be streaming in their amulets exam ined at the door the chaplains would be wandering about ready to pray a possessing spirit out chandler who kept an open mind had considerable doubt of the effectiveness of all the amulets and spellscertainly they had not kept him from committing a brutal rapebut he felt uneasy without them the train was still not mov ing in the silence he could hear the distant huffing of the engine he went to the door supporting himself with one hand on the wooden wall and looked out the tracks followed the roll of a river their bed a few feet higher than an empty threelane highway which in turn was a dozen feet above the water as he looked out the engine brayed twice the train jolted then stopped again then there was a very long time when nothing happened at all from chandlers car he could not see the engine he was on the convex of the curve and the other door of the car was sealed he did not need to see it to know that something was wrong there should have been a brake man running with a flare to ward off other trains but there was not there should have been a station or at least a water tank to account for the stop in the first place there was not something had gone wrong and chandler knew what it was not the details but the central fact that lay behind this and behind almost everything that went wrong these days the engineer was possessed it had to be that yet it was odd he thought as odd as his own trouble he had chosen this train with care it contained eia refrigerator cars full of pharmaceuticals and if anything was known about the laws governing possession as his lawyer had told him it was that such things were almost never interfered with chandler jumped down to the roadbed slipped on the crushed rock and almost fell he had forgotten the wound on his forehead he clutched the sill of the car door where an ankh and fleurdelis had been chalked to ward off demons until the sudden rush of blood subsided and the pain began to relent after a moment he walked gingerly to the end of the car slipped between the cars dodged the couplers and climbed the ladder to its roof it was a warm bright silent day nothing moved from his height he could see the diesel at the front of the train and the caboose at its rear no people the train was halted a quartermile from where the tracks swooped across the river on a suspension bridge away from the river the side of the tracks that had been hidden from him before was an uneven rock cut and above it the slope of a mountain by looking carefully he could spot the signs of a num ber of homes within half a mile or sothe corner of a roof a glassedin porch built to command a river view a twentyfoot television antenna poking through the trees there was also the curve of a higher road along which the homes were strung chandler took thought he was alive and free two gifts more gracious than he had had any right to expect however he would need food and he would need at least some sort of bandage for his forehead he had a wool cap stolen from the high school which would hide the mark though what it would do to the burn on his skin was something else again chandler climbed down the ladder with considerable pain he gentled the cap over the great raw h on his forehead and turned toward the mountain a voice from behind him said hey whats that youve got on your head chandler whirled mad and scared there was a man at the open doorway of the next boxcar kneeling and look ing out at him he was a small man by no means young he wore a dirty army officers uniform blouse over chi nos his face was dirty and unshaven his eyes were redrimmed and puffy but his expression was serenely interested now where the hell did you come from demanded chandler i didnt see you perhaps you didnt look the man said cheerfully untangled his legs and slipped down to the crushed gravel at the side of the roadbed he caught chandlers shoulder to steady himself from twenty inches away his breath was enough to knock chandler down but the man did not seem drunk he didnt even seem hung over though he walked awkwardly like a man who is just on his feet after a long illness or a toddling child excuse he said pushing past chandler and walking a step or two toward the head of the train staring toward the engine as chandler watched the little man lurched recovered himself and spun to face him the change in him was instant one moment he was staring reflectively down the track unhurried and calm the next he was in a flap of consternation and terror his eyes were wide with fright his lips worked convulsively alarmed chandler snapped whats the matter with you i the man swallowed and stared about him then his eyes returned to chandler he took a step put out a hand and said i then his expression changed again his hand dropped in a tone of friendly curiosity he said i asked you what you had on your head fall against a hot stove chandler was now thoroughly jumpy he didnt under stand what was going on but he understood that he didnt like it and he didnt like the subject of their conversation he snapped its a brand i got it for committing murder and rape all right oh the man nodded reflectively yeah i was possessed but they didnt believe me so they put this h on me it stands for hoaxer too bad the man returned to chandler and patted his shoulder why didnt they believe you because it happened in a pharmaceutical plant i dont know how it is where you come from buddy but where i livelivedthat sort of thing didnt happen in that kind of place only it does now look at this train the man smiled brightly you think the train is possessed i think the engineer is the man noddd and glanced impatiently toward the bridge again would that be so bad bad whereve you been the little man apologized i mean do all thewhat do you call them do all the cases of possession have to be wicked chandler took a deep breath he couldnt believe the little man was for real he could feel the short hairs at the back of his neck prickling erect something smelled wrong nobody asked questions like that he said weakly i never heard of any that werent did you yes maybe i did flared the man defensively why not nothing is evil its all what you make of it and i could imagine times when that sort of affair could be good i can imagine it carrying you up to the stars i can imagine it filling yur brain with a mind grand enough to crack your own i can his voice tapered off as he noticed chandlers popeyed stare i was only saying maybe he apologized hesitated seemed about to speak again and then turned and started off toward the head of the train at a dead run chandler stared after him he scratched the area of skin around the seared place on his forehead then turned and began to climb the mountain twenty yards uphill he stopped as though he had run into a brick wall he turned and looked down the tracks but the man was out of sight chandler stood staring down the empty line of crushed rock not seeing it there was a big question in his mind he was wondering just who he had been talking to or what by the time he reached the first shelving roadway he had put that particular puzzle away in the back of his mind he knocked on the first door he came to a great old threestorey house with well tended gardens half a minute passed there was no answer and no sound the air smelled warmly of honeysuckle and mown grass with wild onions chopped down by the blades of the mower it was pleasant or would have been in happier times he knocked again peremptorily and the door was opened at once evidently someone had been right inside listening a man stared at him stranger what do you want he was short plump with an extremely thick and unkempt beard it did not appear to have been grown for its own sake for where the facial hair could not be coaxed to grow his skin had the gross pits of old acne chandler said glibly good morning im working my way east i need something to eat and im willing to work for it the man withdrew leaving the upper half of the dutch door open as it looked in on only a vestibule it did not tell chandler much there was one curious thinga lath and cardboard sign shaped like an arc of a rainbow lettered welcome to orphalese he puzzled over it and dismissed it the entrance room apart from the sign had a knickknack shelf of japanese carved ivory and an oldfashioned umbrella rack but that added nothing to his knowledge he had already guessed that the owners of this home were well off also it had been recently painted so they were not demoralized as so much of the world had been demoralized by the coming of the possessors even the elaborate sculpturing of its hedges had been maintained the man came back and with him was a girl of fifteen or so she was tail slim and rather homely with a large jaw and an oval face guy hes not much to look at she said to the pockmarked man meggie shall i let him in he asked guy you might as well she shrugged staring at chandler with interest but not sympathy stranger come along said the man named guy and led him through a short hall into an enormous living room a room two storeys high with a tenfoot fireplace chandlers first thought was that he had stumbled in upon a wake the room was neatly laid out in rows of folding chairs more than half of them occupied he en tered from the side but all the occupants of the chairs were looking toward him he returned their stares he had had a good deal of practice lately in looking back at staring faces he reflected stranger go in said the man who had let him in nudging him and meet the people of orphalese chandler hardly heard him he had not expected any thing like this it was a meeting a daumier caricature of a thursday afternoon literary circle old men with faces like moons young women with faces like hags they were strained haggard and fearful and a surprising number of them showed some sort of physical defect a bandaged leg an arm in a sling or merely the marks of pain on the features stranger go in repeated the man and it was only then that chandler noticed the man was holding a pistol pointed at him chandler sat in the rear of the room watching there must be thousands of little colonies like this he reflected with the breakdown of longdistance communication the world had been atomized there was a real fear well justified of living in large groups for they too were lightning rods for possession the world was stumbling along but it was lame in all its members a planetary lobotomy had stolen from it its wisdom and plan if he reflected dryly it had ever had any but of course things were better in the old days the world had seemed on the brink of blowing itself up but at least it was by its own hand then came christmas it had happened at christmas and the first sign was on nationwide television the old president balding grave and plump was making a special address to the nation urging good will to men and please lets everyone remem ber to use artificial trees because of the fire danger in the event of hbomb raids in the middle of a sentence twenty million viewers had seen him stop look dazedly around and say in a breathless mumble what sounded like disht dvornyet itgt he had then picked up the bible on the desk before him and thrown it at the camera the last the televiewers had seen was the fluttering pages of the book growing larger as it crashed against the lens then a flicker and blinding shot of the studio lights as the cameraman jumped away and the instrument swiv eled to stare mindlessly upward twenty minutes later the president was dead as his secretary of health education and welfare hurrying with him back to the white house calmly took a hand grenade from a marine guard at the gate and blew the presidents party to fragments for the presidents seizure was only the first and most conspicuous disht dvornyet ilgt cia specialists were playing the tapes of the broadcast feverishly electronically cleaning the mumble and stir from the studio away from the words to try to learn first the language and second what the devil it meant but the president who ordered it was dead before the first reel spun and his successor was not quite sworn in when it became his time to die the ceremony was interrupted for an emergency call from the war room where a very nearly hysterical fourstar gener al was trying to explain why he had ordered the immediate firing of every live missile in his command against wash ington dc over five hundred missiles were involved in most of the sites the order was disobeyed but in six of them unfortu nately unquestioning discipline won out thus ending not only the swearing in the generals weeping explanation the spinning of tapes but also some two million lives in the district of columbia maryland virginia and through malfunctioning guidance relays on two missiles pennsylva nia and vermont but it was only the beginning these were the first cases of possession seen by the world in some five hundred years since the great casting out of devils of the middle ages a thousand more oc curred in the next few days a hundred in the next hours the timetable was made up out of scattered reports in the wireservice newsrooms while they still had facilities for spot coverage in any part of the world that lasted afmost a week they identified cases of possession by noon of the next day disregarding the dubious itemsthe van kee pitcher who leaped from the manhattan bridge he had brights disease the warden of san quentin who seated himself in the gas chamber and literally kicked the bucket did he

countless but before long before even the cia had finished the first play through of the tapes before their successors in the task identified disht dvornyet ilgt as a ukrainian dialect ren dering of my god it worksbefore all this one fact was already apparent there were many incidents scattered around the world but not one of them took place in russia itself warsaw was ablaze china pockmarked with blasts east berlin demolished along with its western sector in eight rounds fired from a us army nuclear cannon but the ussrhad not suffered at all as far as could be told by the prying eyes in orbit and that fact was reason enough for it to suffer very greatly very soon within minutes of this discovery what remained of the military strength of the western world was roaring through airless space toward the most likely targets of the east one unscathed missile base in alaska completed a full shoot seven missiles with fusion warheads the three american bases that survived at all in the mediterranean fired what they had even britain which had already watched the firetails of the american missiles departing on suicide missions managed to resurrect its own two proto type blue streaks from their racks where they had mold ered since the cancellation of the british missile program one of these museumpieces destroyed itself in launching but the other chugged painfully across the sky the tortoise following the flight of the hares it arrived a full halfhour after the newer hotter missiles it might as well not have bothered there was not much left to destroy it was fortunate for the communists that most of the western arsenal had already spent itself in suicide what was left wiped out moscow leningrad and nine other cities it was even fortunate for the whole world for this was the apocalypse they had dreaded every possible nu clear weapon committed but the circumstances were suchhasty orders often at once recalled confusion panicthat most were unfused many others merely tore great craters in the quickly healing surface of the sea the fallout was murderous but spotty and the conventional forces invading russia found nothing to fight the russians were as confused as they there were not many survivors of the very top brass and no one seemed to know just what had happened was the secretary of the cp ussr behind that terrible brief agony as he was dead before it was over there was no way to tell more than a quarter of a billion lives went into mushroomshaped clouds and nearly half of them were russian latvian tatar and kalmuck the peace commission squabbled for a month until the break down of a communications cut them off from their govern ments and each other and in that way for a time there was peace this was the sort of peace that was left thought chan dler looking around at the queer faces and queerer sur roundings the peace of medieval baronies cut off from the world untouched where the rain of fallout had passed by but hardly civilized any more even his own home town trying to take his life in a form of law reduced at last to torture and exile to cast him out was not the civilization he had grown up in but something new and ugly there was a great deal of talk he did not understand because he could not quite hear it though they looked at him then guy with the gun led him up to the front of the room they had constructed an improvised platform out of plywood panels resting on squat heavy boxes that looked like empty ammunition crates on the dais was a dentists chair bolted to the plywood and in the chair strapped in baby spotlights on steeltube frames glaring on her was a girl she looked at chandler with regretting eyes but did not speak stranger get up there said guy prodding him from behind and chandler took a plain wooden chair next to the girl people of orphalese cried the teenage cutie named meggie we have two more brands to save from the imps the men and women in the audience cackled or shrilled save them save them they all had a look of invisible uniforms chandler saw like baseball players in the lobby of a hotel or soldiers in a diner outside the gate of their post they were all of a type their type was something strange some were tall some short there were old fat lean and young among them but they all wore about them a look of glowing excitement muted by an aura of suffer ing and pain they wore in a word the look of bigots the bound girl was not one of them she might have been twenty years old or as much as thirty she might have been pretty it was hard to tell she wore no makeup her hair strung raggedly to her neck and her face was drawn into a tight lean line it was her eyes that were alive she saw chandler and she was sorry for him and he saw as he turned to look at her that she was manacled to the dentists chair people of orphalese chanted guy standing behind chandler with the muzzle of the gun against his neck the meeting of the orphalese selfpreservation society will now come to order there was an approving hungry murmur from the audience well people of orphalese guy went on in his sing song the agenda for the day is first the salvation of we orphalese on mcguires mountain au saved all of us saved rolled a murmur from the congregation a lean redheaded man bounded to the platform and fussed with the stand of spotlights turning one of them full on chandler people of orphalese as we are saved do i have your consent to pass on and proceed to the next order of business and then the second item of business is to welcome and bring to grace these two newly found and adopted souls the congregation shouted variously bring them to grace save them from the imps keep orphalese from the taint of the beast evidently guy was satisfied he nodded and became more chatty okay people of orphalese lets get down to it we got two new ones like i say their spirits have gone wandering on the wind or anyway one of them has and you all know the et cetera they have committed a wrong unto others and therefore unto themselves herself i mean course the other one could have a flame spirit in him too he stared severely at chandler boys keep an eye on him why dont you he said to two men in the front row surrendering his gun meggie you tell about the female one the teenaged girl stepped forward and said in a con versational tone but with modest pride people of orphlese well i was walking down the cut and i heard this car coming well i was pretty surprised you know i had to figure what to do you all know what the trouble is with cars the imps cried a woman of forty with a face like a catfish the girl nodded most probly well i mean peo ple of orpmese well i was by the switchback where we keep the chewyfreeze hid so i just waited till i saw it slowing down for the curveme out of sight you know and i rolled the chewyfreeze out nice and it caught the wheels right over she cried gleefully off the shoulder people of orphlese and into the ditch and over and i didnt give it a chance to bum i cut the switch and i had her i put a knife into her back just a little about a quarter of an inch maybe her pain was the breakin of the shell that enclosed her understanding like it says i figured she was all right then because she yelled but i brought her along that way then guy took care of her until we got the synod oh she remembered and her tongue staggered a little without purpose while he was putting it on didnt it guy the bearded man nodded grinning and lifted up the girls foot incredulously chan dler saw that it was bound tight with a threefoot length of barbed wire wound and twisted like a tourniquet the blood black and congealed around it he lifted his shocked eyes to meet the girls she only looked at him with pity and understanding guy patted the foot and let it go i didnt have any more cclamps people of orphalese he apologized but it looks all right at that well lets see we got to make up our minds about these two i guessno wait he held up his hand as a murmur began first thing is we ought to read a verse or two he opened a purplebound volume at random stared at a page for a moment moving his lips and then read some of you say it is the north wind who has woven the clothes we wear and i say ay it was the north wind but shame was his loom and the softening of the sinews was his thread and when his work was done he laughed in the forest gently he closed the book looking thoughtfully at the wall at the back of the room he scratched his head well people of orphalese he said slowly theyre laughing in the forest all right i guarantee but weve got one here that may be honest in the flesh probably is though she was a thief in the spirit right well do we take her in or reject her people of orphalese the audience muttered to itself and then began to call out accept oh bring in the brand accept and drive out the imp fine said the teenager rubbing her hands and look ing at the bearded man guy let her go he began to release her from the chair you girl stranger whats your name the girl said faintly ellen braisted meggie my name is ellen braisted corrected the teenager always say the name of the person youre talkin to in orphlese that way we know its you talkin not a flame spirit or wanderer okay go sit down ellen limped wordlessly down into the audience oh and peo ple of orphlese said meggie the cars still there if we need it for anything it didnt burn guy you go on with this other fellow guy stroked his beard and assessed chandler looking him over carefully okay he said people of orphalese the third order of business is to welcome or reject this other brand saved from the imps as may be your pleas ure chandler sat up straighter now that all of them were looking at him again but it wasnt quite his turn at that because there was an interruption guy never finished from the valley far below there was a sudden mighty thunder rolling among the mountains the windows blew in with a crystalline crash the room erupted into confusion the audience leaping from their seats running to the broad windows guy and the teenage girl seizing rifles everyone in motion at once chandler straightened then sat down again the red headed man guarding him was looking away it would be quite possible to grab his gun run get away from these maniacs yet he had nowhere to go they might be crazy but they seemed to have organization they seemed in fact to have worked out on whatever crazed foundation of philosophy some practical methods for coping with possession he decided to stay wait and see and at once he found himself leaping for the gun no chandler didnt find himself attacking the red headed man he found his body doing it chandler had nothing to do with it it was the helpless compulsion he had felt before that had nearly cost him his life his body active and urgent and his mind completely cut off from it he felt his own muscles move in ways he had not planned observed himself leap forward felt his own fist strike at the back of the redheaded mans ear the man went spinning the gun went flying chandlers body leaped after it with chandler a prisoner in his own brain watching horrified and helpless and he had the gun he caught it in the hand that was his own hand though someone else was moving it he raised it and half turned he was suddenly conscious of a fusillade of gunfire from the roof and a scattered echo of guns all round the outside of the house part of um was surprised another alien part was not he started to shoot the teenaged girl in the back of the head silently shouting no his fingers never pulled the trigger he caught a seconds glimpse of someone just beside him whirled and saw the girl ellen braisted limping swiftly toward him with her barbedwire amulet loose and catching at her feet in her hands was an axehandle club caught up from somewhere she struck at chandlers head with a face like an eagles impersonal and determined the blow caught him and dazed him and from behind some one else struck him with something else he went down he heard shouts and firing but he was stunned he felt himself dragged and dropped he saw a cloudy misty girls face hanging over him it receded and returned then a frightful blistering pain in his hand startled him back into full consciousness it was the girl ellen still there leaning over him and oddly weeping and the pain in his hand was the burning flame of a kitchen match ellen was doing it his wrist in one hand a burning match held to it with the other chandler yelled hoarsely jerking his hand away she dropped the match and jumped up stepping on the flame and watching him she had a butcher knife that had been caught between her elbow and her body while she burned him now she put her hand on the knife waiting does it hurt she demanded tautly chandler howled with incredulity and rage god damn it yes what did you expect i expected it to hurt she agreed she watched him for a moment more and then for the first time since he had seen her she smiled it was a small smile but a beginning a fusillade of shots from outside wiped it away at once sorry she said i had to do that please trust me why did you have to burn my hand house rules she said keeps the flamespirits out you know they dont like pain she took her hand off the knife warily it still hurts doesnt it it still does yes nodded chandler bitterly and she lost interest in him and got up looking about the room three of the orphalese were dead or seemed to be from the casual poses in which they lay draped across a chair on the floor some of the others miglit have been freshly wounded though it was hard to tell the casualties from the others in view of the orphalese custom of selfinflicted pain there was still firing going on outside and overhead and a shootinggallery smell of burnt powder in the air the girl ellen braisted limped back with the butcher knife held carelessly in one hand she was followed by the teenager who wore a smile of triumphand chandler noticed for the first time a sort of tourniquet of barbed wire on her left forearm the flesh puffy red around it whopped em she said with glee and pointed a rifle at chandler ellen braisted said oh hemeggie i mean hes all right she pointed at his burned palm meg approached him with competent care the rifle resting on her good right forearm and aimed at him as she examined his bum she pursed her lips and looked at his face all right ellen i guess hes clean but you want to bum em deepern that never pays to go easy just means well have to do something else to im tomorrow the hell you will thought chandler and all but said it but reason stopped him in rome he would have to do roman deeds besides maybe their ideas worked besides he had until tomorrow to make up his mind about what he wanted to do ellen show him around ordered the teenager i got no time myself shoosh almost got us that time ellen got to be more careful cause the whitehanded arent clean you know she strutted away the rifle at trail she seemed to be enjoying herself very much the name of the girl in the barbedwire anklet was ellen braisted she came from lehigh county pennsylva nia and chandlers first wonder was what she was doing nearly three thousand miles from home nobody liked to travel much these days one place was as bad as another except that in the place where you were known you could perhaps count on friends and as a stranger you were probably fair game anywhere else of course there was one likely reason for travel chandlers own reason she didnt like to talk about it that was clear but that was the reason she had been possessed when the teen ager trapped her car the day before she had been the tool of anothers will she had had a dozen submachine guns in the trunk and she had meant to deliver them to a party of hunters in a valley just south of mcguires mountain chandler said with some effort i must have been ellen i must have been she corrected ellen i must have been possessed too just now when i grabbed the gun of course first time he shook his head for some reason the brand on his forehead began to throb well then you know look out here now they were at the great pier windows that looked out over the valley down below was the river an arc of the railroad tracks the wooded mountainside he had scaled over there chandler she was pointing to the railroad bridge wispy gray smoke drifted off southward toward the stream the freight train chandler had ridden on had been stopped all that time in the middle of the bridge the explosion that blew out their windows had occurred when another train plowed into itevidently at high speed it seemed that one of the trains had carried some sort of chemicals the bridge was a twisted mess a diversion chandler said ellen braisted they wanted us looking that way then they attacked from up the mountain who ellen looked surprised the men that crashed the trains if they are men the ones who possessed me and youand the hunters they dont like these or phalese i think maybe theyre a little afraid of them i think the orphalese have a pretty good idea of how to fight them chandler felt a sudden flash of sensation along his nerves for a moment he thought he had been possessed again and then he knew it for what it was it was hope ellen i never thought of fighting them i thought that was given up two years ago so maybe you agree with me maybe you think its worth while sticking with the orphalese chandler allowed himself the contemplation of what hope meant to find someone in this world who had a plan whatever the plan was even if it was a bad plan he didnt think specifically of himself or the brand on his forehead or the memory of the body of his wife what he thought of was the prospect of thwartingnot even de feating merely hampering or annoying was enoughthe imps the flame creatures the pythons devils incubi or demons who had destroyed a world he had thought very fair if theyll have me he said ill stick with them all right where do i go to join it was not hard to join at all meg chattily informed him that he was already practical ly a member chandler we got to watch everybody strange you know see why dont you might have a flame spirit in em no fault of theirs but look how they could mess us up but now we know you dont sowhat do you mean how do we know cause you did have one when you busted loose in there i dont get it said chandler lost youre saying that you know i dont have a uh flame spirit now because i did have one then chandler youll catch on said meggie kindly sup pressing a smile cant have two at a time you see so if youre the fella you are now and the same fella you were before you got to be honestintheflesh yourself chandler nodded thoughtfully anyway chandler the girl added were going to take time off to eat now you just make yourself at home soons we start the synod up again well see bout letting you in ellen braisted asked can i help with the food meggie looked at her patiently and she corrected herself meggie can i help with the food not this time ellen just stay out of the way a little ellen took chandlers arm and led him to a sunporch all over the house the orphalese were putting themselves back together again after the fight they didnt seem terribly upset neither by their wounds nor their losses they had chandler thought a collective identity the survival of the community was more impor tant than any incidental damage to its members after three years of increasing alienation from a life he could not understand or accept chandler found that trait admirable he liked their style sorry about your hand said ellen braisted he had not realized that he was rubbing it oh thats all right i understand why you had to do it come over here she opened a chest of firstaid supplies and took out cotton gauze let me put this on it you dont want it to stop hurtingthats the whole idea but you dont want it getting infected whats that busi ness on your head he touched the scar with his free hand he had almost forgotten it he found it easy to tell her about it when he was through she patted his arm tough world you say you were married yes he told her about margot and about margots death she nodded her face drawn i was married too chandler she said after a moment lost my husband two years ago murdered well she said thoughtfully depends on what you mean by that it was his own hand that did it got up one morning went into the kitchen came back looking like dont knowuke his own evil nature you know those cartoons the good you in white the bad you in black whispering suggestions into your ear he looked the bad him and he cut his throat with a breadknife oh god the words were jerked out of him did hedidnt he say anything yes chandler he did but i dont want to tell you what because it was dirty and awful there was a smell of coffee percolating from inside the house and sounds of dishes and silverware lets sit down over here said chandler pointing to a chained swing that looked out over the darkening valley i guess your husband was possessed or as they say here he had a flame spirit ellen ellen i mean he corrected chandler she said thoughtfully well i dont quite go along with them on that ive had quite a lot of experience with them ever since my husbandever since two years ago they used me for what chandler demanded startled the concept of being used by the things was new and peculiarly frightening it was bad enough to view them as strange diabolic elements out of a hostile universe to give them purpose was terrifying you name it chandler said the girl i did it ive been practically all over the world in two years because they used me for a messenger andother things they used me for all sorts of things chandler she said very temperately and some of them i dont intend to discuss of course of course then she brightened but it wasnt all bad you wouldnt believe some of the things flew a jet airplane to lisbon once chandler would you believe it and as a matter of fact i dont even know how to drive a car very well when im myself i mean ive been in russia and england i think i was in africa once although nobody ever mentioned the name and i wasnt sure just now i came up from san diego driving a great big truck and well its been interesting but i dont agree with the flame spirit idea they arent ghosts or witches they arent creatures from outer space anyway one of them is a man named brad fenell chandlers heels dropped to the floor the swing stopped with a clatter of its chains a man ellen nodded soberly or he was at one time anyway she corrected after a moment i used to go out with him when he lived next door to me in catasauqua but cried chandler what how how could ho she shook her head now youre asking hard ques tions chandler but i know this onethingwas brad pencil brad asked me to marry him and when i told him i wouldnt hesaid those words i heard from my hus band just before he killed himself she stood up and turned toward the house and now she said meggies calling us to eat i hope i havent spoiled your appetite all through the meal chandler was preoccupied he had to be spoken to twice before he responded and then he had to be reminded to address the orphalese by name he was trying to understand what ellen had told him and he was not succeeding real human beings the monsters who had done such things it was he thought somberly more incredible to think of them as men than as demons from the pits of hell the interrupted meeting was resumed after the place had been tidied up the community had counted its losses and buried its dead there had been four of the attacking hunters even without their submachine guns they had succeeded in killing eight orphalese but it was not all loss to the orphalese because two of the hunters were still alive though wounded and under the rules of this chessboard the captured enemy became a friend guy had suffered a broken jaw in the scuffle and another man presided a fat youth who favored a band aged leg he limped to his feet grimacing and patting his leg orphalese and brothers he said we have lost friends but we have won a test praise the prophet we will be spared to win again and to drive the imps of fire out of our world meggie you going to tie these folks up the girl proudly ordered one of the hunters into the spotlighted dentists chair another into a wing chair that was hastily moved onto the platform the men were bleed ing and hurt but they had clearly been abandoned by their possessors they watched the orphalese with puzzle ment and fear walter theyre okay now meg reported as others finished tying up the hunters oh wait a minute she advanced on chandler chandler im sorry you sit down there hear chandler suffered himself to be bound to a camp chair on the platform and walter took a drink of wine and opened the ornate book that was before him on the rostrum meg thanks guy i hope i do this as good as you do let me read you a little lets see he put on his glasses and read much in you is still man and much in you is not yet man but a shapeless pigmy that walks asleep in the mist searching for its own awakening he closed the book loojced with satisfaction at guy and said do you understand that new friends they are t ee words of the prophet who men call kahlil gibran foi the benefit of the new folks i ought to say that he died this fleshly life quite a good number of years ago but his vision was unclouded like we say we are the sinews that batter the flame spirits but he is our soul there was an antfphonal murmur from the audience and walter flipped the pages again rapidly obviously looking for a familiar passage people of orphalese here we are now thiss what he says what is this that has torn our world apart the prophet says it is life in quest of life inbodies that fear the grave now honestly nothing could be clearer than that people of orphalese and friends we got some thing taking possession of us see what is it well he says here people of orphalese and friends it is a flame spirit in you ever gathering more of itself now what the heck nobody can blame us for what a flame spirit in us does so the first thing we got to learn friendsand people of orphaleseis we arent to blame and the second thing is we are to blame he turned and grinned at chandler kindly while the chorus of responses came from the room like here he said people of orphalese the prophet says everybody is guilty the murdered is not unaccountable for his own murder and the robbed is not blameless in being robbed the righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked and the whitehanded is not clean in the doings of the felon you see what hes getting at we all got to take the responsibility for everythingand that means we got to sufferbut we dont have to worry about any special things we did when some flame spirit or wanderer like took us over but we do have to suffer people of orphalese his expression became grim our beloved founder guy whos sitting there doing a little extra suffering now was favored enough to understand these things in the very beginning when he himself was seized by these imps and it is all in this book like it says your pain is selfchosen it is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self ponder on that people of orphaleseand friends no i mean really ponder he explained glancing at the bound friends on the platform we always do that for a minute ada there will play us some music so we can ponder chandler shifted uncomfortably while an old woman crippled by arthritis began fumbling a tune out of an electric organ the bum ellen braisted had given him was beginning to hurt badly if only these people were not such obvious nuts he thought he would feel a lot better about casting his lot in with them but maybe it took lunatics to do the job sane people hadnt accomplished much and anyway he had very little choice ada thats enough ordered the fat youth meg come on up here people of orphalese now you can listen again while meg explains to the new folks how all this got started seeing guys in no condition to do it the teenager marched up to the platform and took the paraderest position learned in some high school debating societyin the days when there were debating societies and high schools ladies and gentlemen well lets start at the beginning guy tells this bettern i do of course but i guess i remember it all pretty well too i ought to i was in on it and all i she grimaced and said well anyway ladies and gentlemenpeople of orphalesethe way guy organized this orphalese selfprotection society was like walter says he was possessed the only difference between guy and you and me was that he knew what to do about it because he read the book you see not that that helped him at first when he was took over he was really seized yes people of orphlese he was taken and while his whole soul and brain and body was under the influence of some foul wanderer fiend from hell he did things tha ladies and gentlemen of orphlese i wouldnt want to tell you he was a harp in the hand of the mighty as it says couldnt help it not however much he tried only while he was doingthe thingshe happened to catch his hand in a gas flame and well you can see it was pretty bad with a deprecatory smile guy held up a twisted hand and do you know he was free of his imp right then and there now guy is a scientist people of orphlese he worked for the telephone company and he not only had that training in the company school but he had read the book yon see and he put two and two together oh and hes my uncle of course im proud of him ive alwavs loved him and even when hewhen he was not one with himself you know when he was doing those terrible things to me i knew it wasnt uncle guy that was doing them but something else i didnt know what though and when he told me he had figured out the basic rule i went along with him every bit i knew guy wasnt wrong and what he said was from scripture imps fear pain so we got to love it that one i know by heart all right could you keep your heart from wonder at the daily miracles of your life your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy thats what it savs ri kt so thats why we got to hurt ourselves people of ornhlpse and new brothersbecause the wanderers dont like it when we hurt and they leave us alone simples that well the girls face stiffened momentarilyi knew wasnt going to be seized so guy and i got else thats the other girl hed been doing things to and we knew she wasnt going to be taken either not if the imps feared pain like guy said because she said solemnly i want to tell you guy hurt us pretty bad and then we came out here and found this place and ever since then weve been adding brothers and sisters its been slow of course because not many people come this way any more and weve had to kill a lot yes we have sometimes the possessed just cant be saved but abruptly her face changed suddenly alert her face years older she glanced around the room then she relaxed and screamed guy leaped up hoarsely his voice almost inarticulate as he tried to talk with his broken jaw he cried wha whas matter meg uncle guy she wailed she plunged off the platform and flung herself into his arms crying hysterically who she sobbed i could feel it they took me guy you promised me they couldnt he shook his head dazed staring at her as though she were indeed possessedstill possessed and telling him some fearful great lie to destroy his hopes he seemed unable to comprehend what she had said one of the hunters bellowed in stark fear for gods sake untie us give us a chance anyway chandler yelled agreement in one split second everyone in the room had been transmut ed by terror into something less than human no one seemed capable of any action slowly the plump youth who had presided moved over to the hunter bound in the dentists chair and began to fumble blindly at the knots ellen braisted dropped her head into her hands and began to shake the cruelty of the moment was that they had all tasted hope chandler writhed wildly against his ropes his mind racing out of control the world had become a hell for everyone but a bearable hell until the promise of a chance to end it gave them a full sight of what their lives had been now that that was dashed they were far worse off than before walter finished with the hunter and lethargically began to pick at chandlers bonds his face was slack and unseeing then it too changed the plump youth stood up sharply glanced about and walked off the platform ellen braisted raised her face from her hands and her eyes streaming quietly stood up and followed the old lady with the arthritis aboutfaced and limped with them chandler stared puzzled and then comprehended they were marching toward the corner of the room where the rifles were stacked possessed chandler bel lowed the words tasting of acid as they ripped out of his throat stop them youguylook he flailed wildly at his loosened bonds lunged tottered and toppled chair and all crashingly off the platform the three possessed ones did not need to hurry they had all the time in the world they were already reaching out for the rifles when chandler shouted economically they turned raising the butts to their shoulders and began to fire at the orphalese it was a queerly frightening sight to see the arthritic organist with a face like a relaxed executioner take quick aim at guy and with a thirty thirty shell blow his throat out three shots and the nearest three of the congregation were dead three more and others went down while the remainder turned and tried to run it was like a slaughter of vermin they never had a chance when every orphalese except themselves was down on the floor dead wounded or like chandler overlooked the arthritic lady took careful aim at ellen braisted and the plump youth and shot them neatly in the temples they didnt try to prevent her with expressions that seemed almost impatient they presented their profiles to her aim then the arthritic lady glanced leisurely about fired into the stomach of a wounded man who was trying to rise reloaded her rifle for insurance and began to search the bodies of the nearest dead she was looking for matches when she found them she tugged weakly at the uphol stery on a couch swore and began methodically to rip and crumple pages out of kahlil gibran when she had a heap of loose papers piled against the dais she pitched the remainder of the book out of the window knelt and ignited the crumpled heap she stood watching the fire her expression angry and impatient tapping her foot the crumpled pages burned briskly before they died the wooden dais was beginning to catch laboriously the old lady toted folding chairs to pile on the blaze until it was roaring handsomely she watched it for several minutes until it was a great orange pillar of fire sweeping to the ceiling until the drapes on the wall behind were burning and the platform was a holocaust until the noise of crackling flame and the beginning of plaster falling from the high ceiling proved that there was no likelihood of the fire going out and indeed no way to put it out without a complete fire department on the scene at once the old ladys expression cleared she nodded to herself she then put the muzzle of the rifle in her mouth and with her thumb pulled the trigger that blew the top of her head off the body fell into the flames but it was by then already dead chandler had not been shot but he was very near to roasting walter had released one hand and while the possessed womans attention was elsewhere he had worked on the other knots when chandler saw her commit suicide he redoubled his efforts it was incredible to him that his life had been saved and he knew that if he escaped the flames he still had nothing to live forthat blasted brief hope had bro ken his spiritbut his fingers had a will of their own he lay there struggling while great black clouds of smoke orangepainted from the flames gathered under the high ceiling while the thunder of falling lumps of plaster sounded like a child heaving volumes of the encyclopedia britannica down a flight of stairs while the heat and shortage of oxygen made um breathe in violent spasms then he cried out sharply and stumbled to his feet it was only a matter of moments before he was out of the house but it was very nearly not time enough behind him was a great sustained crash he thought it must have been the furniture on the upper floor toppling through the burnedout ceiling of the hall he turned and looked it was dark and now every window on the side of the house facing him was lighted it was as though some mad householder had decided to equip his rooms only with orange lights that flickered and tossed for a second chandler thought there were still living people in the roomsshapes moved and cavorted at the windows as though they were gathering up possessions or waving wildly for help but it was only the drapes aflame thrown about in the fierce heat chandler sighed and turned away pain was not a sure defense after all evidently it was only an annoyance to the posses sors whoever or whatever they might be as soon as they had become suspicious they had exerted themselves and destroyed the orphalese he listened and looked about but no one else moved he had not expected anyone he had been sure that he was the only survivor he began to walk down the hill toward the wrecked railway bridge turning only when a roar told him that the roof of the house had fallen in a tulip of flame a hundred feet tall rose above the standing walls and above that a shower of floating redorange sparks heatborne drifting up and away and beginning to settle all over the moun tainside many were still red when they landed a few still flaming it was a distinct risk that the trees would begin to bum and then he would be in fresh danger but so great was his stupor that he did not even hurry by a plowed field he flung himself to the ground he could go no farther because he had nowhere to go he had had two homes and he had been driven from both of them he had had hope twice and twice he had been damned he lay on his back with the burning house mumbling and crackling in the distance and stared up at the orangelit tops of the trees and past them the stars over his left shoulder deneb chased vega across the sky toward his feet something moved between the bright rosy dot that was antares and another the same brightness and huemars he spent several moments wondering if mars were in that part of the heavens then he looked again for the tiny moving point that had crossed the claws of the scorpion but it was gone a satellite maybe although there were few of them left that the naked eye could hope to see and there would never be any more because the sort of accumulated wealth of nations that threw rockets into the sky was forever spent it was probably an air plane he thought drowsily and drifted off to sleep without realizing how remote even that possibility had become he woke up to find that he was getting to his feet once again an interloper tenanted his brain he tried to interfere although he knew how useless it was but his own neck muscles turned his head from side to side his own eyes looked this way and that his own hand reached down for a dead branch that lay on the ground then hesitated and withdrew his body stood motionless for a second the lips moving the larynx mumbling to itself he could almost hear words chandler felt like a fly in amber imprisoned in his own brainbox he was not surprised when his legs moved to carry him back toward the de stroyed building now a fakirs bed of whitehot coals with brush fires spattered around it he thought he knew why it seemed very likely that what possessor had him was a sort of cleanup squad tidying up the loose ends of the slaughter he expected that his bodys errand was to de stroy itself and thus him as all the others in the group ol the orphalese had been destroyed chandlers body carried him rapidly toward the house now and then it paused and glanced about it seemed to be weighing some shortcut in its errand but always it resumed its climb chandler could sympathize with it in a way he still felt every pain from burn brand and wound as they neared the embers of the building the heat it threw off intensified them all he could not be a comfortable body to inhabit for long he was almost sympathetic because his tenant could not find a convenient weapon with which to fulfill his purpose when it seemed they could get no closer without the skin of his face crackling and bursting into flame his body halted chandler could feel his muscles gathering for what would be the final leap into the autodafe his feet took a short stepand slipped his body stumbled and recovered itself his mouth swore thickly in a language he did not know then his body hesitated glanced at the ground paused again and bent down it had tripped on a book it picked the book up and chandler saw that it was the ripped orphalese copy of gibrans the prophet chandlers body stood poised for a moment in an attitude of thought then it sat down in the play of heat from the coals it was a moment before chandler realized he was free he tested his legs they worked he got up turned and began to walk away he had traveled no more than a few yards when he stumbled slightly as though shifting gears and felt the tenant in his mind again he continued to walk away from the building down toward the road once his arm raised the book he still carried and his eyes glanced down as if for reassurance that it was the same book that was the only clue he was given as to what had happened and it was not much it was as though his occupying power whatever it was had gonesomewhereto think things over perhaps to ask a question of an unimaginable companion and then re turned with an altered purpose as time passed chandler began to receive additional clues but he was in little shape to fit them together for his body was near exhaustion he walked to the road and waited rigid until a pickup truck came bouncing along he hailed it his arms making a sign he did not under stand and when it stopped he addressed the driver in a language he did not speak shto said the driver a somberfaced mexican in dungarees ja nie jestem ruska czego pragmesh czy ty jedziesz to los angeles asked chandlers mouth nyef acapuico chandlers voice argued wes na los angeles nyet the voices droned on chandler lost interest in the argument and was only relieved when it seemed some how to be settled and he was herded into the back of the truck the somber mexican locked him in he felt the truck begin to move his tenant left him and he was at once asleep he woke long enough to find himself standmg in the mist of early dawn at a crossroads in a few minutes another car came by and his voice talked earnestly with the driver for a moment chandler got in was released slept again and woke to find himself free and abandoned sprawled across the back seat of the car which was parked in front of a building marked los angeles interna tional airport chandler got out of the car and strolled around stretching he realized he was very hungry no one was in sight the field showed clear signs of having been through the same sort of destruction that had visited every major communications facility in the world part of the building before him was smashed flat and showed signs of having been burned he saw projecting aluminum members twisted and scorched but still visible aircraft parts apparently a transport had crashed into the building burnedout cars littered the parking lot and what had once been a green lawn they seemed to have been bulldozed out of the way but not an inch farther than was necessary to clear the approach roads to his right as he stared out onto the field was a strangelooking construction on three legs several storeys high it did not seem to serve any useful purpose perhaps it had been a sort of luxury restaurant at one time but now it too was burned out and glassless in its windows the field itself was swept bare except for two or three parked planes in the bays but he could see wrecked transports lining the approach strips all in all los ange les international airport appeared to be serviceable but only just he wondered where all the people were distant truck noises answered part of the question an army sixbysix came bumping across a bridge that led from the takeoff strips to this parking area of the airport five men got out next to one of the ships they glanced at him but did not speak as they began loading crates of some sort of goods from the truck into the aircraft a four engine sweptwing jet of what looked to chandler like an obsolete model perhaps it was one of the early boeings there hadnt been many of those in use at the time the troubles began too big and fast for short hops too slow to compete over long distances but of course with all the destruction and with no new aircraft being built anywhere in the world any more no doubt they were as good as could be found the truckmen did not seem to be possessed they worked with the normal amount of gronting and swearing pausing to wipe sweat away or to scratch an itch they showed neither the intense malevolent concentration nor the wideeyed idiot curiosity of those whose bodies were no longer their own chandler settled the woolen cap over the brand on his forehead to avoid unpleasantness and drifted over toward them they stopped work and regarded him one of them said something to another who nodded and walked toward chandler what do you want he demanded warily i dont know i was going to ask you the same ques tion i guess the man scowled didnt your exec tell you what to do my what the man paused scratched and shook his head well stay away from us this is an important shipment see i guess youre all right or you couldntve got past the guards but i dont want you messing us up got enough trouble already i dont know why he said in the tones of an old grievance we cant get the execs to let us know when theyre going to bring somebody in it wouldnt hurt them now here we got to load and fuel this ship and for all i know youve got half a ton of junk around some where that youre going to load onto it how do i know how much fuel itll take no weather naturally so if theres headwinds itll take full tanks but it theres extra cargo i the only cargo i brought with me that i can think of is a book said chandler weighs maybe a pound you think im supposed to get on that plane the man grunted noncommittally all right suit yourself listen is there any place i can get something to eat the man considered well i guess we can spare you a sandwich but you wait here ill bring it to you he went back to the truck a moment later one of the others brought chandler two cold hamburgers wrapped in wax paper but would answer no questions chandler ate every crumb sought and found a wash room in the wrecked building came out again and sat in the sun watching the loading crew he had become quite a fatalist it did not seem that it was intended he should die immediately so he might as well live there were large gaps in his understanding but it seemed clear to chandler that these men though not pos sessed were in some way working for the possessors it was a distasteful concept but on second thought it had reassuring elements it was evidence that whatever the execs were they were very possibly human beingsor if not precisely human at least they shared the human trait of working by some sort of organized effort toward some sort of a goal it was the first nonrandom phe nomenon he had seen in connection with the possessors barring the shortterm tactical matters of mass slaughter and destruction it made him feelwhat he tried at once to suppress for he feared another destroying frustration a touch of hope the men finished their work but did not leave nor did they approach chandler but sat in the shade of their truck waiting for something he drowsed and was awak ened by a distant sputter of a singleengined aerocoupe that hopped across the building behind him turned sharp ly and came down with a brisk little run in the parking bay itself from one side the pilot climbed down and from the other two men lifted with great care a wooden crate small but apparently heavy they stowed it in the jet while the pilot stood watching then the pilot and one of the other men got into the crew compartment chandler could not be sure but he had the impression that the truckman who entered the plane was no longer his own master his movements seemed more sure and confident but above all it was the mute angry eyes with which his fellows regarded him that gave chandler grounds for sus picion he had no time to worry about that for in the same breath he felt himself occupied once more he did not rise his own voice said to him you votever you name you fellow vit de book you go get de book verever you pud it and get on dat ship dere you see his eyes turned toward the waiting aircraft and dont forget de book he was released i wont he said automatically and then realized that there was no longer anyone there to hear his answer chandler retrieved the gibran volume from where he had tossed it turned and leaped out of the way another truck was racing toward them gears racketing as the driver expertly downshifted and brought it to a halt with a hiss of airbrakes chandler stared at the driver open mouthed the tenwheeler was being driven by a girl of about fourteen she turned and shouted over her shoulder into the back of the truck opened the door of the cab and jumped out the side door of the truck swung open a girl of about eleven stood there behind her a young boy in a scout uniform they hopped to the ground and were followed by a dozen more and another dozen and more at least fifty children were piling out of that truck some were as young as ten some as old as the girl driver they were mixed boys and girls about half and half there were japanese and negroes mexicans and blueeyed blonds they formed into a ragged line and marched up the wheeled steps into the jet with a birdtwittering like the sound of a school bus on the way home chandler followed them up the steps and turned to the loading crew standing by they neither looked at him nor spoke inside the ship the children were larking and shout ing about the rows of seats whats going on chandler asked shut up and get in none of the men were looking at him he couldnt even tell which one had spoken all had the worried angry helpless expressions on their faces come on look cant you at least tell me where were going get in but one of them looked at him at last for just a moment then raised an arm and pointed he pointed west out toward the pacific and to ten million square miles of nearly empty sea no lighted sign ordered fastening seat belts no steward ess handed herself down the aisle between the seats to check on cigarettes the loading crew slammed down the door from the outside and shouted through it for chan dler to dog it down pilot and copilot were aboard al ready but the door to their compartment was locked and chandler never saw them as he was levering down the latches that held the door the plane started its engines blipped them once wobbled over to a taxi strip and took off just like that chandler half fell into a seat and held on the children shouted and sang bouncing around the seats pointing out the wrecked buildings of downtown los angeles as they slid by a few hundred feet under their wings sit down chandler shouted all of you youll get your necks broken but it was useless they didnt refuse to obey him they simply didnt hear the takeoff was quicker and more violent than any commercial flight they rock eted up at full power there would be no complaints about the noise from householders below turned tightly in a bank that threw the children laughing and shouting into each other in heaps and leveled off over the pacific chandler felt his ears popping he got up holding on to the back of the seat across the aisle it had been a long time since he had been in an airplane for a moment he thought he might be airsick but the moment passed the children had no such worries they were acting like a class trip as the plane headed into the sun he counted and discovered there were fiftytwo of the children they were all around him squeezing past in the aisle calling to each other but they didnt speak directly to him nor he to them they were in the coachsection of the plane chandler explored the connecting door to the first class compartment was closed but it was only fabric on a skeleton of metal rods chandler did not debate the advis ability of breaking his way in he just kicked it open and squeezed through while the children watched him and laughed and whispered to each other most of the first class seats had been removed a thin scatter of crates and boxes were strapped to the floor in the lounge section the divans were still in place though and chandler cast himself down on one and closed his eyes he thought that it would be very easy to weep for ellen braisted in a couple of hours she had come very close to him for that matter he thought turning his head to the back of the divan the orphalese were worth mourning too crazy of course a kinder term would be cultist but out of their oddness had come an attempt to organize a life on a plan that worked worked too wellfor beyond doubt the success of their defenses against the flame spirits was what had doomed them the destruction of orphalese was no lunatic caprice it had been planned and methodically carried out by a concerted effort involving at least a dozen at least a dozen what if ellen braisted were to be believed human beings if a person wanted something to weep about thought chandler the thought that it was human beings who had done all this was cause for tears enough he slept in spite of everything he dropped off and did not wake for at least two or three hours until the noise of the children woke him he stretched and sat up feeling unutterably weary neither terror nor worry could stimulate him any more he had reached that point of emotional exhaustion when the sudden thunder of shellfire or the unwarned banzai charge has lost its power to pump adrenalin into the blood the glands were dry he stared without emotion at the children standing before him mister cried one of them were hungry he remembered having seen the boy before getting out of the truck in his boy scout uniform a child of about twelve dark and darkeyed yes said chandler im hungry too he wished they were not therewished they werent on the plane at all chandler was not prepared to load his fragile con fidence with the responsibility for fiftytwo children not when he could think of no way to take care even of himself as a delaying tactic he asked whered all of you come from but the boy would not be swerved st rose of lima thats a school out venice way do you know if theres anything to eat chandler shook his head heavily i doubt it he could not help trying to find something to discharge his responsibility though he added we ought to be landing pretty soon probably theyll feed you then the boy nodded accepting the word of the adult where we going mister china chandler almost laughed but it might just be china he thought and admitted im not entirely sure it might be hawaii hawaii cried the teenage girl behind him keen say theres surfing in hawaii right mister chandler looked at her although he couldnt be sure he thought she was the one who had been driving the truck and issuing the orders but evidently the experience of being occupied had not left her with any extra information he chose his words with care as a matter of fact thats where surfing was invented i think hey thats great but really she added were awful ly hungry chandler roused himself well lets take a look he said he had no real hope of finding food but anything was better than doing nothing while the children stood there looking at him just across the aisle was the flight kitchen it contained as a matter of fact a great deal of food most of it was useless in stacked trays in the warming ovens so thoroughly decayed that it hardly even smeued any more but there were also little packages of crackers cheeses jellies macadamia nuts and cigarettes real cigarettes factory made chandler put the scout in charge of handing out the rations and with trembling fingers lit a cigarette it was dried out with age but it was delicious before he did anything else he filled his pockets with the little cardboard packs then he made himself some instant coffee with cold water opened a can of the nuts and abandoned himself to his fate the children were far braver than he at first chandler thought it was merely the ignorance of youth but he was wrong they knew as much of what was ahead as he didknew at least on what summons they were trav eling and how vile some of the creatures that summoned them could be they had seen it happen in their own school they almost reassured him with their careless pleasures in the food and the excitement of flying until the hiss of the jets changed key and chandler realized his ears were popping again outside the windows it was almost sunset again some of the children had been asleep in the reclining seats others talking or playing with the empty cups and boxes of their feast but they all waked and stared and comment ed it is hawaii chortled the girl surfer right mr chandler i mean look at those combers i think sonear as i can tell from the flying time he raised his voice all of you sit down fasten the seat belts surprisingly they obeyed the horizon dipped below the wingtip and straightened again and there was a chorus of yells as they beheld land chandler never saw the airfield only water then beach then water again and some buildings then the plane staggered slowedtrees appeared underneath them and to the sidesthe wheels touched with a squeal and a jolt and there was a roar of jets as the clamshells deflected their thrust forward to slow the plane down as the plane stopped chandler reached to unbuckle his seat beltand found himself once more possessed his body strained to rise surged against the belt and fell back his lips exclaimed something irritable in a language he did not understand his hands went back to fumble with the buckle the girl surfer rose stiffly and said all right children stay together now come with me she glanced incurious ly at chandler and opened the door the movable steps were there already and the children filed out chandlers body mumbling to itself got the belt open picked up the book and waited impatiently for the children to get out of the way chandler was conscious of a horde of men off to one side pushing steps toward the other door but he could not turn his head to look as he descended the steps out of the comer of his eye he saw the boy scout look toward him and wave but chandler could not respond another swarm of men was waiting for him to clear the steps as soon as they could they hurried up and began stripping the aircraft of its cargo he wondered at the rush but could not stop to watch them his legs carried him swiftly across a paved strip to where a police car was cruising chandler cringed inside instinctively but his body did not falter as it stepped into the path of the car and raised its hand the police car jammed on its brakes the policeman at the wheel chandler thought inside himself looked startled but he also looked resigned to de south gate qvickly said chandlers lips and he felt his legs carry him around to the door on the other side there was another policeman on the seat next to the driver he leaped like a hare to get the door open and get out before chandlers body got there he made it with nothing to spare jack you go on iii tell headquarters he said hurriedly the driver nodded without speaking his lips were white he reached over chandler to close the door and made a sharp utum as soon as the car was moving chandler felt himself able to move his lips again i he said i dont know friend said the policeman kindly keep your mouth shut south gate the exec said and south gate is where im going chandler shrugged and looked out the window just in time to see the jet that had brought him to the islands once more lumbering into life it crept wobbling its wing tips over the ground picked up speed roared across taxi strips and over rough ground and at last piled up against an ungainly looking foreign airplane a russian turbo prop by its markings in a thunderous crash and ball of flame its fuel exploded no one got out it seemed that traffic to hawaii was all one way viii they roared through downtown honolulu with the siren blaring and cars scattering out of the way at seventy miles an hour they raced down a road by the sea chan dler caught a glimpse of a sign that said hilo but where or what hilo might be he had no idea soon there were fewer cars then there were none but their own the road was a suburban highway lined with housing developments shopping centers palm groves and the occa sional center of a small municipality scattering helter skelter together there was a road like this extending in every direction from every city in the united states chan dler thought but this one was somewhat altered something had been there before them about a mile outside honolu lus outer fringe life was cut off as with a knife there were no people on foot and the only cars were rusted wrecks lining the roads the lawns were ragged stands of weeds in front of the ranchtype homes it was evidently not allowed to live here chandler craned his neck his curiosity was becoming almost unbearable he opened his mouth but i said shut up rumbled the cop without looking at him there was a note in the policemans voice that impressed chandler he did not quite know what it was but it made him obey they drove for another fifteen minutes in si lence then drew up before a barricade across the road chandler got out the policeman slammed the door behind him ripping rubber off his tires with the speed of his utum and acceleration back toward honolulu chandler stood staring off after him in bright warm sunlight with a reek of hibiscus and rotting palms in his nostrils it was very quiet there except for a soft scratchy sound of footsteps on gravel as chandler turned to face the man who was coming toward him he realized he had learned one fact from the policeman after all the cop was scared clear through chandler said hello to the man who was approach ing he too wore a uniform but not that of the honolulu city police it was like us army suntans but without insignia behind him were half a dozen others in the same dress smoking chatting leaning against whatever was handy the barricades themselves were impressively thor ough barbed wire ran down the beach and out into the ocean on the other side of the road barbed wire ran clear out of sight along the middle of a sideroad the gate itself was bracketed with machinegun emplacements the guard waited until he was close to chandler before speaking what do you want he asked without greeting chandler shrugged all right just wait here said the guard and began to walk away again wait a minute what am i waiting for the guard shook his head without stopping or turning he did not seem very interested and he certainly was not helpful chandler put down the fragmentary copy of the prophet which he had carried so far and sat on the ground but again he had no long time to wait one of the guards came toward him with the purposeful movements chandler had learned to recognize without speaking the guard dug into a pocket chandler jumped up instinctively but it was only a set of car keys as chandler took them the look in the guards eyes showed the quick release of tension that meant he was free again and in that same moment chandlers own body was occupied once more he reached down and picked up the tattered book quickly but a little clumsily his fingers selected a key and his legs carried him toward a little french car parked just the other side of the barrier chandler was learning at last the skills of allowing his body to have its way he couldnt help it in any event so he was consciously disciplining himself to withdraw his attention from his muscles and senses it involved queerly vertiginous problems a hundred times a minute there was some unexpected body sway or movement of the hand and his lagging imprisoned mind would wrench at its unresponsive nerves to put out the elbow that would brace him or to catch itself with a step he had learned to ignore these things the mind that inhabited his body had ways not his own of maintaining balance and reaching an objective but they were equally sure he watched his own hands shifting the gears of the car it was a make he had never driven with a clutchless drive he did not understand but the mind in his brain evidently understood it well enough they picked up speed in great gasolinewasting surges chandler began to form a picture of that mind it belonged to an older man from the hesitancy of its walk and a testy one from the heedless crash of the gears as it shifted it drove with careless slapdash speed chandlers mind yelled and flinched in his brain as they rounded blind curves where any casual other motorist would have been a catastrophe but his hand on the wheel and his foot on the accelerator did not hesitate beyond the south gate the island of oahu became abruptly wild there were beautiful homes but there were also great gaptoothed spaces where homes had once been and were no longer it seemed that some monstrous zoning com missar had stalked through the island with an eraser rubbing out the small homes the cheap ones the old ones rubbing out the stores rubbing out the factories this whole section of the island had been turned into an exclusive residential park it was not uninhabited chandler thought he glimpsed a few people though since the direction of his eyes was not his to control it was hard to be sure and then the renault turned into a lane paved but narrow hardwood trees with some sort of blossoms chandler could not tell what overhung it on both sides it meandered for a mile or so turned and opened into a great vacant parking lot the renault stopped with a squeal of brakes in front of a door that was flanked by bronze plaques twa flight message center chandler caught sight of a skeletal towering form over head like radio transmitter antennae as his body marched him inside up a motionless escalator along a hall and into a room his muscles relaxed he glanced around and from a huge soft couch beside a desk a huge soft body stirred and gasping sat up it was a very fat old man almost bald wearing a coronet of silvery spikes he looked at chandler without much interest vots your name he wheezed he had a heavy ineradicable accent like a hapsburg or a russian diplomat chandler recognized it readily he had heard it often enough from his own lips the mans name was koitska he said in his accented wheeze if he had another name he did not waste it on chandler he took as few words as possible to order chandler to be seated and to be still koitska squinted at the copy of gibrans the prophet he did not glance at chandler but chandler felt himself propelled out of his seat to hand the book to koitska then returning koitska turned its pages with an expression of bored repugnance like a man picking leeches off his arm he seemed to be waiting for something a door closed on the floor below and in a moment a girl came into the room she was tall dark and not quite young chandler struck by her beauty was sure that he had seen her somewhere but could not place her face she wore a coronet like the fat mans intertwined in a complicated hairdo and she got right down to business chandler is it all right love what we want to know is what this is all about she indicated the book a relief that was like pain crossed chandlers mind so that was why he was here whoever these people were however they managed to rule mens minds they were not quite certain of their perfect power to them the sad futile orphalese represented a sort of annoyancenot important enough to be a threatbut something which had proved inconvenient at one time and therefore needed investigat ing as chandler was the only survivor they had deemed it worth their godlike whiles to transport him four thou sand miles so that he might bring them the book and satisfy their curiosity chandler did not hesitate in telling them all about the people of orphalese there was nothing worth concealing he was quite sure no debts are owed to the dead and the orphalese had proved on their own heads at the last that their ritual of pain was only an annoyance to the posses sors not a tactic that could defeat them it took hardly five minutes to say everything that need ed saying about guy meggie and the other doomed and suffering inhabitants of the old house on the mountain koitska hardly spoke the girl was his interrogator and sometimes translator as well when his english was not sufficient to comprehend a point with patient detachment she kept the story moving until koitska with a bored shrug indicated he was through then she smiled at chandler and said thanks love havent i seen you somewhere before i dont know i thought the same thing about you oh everybodys seen me lots of me butwell no matter good luck love be nice to koitska and perhaps hell do as much for you and she was gone koitska lay unmoving on his couch for a few moments rubbing a fat nose with a plump finger hah he said at last then abruptly and now d qvestion is vot to do vit you eh i do not fink you can cook eh with unexpected clarity chandler realized he was on trial for his life cook no im afraid mean i can boil eggs he said nothing fancy hah grumbled koitska vel ve need a couple three doctors but i do not fink you vould do you mean a medical doctor chandler repeated stu pidly da konyekhno vot you fink i mean the fat mans voice was abruptly savage it was very clear that to him chandler was of far less importance than the bougainvillea that framed the parking lot outside chandler said carefully im not a doctor but i am an electrical engineer or was vas i havent had much practice there has not been a great deal of call for engineers the last year or two hah koifska seemed to consider vel he said it could be yes it could be dat ve have a job for you you go back downstairs andno vait the fat man closed his eyes and chandler felt himself seized and pro pelled down the stairs to what had once been a bay of a builtin garage now it was fitted up with workbenches and the gear of a radio hams dreams chandler walked woodenly to one of the benches his own voice spoke to him out of his own lips ve got here someplaceda here is cirguit diagrams an de specs for a sqvarevave generator you know vot dat is write down de answer chandler released with a pencil in his hand and a pad before him wrote yes okay den you build vun for me i areddy got vun but i vant another you do dis in de city no here go to tripler dey tells you dere vere you can verk vere to get parts all dat couple days you come out here again i see if i like how you build clutching the thick sheaf of diagrams chandler felt himself propelled outside and back into the little car the interview was over he wondered if he would be able to find his way back to honolulu but that problem was then postponed as he discovered he could not start the car his own hands had already done so of course but it had been so quick and sure that he had not paid attention now he found that the ignition key was marked only in french which he could not speak after trial and error he discovered the combina tion that would start the engine and unlock the steering wheel and then gingerly he toured the perimetef of the lot until he found an exit road it was close to midnight he judged stars were shining overhead there was a rising moon he then remembered somewhat tardily that he should not be seeing stars the lane he had come in on had been overhung on both sides with trees a few minutes later he realized he was quite lost chandler stopped the car swore feelingly got out and looked around there was nothing much to see the roads bore no markers that made sense to him he shrugged and rum maged through the glove compartment on the chance of a map there was none but he did find a halfempty pack of cigarettes he added them to the store in his pockets lit up and relaxed chandler felt exactly as he had felt the day he got his first job it was absolutely astonishing he marveled at himself but the mere suggestion of a possibility that there might somehow be some sort of an organized place for him in the lunatic framework of this world had calmed jumpy nerves he had almost forgotten he possessed he puffed smoke over the top of the little car and admired the pleas ant evening there were the stars vega and deneb it did not really seem to matter to him that the last time he had seen those stars twentyfour hours before he had just witnessed the murder of a score of innocents and con sidered his own life to be spent it would not be very hard to build a squarewave generator if he could get parts no doubt it was a sort of test if he passed he would get the job and this koitska would have little to worry about too because if anyone should somehow fake the test it would not take long to discover the deception and chandler had a good idea of what would happen to him or to anyone else whom koitska caught in a deception he felt a light touch at his mind or had he he flicked the cigarette away staring around it was nothing really or nothing that he could quite identify it was as though he had been well nudged it seemed that someone had paused on the threshold of usurping his body but then unaccountably reframed as he had just about decided to forget it and get back into the car he saw headlights approaching a low lean sports car slowed as it came near stopping beside him and a girl leaned out almost invisible in the darkness there you are love she said cheerfully thought i spotted someone lost she had a coronet and chandler recognized her it was the girl who had interrogated him i guess i am he admitted the girl leaned forward come in dear oh that car leave it here the silly little bug she giggled as they drove away from the renault koitska wouldnt like you wandering around i guess he decided to give you a job how did you know she said softly well love youre still here you know what are you supposed to be doing going to tripler whatever that is in honolulu i guess then i have to build some radio equipment triplers actually on the other side of the city ill take you to the gate then you tell them where you want to go theyll take care of it i dont have any money for fare she laughed at the idea after a moment she said koitskas not the worst but id mind my step if i were you love do what he says the best you can you never know you might find yourself very fortunate i already think that im alive why love that point of view will take you far she drove in silence for a minute those awfulawfuls of yours the oiphalese whatever you call them they really didnt have much of a chance you know chandler looked at her face but it was shadowed he wondered why she was taking the trouble to talk to him out of simple compassion no body does against the exec she said her voice quite cheerful you get along best if you make up your mind fo that right away the sports car slid smoothly to a stop at the barricade in the floodlights above the machinegun nests she looked more closely at chandler whats that on your forehead dear somehow he had lost the woolen cap somewhere along the way a brand he said shortly h for hoaxer i did something when one of you people had taken me over and they thought id done it on my own the girl caught her breath then laughed why this is wonderful she said excitedly no wonder i thought id seen you before dont you remember i was the fore woman at your trial chandler spent the night in a sort of hostel for casual employees of the executive committee it had once been an army hospital and was still run with the militarys casual loosejointed efficiency everything he needed was provided for himroom bedding food directionsbut without anyone ever taking a moment to explain still the next morning following the directions the desk orderly had given chandler boarded a pink and silver bus that took him to downtown honolulu the driver did not collect any fares chandler got off as directed at fort street and walked a few blocks to the address he had been given the name of the place was parts n plenty he found it easily enough it was a radio parts store by the size of it it had once been a big wellstocked one but now the counters were almost bare a thinfaced man with khakicolored skin looked up and nodded chandler nodded back he fingered a bin of tuning knobs hefted a coil of twostrand antenna wire and said a fellow at tripler told me to come here to pick up equipment but im damned if i know what im supposed to do when i locate it i dont have any money the darkskinned man got up and came over to him figured you for a malihini no sweat have you got a list i can make one all right catalogues on the table behind you if you want them he offered chandler a cigarette and sat against the edge of the counter reading over chandlers shoulder ho he said suddenly koitskas squarewave generator again right chandler admitted it and the man grinned every couple months he sends somebody along mr chandler glad to know you im john hsi dont go easy on the job just because koitska doesnt really need it chan dler it could be pretty important to you chandler absorbed the information silently and handed over his list the man did not look at it come back in about an hour he said i wont have any money in an hour either oh thats all right ill put it on koitskas bill chandler said frankly look i dont know whats going on suppose i came in and picked up a thousand dollars worth of stuff would you put that on the bill too certainly said hsi optimistically you thinking about stealing parts what would you do with them well chandler puffed on his cigarette well i could no you couldnt also it wouldnt pay believe me hsi said seriously if there is one thing that doesnt pay it is cheating on the exec now thats another good question said chandler who is the exec hsi shook his head sorry i dont know you chan dler you mean youre afraid even to answer a question youre damned well told i am probably nobody would mind what i might tell you but probably isnt good enough exasperated chandler said how the devil am i sup posed to know what to do next so i take all this junk back to my room at tripler and solder up the generator then what then koitska will get in touch with you hsi said not unkindly play it as it comes to you chandler thats the best advice i can offer he hesitated koitskas not the worst of them he said and then daringly and maybe hes not the best either just do whatever he told you keep on doing it until he tells you to do something else thats all i mean thats all the advice i can give you whether its going to be enough to satisfy koitska is something else again there is not much to do in a strange town when you have no money chandlers room at what once had been tripler general hospital was free the bus was free evi dently all the radio parts he could want were also free but he did not have the price of a cup of coffee or a haircut in the pockets of the suntan slacks the desk man at tripler had issued him he wandered around the streets of hono lulu waiting for the hour to be up at tripler a doctor had also examined his scar and it was now concealed under a neat white bandage he had been fed he had bathed he had been given new clothes tripler was a teeming metropolis in itself a main building some ten storeys high a scattering of outbuildings connect ed to it by covered passages with thousands of men and women busy about it chandler had spoken to a good many of them in the hour after waking up and before boarding the bus to honolulu and none of them had been free with information either honolulu had not suffered greatly under the rule of the exec remembering the shattered stateside cities chandler thought that this one had been incredibly fortunate daw dling down king street in the aromatic reek of the fish markets chandler could have thought himself in any port city before the grisly events of that christmas when the planet went possessed crabs waved sluggishly at him from bins great pinkscaled fish rested on nests of ice waiting to be sold smells of frying food came from half a dozen restaurants it was only the people who were different there was a solid sprinkling of those who like himself were dressed in insignialess former army uniformsobviously conscripts on exec errandsand a surprising minority who from overheard snatches of conversation had come from coun tries other than the usa russian mostly chandler guessed but russian or american wearing suntans or aloha shirts everyone he saw was marked by the visible signs of strain there was no laughter chandler saw a clock within the door of a restaurant half an hour still to kill he turned and wandered up away from the water toward the visible bulk of the hills and in a moment he saw what made honolulus collective face wear its careworn frown it was an open squareperhaps it had once been a war memorialand in the center of it was a fencedoff paved area where people seemed to be resting it struck chandler as curious that so many persons should have decided to take a nap on what surely was an uncomfortable bed of flat concrete he approached and saw that they were not resting not only his eyes but his ears conveyed the messageand his nose too for the mild air was fetid with blood and rot these were not sleeping men and women some were dead some were unconscious all were maimed the pave ment was slimed with their blood none had the strength to scream but several were moaning and even some of the unconscious ones gasped like the breathing of a man in diabetic coma passersby walked briskly around the metal fence and if their glances were curious it was at chandler they looked not at the tortured wrecks before them he understood that the sight of the dying men and women was familiarwas painfuland thus was ignored it was himself who was the curiosity for staring at them he turned and fled trying not to vomit he was still shaken when he returned to parts n plenty the hour was up but hsi shook his head not yet you can sit down over there if you like chandler slumped into the indicated swivel chair and stared blank ly at the wall the terror he had just seen was far worse than anything stateside the random slaughter of murders and bombs was at least a momentary thing and when it was done it was done but this was sustained torture he buried his head in his hands and did not look up until he heard the sound of a door opening hsi his face somehow different was manipulating a lever on the outside of a door while a man inside becom ing visible as the door opened was doing the same from inside it looked as though the lock on the door would not work unless both levers operated and the man on the inside whom chandler had not seen before was dressed oddly only in bathing trunks his face wore the same expression as hsis chandler guessed that both were possessed the man inside wheeled out two shopping carts loaded with electronic equipment of varying kinds wordlessly received some empty ones from hsi and the door closed on him again hsi tugged the lever down turned biinked and said all right chandler your stuffs here chandler approached what was that all about go to hell hsi said with sudden violence i oh never mind sorry but i told you already ask somebody else your questions not me he gloomily began to pack the items on chandlers list into a cardboard carton then he glanced at chandler and said half apologetically these are tough times buddy i guess theres no harm in answering some questions you want to know why most of my stocks locked behind an armorplate door well you ought to be able to figure that out for yourself anyway the exec doesnt like to have people playing with radios bert stays in the stock room i stay out here twice a day the bosses open the door and we fill whatever orders theyve approved a little rough on bert of courseits a tenhour day in the stockroom for him and nothing to do but it could be worse oh thats for sure friend it could be worse why the bathing suit hot in there hot for bert if they think hes smuggling stuff out said hsi you been here long enough to see the monu ment yet chandler shook his head then grimaced you mean up about three blocks that way where the people thats right said hsi three blocks mauka from here where the people where the people are serving as a very good object lesson to you and me about a dozen there right small for this time of year chandler usually there are more notice anything special about them they were butchered some of them looked like their legs had been burned right off their eyes gouged out their faces chandler brought up sharply it had been bad enough looking at those wretched writhing semi cadavers he did not want to talk about them the parts man nodded seriously sometimes there are more and sometimes theyre worse hurt than that have you got any idea how they get that way they do it to themselves thats how my own brother was out there for a week last statehood day he jumped feet first into a concrete mixer and it took him seven days to die after i put him on my shoulder and carried him out there i didnt like it of course but i didnt exactly have any choice i wasnt running my own body at the time neither was he when he jumped he was made to do it because he used to have berts job and he thought hed take a little shortwave set home like i said you dont want to cheat on the exec because it doesnt pay but what am i supposed to hsi held up his hand dont ask me how to keep out of that monument bunch chandler i dont know do what youre told and dont do anything you arent told to do that is the whole of the law now do me a favor and get out of here so i can pack up these other orders by the morning of the fourth day on the island of oahu chandler had learned enough of the ropes to have signed a moneychit at the tripler currency office against koit skas account that was about all he had learned except for a few practical matters like where meals were served and the location of the freshwater swimming pool at the back of the grounds he was killing time using the pool when in the middle of a jackknife from the tenfoot board he felt himself seized he sprawled into the water with a hard splashing slap threshed about and as he came to the surface found himself giggling sorry dear he apologized to himself but we dont carry our weight in the same places you know get that squarewhatsit thingamajig like an angel and meet me in front by the flagpole in twenty minutes he recognized the voice even if his own vocal chords had made it it was the girl who had driven him back from the interview with koitska the one who had casually announced she had saved his life at his hoaxing trial chandler swam to the side of the pool and toweled as he trotted toward his quarters she was from koitska now of course which meant that his test was about to be graded quickly though he dressed she was there before him standing beside a lowslung sports car and chatting with one of the groundskeepers an armful of leis dangled beside her and although she wore the coronet which was evidence of her status the gardener did not seem to fear her come along love she called to chandler koitska wants your thingummy chuck it in the trunk if itll fit and well head waikiki wikiwiki dont i say that nicely but i only fool the malihinis like you she chattered away as the little car dug its rear wheels into the drive and leaped around the green and out the gate the wind howled by them the sun was bright the sky was piercingly blue riding next to this beautiful girl it was hard for chandler to remember that she was one of those who had destroyed his world it was a terrible thing to have so much hatred and to feel it so diluted not even koitska seemed a terrible enough enemy to accept such a load of detestation it was hate without an object and it recoiled on the hater leaving him turgid and constrained if he could not hate his onetime friend jack souther for defiling and destroying his wife it was almost as hard to hate southers anonymous possessor it could have been koitska it could even have been this girl by his side in the strange cruel fantasies with which the execs indulged themselves it was likely enough that they would sometimes assume the body and the role of the opposite sex why not strange ruthless morality it was impossible to evaluate it by any human standards it was also impossible to think of hatred with her beside him they soared around honolulu on a broad express way and paralleled the beach toward waikiki look dear diamond head mustnt ignore itvery bad form like not going to see the nightblooming cereus at the punahou school you havent missed that have you im afraid i have rosalie call me rosalie dear im afraid i have rosalie for some reason the name sounded familiar shame oh shame they say it was wonderful night before last looks like cactus to me but chandlers mental processes had worked to a conclu sion rosalie pan he said now i know know what you mean she swerved around a motionless buick parked arrogantly five feet from the curbyou mean you didnt know who i was and to think i used to pay my press agent five thousand a year chandler said smiling and almost relaxed im sorry but musical comedies werent my strong point lets see wasnt there something about you disappearing she nodded glancing at him there sure was dear i almost froze to death getting out to that airport of course it was worth it i found out later if i hadnt been took as they say i wouldve been dead you remember what happened to new york about an hour later you must have had some friends chandler began and let it trail off so did the girl after a moment she began to talk about the scenery again pointing out the brickred and purple bougainvillea describing how the shoreline had looked before theyd cleaned it up oh thousands and thou sands of the komeliest little houses youd have hated it so we have done at least a few good things anyway she said complacently and began gently to probe into his life story but as they stopped before the twa message center a few moments later she said well love its been fun go on in koitskas expecting you ill see you later and her eyes added gently hope chandler got out of the car turned and felt himself taken his voice said briskly zdrastvoi rosie gdyeh koitska unsurprised the girl pointed to the building kto gowrit chandlers voice answered in enghsh with a faint ox ford accent it is i rosie kalman wheres koitskas tinkertoy oh all right thanks ill just pick it up and take it in hope its all right i must say one wearies of breaking in these new fellows chandlers body ambled around to the trunk of the car took out the squarewave generator on its breadboard base and slouched into the building it called ahead in the same language and was answered wheezily from above koitska zdrastvoi kto katman iditye suda ko mneh konyekhno cried chandlers voice and he was car ried in and up to where the fat man lounged in a leather upholstered wheelchair there was a conversation long minutes of it while the two men poked at the generator chandler did not understand a word until he spoke to himself youwhats your name chandler koitska filled in for him you chandler dyou know anything at all about submillimeter microwaves tell koitska briefly chandler felt himself freelong enough to nod then he was pos sessed again and koitska repeated the nod good then tell koitska what experience youve had again free chandler said not a great deal of actual experience i worked with a group at cal tech on spectro scopic measurements in the million megacycle range i didnt design any of the equipment though i helped put it together he recited his degrees until koitska raised a languid hand shto i dont care if ve gave you diagrams you could build certainly if i had the equipment i suppose id need but koitska stopped him again i know vot you need he said damply enough ve see in a moment chandler was taken again and his voice and koitskas debated the matter for a while until koitska shrugged turned his head and seemed to go to sleep chandler marched himself out of the room and out into the driveway before his voice said to him youve secured a position then go back to tripler until we send for you itll be a few days i expect and chandler was free again he was also alone the girl in the porsche was gone the door to the twa building had latched itself behind him he stared around him swore shrugged and circled the building to the parking lot at back on the chance that a car might be there for him to borrow luckily there wasthere were four in fact all with keys in them he selected a ford puzzled out the likeliest road back to honolulu and turned the key in the starter it was fortunate he thought that there had been several cars if there had been only one he would not have dared to take it for fear of stranding koitska or some other exec who might easily blot him out in annoyance he did not wish to join the wretches at the monument it was astonishing how readily fear had become a part of his life the trouble with this position he had somehow securedone of the troubleswas that there was no union delegate to settle employee grievances like no transportation like no clear idea of working hours or duties like no mention at allof courseof wages chandler had no idea what his rights were if any at all or of what the penalties would be if he overstepped them the maimed victims at the monument supplied a clue of course he could not really believe that that sort of punishment would be applied for minor infractions death was so much less trouble even death was not really likely he thought for a simple lapse he thought he could not be sure of course he could be sure of only one thing he was now a slave completely a slave a slave until the day he died back on the mainland there was the statistical likelihood of occasional slaveryby possession yet but there it was only the body that was enslaved and only for moments here in the shadow of the execs it was all of him forever until death or a miracle turned him loose on the second day follovidng he returned to his room at tripler after breakfast and found a honolulu city policeman sitting holloweyed on the edge of his bed the man stood up as chandler came in so he grumbled you take so long here is diagrams specs parts lists all you get everything three days from now then we begin the policeman no longer koitska shook himself glanced stolidly at chandler and walked out leaving a thick manila envelope on the pillow on it was written in a crabbed hand all secret do not show diagrams f chandler opened the envelope and spilled its contents on the bed an hour later he realized that sixty minutes had passed in which he had not been afraid it was good to be working again he thought and then that thought faded away again as he returned to studying the sheaves of circuit diagrams and closely typed pages of specifications it was not only work it was hard work and absorbing chandler knew enough about the very short wavelength radio spectrum to know that the device he was supposed to build was no proficiency test this was for real the more he puzzled over it the less he could understand of its purpose there was a transmitter and there was a receiver astonishingly neither was directional that ruled out ra dar for example he rejected immediately the thought that the radiation was for spectrum analysis as in the cal tech projectunfortunate because that was the only applica tion with which he had firsthand familiarity but impossi ble the thing was too complicated nor could it be a simple message transmitterno perhaps it could assuming there was a reason for using the submillimeter bands instead of the conventional far simpler shortwave spec trum could it the submillimeter waves were lineofsight of course but would ionosphere scatter make it possible for them to cover great distances he could not remember or was that irrelevant since perhaps they needed only to cover the distances between islands in their own archipelago but then why all the power and in any case what about this fantastic switching panel hundreds of square feet of it even though it was transistorized and subminiaturized and involving at least a dozen sophisti cated technical refinements he hadnt the training quite to understand at t could have handled every phone call in the united states with less switching than thisin the days when telephone systems spanned a nation instead of a fraction of a city he pushed the papers together in a pile and sat back smoking a cigarette trying to remember what he could of the theory behind submilumeter radia tion at half a million megacycles and up the domain of quantum theory began to be invaded rotating gas mole cules constricted to a few energy states responded directly to the radio waves chandler remembered latenight bull sessions in pasadena during which it had been pointed out that the possibilities in the field were enormousalthough only possibilities for there was no engineering way to reach them and no clear theory to point the way suggesting such strange ultimate practical applications as the receiverless radio for example was that what he had here he gave up it was a question that would burn at him until he found the answer but iust now he had work to do and hed better be doing it skipping lunch entirely he carefully checked the components lists made a copy of what he would need put the original envelope and its contents in the safe at the main receiving desk and caught the bus to honolulu at the parts n plenty store hsi read the list with a faint frown that turned into a puzzled scowl when he put it down he looked at chandler for a few moments without speaking well hsi can you get all this for me the parts man shrugged and nodded koitska said in three days hsi looked startled then resigned that puts it right up to me doesnt it all right wait a moment he disappeared in the back of the store where chan dler heard him talking on what was evidently an intercom system he came back in a few minutes and slipped chandlers list into a slit in the locked door tough for bert he said hell be working all night getting startedbut i can take it easy till tomorrow by then hell know what we dont have and ill find some way to get it he shrugged again but his face was lined chan dler wondered how one went about finding for example a thirty megawatt klystron tube but it was hsis problem he said all right ril see you monday wait a minute chandler hsi eyed him you dont have anything special to do do you well come have dinner with me maybe i can get to know you then maybe i can answer some of your questions if you like they took a bus out kapiolani boulevard then got out and walked a few blocks to a restaurant named mother chees hsi was well known there it seemed he led chandler to a booth at the back nodded to the waiter ordered without looking at the menu and sat back the foods all fish he said youll only find meat in the places where the execs sometimes go tell me some thing chandler whats that scar on your forehead chandler touched it almost with surprise since the medics had treated it he had almost forgotten it was there he said whats the score you testing me too want to see if ill lie about it hsi grinned sorry i guess thats what i was doing i do know what an h stands for weve seen them before not many the ones that do get this far usually dont last long unless of course they are working for somebody whom it wouldnt do to offend he explained so what you want to know then is whether i was really hoaxing or not does it make any difference damn right it does man were slaves but were not animals chandler had gotten to him the parts man looked startled then sallow as he observed his own vehemence sorry hsi it makes a difference to me too well i wasnt hoaxing i was possessed just like any other every day rapist only i couldnt prove it and it didnt look too good for me because the damn thing happened in a phar maceuticals plant that was supposed to be about the only place in town where you could be sure you wouldnt be possessed or so everybody thought including me up to the time i went ape hsi nodded the waiter approached with their drinks hsi looked at him appraisingly then did a curious thing he gripped his left wrist with his right hand quickly then released it again the waiter did not appear to notice expertly he served the drinks folded small pink floral napkins dumped and wiped their ashtray in one motion and then so quickly that chandler was not quite sure he had seen it caught hsis wrist in the same fleeting gesture just before he turned and walked away without comment hsi turned back to chandler he said i believe you would you like to know why it happened because i think i can tell you the execs have all the antibiotics they need now you mean chandler hesitated thats right they did leave some areas alone as long as they werent fully stocked on everything they might want for the foreseeable future wouldnt you i might chandler said cautiously if i knew what i wasbeing an exec hsi said eat your dinner ill take a chance and tell you what i know he swallowed his whiskeyonthe rocks wth a quick backward jerk of the head theyre mostly russiansyou must know that much for yourself the whole thing started in russia chandler said well thats pretty obvious but russia was smashed up as much as anywhere else the whole russian government was killedwasnt it hsi nodded theyre not the government not the exec communism doesnt mean any more to them than the declaration of independence doeswhich is nothing its very simple chandler theyre a project that got out of hand back three years ago he said in russia it started in the last days of the second stalinite regime before the neo khrushchevists took over power in the january push the western world had not known exactly what was going on of course russia had become queerer and even more opaque after the maoist trials and the revival of such fine old soviet institutions as the gay pay oo that was the development called the freeze when the stalinites seized control in the name of the sacred generalissimo of the soviet fatherland a mightymissile party dedicated to bringing about the world revolution by force of sputnik the neokhrushchevists on the other hand believed that honey caught more flies than vinegar and although there were few visible adherents to that philosophy during the purges of the freeze they were not all dead then out of the donbas electrical workshop came sudden support for their point of view it was a weapon it was more than a weapon an irresistible toolmore than that the way to end all dis putes forever it was a simple radio transmitter or so it seemed but its frequencies were on an unusual band and its effects were remarkable it controlled the minds of men the receiver was the human brain through this little portable transmitter surgically patchwired to the brain of the person operating it his entire personality was trans mitted in a pattern of very short waves which could invade and modulate the personality of any other human being in the world whats the matter hsi interrupted himself staring at chandler chandler had stopped eating his hand frozen midway to his mouth he shook his head nothing go on hsi shrugged and continued while the western world was celebrating christmas the christmas before the first outbreak of possession in the outside worldthe man who invented the machine was secretly demonstrating it to another man both of them were now dead the inventor had been a pole the other man a former party leader who four years before had pardoned the inventors dying father from a siberian work camp the party leader had reason to congratulate himself on that loaf cast on the water there were only three working models of the transmitterwhat ultimately was refined into the coronet chandler had seen on the heads of koitska and the girlbut that was enough for the january push the stalinites were out the neokhrushchevists were in a whole factory in the donbas was converted to manu facturing these little mental controllers as fast as they could be producedand that was fast for they were simple in design to begin with and were quickly refined to a few circuits even the surgical wiring to the brain became unnecessary as induction coils tapped the encephalic rhythms only the great amplifying hookup was really complicated only one of those was necessary for a single amplifier could serve as rebroadcastermodulator for thou sands of the headsets are you sure youre all right hsi demanded chandler put down his fork lit a cigarette and beck oned to the waiter im all right i just want another drink he needed it for now he knew what he was building for koitska the waiter brought two more drinks and carried away the uneaten food we dont know exactly who did what after that hsi said but somehow or other it got out of hand i think it was the technical crew of the factory that took over i suppose it was an inevitable danger he grinned savagely i can just imagine the party bosses in the factory he said trying to figure out how to keep the workers in linebribe them or terrify them give them dachas or send a quota to siberia neither would work of course because there isnt any bribe you can give to a man who only has to stretch out his hand to take over the world and you cant frighten a man who can make you slit your own throat anyway the next thing that happened the following christmaswas when they took over the world it wasnt a party movement at all any more a lot of the workers were czechs and hungarians and poles and the first thing they wanted to do was to even a few scores so here they are before they let the whole world go bang they got out of range they got themselves out of russia on two red navy cruisers about a thousand of them then they systematically triggered off every ballistic missile they could find and they could find all of them sooner or later it was just a matter of looking as soon as it was safe they moved in here there are only a thousand or so of them here on the islands and nobody outside the islands even knows where they are if they did what good would it do them they can kill anyone anywhere they kill for fun but some times they kill for a reason too when one of them goes wandering for kicks he makes it a point to mess up all the transport and communications facilities he comes across especially now since theyve stockpiled everything theyre likely to need for the next twenty years we dont know what theyre planning to do when the twenty years are up maybe they dont care would you chandler drained his drink and shook his head one question he said whos we hsi carefully unwrapped a package of cigarettes took one out and lit it he looked at it as though he were not enjoying it cigarettes had a way of tasting stale these days as they were just a minute he said tardily chandler remembered the quick grasp of the waiters fingers on hsis wrist and that the waiter had been hovering inconspicuously close all through their meal hsi was waiting for the man to return in a moment the waiter was back looking directly at chandler he looped his own wrist with his fingers and nodded hsi said softly we is the society of slaves thats all of usslavesbut only a few of us belong to the society we there was a crash of glass the waiter had dropped their tray across the table from chandler hsi looked suddenly changed his left hand lay on the table before him his right hand poised over it apparently he had been about to show chandler again the sign he had made but he could not do it his hand paused and fluttered like a captured bird captured it was hsi was captured out of hsis mouth with hsis voice came the light tonal rhythms of rosalie pan this is an unexpected pleasure love i never expected to see you here enjoying your meal chandler had his empty glass halfway to his lips auto matically before he realized there was nothing in it to brace him he said hoarsely yes thanks do you come here often it was like the banal talk of a language handbook wildly inappropriate to uihat had been going on a moment before he was shaken oh i love it cooed hsi investigating the dishes before him all finished i see too bad your friend doesnt feel like he ate much either i guess he wasnt hungry chandler managed well i am hsi cocked his head and smiled like a clumsy female impersonator i know are you doing anything special right now love i know youve eaten butwell ive been a good girl and i guess i can eat a real meal i mean not with somebody elses teeth and still keep the calories in line suppose i meet you down at the beach theres a place there where the luau is divine i can be there in half an hour chandlers breathing was back to normal why not ill be delighted luigi the wharf rat thats the name of it they wont let you in though unless you tell them youre with me itsspecial hsis eye closed in rosalie pans wink half an hour he said and was again himself he began to shake the waiter brought him straight whiskey and pretense abandoned stood by while hsi drank it after a moment he said scares you but guess were all right youd better go chandler ill talk to you again some other time chandler stood up but he couldnt leave hsi like that are you all right hsi almost managed control oh think so not the first time its come close you know sooner or later itll come closer still and that will be the end butyes im all right for now chandler tarried you were saying something about the society of slaves damn it go hsi barked shell be waiting for you sorry i didnt mean to shout but go as chan dler turned he said more quietly come around to the store tomorrow maybe we can finish our talk then luigi the wharf rats was not actually on the beach but on the bank of a body of water called the ala wai canal across the water were the snowtopped hills a maitred escorted chandler personally to a table on a balcony and there he waited rosalies halfhour was nearly two but then he heard her calling him from across the room in the voice which had reached a thousand second balconies and he rose as she came near she said lightly sorry you ought to be flattered though its a twentyminute driveand an hour and a half to put on my face so you wont be ashamed to be seen with me well its good to be out in my own skin for a change lets eat the talk with hsi had left a mark on chandler that not even this girls pretty face could obscure it was a pretty face though and she was obviously exerting herself to make him enjoy himself he could not help responding to her mood she talked of her life on the stage the excitement of a performance the entertainers she had known her conver sation was one long namedrop but it was not vanity the world of the famous was the world she had lived in it was not a world that chandler had ever visited but he recognized the names rosie had been married once to an english actor whose movies chandler had made a point of watching on television it was interesting in a way to know that the man snored and lived principally on vitamin pills but it was a view of the man that chandler had not sought the restaurant drew its clientele mostly from the execs young ones or youngacting ones like the girl the coro nets were all over there had been a sign on the door kapu walihini to mark it off limits to anyone not an exec or a collab orator still chandler thought who on the island was not a collaborator the only effective resistance a man could make would be to kill everyone within reach and then himself thus depriving them of slavesand that was after all only what the execs themselves had done in other places often enough it would inconvenience them only slightly the next few planeloads or shiploads of possessed warm bodies from the mainland would be permitted to live instead of being required to dash themselves to de struction like the crew of the airplane that had carried chandler thus the domestic stocks would be replenished an annoying feature of dining with rosalie in the flesh chandler found was that half a dozen times while they were talking he found himself taken speaking words to rosie that were not his own usually in a language he did not understand she took it as a matter of course it was merely a friend across the room or across the island using chandler as the casual convenience of a telephone sor ry she apologized blithely after it happened for the third time you dont like that love do you can you blame me he stopped himself from saying more he was astonished even so at his tone she said it for him i know it takes away your manhood i suppose please dont let it do that to you love were not so bad even she hesitated and did not go on you know she said i came here the same way you did kidnapped off the stage of the winter garden of course the difference was the one who kid napped me was an old friend though i didnt know it at the time and it scared me half to death chandler must have looked startled she nodded youve been thinking of us as another race havent you like the neanderthals orwell worse than that maybe she smiled were not about half of us came from russia in the first place but the others are from all over youd be astonished really she mentioned several names worldfamous scientists musicians writers of course not everybody can qualify for the club love wouldnt be exclusive otherwise the chief rule is loyalty im loyal she added gently after a moment and dont you forget it have to be whoever becomes an exec has to be with us all the way there are tests it has to be that waynot only for our protection for the worlds chandler was genuinely startled at that rosie nodded seriously if one exec should give away something hes not supposed to it would upset the whole applecart there are only a thousand of us and i guess probably two billion of you or nearly the result would be complete destruction of the executive committee chandler thought she meant at first but then he thought again no of the world for the thousand execs outnumbered though they were two million to one could not fail to triumph the contest would not be in doubt if the whole thousand execs at once began systematically to kill and destroy instead of merely playing at it as the spirit moved them they could all but end the human race overnight a man could be made to slash his throat in a quarter of a minute an exec killing killing killing without pause could de stroy his own two million enemies in an eighthour day and there were surer faster ways chandler did not have to imagine them he had seen them the massacre of the orphalese the victims at the monumentthey were only crumbs of destruction what had happened to new york city showed what massproduction methods could do no doubt there were bombs left even if only chemical ones shoot stab crash blow up swallow poison leap from window slit throat every man a murderer at the touch of a mind from hawaii and if no one else was near to murder surely each man could find a victim in himself in one ravaging day mankind would cease to exist as a major force in a week the only survivors would be those in such far off and hopelessly impotent places that they were not worth the trouble of tracking down yon hate us dont you chandler paused and tried to find an answer rosie was neither belligerent nor mocking she was only sympatheti cally trying to reach his point of view he shook his head not meaning nomeaning no comment well i dont blame you love but do you see that were not altogether a bad thing until we came along the world was getting ready to kill itself anyway theres a difference chandler mumbled he was thinking of his wife he and margot had loved each other as married couples dowithout any very great searing compulsion but with affection with habit and with spo radic passion chandler had not given much thought to the whole though he was aware of the parts during the last years of his marriage it was only after margots murder that he had come to know that the sum of those parts was a quite irreplaceable love but rosie was shaking her head the difference is all on our side suppose koitskas boss had never discovered the coronets at any moment one country might have got nervous and touched off the whole thingnot carefully the way we did it with most of the really dirty missiles fused safe and the others landing where they were sup posed to go i mean touched off a war the end love the bloody finis the ones that were killed at once would have been the lucky ones no love she said in dead earnest we arent the worst things that ever happened to the world once the bad part is over people will under stand what we really are and whats that exactly she hesitated smiled and said modestly were gods it took chandlers breath awaynot because it was untrue but because it had never occurred to him that gods were aware of their divinity were gods love with the privilege of electing mortals to the club dont judge us by anything that has gone before dont judge us by anything we are a new thing we dont have to conform to precedent because we upset all precedents from now on to the end of time the rules will grow from us she patted her lips briskly with a napkin and said would you like to see something lets take a little walk she took him by the hand and led him across the room out to a sundeck on the other side of the restaurant they were looking down on what had once been a garden there were people in it chandler was conscious of sounds coming from them and he was able to see that there were dozens of them perhaps a hundred and that they all seemed to be wearing suntans like his own from tripler he guessed no love they pick out those clothes themselves stand there a minute the girl in the coronet walked out to the rail of the sundeck where pink and amber spotlights were playing on nothing as she came into the colored lights there was a sigh from the people in the garden a man walked for ward with an armload of leis and deposited them on the ground below the rail they were adoring her rosalie stood gravely for a moment then nodded and returned to chandler they began doing that about a year ago she whis pered to him as a murmur of disappointment came up from the crowd their own idea we didnt know what they wanted at first but they werent doing any harm you see love she said softly we can make them do anything we like but we dont make them do that hours later chandler was not sure just how they were in a light plane flying high over the pacific clear out of sight of land the moon was gold above them the ocean black beneath chandler stared down as the girl circled the plane slipping lower toward the water silent and perplexed but he was not afraid he was almost content rosie was good companygay cheerfuland she had treasures to share it had been an impulse of hers a long drive in her sports car and a quick comfortable flight over the ocean to cap the evening it had been a pleasant impulse he reflected gravely that he could understand now how generations of country maidens had been dazzled and despoiled a touch of luxury was a great seducer the coronet on the girls body could catch his body at any moment she had only to think herself into his mind and her will flashed to a relay station like the one he was building for koitska at loose in infinity could sweep into him and make him a puppet if she chose he would open that door beside him and step out into a thousand feet of air and a meal for the sharks but he did not think she would do it he did not think anyone would really though with his own eyes he had seen some anyones do things as bad as that and sicken ingly worse there was not a corrupt whim of the most diseased mind in history that some torpid exec had not visited on a helpless man woman or child in the past years even as they flew here chandler knew the gross bodies that lay in luxury in the islands villas were surging restlessly around the world and death and shame re mained where they had passed it was a paradox too great to be reconciled this girl and this vileness he could not forget it but he could not feel it in his glands she was pretty she was gay he began to think thoughts that had left hhn alone for a long time the dark bulk of the island showed ahead and they were sinking toward a landing the girl landed skillfully on a runway that sprang into light as she approachedelectronic wizardry or the coro net and some tethered serf at a switch it didnt matter nothing mattered very greatly at that moment to chan dler thank you love she said laughing i liked that its all very well to use someone elses body for this sort of thing but every now and then i want to keep my own in practice she linked arms with him as they left the plane when i was first given the coronet here she reminisced amuse ment in her voice i got the habit real bad i spent six awful monthsreally six months in bed and by myself at that oh i was all over the world and skindiving on the barrier reef and skiing in norway andwell she said squeezing his arm never mind what all and then one day i got on the scales just out of habit do you know what i weighed she closed her eyes in mock horror but they were smiling when she opened them again i wont do that again love of course a lot of us do let ourselves go even koitska especially koitska and some of the women but just between us the ones who do really didnt have much to keep in shape in the first place she led the way into a villa that smelled of jasmine and gardenias snapped her fingers and subdued lights came on like it oh weve nothing but the best what would you like to drink she fixed them both tall cold glasses and vetoed chandlers choice of a sprawling wicker chair to sit on over here love she patted the couch beside her she drew up her legs leaning against him very soft warm and fragrant and said dreamily let me see whats nice what do you like in music love oh anything no no youre supposed to say why the original cast album from fancy free or anything else i starred in she shook her head reprovingly and the points of her coronet caught golden reflections from the lights but since youre obviously a man of low taste ill have to do the whole bit myself she touched switches at a remote control set by her end of the couch and in a moment dreamy strings began to come from triaural speakers hidden around the room it was not fancy free thats better she said drowsily and in a moment wasnt it nice in the plane it was fine chandler said gentlybut firmlyhe sat up and reached automatically into his pocket the girl sighed and straightened cigarette theyre on the table beside you hope you like the brand they only keep one big factory going not to count those terrible russian things thatre all air and no smoke she touched his forehead with cool fingers you never told me about that love it was like an electric shockthe touch of her fingers and the touch of reality at once chandler said stiffly my brand but i thought you were there oh only now and then i missed all the naughty partsdiough to tell the truth thats why i was hang ing around i do like to hear a little naughtiness now and then but all i heard was that stupid lawyer and that stupid judge made me mad she giggled lucky for you i was so irritated i decided to spoil their fun too chandler sat up and took a long pull at his drink iously it seemed to sober him he said its nothing i happened to rape a young girl happens every day of course it was one of your friends that was doing it for me but i didnt miss any of what was going on i can give you a blowbyblow description if you like the people in the town where i lived at that time thought i was doing it on my own though and they didnt approve hoaxingyou know they thought i was so perverse and cruel that i would do that sort of thing under my own power instead of with some execor as they would have put it being ignorant some imp or devil or demon pulling the strings he was shaking he waited for what she had to say but she only whispered im sorry love and looked so contrite and honest that as rapidly as it had come upon him his anger passed he opened his mouth to say something to her he didnt get it said she was sitting there looking at him alone and soft and inviting he kissed her and as she returned the kiss he kissed her again and again but less than an hour later he was in her porsche cold sober raging frustrated miserable he slammed it through the unfamiliar gears as he sped back to the city she had left him they had kissed with increasing pas sion his hands playing about her her body surging toward him and then just then she whispered no love he held her tighter and without another word she opened her eyes and looked at him he knew what mind it was that caught him then it was her mind stiffly like wood he released her stood up walked to the door and locked it behind him the lights in the villa went out he stood there boiling looking into the shadows through the great wide empty window he could see her lying there on the couch and as he watched he saw her body toss and stir and as surely as he had ever known anything before he knew that some where in the world some womanor some manlay locked with a lover violent in love and was unable to tell the other that a third party had invaded their bed chandler did not know it until he saw something glis tening on his wrist but he was weeping on the wild ride back to honolulu in the car her car would there be trouble for his taking it god let there be trouble he was in a mood for trouble he was sick and wild with revul sion worse than her use of him a casual stimulant an aphrodisiac touch was that she thought what she did was right chandler thought of the worshipping dozens under the sundeck of the exec restaurant and rosalies gracious benediction as they made her their floral offerings blind pathetic fools not only the deluded men and women in the garden were worshippers trapped in a vile religion he thought it was worse the gods and goddesses worshipped at their own divinity as well three days later koitskas voice coming from chandlers lips summoned him out to the twa shack again wise now in the ways of this world chandler comman deered a police car and was hurried out to the south gate where the guards allowed him a car of his own the door of the building was unlocked and chandler went right up he was astonished the fat man was actually sitting up he was fully dressedmore or less incongruously he wore flowered shorts and a bright red shortsleeve shirt with rope sandals his coronet perched on his plump old head curiously he carried another less ornate one he said you fly a gilikopter no no difference help me an arm like a mountain went over chandlers shoulders the man must have weighed three hundred pounds slowly wheezing he limped toward the back of theroom and touched a button a door opened chandler had not known before that there was an elevator in the building that was one of the things the exec did not consider important for his slaves to know the elevator lowered them with great grace and delicacy to the first floor where a large old cadillac ancient but immaculately kept the kind that used to be called a gangsters car waited in a private parking bay chandler followed koitskas directions and drove to an airfield where a small plexiglassnosed helicopter waited more by the force of chandler pushing him from behind than through his own fat thighs koitska puffed up the little staircase into the cabin originally the copter had been fitted for four passengers now there was the pilots seat and a seat beside it and in the back a wide soft couch koitska collapsed onto it clutching the extra coro net his face blanked outhe was chandler knew some where else just then in a moment his eyes opened again he looked at chandler with no interest at all and turned his face to the wall after a moment he wheezed sit down at de con trols he breathed noisily for a while then it vont pay you to be interested in rosalie he said chandler was startled he craned around in the seat but saw only koitskas back im not or anyway but he had no place to go in that sentence and in any case koitska no longer seemed interested after a moment koitska stirred settled himself more comfortablyand chandler felt himself taken he turned easily and surely to face the split wheel and the unfamiliar pedals of the helicopter he started the motor scanned the panels of instruments and through maneuvers which he did not understand but whose effect was accurate and sure caused the machine to roar tilt and whir up and away it was an admirable performance chandler could not guess what member of the exec was inhabiting his body at that moment there were no clues but whoever it was it had turned him into a firstclass helicopter pilot for more than an hour chandler was imprisoned in his own body without let or intermission flying a helicopter it seemed was a job without coffee breaks the remote exec who was controlling him did not trust his attention away even for a moment it was like being the prisoner of a dream thought chandler watching his right hand advance a throttle and his feet press the guiding pedals from time to time his head turned and his voice spoke over his shoulder to koitska but as the conversation seemed to be in russian or polish he gleaned nothing from it there was not much talk though the fluttering roar of the vanes overhead drowned out most sounds chandler fell into a light somber not unpleasant reverie thinking of ellen braisted and the orphalese of the girl rosalie pan and the fat murderous slug behind him it occurred to him as a phenomenon worthy of study that he was actually aiding and abetting the monsters who had destroyed his own wife and caused him to defile a silly but blameless girl the moral issues were too deep for him he preferred to think of rosalie pan and then of nothing at all they crossed a wide body of ocean and approached another island from one quick glance at a navigation map that his eyes had taken chandler guessed it to be hilo he landed the craft expertly on the margin of a small airstrip where two dcs were already parked and being unload ed and felt himself free again two husky young men apparently native hawaiians by their size rolled up a ramp and assisted koitska down it and into a building chandler was left to his own devices the building was rundown but sound around it stalky grass clumped long uncut and a few mauve and scarlet blossoms almost hidden showed where someone had once tended beds of bougainvillea and poinsettias he could not guess what the building had been doing there looking like a small officefactory combination out in the remote wilds until he caught sight of a sign the winds had blown against a wall dole apparently this had been headquarters for one of the plantations now it was stripped almost clean inside a welter of desks and rusted machines piled heedlessly outside where there once had been a parking lot new equipment was being loaded into it from the cargo planes chandler recognized some of it as from the list he had given the parts man hsi there also seemed to be a gasolinedriven generatora large one but what the other things were he could not guess besides koitska there were at least five coronetwear ing execs visible around the place chandler was not surprised it would have to be something big to winkle these torpid slugs out of their shells but he knew what it was and that it was big enough to them indeed in fact it was their lives he deduced that koitskas plans for his future comfort required a standby transmitter to service the coronets in case something went wrong perhaps a slightly modified one judging by the extra coronet koitska had brought and clearly it was this that they were to put together here for ten hours while the afternoon became dark night they worked at a furious pace when the sun set one of the execs gestured and the generator was started rocking on its rubbertired wheels as its rotors spun and fumes chugged out and they worked on by strings of incandes cent lights it was pickandshovel work for chandler no engineer ing just unloading and roughly grouping the equipment where it was ready to be assembled the execs did not take part in the work nor were they idle they busied themselves in one room of the building with some small devicechandler could not see whatand when he looked again it was gone he did not see them take it away and did not know where it was taken toward mid night he suddenly realized that it was likely some essential part which they would not permit anyone but themselves to handle and that no doubt was why they had come in person instead of working through proxies weary as he was that realization seemed pregnant with possibilities to chandler what could be so important and what use could he make of the information so much had happened to chandler so quickly that he seemed to have numbed his reflexes he was not reacting as rapidly or as surely as he should in this wonderland if the red queen were to come up to him and lop off his head he might not even remember to die dizzying worryinghis sensory network simply could not cope with the demands on it but all the same he thought slowly and painfully there was a weapon here a lever just before they left koitska and two or three of the other execs quizzed him briefly he was too tired to think beyond the questions but they seemed to be trying to find out if he were able to do the simpler parts of the construction without supervision and they seemed satisfied with the answers he flew the helicopter home with someone else guiding his arms and legs but he was half asleep as he did it and he never quite remembered how he managed to get back to his room at tripler the next morning he went back to parts n plenty with an additional list covering replacement of some compo nents that had turned out defective hsi glanced at it quickly and nodded all this stuff i have you can pick it up this afternoon if you like chandler offered him a cigarette out of a stale pack about the other night but hsi shook his head violently he began to perspire but he said casually enough interested in baseball baseball hsi said as though there had been nothing incongruous about the question why theres a little league game this afternoon back of the school on punahou and wilder i thought i might stop by then we can come back and pick up the rest of your gear two oclock hope ill see you chandler walked away thoughtfully something in hsis attitude suggested more than a ball game after a quick and poor lunch he decided to go the field was a dirty playground scuffed out of what had probably once been an attractive campus the players were tenyearolds of the mixture of hair colors and complexions typical of the islands chandler was puzzled surely even the wildest baseball rooter wouldnt go far out of his way for this and yet there was an audience of at least fifty adults watching the game and none seemed to be related to the ballplayers the little leaguers played grave careful ball and the audience watched them without a word of parental encouragement or joy hsi approached him from the shadow of the school building glad you could make it chandler no no questions just watch in the fifth inning with the score aggregating around thirty there was an interruption a tall redheaded man glanced at his watch licked his lips took a deep breath and walked out onto the diamond he glanced at the crowd while the kids suspended play without surprise then the redheaded man nodded to the umpire and stepped off the field the ballplayers resumed their game but now the whole attention of the audience was on the redheaded man suspicion crossed chandlers mind in a moment it was confirmed as the redheaded man raised his hands waist high and clasped his right hand around his left wristonly for a moment but that was enough the ball game was a cover chandler was present at a meeting of what hsi had called the society of slaves the underground that dared to pit itself against the execs hsi cleared his throat and said this is the one i vouch for him and that was startling too chandler thought because all these wristcircled men and women were looking at him all right said the redheaded man nervously lets get started then first thing anybody got any weapons sure take a lookwe dont want any slipups turn out your pockets there was a flurry and a woman near chandler held up a key ring with a tiny knife on it penknife hell yes get rid of it throw it in the outfield you can pick it up after the meeting a hundred eyes watched the pearly object fly we ought to be all right here said the redheaded man the kids have been playing every day this week and nobody looked in but watch your neighbor see anything suspicious dont wait dont take a chance holier kill the umpire or anything you like but holier good and loud he paused breathing hard all right hsi introduce him the parts man took chandler firmly by the shoulder this fellow has something for us he said hes working for the exec koitska building what cant be anything else but a duplicate of the machine that they use to control us chandler was jolted out of his detached calm hey he cried i never said anything like that you didnt have to hsi said tightly what the hell do you think i am an idiot ive filled all your parts orders remember its higher frequency but otherwise its a duplicate of the master transmitter but they never told me told you did they have to tell you what else would they be so busy at chandler hesitated staring around the words had been actually frightening and yetand yet he realized he had been sure within himself that the project he was working on was something very like that a duplicate of the con trolling machine and that meant a tail thin bearded man was moving forward staring at chandler angrily he said dangerously you dont seem too reliable friend which side are you on chandler shrugged whyyours of course i guess i mean you guess hub the man nodded then leaned for ward and peered furiously into chandlers face look at his head he cried his face only inches away from chandlers own dont you see hes branded chandler fell back touching his scar the man followed damned hoaxer look at him the lowest species of life on the face of the earthsomeone who pretended to be possessed in order to do some damned dirty act what was it hoaxer murder burning babies alive hsi economically let go of chandlers shoulder half turned the bearded man with one hand and swung with the other knocking him down shut up linton wait till you hear what hes got for us the bearded man sprawling and groggy slowly rose as hsi explained tersely what he had guessed of chandlers workas much as chandler himself knew it seemed maybe this is only a duplicate maybe it wont be used but maybe it willand chandlers the man who can sabotage it how would you like that the exec switch ing over to this equipment while the other one is down for maintenanceand their headsets dont work there was a terrible silence except for the sounds of the children playing ball two runs had just scored chandler recognized the silence it was hope linton broke it his blue eyes gleaming above the beard no better than that why wait we can use this fellows machine set it up get us some headsetsand we can control the execs themselves the silence was even longer then there was a babble of discussion but chandler did not take part in it he was thinking it was a tremendous thought suppose a man like himself were actually able to do what they wanted of him never mind the practical difficultieslearning how it worked getting a headset bypassing the traps koitska would surely have set to prevent just that never mind the penalties for failure suppose he could make it work and find fifty headsets and fit them to the fifty men and women here in this clandestine meeting of the society of slaves would there after all be any change worth mentioning in the state of the world or was lord acton always and everywhere right power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely the power locked in the coronets of the exec was more than flesh and blood could stand he could almost sense the rot in those near him at the mere thought but hsi was throwing cold water on the idea sorry but i know that much one exec cant control another the headpieces insulate against control well he glanced at his watch we agreed on twenty minutes maximum for this meeting he reminded the redheaded man who nodded youre right he glanced around the group ill make the rest of it fast news you all know they got some more of us last week have you all been by the monu ment three of our comrades were still there this morning but i dont think they know were organized they think its only individual acts of sabotage in case any of you dont know the execs cant read our minds not even when theyre controlling us proof is were all still alive hanrahan knew practically every one of us and hes been lying out there for a week with a broken back ever since they caught him trying to blow up the guard pits at east gate they had plenty of chance to pump him if they could they cant next thing no more individual attacks on one exec not unless its a matter of life and death and even then youre wasting your time unless youve got a gun they can grab your mind faster than you can cut a throat third thing dont get the idea there are good execs and bad execs once they put that thing on their heads theyre all the same fourth thing you cant make deals they arent that worried so if anybodys thinking of selling outim not saying anyone isforget it he looked around anything else what about germ warfare in the water supply some body ventured still looking into it no report yet all right thats enough for now meetings adjourned watch the ball game for a while then drift away one at a time hsi was the first to go then a couple of women togeth er then a sprinkling of other men chandler still numbed by the possibility that had opened before him was in no particular hurry although it seemed time to leave anyway the ball game appeared to be over a tenyearold with freckles on his face was at the plate but he was leaning on his bat staring at chandler with wide serious eyes chandler felt a sudden chill he turned began to walk awayand felt himself seized he walked slowly into the schoolhouse unable to look around behind him he heard a confused sob tears and a childs voice trying to blubber through something funny happened if the child had been an adult it might have been warning enough but the child had never experienced possession before was not sure enough was not clear enough chandler was clear into the schoolhouse before the remaining members of the society of slaves awoke to their danger he heard a quick cry of they got him then chandlers legs stopped walking and he addressed himself savagely a few yards away a stout chinese lady was mopping the tiles she looked up at him startled but no more startled than chandler was himself you idiot chandler blazed why do you have to get mixed up in this dont you know its wrong love stay here chan dler commanded himself dont you dare leave this build ing and he was free again but there was a sudden burst of screams from outside bewildered chandler stood for a moment as little able to move as though the girl still had him under control then he leaped through a classroom to a window staring outside in the playground there was wild confusion half the spectators were on the ground trying to rise as he watched a teenage boy buried himself at an elderly lady the two of them falling another man flung himself to the ground a woman swung her pocketbook into the face of the man next to her one of the fallen ones rose only to trip himself again it was a mad spectacle but chandler understood it what he was watching was a single member of the execs trying to keep a group of twenty ordinary un armed human beings in line the exec was leaping from mind to mind even so the crowd was beginning to scatter without thought chandler started to leap out to help them but the possessor had anticipated that he was caught at the door he whirled and ran toward the wom an with the mop as he was released the woman flung herself upon him knocking him down by the time he was able to get up again it was far too late to help if there ever had been a time when he could have helped he heard shots two policemen had come running into the playground guns drawn the exec who had looked at him out of the boys eyes who had penetrated this nest of enemies and extricated chandler from it had taken first things first help had been summoned quick as the coronets worked it was no time at all until the nearest persons with weapons were located commandeered and in action two minutes later there no longer was resistance obviously more execs had come to help attracted by the commotion perhaps or summoned at some stolen moment after the meeting had first been invaded there were only five survivors on the field each was clearly controlled they rose and stood patiently while the two police shot them shot them paused to reload and shot again the last to die was the bearded man linton and as he fell his eyes brushed chandlers chandler leaned against a wall it had been a terrible sight the nearness of his own death had been almost the least of it far worse far more damagingand how many times had it tortured him nowwas the death of hope for one moment there he had seen a vision of freedom again him on the island of hilo somehow magically gimmicking the controlling ma chine that gave the executive committee its power here in honolulu the society of slaves somehow magically using the hour of freedom he gave them to destroy their oppres sors but it was all gone now and it would not come again his own escape was both miraculous and very likely only a temporary thing he had no doubt of the identity of the exec who had interfered to save him and had destroyed the others though he had heard the voice only as it came from his own mouth he could not mistake it it was rosalie pan he looked out at the redheaded man sprawled across the foul line behind third base and remembered what he said there werent any good execs or bad execs there were only execs xiii whatever chandlers life might be worth he knew he had given it away and the girl had given it back to him he did not see her for several days but the morning after the massacre he woke to find a note beside his bed table no one had been in the room it was his own sleeping hand that had written it though the girls mind had moved his fingers if you get mixed up in anything like that again i wont be able to help you so dont those people are just using you you know dont throw away your chances do you like surfboarding rosie but by then there was no time for surfboarding or for anything else but work the construction job on hilo had begun and it was a nightmare he was flown to the island with the last load of parts no execs were present in the flesh but on the first day chandler lost count of how many different minds possessed his own he began to be able to recognize them by a limp as he walked by tags of german as he spoke by a stutter a distinctive gesture of annoyance an expletive as he was a trained engineer he was left to labor by himself for hours on end it was worse for the others in the construction crew there seemed to be a dozen execs hovering invisible around all the time no sooner was a worker released by one than he was seized by another the work progressed rapidly but at the cost of utter exhaustion by the end of the fourth day chandler had eaten only two meals and could not remember when he had slept last he found himself staggering when free and furious with the fatigueclumsiness of his own body when possessed at sundown on the fourth day he found himself free for a moment and incredibly without work of his own to do just then until someone else completed a job of patch wiring he stumbled out into the open air and had time only to gaze around for a moment before his eyes began to close he had time to think that this must once have been a lovely island even unkempt as it was the trees were tall and beautiful beyond them a wisp of smoke was pale against the darkblue evening sky the breeze was scent ed he woke and found he was already back in the building reaching for his soldering gun there came a point at which even the will of the execs was unable to drive the flogged bodies farther and then they were pefmitted to sleep for a few hours at daybreak they were awake again the sleep was not enough the bodies were slow and inaccurate two of the hawaiians straining a hundred pound component into place staggered slippedand dropped it appalled chandler waited for them to kill themselves but it seemed that the execs were tiring too one of the hawaiians said irritably with an accent chandler did not recognize thats pan all right you morons youve won yourselves a vacation well have to fly you in replace ments take the day off and incredibly all eleven of the haggard wrecks stumbling around the building were free at once the first thought of every man was to eat to relieve himself to remove a shoe and ease a blistered footto do any of the things they had not been permitted to do the second thought was sleep chandler dropped off at once but he was overtired he slept fitfully and after an hour or two of turning on the hard ground sat up blinking redeyed around he had been slow the cushioned seats in the aircraft and cars were already taken he stood up stretched scratched himself and wondered what to do next and he remem bered the thread of smoke he had seenwhen three nights agoagainst the evening sky in all those hours he had not had time to think one obvious thought there should have been no smoke there the island was supposed to be deserted it was of no importance of course what could it matter to him but he had nothing else to do he stood up looked around to get his bearings and started off in the direction be remembered it was good to own his body again in poor condition as it was it was delicious to be allowed to think consecu tive thoughts the chemistry of the human animal is such that it heals whatever thrusts it may receive from the outside world short of death its only incapacitating wound comes from itself from the outside it can survive astonishing blows rise again and flourish chandler was not flourishing but be had begun to rise time had been so compressed and blurred in the days since the slaughter at the punahou school that he had not had time to grieve over the deaths of his briefly met friends or even to think of their quixotic plans against the execs now he began to wonder he understood with what thrill of hope he had been receiveda man like themselves not an exec whose touch was at the very center of the exec power but how firm was that touch was there really anything he could do it seemed not he barely understood the mechanics of what he was doing far less the theory belund it con ceivably knowing where this installation was he could somehow get back to it when it was completed in theory it might be that there was a way to dispense with the headsets and exert power from the big board itself a piltdowner at the controls of a nuclearladen jet bomber could destroy a city nothing stopped him noth ing but his own invincible ignorance chandler was that piltdowner certainly power was here to grasp but he had no way of knowing how to pick it up stillwhere there was life there was hope he decided he was wasting time that would not come again he had been wandering along a road that led into a small town quite deserted but this was no time for wandering his place was back at the installation studying scheming trying to understand all he could he began to turn and stopped great god he sad softly looking at what he had just seen the town was deserted of life but not of death there were bodies everywhere they were long dead perhaps years they seemed natu ral and right as they lay there it was not surprising they had escaped his notice at first little was left but bones and an occasional desiccated leathery rag that might have been a face the clothing was faded and rotted away but enough was left of the bodies and the clothes to make it clear that none of these people had died natural deaths a rusted blade in a chest cage showed where a knife had pierced a heart a small skull near his feet with a scrap of faded blue rompers near it was shattered on a flagstone terrace a family group of bones lay radiating outward like a rosette something had exploded there and caught them all as they turned to flee there was a womans face grained like oak and eyeless visible between the fender of a truck and a crushedin wall like exhumed pompeii the tragedy was so ancient that it aroused only wonder the whole town had been blotted out the execs did not take chances apparently they had sterilized the whole islandprobably had sterilized all of them except oahu itself to make certain that their isola tion was complete except for the captive stock allowed to breed and serve them in and around honolulu chandler prowled the town for a quarter of an hour but one street was like another the bodies did not seem to have been disturbed even by animals but perhaps there were none big enough to show traces of such work something moved in a doorway chandler thought at once of the smoke he had seen but no one answered his call and though he searched he could neither see nor hear anything alive the search was a waste of time it also wasted his best chance to study the thing he was building as he returned to the cinderblock structure at the end of the airstrip he heard motors and looked up to see a plane circling in for a landing he knew that he had only a few minutes he spent those minutes as thriftily as he could but long before he could even grasp the circuitry of the parts he had not himself worked on he felt a touch at his mind the plane was rolling to a stop he and all of them hurried over to begin unloading it the plane was stopped with one wingtip almost touch ing the building heading directly into itconvenient for unloading but a foolish nuisance when it came time to turn it and take off again chandlers mind thought while his body lugged cartons out of the plane but he knew the answer to that takeoff would be no problem any more than it would for the other small transports at the far end of the strip these planes were not going to return ever the work went on and then it was done or all but and chandler knew no more about it than when it wa begun the last little bit was a careful check of line voltages and balancing of biases chandler could help only up to a point and then two execs working through the bodies of one of the hawaiians and the pilot of a piper tripacer who bad flown in some lastminute test equipmentand remained as part of the labor pool laboriously worked on the final tests spent the other men flopped to the ground waiting they were far gone all of them chandler as much as the others but one of them rolled over grinned tightly at chandler and said its been fun my names bradley i always think people ought to know each others names in cases like thisimagine sharing a grave with some utter stranger grave bradley nodded like pharaohs slaves the pyramid is just about finished friend you dont know what im talking about he sat up plucked the end of a tall blade of stemmy grass and put it between his teeth i guess you havent seen the corpses in the woods chandler said i found a town half a mile or so over there nothing in it but skeletons no heavens nothing that ancient these are nice fresh corpses out behind the junkheap there well not fresh theyre a couple of weeks old i thought it was neat of the execs to dispose of the usedup labor out of sight of the rest of us so much better for morale until juan simoa and i went back looking for a plain simple electrical extension cord and found them with icy calm chandler realized that the man was talking sense usedup labor the men who had unloaded the first planes no doubtworked until they dropped then efficiently disposed of as they were so cheap a commodity that they were not worth the trouble of haul ing back to honolulu for salvage i see he said be sides dead men tell no tales ami spread no disease probably thats why they did their killing back in the tall trees always the chance some exec might have to come down here to inspect in person rotting corpses just arent sanitary bradley grinned again i used to be a doctor at molokai lep began chandler but the doctor shook his head no no never say leprosy its hansens disease whatever it is the execs were sure scared of it they wiped out every patient we had except a couple who got away by swimming then for good measure they wiped out most of the medical staff too except for a couple like me who were offisland and had the sense to keep quiet about where theyd worked right down the beach it was chandler said i was back in the village today i thought i saw someone still alive you think it might be one of the lepers its possible but dont worry said the doctor rolling over on his back and putting his hands behind his head dont let a little hansens disease scare you we suffer from an infection far worse than that he yawned and said drowsily you know in the old days i used to work on pestcontrol for the public health service we sure knocked off a lot of rats and fleas i never thought id be one of them he was silent chandler looked at him more closely and admired his courage very much the man had fallen asleep chandler looked at the others you going to let them kill us without a struggle he demanded the remaining hawaiian was the only one to answer malihini he said you just dont know how much pilikia youre in it isnt what we let them do well see chandler promised grimly theyre only human i havent given up yet but in the end he could not save himself it was the girl who saved him that night chandler tossed in troubled sleep and woke to find himself standing walking toward the tripacer the sun was just beginning to pink the sky and no one else was moving sorry love he apologized to himself you probably need to bathe and shave but i dont know how shave i mean he giggled anyway youll find everything you need at my house he climbed into the plane ever fly before he asked himself well youll love it here we goclose the door snap the belt turn the switch he admired the practiced ease with which his body started the motor raced it with a critical eye on the instruments turned the plane and lifted it off up into the rising sun oh dear you do need a bath he told himself wrinkling his nose humorously no harm ive the nicest tubpink deepand nine kinds of bath salts but i wish you werent so tired love because its a long flight and youre wearing me out he was silent as he bent to the correct compass heading and cranked a handle over his head to adjust the trim koitskas going to be so huhlt he said smiling never fear love i can calm him down but its easier to do with you in one piece you know the other ways too late he was silent for a long time and then his voice began to sing they were songs from rosalies own musical comedies even with so poor an instrument as chandlers voice to work with she sang well enough to keep both of them entertained while his body brought the plane in for a land ing and so chandler went to live in the villa that belonged to rosalie pan xiv love she said there are worse things in the world than keeping me amused when im not busy well go to the beach again one day soon i promise and she was gone again it was like that every day chandler was a concubinenot even that he was a male geisha convenient to play gin rummy with or for company on the surfboards or to make a drink he did not quite know what to make of himself in bad times one hopes for survival he had hoped and now he had survival perfumed and cushioned but on what mad terms rosalie was apretty girl and a goodhumored one she was right there were worse things in the world than being her companion but chandler could not adjust him self to the role it angered him when she got up from the garden swing and locked herself in her roomfor he knew that she was not sleeping as she lay there though her eyes were closed and she was motionless it infuriated him when she casu ally usurped his body to bring an ashtray to her side or to stop him when his hands presumed and it drove him nearly wild to be a puppet with her friends working his strings he was that most of all one exec who wished to communicate with another cast about for an available human proxy nearby chandler served for rosie pan her telephone her social secretary and on occasion he was the garment her dates put on for rosalie was one of the few execs who cared to conduct any major part of her life in her own skin she liked dancing she enjoyed dining out it was her pleasure to display herself to the worshippers at luigi the wharf rats and to speed down the long comb ers on a surfboard when another exec chose to accompa ny her it was chandlers body which gave the remote date flesh he ate very well indeedin surprising variety he drank heavily sometimes and abstained others once in the per son of a moroccan exec he smoked an opium pipe once he dined on roasted puppy he saw many interesting things and when rosalie was occupied without him he had the run of her house her music library her pantry and her books he was not mistreated he was pampered and praised and every night she kissed him before she retired to her own room with the snaplock on the door he was miserable he prowled the house in the nights after she had left him unable to sleep it had been bad enough on hilo under the hanging threat of death but then though he was only a slave he was working at something that used his skill and training now now a pekingese could do nearly all she wanted of him he despised in himself the knowledge that with a pekingeses cunning he was contriving to make himself indispensable to herher slippers fetched in his teeth his silky mane by her hand to strokeif not these things in actuality then their very near equivalents but what else was there for him there was nothing she had spared his life from koit ska and if he offended her koitskas sentence would be carried out even dying might be better than this he thought indeed it might be better even to go back to honolulu and life in the morning he woke to find himself climbing the wide carpeted steps to her room she was not asleep it was her mind that was guiding him he opened the door she lay with a feathery coverlet pulled up to her chin eyes open head propped on three pillows as she looked at him he was free something the matter love you fell asleep sitting up sorry she would not be put off she made him tell her his resentments she was very understanding and very sure as she said youre not a dog love i wont have you thinking that way youre my friend dont you think i need a friend she leaned forward her nightgown was very sheer but chandler had tasted that trap before and he averted his eyes you think its all fun for us i understand tell me if you thought i was doing important workoh crucial work lovewould you feel a little easier because i am weve got the whole work of the island to do and i do my share weve got our plans to make and our future to provide for there are so few of us a single hbomb could kill us all do you think it isnt work keeping that bomb from ever coming here theres all honolulu to monitor for they know about us there we cant let some disgusting nitwits like your society of slaves destroy us theres the problems of the world to see to why she said with pride weve solved the whole indianpakistani population problem in the last two months theyll not have to worry about famine again for a dozen generations were working on china now next japan nextoh all the world well have threequarters of the lumps gone soon and the rest will have space to breathe in its work she saw his expression and said earnestly no dont think that you call it murder it is of course but its the surgeons knife were quicker and less painful than starva tion love and if some of us enjoy the work of weeding out the unfit does that change anything it does not i admit some of us are well mean but not all and were improving the new people we take in are better than the old she looked at him thoughtfully for a moment then she shook her head never mind she said apparently to herself forget it love go like an angel and fetch us both some coffee like an angel he went not he thought bitterly like a man she was keeping something from him and he was too stubborn to let her tease him out of his mood every things a secret he complained and she patted his cheek it has to be that way she was quite serious this is the biggest thing in the world im fond of you love but i cant let that interfere with my duty shto rosie said chandlers mouth thickly oh there you are andrei she said and spoke quick ly in russian chandlers brows knotted in a scowl and he barked nyeh mozhet bit andrei she said gently ya vas sprashniva yoo nyet no andrei rumble grumble chandlers body twitchedand fumed he heard his own name in the argument but what the subject matter was he could not tell rosalie was coaxing koitska was refusing but he was weakening after min utes chandlers shoulders shrugged he nodded and he was free have some more coffee love said rosalie pan with an air of triumph chandler waited he did not understand what was going on it was up to her to enlighten him and finally she smiled and said perhaps you can join us love dont say yes or no it isnt up to you and besides you cant know whether you want it or not until you try so be patient a moment chandler frowned then felt his body taken his lips barked khorashaw his body got up and walked to the wall of rosalies room a picture on the wall moved aside and there was a safe flick flick chandlers own fingers dialed a combination so rapidly that he could not follow it the door of the safe opened and chandler was free and rosalie excitedly leaping out of the bed behind him careless of the wisp of nylon that was her only garment crowding softly warmly past him to reach inside the safe she lifted out a coronet very like her own she paused and looked at chandler you cant do anything to harm us with this one love she warned do you understand that i mean dont get the idea that you can tell anyone anything or do some thing violent you cant ill be right with you and koitska will be monitoring the transmitter she handed him the coronet now when you see something interesting you move right in youll see how its the easiest thing in the world and oh here put it on chandler swallowed with difficulty she was offering him the tool that had given the execs the world a blunter weaker tool than her own no doubt but still it was power beyond his imagining he stood there frozen as she slipped it on his head sprung elec trodes pressed gently against his temples and behind his ears she touched something chandler stood motionless for a moment and then without effort floated free of his own body floating floating a jellyfish floating trailing tentacles that whipped and curled floating over the sandbound claws and chitin that clashed beneath floating over the worlds people and them not even knowing not even seeing chandler floated he was up out and away he was drifting around him was nocolor he saw nothing of space or size he only saw or did not see but feltsmelledtasted people they were the sandbound they were the creatures that crawled and struggled below and his tentacles lashed out at them beside him floated another the girl it had a shape but not a human shapea cinctured arearule shape female yes undoubtedly the girl it waved a member at him and he understood he was beckoned he followed two of the sandbound ones were ahead the female shape slipped into one he into the other it was as easy to invest this form with his own will as it was to order the muscles of his hand they looked at each other out of sandbound eyes youre a boy chandler laughed the girl laughed youre an old washerwoman they were in a kitchen where fish simmered on an electric stove the boyrosie wrinkled hisher nose biinked and was empty only the small almondeyed boy was left and he began to cry convulsively chandler understood he floated out after her this way this way she gestured a crowd of mudbound figures she slipped into one he into another they were in a bus now rocking along an inland road all men all roughly dressed laborers going to clear a new section of oahu of its splitlevel debris chandler thought and looked for the girl in one of the mens eyes could not find her hesitated andfloated she was hovering impatiently this way he followed and followed they were a hundred people doing a hundred things they lingered a few moments as a teenage couple holding hands in the twilight of the beach they fled from a room where chandler was an old woman dying on a bed and rosalie a stolid uncaring nurse beside her they played followtheleader through the audience of a honolulu movie theater and sought each other laughing among the fish stalls of king street then chandler turned to rosalie to speak and it all went out the scene disap peared he opened his eyes and he was back in his own flesh he was lying on the pastel pile rug in rosalies bed room he got up rubbing the side of his face he had tum bled it seemed rosalie was lying on the bed in a mo ment she opened her eyes well love he said hoarsely what made it stop she shrugged koitska turned you off tired of moni toring us i expectits been an hour im surprised his patience lasted this long she stretched luxuriously but he was too full of what had happened even to see the white grace of her body did you like it love she asked would you like to have it forever for nine days chandlers status remained in limbo he spent those days in a state of numb detachment remember ing the men and women he had worn like garments appalled and exhilarated he did not see rosalie again that day she kept to her room and he was locked out he was still a lapdog but he was a lapdog with a dream dangling before him he went to sleep that night thinking that he was a dog who might yet become a god and had eight days left the next day rosalie wheedled another hour of the coronet from koitska she and chandler explored the ice caves on mount rainier wearing the bodies of two sick and dying hermits they had found inhabiting a half destroyed inn on its slopes the mountain wore its cloudy flag of ice crystals in a bleak pale evening the air was thin and stinging and their borrowed bodies ached they left them and found two others twentyfive hundred miles to the east and wandered arm in arm under stars neared the destroyed international bridge at niagara breathing the spray of the unchanging falls they came back in a flash when koitskas patience ran out again and sprawled on her hot dry lawn and he had seven days left they passed like a dream chandler saw a great deal of the inner workings of the exec he had privileges for he was up for membership in the club rosalie had proposed him he talked with two czechoslovakian ballet dancers in their personslean dark girls who laughed and frowned alternatelyand with a succession of heavily accented russians and poles and japanese who came to him only through the mouth of the beach boyservant who worked on rosalies garden chandler thought they liked him he was pleased that he had penetrated where he had not been allowed before until he realized that these freedoms were in themselves a threat they allowed him this contact for a reason they were looking him over if their final decision was to reject him as it well might be they would have to kill him because he had seen too much but he had little time to dwell on fears of the future the present was crowded on the fourth day one of the members of the exec invited him to join them youll do for a gang boss shandalerra he said through the beach boys mouth and once again chandler found himself working on an executive committee project though no one had told him what it was he swam up into the strange thin sea of the mind in company with a dozen others and they arrowed through emptiness to a place chandler could not recognize he watched the others spiral down and slip into the bodies of the tiny mud dwelling dolls that were human beings when they were all gone he sought a dollbody of his own he opened his eyes on a bleak snowladen arctic dawn a shrieking blast from the north pole was driving particles of gritty ice into his eyes his ears the loose quilted clothes his body wore the temperature he was sure was far below zero the cold made his teeth ache filled his eyes with tears all around him great floodlights mounted on poles cast a harsh glare over a hundred acres of barren earth stud ded with sheds and concrete pillboxes heaped over with dirt and snow in the center of the great lighted icedesert loomed a skeletal steel object that looked like a madly displaced skyscraper it rose hundreds of feet into the air its top beyond the range of the floodlights its base fogged by driving snow chandler looked again no it was not a single skyscraper but two of them two tall steel towers one like an elon gated projectile standing on its tail the other like the eiffel tower torn out of context someone caught chandlers arm and bellowed hoarsely come on darling that is you isnt it come over here where djelenkos handing out the guns he recognized rosalie clad in the corpus of a siberian yakherder and followed her docilely toward a man who was unlocking a concrete bunker it was not only the girl he had recognized with an active shock of surprise he saw that the twin towers were a rocket and its gantry by the size of it an orbital rocket at the least i didnt think there were any satellites left he bel lowed into the flat dirty ear that was at present the prop erty of rosalie pan the broad darkbrowed face turned toward him thisuns about the last i guess she shouted wouldnt be out in this mess otherwise miserable weather aint it she pushed him toward the bunker go see djelenko love faster we get to work faster we get this over with but djelenko was shouting something at them that chandler could not understand oh damn cried rosalie love you went and got yourself the wrong body this chaps one of the old experts zip out of it and pick yourself a nice mongol like mine confused chandler brought his bodys fist up before his eyes the hand was calloused scarred and twisted with coldand one finger its nail mashed was trying its best to hurt in the numbing chill of the siberian airbut the fingers had started out to be long and white they were not the blunt fists of the yakherders sorry shouted chandler and took himself out of the body what price the orphalese what price the murder of so many innocents including his own wife for them and all of them chandler did not have a thought this was his tryout at the spring training of the team his first day on the new job conscientiously he was attempting to acquire the knack of being a demon if he regretted anything at this moment it was only his own lack of expertise he wished he were a better demon than he was he hung irresolute in the queemess of this luminous distorted sea he saw the sanddweller he had just quit moving in its shapeless way toward the place where he knew the gantries stood there were others like it aboutbut which should he enter he swore to himself no doubt there were recognition marks that were easy enough to find neither rosalie nor the other members of the exec seemed to have much difficulty making their way about but he lacked pieces for the puzzle and he was confused he reasoned the pattern out the gantries meant a rocket flight the european body he had tenanted for a moment was not native to the region a slave expert no doubt once perhaps an official on this project and now impressed into the service of the executive committee no doubt the mongols were mere warm bodies casually commandeered from their nearby villages to be used for haulandlift labor as need be probably the largest groups of dollbodies would be the mongols so he selected one at random entered it and stood up again into the noise and pain of the freezing gale he had a pick in his hand there were forty or fifty like him in this work crew digging with antlike tenacityand antlike resultsinto the flinty frozen ground apparently they were trying to set stakes to help moor the gantries against the gale he dropped the pick and rubbed numbed fingers to gether he realized at once that he had not chosen a very good body for one thing it had a squint which made everything look fuzzy and doubled until he learned to adjust to it he was almost blind for another it ached with the effects of a very long time of forced labor and hunger and it was lousy well he thought i can stand anything for a while lets get to work and then he saw that a body very like his ownbut a body which was inhabited by a member of the exec since it was carrying a riflegestured to him screaming something he could not understand he doesnt know i am me thought chandler half amused he started toward the rifleman wait a minute he called im chandler im ready to go to work if youll just tell me what tohey wait he was very surprised to see that the rifleman was not even making an attempt to understand him the figure raised its rifle pointed it at him and fired that was all chandler was very seriously annoyed it was a clear careless matter of mistaken identity he thought angrily how stupid of the man he felt the first shock of the bullet entering his body but did not wait for more he did not linger to taste death or even pain before either could reach his mind he was up and out of the body again fuming and mad stupid he thought somebody ought to get called down for this a dizzying sense of falling a soundless explosion of light then he was back in a body his own he picked himself up and stood looking out of rosalie pans picture window onto the thin green lawn still angry he had been turned off somehow koitska or whatever other member of the executive committee had been watching over him had observed his blundering his relay coronet had been turned off and he was back in hawaii well he thought grudgingly that part was all right he probably was better off out of the wayat least if they didnt have sense enough to brief him ahead of time but the rest of the affair was plain stupidity he had been frozen scared and pushed about for nothing he rubbed his ear angrily it was soft and warm not the chilled numbed thing he had worn moments before he muttered imprecations at the damned foolishness of the executive committee if he couldnt run things better than they he told himself he would just give up ten or fifteen minutes later it occurred to him that he had not after all been the greatest loser from that particu lar blunder a few minutes later still something else occurred to him he was not merely beginning to live the life of the execs he was beginning to think like them too an hour later rosalie came lightly down the stairs yawning and stretching love she cried catching sight of chandler you really screwed that one up cant you tell a kraut missile expert from a mongolian cowboy chandler said glumly no she said consolingly but with a touch of annoyance too oh dont be frightful love i know it was a disap pointment but it mustve disappointed the man i got killed too said chandler you are being frightful well i understand she pat ted his arm its the waiting its so nervousmaking embarrassing too how would you know why love she said dont you think i went through it myself but it passes dear it passes meanwhile come have a drink moodily chandler allowed the girl to soothe him al though he thought she was taking far too light a view of it he accepted the scotch from her and tasted it without comment is something wrong with it love he said patiently you know i dont like too much water in a drink im sorry love he shrugged well he thought she was right in a way he was indeed being frightful he did not see why she would respond with annoyance however he had a right to act a little odd when he was after all betraying all of his friends even the memory of his dead wife she certainly could not expect him to take all of that in his stride without a moments regret rosalie yawned and smothered it im sorry love funny how it tires you out to work in somebody elses body yes oh really now she was angry at last for cats sake love mooning around like a puppy thats been swatted for making a mess he said im sorry if i have been in any way annoying to come off it this is rosie youre talking to she cradled his head in her arm like a motheran irritated mother but a mother smarter are you scared he put down the scotch and admitted a little bit i think so well why didnt you say so dear heart everybodys scared waiting for the votes to come in very nervous making waiting to know he demanded when will i know she hesitated im not supposed to discuss some things with you love you know that not yet when rosie she capitulated well i dont suppose it makes much difference under the circumstances he knew what circumstances she meant so ill tell you that much anyway see love you need a little over seven hundred votes to get in thats a lot isnt it but thats the rules of the game and right now you have lets see her eyes glazed for a moment chandler knew that she was looking out at something else through some clerks vision somewhere on the islandor somewhere in the world right now you have about a hundred and fifty takes time doesnt it thats a hundred and fifty to let me in right and how many no votes she patted his hand and said gently none of those love you wouldnt ever have but one she got up and refilled his drink never fear dear she said rosies on your side and now lets have something to eat eh and he had seven days left xvi time passed chandler wheedled information out of ros alie until he had a clear picture of what he was up against twothirds of all the members of the executive committee had to cast an affirmative vote for him but they would vote in blocs rosalie promised get this one on his side and she would bring in fifty more get that one and he could deliver a hundred if there were a single blackball he was out and he had ten days to be ac cepted which were going fast very fast he had no idea that so many things could be done so rapidly he was meeting people by the dozen and score members of the exec who were rosalies personal friends all of them votes if he could please them he did everything he could think of to please them he was working toonot on the rocket project any more and not on any of the other offisland projects of the exec which was all right with him as he felt pretty sure that most of these involved selective murder and demolition but on little odds and ends of electronic jobs for koitska and others he was allowed to go into honolulu for more parts which the new owner of parts n plenty provided for him in silence her eyes were red with weeping she was hsis widow chandler tried to find something to say to her ran through every possible word in his vocabulary and left without speaking at all chandler knew that his very great measure of freedom was a dangerous sign koitska did not trouble to hide from him any more just what it was that they had built on hilo he even allowed chandler to do some patchcording and soldering on the installation in the former twa mes sage centerwatching him every minute gasping and snoring as he lay on his couch across the roomand made no effort to keep chandler from guessing that the hilo assembly was almost a duplicate of the one here hilo had more power chandler thought there had been some hint that more power was needed for the really remote control applications involved in the execudve committees mars project but basically it was only a standby checking current flows under koitskas eye chandler thought detachedly that it might just be possible if one were both daring and very lucky to overcome the exec destroy the installation find a way to hilo and destroy that one too one did not take that sort of risk lightly of course he acknowledged it was an easy way to get killed and he did not want to get killed he wanted to live very much as a member in good standing of the executive committee the russian pows who manned hitlers atlantic wall would have understood chandlers reasoning so would the americans who broadcast for the enemy in korea the ultimately important thing for any man was to stay alive chandler had not forgotten peggy flershem or the orphalese or hsi and his tortured friends around the monument he merely thought quite reasonably that he could do nothing to help them any more and meanwhile he had to pick up several hundred more votes or he would join them all in death he acknowledged that it was in some sense degrading that chances were the men and women he curried favor with today were perhaps the very ones who had shot ellen braisted in orphalese raped and murdered his wife through the person of his friend jack souther kidnaped the children who had flown across the pacific with him there was no sense in cataloguing all the possible abominations these men and women had committed he told himself firmly all that was as dead as hsi life was important on any terms life considered objectively the orphalese and the people in his own home town who had been destroyed by the execs were of no more importance than the stolid halffrozen siberians whom he had actually helped even if ineffec tually to work to death or the inhabitants of the destroyed village in hilo or the peaceful people of new york when the submarine exploded itself in the harbor or he sighed it was very difficult to stop making cata logues or to turn from that to a friendly smile and a gay friendshipwinning quip but he managed the task it revolted him said pooh bah but he did it when she could rosalie borrowed the use of a coronet for him and they roamed the world to night clubs in juarez and lamaseries under the himalayan peaks to every place that she thought might amuse and divert him on the fourth day she took him to a very special place indeed youll like it was all she would say oh i havent been there for months it was half a world away chandler had never learned to read the topologically insane patterns of grayed light but he knew it was very distant and it turned out in fact to be in italy they found bodies to wear and comman deered a boat and headed out over blue water rosalie claiming she knew where she was going but when after repeated sightings on the coast behind them she cut the little electric motor the water in which they drifted looked like any other water to chandler i hope you know what youre doing he said of course love and i adore your mustachios he preened them he rather fancied the body he had found too it had come with a gun and a plumed hat but he had discarded them on the beach where they found the boat rosalie had done herself well enough in a costume of flesh that was not more than eighteen years old not taller than five feet one and darkly beautiful she stood up rocking the boat everybody in the water she called last one ins a malihinil swimming swimming where he demanded she was already taking off her clothes the ruffled shirt the tore ador pants in brief underwear she climbed to the gunwale and tugged at his mustache straight down love youll like it he stood up and began taking off the coat and the uniform pants with their broad stripe of gold wait a minute he grumbled it always takes longer for a man to get his clothes off he doesnt get as much practice i suppose love youre terribly antiwoman follow me and she dived from the gunwale neat and clean heading down chandler followed he had never been a great swimmer and was in fact not very fond of water sports you cant get hurt he reminded himself as he swam down into the dark after the pale wriggling shape that was rosalies body but it felt as if he could get hurt he was ten yards down and fifteen and the end not in sight and he could feel his borrowed heart pounding and the carabinieris lungs craving to breathe the warm adriatic water was clouded and dim he could see nothing except for rosalie down belowno there was something else he could not be sure what something darker and square in out line rosalies slim pale form slipped under it and disap peared grimly chandler followed his muscles tiring his lungs bursting with the last of his strength he skirted the dark square thing and came up beneath it it was a thirtyfoot rectangle of metal he could see now pierced with dark ened windows swinging on long chains that stretched downward into invisibility where rosalie had gone there was a square of a different color it looked like a hatch it was a hatch he bobbed up through it and into a dark bubble of air puffing and gasping rosalie was there before him sprawled out of the water onto the metal deck wheezing like himself whew love she panted come on up youve done the hard part now lets see if i can find the lights the lights were tiny lanterns for which rosalie found flashlight cells somewhere they illuminated a chamber containing tables chairs beds racks of instruments cup boards of food isnt it nice love wasnt i lucky to find it chandler stared about beginning to breathe normally again what is it some sort of experiment i think she had found a mirror coated with grime and was scrubbing it clean with someones neatly folded sweatshirt people used to live here in the old days she said propping the mirror against a wall and pirouetting in front of it oh lovely really i looked a little bit like this once back inwell now what do we do she pressed her hair back squeezing water out of it why we rest for a minute love and if i can find it we drink some champagne and then we do something very nice chandler picked up a harpoon gun and put it down again he could not help wondering who had built this trapped bubble of underwater livingspace cousteau he said out loud remembering you mean that skindiver well no i dont think so love he was french but its the same idea she pro duced a bottle from a chest champagne she crowed just as i promised a bit warm im afraid but still itll give you heart for the next bit and whats that but she would not tell him only fussed over him while he popped the scarlet plastic cork out with his thumbs and retreated laughing from the gush of foam they drank out of a mug and a canteen cup chandler could not help prodding at her for information the boats going to be drifted away you know how do we get back oh love you do worry about the most peculiar things i do wish youd relax its not entirely easy he began but she flared at him oh come on i must say youve got a pretty but she relented almost at once im sorry for snapping at you i know its a scary time she sat down beside him her bare arm touching his and said we might as well finish the champagne before we go want me to tell you about when i went through it sure he said stirring the wine around in the glass and drinking it down hardly hearing what she said although the sound of her voice was welcome oh that lousy headdress it weighed twenty pounds and they put it on with hatpins he caressed her absent ly he had figured out that she was talking about the night new york was bombed i was in the middle of the big firstact curtain number when her face was strained even after years even now that she was herself one of the godlike oneswhen something took hold of me i ran off the stage and right out through the front door there was a cab waiting as soon as i got in i was free and the driver took off like a lunatic through the tunnel out to newark airport i tell you i was scared at the toll booth i screamed but myfriendlet go of the driver for a minute smashed a trailertruck into a police car and in the confusion we got away he took me over again at the airport i ran bare as a bird into a plane that was just ready to take off the pilot was under control we flew eleven hours and i wore that damn feather headdress all the way she held out her glass for a refill chandler busied himself opening the second bottle now she was talking about her friend i hadnt seen him in six years i was just a md living in islip he was with a russian trade commission next door in an old mansion well he was one of the ones back in russia that came up with these she touched her brow where her coronet usually rested so she said brightly he put me up for membership and by and by they gave me one you see its all very simple except the waiting chandler pulled her to him and made a toast your friend hes a nice guy she said moodily sipping her drink you know how careful i am about getting exercise and so on its partly because of him you would have liked him love onlywell it turned out that he liked me well enough but he began to like what he could get through the coronet a lot more he got fat a lot of them are awfully fat love she said seriously thats why they need people like me and you replacements heart trou ble liver trouble what can they expect when they lie in bed day in and day out taking their lives through other peoples bodies i wont let myself go that way its a temptation you know almost every day i find some poor woman on a diet and spend a solid hour eating cream puffs and gravies how they must hate me she grinned leaned back and kissed him chandler put his arms around the girl and returned the kiss hard she did not draw away she clung to him and he could feel in the warmth of her body the sound of her breath that she was responding and then she whispered not yet love and pushed him away time for water sports she cried getting to her feet youve loafed here long enoughnow let me show you whats fun ten minutes later wearing scuba gear rosalie had turned up from somewhere he was following her out through the grayish green sea after the first minute it was not like swimming at all for one thing you didnt feel wet and you were breath ing through the mask and the tube in your teeth it was interesting he thought but he could not help wondering if this was what rosalie had meant by fun they had weighted themselves with belts of metal slugs but he was still buoyant and had to fight continually against rising to the surface where rosalie seemed to have overweighted herself and kept sloping down toward the distant bottom swimming was slow especially as rosalie had insisted he carry a longbladed butcher knifein case of sharks love but still he was under the water and breathing he followed her expecting something but not knowing quite what there were sharks all right he had seen a dozen of them and there was something off to the side right now circling behind him almost invisible in the distance he regarded it with great suspicion and dislike even if you couldnt get really killed in a borrowed bodyyou your self couldnt he was not prepared to think about what happened to the prisoned owner of the bodythere were things that were not attractive about the prospect of great unseen jaws suddenly slicing a ham away rosalie half turned to him beckoned and started down dimly he could see the bottom now or at any rate something that was where the bottom ought to be rosalie was spinning there below him waiting for him it was quite dim this far from the surface of the sea but chandler could see the gleam of her eye and her cheerful wink behind the mask she stretched out a hand and pointed above him and behind chandler half turned to see there were five of the great shadowy bulks there now and they seemed to be moving toward him frantically he kicked and squirmed to face them but rosalie caught his arm she held him and gestured for him to hand her the knife chandler was frankly terrified every childhood fear sprang to life in him his breath caught his heart pounded something churned in his belly and forced its way into his throat it was no good telling himself that this was not really his body that his own flesh lay secure in a splitlevel living room twelve thousand miles away he cringed from the threat of the grim silent shapes and it was all he could do to stay in this threatened corpus to see what rosalie wanted to do he gave her the knife she glanced upward at the sharks calculatingly then pursed her lips winked blew him a kiss and neatly carefully sliced his airhose in two his oxygen blew out in a cascade of great wriggling bubbles water rushed in he felt her tearing his facemask off but water was already in his eyes mouth nose he coughed and strangled more startled than he had ever been in his life and then she touched his chest with the blade daintily and precisely fire leaped along his side and a cloud of blood began to diffuse through the water she ripped off her own facemask and slit a careful line across the eighteenyearolds borrowed abdomen then reached out her arms to him they kissed her arms locked around him like manacles he felt his lungs bursting as they kissed and spun thrashing through the water while the feathery clouds of blood spread out and as they turned chandler saw the great torpedo shapes now incredibly close coming toward them incredibly fast the last he saw was the great yawning grin of teeth and then he could not help it he fled he abandoned rosalie abandoned the borrowed body of the carabinieri fled and did not stop until he was back in his own flesh still frightened and violently ill xvii chandler could sleep only tardily that night and not well his sleep was punctuated with sudden wakenings illuminated with dreams ellen braisted came and spoke to him and margot his wife they did not threaten or terrify him they only looked at him with reproach and when he woke and it was broad daylight and the kanaka was whirring the lawnmower across the grass out side just as though no murders had been committed by the inmates of the house he slouched angrily around the living room for an hour and then began to drink by the time rosalie pan came downstairs yawning and looking slaked and contented he was drunk enough to coax her into breakfasting on bloody marys by the time she had had her third and no longer minded the fact that she had not eaten chandler was stumbling and stammering rosalie did not object perhaps she understood or understood at least that she had shown him something of herself that took getting used to even when the other members of the exec began calling in usually through the person of the beach boy who was her handyman she laughed and made excuses for chandler but when they were gonewhen it was only the kanaka who was in the room with them turning to leave with a tired fearshe reproached him gently not quite so much of the armaroundtheneck love do you mind i mean everything in its place you didnt mind yesterday said chandler sullenly oh really im not trying to reform you you know but these are members of the exec and you need then votes i certainly wouldnt want to behave badly in the pres ence of a member of the exec said chandler and lurched to the kitchen for another bottle he was at that stage of drunkenness when he felt he was not going to be able to get drunk he observed the symptoms of hands and feet and mouth and cursed the clarity of his brain that would not anesthetize him in the kitchen he paused staggered over to the sink and on impulse put his head under the coldwater tap when rosalie came looking for him minutes later she found him brewing coffee why thats better love she cried i thought you were going to drink the island dry he poured a cup of the stuff hot and black and began to swallow it in small painful gulps rosalie fetched a cup for herself added cream and sugar and sat at the table times wasting she said practically and you dont have the votes yet love i want you to work on koitska today tell him all about the geraniums and whatyoucall thems he can bring you fifty votes if he wants to chandler finished the coffee and poured another cup this time he added a generous shot of whiskey to it rosalie tightened her lips but only said then theres that bunch from the east coast the embassy girls and brad and tony theyve already voted but they could get out some more for you if you got them interested brads been a doll but the girls have all sorts of friends they havent done anything with chandler lit a cigarette and let her talk he knew it was important to him he knew she was trying to help him and indeed that without her help he was a dead man he simply could not bring himself to play up to her mood he stood up and said im going to take a bath and he left her sitting there and ten minutes later he came shouting into her room his body still wet from the shower wearing a pair of khaki shorts and nothing else who he cried who did you say whats the name of your friend rosalie sitting at her vanity mirror wearing nothing but underwear and her coronet took her hands away from her hair and looked at him love whats the matter answer me damn it brad brad who she said with little patience do you mean brad fe nell i must say the way youre acting i dont know why be should go out of his way whats the matter chandlers eyes were glaring and he had begun to shake he sat down limply on her bed staring at her you mean brad fenell is helping me if i get elected to the exec it will be because of brad fenell well love i have a little something to do with it too but brads been lovely chandler nodded lovely he said faintly a real doll you remember him dont you at the party night before last the little dark fellow i remember him and he did but he hadnt there for a while he hadnt remembered at all what ellen braisted had told him the brad fenell who had debased and tortured her who had finally murdered her was now a powerful friend there was a joke about that mused chandler with that sort of friend you didnt need any enemy but on all the executive committee what other sort of friend could there possibly be rosalies irritation was lost in alarm now something was clearly wrong with chandler she was in very little doubt what it was she knew nothing of ellen braisted but she knew enough of the exec in general herself includ ed to have a shrewd notion of what personal nerve had somehow been touched and she came over and sat beside him love she said gently its not as bad as you think there are good things too chandler said unrelentingly name one oh love dont be awful she put her arm around him its just another few days she soothed and then you can do what you like isnt that worth it i mean really what you like love a whole world to play in get thee behind me thought chandler numbly but she was right it was too bad but facts were facts he told himself reasonably goodby ellen he thought goodby margot and he turned to the girl beside him and stiffened and felt himself seized vi myenya zvali his own voice demanded harsh and mocking the girl tried to push him away her eyes were bright and huge staring at him andrei da andrei kok eto dosadno andrei please i know youre filthy screamed chandlers voice how can you i do not allow this carrion to touch you sonot vot is mine do not allow him to live and chandler dropped her and leaped to his feet he fought he struggled but only in his mind and help lessly his body carried him out of the room in spite of his struggles running and stumbling out into the drive into her waiting car and away he drove like a madman on roads he had never seen before the cars gears bellowed pain at their abuse the tires screamed chandler imprisoned inside himself recognized that touch koitska he knew who rosalie pans lover had been if he had been in doubt his own voice raucous and hysterical with rage told him the truth all that long drive it screamed threats and obscenities at him in russian and tortured english the car stopped in front of the twa facility and still imprisoned his body hurried in bruising itself deliberately against every doorpost and stick of furniture i could have smashed you in the car his voice screamed hoarsely it is too merciful i could have thrown you into the sea it is not painful enough in the garage his body stopped and looked wildly around knives torches his lips chanted shall i gouge out eyes slit throat a jar of battery acid stood on a shelf da da screamed chandler stumbling toward it one drink eh and i vont even stay vith you to feel it the painjust a momentthen it eats the guts the long slow dying and all the time the body that was chandlers was clawing the cap off the jar tilling it he dropped the jar and leaped aside instinctively as it splintered at his feet he was free before he could move he was seized again stumbled crashed into a wall and was free again he stood waiting for a moment unable to believe it but he was still free the alien invader did not seize his mind there was no sound no one moved no gun fired at him no danger threatened he was free he took a step turned shook his head and proved it he was free and in a moment realized that he was in the building with the fat bloated body of the man who wanted to murder him the body that in its own strength could scarcely stand erect it was suicide to attempt to harm an exec he would certainly lose his lifeexceptthat was gone already any how he had lost it he had nothing left to lose xvm chandler loped silently up the stairs to koitskas suite halfway up he tripped and sprawled half stunning himself against the stair rail it had not been his own clumsiness he was sure koitska had caught at his mind again but only feebly chandler did not wait whatever was interfering with koitskas control some distraction or malfunction of the coronet or whatever chandler could not bank on its lasting the door was locked he found a heavy mahogany chair with a back of solid carved wood he flung it onto his shoulders grunting and ran with it into the door a bull driven frantic lunging out of its querencia to batter the wall of the arena the door splintered chandler was gashed with long slivers of wood but he was through the door koitska lay sprawled along his couch eyes staring alive or dead chandler did not wait to find out but sprang at him with hands outstretched the staring eyes flickered chandler felt the pull at his mind but koitskas strength was almost gone the eyes glazed and chandler was upon him he ripped the coronet off and flung it aside and the huge bulk of koitska swung paralytically off the couch and fell to the floor the man was helpless he lay breathing like a steam engine one eye pressed shut against the leg of a coffee table the other looking up at chandler chandler was panting almost as hard as the helpless mass at his feet he was safe for a moment at the most for a moment for at any time one of the other execs might dart down out of the mindworld into the real looking at the scene through chandlers eyes and surely deducing what would be even less to his favor than the truth he had to get away from there if he seemed busy in another room perhaps they would go away again chandler turned his back on the paralyzed monster to flee it would be even better to try to lose himself in honoluluif he could get that farhe did not in his own flesh know how to fly the helicopter that was parked in the yard or he would try to get farther still but as he turned he was caught chandlers body turned to see koitska lying there and screamed his eyes were staring at koitska it was too late he was possessed by someone he did not know whom though it made little enough difference he thought watching his own hands reach out to touch the staring face his body straightened his eyes looked around the room he went to the desk love he cried to himself whats the matter with koitska write for gods sake and he took a pencil in his hand and was free he hesitated then scribbled i cmt know i think he had a stroke who are you the other mind slipped tentatively into his scanning the paper rosie you idiot who did you think he said furiously what have you done nothing he began instinctively then scratched the word out briskly and exactly he wrote he was going to kill me but he had some kind of an attack i took his coronet away i was going to run oh you fool he told himself shrilly a moment later chandlers body knelt beside the wheezing fat lump taking its pulse the faint fitful throb meant nothing to chan dler probably meant nothing to rosie either for his body stood up hesitated shook its head youve done it now hesobbed and was surprised to find he was weeping real tears oh love why i could have taken care of koitskasomehow no maybe i couldnt he said frantically breaking down i dont know what to do do you have any ideasoutside of running it took him several seconds to write the one word but it was really all he could find to write no his lips twisted as his eyes read the word well he said practically i guess thats the end love i mean i give up he got up turned around the room i dont know he told himself worriedly there might be a chanceif we could hush this up id better get a doctor hell have to use your body so dont be surprised if theres someone and it isnt me maybe he can pull andrei through maybe andreill forgive you then or if he dies chandlers voice schemed as his eyes stared at the rasping motionless hulk we can say you broke down the door to help him only youll have to put his coronet back on so it wont look suspicious besides that will keep anyone from occu pying him do that love hurry and he was free gingerly chandler crossed the floor he did not like to touch the dying animal that wheezed before him liked even less to give it back the weapon that if it had as much as five minutes of sentience again it would use to kill him but the girl was right without the helmet any wandering curious exec might possess koitska himself the helmet would shield him from would shield anyone from would shield even chandler himself from possession if he used it he did not hesitate he slipped the helmet on his head snapped the switch and in a moment stood free of his own body in the gray luminous limbo looking down at the pallid traceries that lay beneath he did not pause to think or plan it was as though he had planned every step in long detail over many years chandler for at least a few moments had the freedom to battle the execs on their own ground the freedom that any mourning parent or husband in the outside world would know well how to use chandler also knew how he was a weapon the coronet that he wore now was no limited moni tored slave device it was koitskas own while he wore it chandler could not be touched perhaps it was the aftermath of these wearing terrifying days perhaps it was the residual poison of his morning of drinking and night of little sleep chandler felt both placid and prepared there would be a way to use this weapon against the exec and he would find it margot ellen braisted meggie hsia billion othersall would be re venged he would very likely die for it but he was a dead man anyway in any case it was not a great thing to die millions had done it for nothing under the rule of the execs and he was privileged to be able to die trying to kill them he stepped callously around the hulk on the floor and found a door behind the couch a door and a hall and at the end of that hall a large room that had once perhaps been a message center now it held rack after rack of electronic gear he recognized it without elation it was the main transmitter for all the coronets of the exec he had only to pull one switchthat one thereand power would cease to flow the coronets would be dead the execs would be only human beings again in five minutes he could destroy enough parts that it would be at least a weeks work to build it again and in a week the slaves in honolulusomehow he could reach them some how he would tell them of their chancecould root out and destroy every exec on all the islands of course there was the standby transmitter he himself had helped to build he realized tardily that koitska would have made some arrangement for starting that up by remote control he put down the toolkit with which he had been advancing on the racks of transistors and paused to think he was a fool he saw after a moment he could not destroy this installationnot yetnot until he had used it he remembered to sit down so that his body would not crash to the floor and then he sent himself out and up to scan the nearby area there was no one there nobody within a mile or more except the feeble glimmer that was dying koitska he did not enter that body he returned to his own long enough to lock the door and then he went up and out grateful to rosalie who had taught him how to navigate in the curious world of the mind flashing across water to the island of hilo there had to be someone near the standby installation he searched but there was no one no one in the building no one near the ruined field no one in the village of the dead nearby he was desperate he became frantic he was on the point of giving up and then he foundsomeone but it was a personality feebler than stricken koitskas a bare swampfire glow no matter he entered it at once he screamed silently and left it again he had never known such pain a terrifying fire in the belly a thunder past any migraine in the head a thousand lesser aches and woes in every member he could not imagine what person lived in such distress but grimly he forced himself to enter again moaningit was astonishing how thick and animallike the mans voice waschandler forced his borrowed body stumbling through the jungle time was growing very short he drove it gasping at an awkward run across the airfield dodged around one wrecked plane and blundered through the door the pain was intolerable he was hardly able to main tain control waves of nausea washed into his mind how could he drive this agonizing hulk into the protracted thoroughgoing job of total destruction chandler stretched out the borrowed hand to pick up a heavy wrench even while he thought but the hand would not grasp he brought it to the weak watering eyes the hand had no fingers it ended in a ball of scar tissue the other hand was nearly as misshapen panicked chandler retreated from the body in a flash back to his own and then he began to think what sort of creature had he been inhabiting human why yes it must be humanthe coronets gave no power over the bodies of animals but it had not felt human chandler experienced one vertiginous moment when all possibilities seemed real when visions of elves and beings from flying saucers danced in his brain then sanity returned certainly it was humansomeone sick perhaps or insane but human he could not understand that clawed club of a hand but it didnt matter he could use it because he had used it it was only a matter of figuring out how at that moment he heard a car race into the parking lot spraying gravel he looked out the window and saw rosalie pans porsche he unlocked the door for her and she came clattering up the stairs as though chased by bears glanced at chandler passed him by and dropped to her knees be side koitskas body she looked up and said hes dead i didnt kill him i didnt say you did she got up slowly watching him you almost might as well be love she said i dont know what i can do for you now no agreed chandler nodding as though very frank and fair you cant help me much if hes dead full of guile he approached her staring at koitskas body but is he i think i saw him breathe perplexed she turned back to the body chandler took a quick step reached out and knocked the coronet off her head it clung to her coiffure ruthless ly he grabbed it and yanked and it came away with locks of her hair clinging to it she cried out and put a hand to her head looking at him with astonishment and fear overriding the pain he said breathing hard maybe i can do something for myself rosalie sobbed love youre crazy you dont have a chance give it back to me and ill try to help you but love give it back please chandler controlled his breathing and asked very rea sonably if you were me would you give it back yes please she took a step toward him then stopped her pretty face was a grimace now her hair torn and ffying she dropped her hands to her side and sobbed no i wouldnt but you must love please chandler said sit down over there next to his body i want to think and i dont want you close to me she started to object and he overrode her sit down or he touched the coronet on his own head she turned like a golem and sat down beside the obese old corpse she sat watching him her face passive and drained chandler tried to imagine for a moment what it must be like for her in one second a member of that god like society of superbeings who ruled the earth in another a mere mortal a figure of clay whose body could be seized by him chandler or by any other of the executive committee there was a threat in that chandler frowned i cant leave you there he said thinjdng out loud your friend fenell might drop in on you or somebody her expres sion did not change he said briskly get up get in that closet when she hesitated he added im not too good at controlling people i might not be able to make you tie yourself up but rosalie i could make you kill yourself the closet was small and uncomfortable but it would hold her and it had a lock with rosalie out of the way chandler paused for only a moment there were details to rtiinic out but he had a plan he could strike a blow he could end the menace of the executive committee forever the key to the whole thing was that crippled creature on hilo he knew now what it was and wondered that he had not understood before a leper one of the patients at molokaithe doctor had told him some had got away through that leper chandler calculated he could find a way to destroy the installation on hiloif nothing else offered he could contrive to disable the generator or break open its fuel storage supply and set fire to the building and the other installation was right here in this build ing within his grasp he could destroy them both one through the leper the other in his own personi and thats the end of the executive committee he thought trium phantly and then and then he paused suddenly downcast and then of course they would know something was wrong there were a thousand of them they would come here they would kill him and they would rebuild the equipment that would give them back the world chandler was close to weeping so near to victory and yet it was out of his reach except he thought that there was something about the standby installation that was different what had hsi said a different frequency and koitska had had two coronets with him on the island chandler did not delay perhaps he was wrong perhaps it would not work perhaps his memory played him false or his assumptions were in error or koitska had reset the frequency in the days since perhaps anything there were more unknown factors than he could guess at but still there was a chance he leaped out of his body poised himself to get his bearings and fled through the luminous gray mists toward hilo steeling himself to the pain he entered the body of the leper and loped shamblingly back toward the duplicate installation five minutes later the generator coughed and spun and the components came to life chandler had no way to test them to determine what sort of signal they were generat ing but he had helped put the installation together and as far as he could see it was operating perfectly he abandoned the body of the leper with gratitude and stood up in his own five minutes more and the master transmitter was stilled chandler had pulled the switch when he found koitskas standbyfrequency coronet and placed it on his head there was only one person in all the world who possessed the terrifying powers of a mem ber of the executive committee and that person was chandler he stood there for a moment with his eyes closed very tired and very calm he knew what he had to do but there was something he felt that he should do first he waited but could not remember what it was and so a moment later he left his body and soared off in search of his first quarry it was not for some time that it came to him what he had wanted to do he had wanted to pray it was all working his best hopes were coming true the installation on hilo functioned perfectly and chandler was in fact the master of the islands and thus of the world he accepted it without triumph perhaps the triumph would come later but first he had work to do for he had been wrong he saw now in thinking that the destruction of the machines would free the world from its tyranny koitska had not been the only scientist among the exec surely others knew the theory behind the electronic wiz ardry that gave them control surely there were plans and wiring diagrams in some safe file perhaps in a dozen of them that could be brought out and used again it was necessary to destroy the machinery yes but it was also necessary to destroy the plans not only the plans on paper but the plans that might linger in the brains of the members of the exec it was in fact necessary to kill them all it was not only necessary thought chandler objectively it was rather easy it was childs play all you had to do was the sort of thing members of the exec had been doing for fun or in furtherance of a purpose every day for years all you had to do was what he was doing up out of the body and search for the queerly distorted sluggish sort of creature that turned out to be a human mind enter it and there you were in the body of a man or woman you glanced in a mirror or touched the bodys head with the bodys handto check to see if it wore a coronet of course it if did the body had to be destroyed there were many ways of doing that simple household objects could be employeda knife a bottle of iodine to drink some times you could find a gun carefully and scientifically chandler experimented with modes of suicide he tried them all he discovered that failing all else you really could choke yourself to death but it was difficult and slow and quite painful he only did that once he discovered that even a nail file sawed vigorously enough across a throat would ultimately open the artery that would spill out the life he set fire to one house and trapped himself in a closet but that was slow too drowned himself in a bathtub but it took so irritat ingly long for the tub to fill knives were almost always available if you just took the trouble to look though and saws chisels barbecue forks scythesalmost anything with an edge could be used when chandler had first learned that the flame spirits were human beings he had dreamed at night about them and wakened to wonder how it must feel to kill oneself over and over again in some other flesh now he knew it felt very painful and very wearing but of emotionregret sorrow shamethere was little or none it became very quickly a job like any other job it was susceptible to time study and rationalization after the first hour when chandler realized he had only managed seven deaths and would at that rate pass out from exhaus tion before he had made himself safe against attack he systematically improved his methods finally settling for the quickest and easiest of them all too bad he thought as he slew and slew that it was only good in twostory buildings annoying that the hawaiians had gone in so heavily for ranch houses but it was quite possible to kill yourself by leaping from a secondstory window provided only that you had the resolution to land headfirst the orgy of killing went on and on all that day and all that night killing killing in widening circles from the twa message center killing everything that wore a coronet and then as he grew wearier and more carelessand realized that the execs might by then have begun taking their useless coronets off killing everything that moved he stopped only when he realized that he was in the fringes of honolulu itself he had lost count long since but he had surely killed a thousand timesand died a thousand times no doubt some execs still survived but he no longer had a way to distinguish them from the slaves he stopped for that reason and because he was tired beyond further effort and most of all because blood had washed away his passions he was spent he slumped against a wall for a moment back in his own body and then he stood up and took off the coronet and dangling it from one hand walked out into the dawn of a new world chandler the giant killer looked upon his world and did not find it good exhaustion diminished all his emotions but he was aware that this was wrong he should be exultant he should be shouting with joy caroling his gratitude to god and he was not why he told himself reasonably every most fantastic prayer of the past years had been granted at once in one night he had avenged new york and the orphalese the incinerated millions of russia and the raped slaves in honolulu but he could not help feeling that the job was not really done after all he swung the coronet idly in his hand staring blankly at the lightening sky while a sly and treasonable voice in a corner of his mind whispered to him who held this coronet held the world said the voice in his mind he nodded for that was true absently he poke at the steelbright filigree of the thing as a man might caress the pretty rug which once had been the skin of a tiger poised to kill him it was such a small thing to hold so much power chandler went back into the building and brewed him self strong black coffee he could hear rosalie pan stirring inside the closet where he had left her in a minute he would let her out he thought not just yet but in a minute as soon as he had thought things out as soon as he had made up his mind to an extremely important decision for tt was true that the job was not quite done yet the plans had to be locatedand destroyed of course naturally destroyed survivors of the exec had to be found and also destroyed yes there was much to do while he was waiting for the coffee to seep through its filter he slipped the coronet casually back atop his head only for a while of course a very little while he pledged himself solemnly that there would definitely be no question about that he would wear it just long enough to clean up all the loose ends just that long and not one second longer he pledged and knew as he pledged it that he lied
