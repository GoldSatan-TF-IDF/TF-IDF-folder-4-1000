sharing with me the true recipe for a martini bill massey for his constant encouragement jimmy scott van morrison and diana krall for most of the musical accompaniment and as always eileen for putting up with it all yes okay honey ill turn the music down a notch size matters i didnt appreciate how big it was not until the very moment when he brought it out she looked up into his twisted anguished face i mean ive seen that calibre of gun before she added but ive never actually held one its quite a cannon he admitted ill give you that yes but im not just talking about its weight or its smoothness or any physical thing im talking about a sheer sense of potency i just seemed to feel it flowing into me it scared me yet thrilled me at the same time her voice was matteroffact he realised the depth of her hysteria and that scared him more than anything he threw his head back and exhaled a great breath hissing through his teeth he could feel the tension gripping him bunching the muscles behind his neck puckering the scars of battle that he had picked up over the years that roar of anger and frustration swelled up inside him again and again he held it back he gazed at the weapon as it lay at her feet a huge oldfashioned nickelplated automatic which he recognised as a calibre colt with a long black silencer fitted to the end of the barrel so he ground out the word gripped by this sudden surge of omnipotence you again he cut himself off short is that what youre saying the emotion within him seemed to bring her to her senses or to somewhere close by yet still she looked at him as if he was a stranger no she said evasively her whisper barely audible even in that still silent room thats not how it happened i was frightened he was mocking me if hed laid down the fucking gun and you had picked it up why were you frightened there was a long pause he felt his heartrate rise and a strange cold feeling ran through him come on he snapped at last forcing her to answer it was the look in his eyes he was sneering at me he thought he was so dominant he was just so damn confident he was playing with me as if i was his slave he had me there at his mercy about to be killed and there was nothing i could do about it did he speak oh yes she said her voice strengthening he spoke all right he explained to me in great detail what it would do to me after he was finished with me that is how the bullets were softnosed with a mercury core to flatten them on impact he didnt have to though ive seen how they work too bloody right you have he grunted absently she gave no sign of having heard him then he told me he was going to shoot me in the back of the head it would blow my face away he said make a mess that would be a message as well he said that he wished he could be there when they found me she took a deep breath he laughed at the thought of it thats how sure he was of himself he laughed as he got down on me and then he put it on the floor as he undid himself he laid it right beside my face he invited me to look at the means of my own destruction to understand it to feel its power i remember thinking he was crazy and looking at him too scared really to understand what he was saying he was smiling all the time smiling dont worry he said when he was almost ready the best is yet to come but he had got it wrong he thought i couldnt move but when both his hands were busy when he was she paused for breath i made a grab for it i almost dropped it thats how badly i was shaking thats how frightened i was but i managed to keep hold of it and to put it up against his head and to tell him to get off me he looked down at her waiting for her to finish she was still perched on the edge of her seat her naked body shining silver in a shaft of moonlight that flowed through a narrow gap in the curtains and then okay i suppose you could be right then i felt it i felt the power that it gave me power over him for a change my hands had stopped shaking completely i could hold the gun steady i saw the safety catch on the side and i saw that it was off he stopped laughing then i pointed it at him and it was his turn to be terrified and yes youre right i wasnt frightened at all not by then i just felt so angry so tremendously overpoweringly angry at what hed done to me and been going to do i couldnt stop myself i didnt want to stop myself and so he finished for her you blew his fucking head off you had him under control but you fucking well shot him suddenly he bent and picked up the great gun from the floor releasing the magazine checking it then slipping it back into its housing in the butt he knelt down beside the body feeling the queasiness which always overtook him when he confronted death close up he was glad that he had switched off the light as he looked at the leavings of the man lying face up on the floor in a dark puddle that had soaked into the rug on which he had fallen he wasnt kidding about the ammo he said you dont use this stuff to inflict flesh wounds shoot someone in the arm with one of these shells and youll blow it right off he glanced over his shoulder back towards her you made a good job of it he said you shot him right in the face took out his right eye and the bridge of his nose no this bastard will not be bothering you again he saw a shiver run through her shoulders he knew that soon she would need sedation this leaves us with only one small problem he continued whats that she whispered what the hell are we going to do with him the skulls empty eyesockets seemed to be looking up at him from the white card which the cabin attendant had given him welcome to malaysia he murmured a significant part of bob skinners police career had been spent pursuing the drug dealers who had threatened the social fabric of edinburgh the city that lay at the heart of his forces territory the bigger they were the more he hated them with his strongest venom being reserved for those who peddled the most addictive substances in the most vulnerable areas the places where the poverty trap was at its tightest and where the perceived respite offered by spoon flame and needle was for some an irresistible lure the heavier the sentences the scottish high court had handed down to those convicted the wider had been his smile but even he thought that the pacific countries were going too far in imposing the ultimate penalty on the peddlers at the same time he recognised that much of the global supply of hard drugs originated in the area and that at least the regional governments were showing the rest of the world that they took the problem seriously his difficulty with their policy was that invariably the people who fell through the trapdoor were the couriers the mules the foot soldiers but never the generals in any war the great majority of the casualties come from the other ranks in the global battle against narcotics the story was just the same the deputy chief constable planned to say as much in his speech to the plenary session of the international conference at which he was representing the police service in scotland he knew that his view would not be popular with his malaysian hosts but that would not deter him from putting it forward they spell it out sir dont they said detective chief inspector mary chambers a red skull and crossbones and death penalty for drug trafficking stamped on your landing card thats a bit unnecessary heading in this direction do you not think there cant be a hell of a lot of smack smuggled from heathrow to the far east skinner glanced sideways at her taking in the plain square face the forehead defined by closecut dark hair which offered not a hint of personal vanity she looks more like a copper than any bloke ive ever seen andy martin had said after her interview and the dcc had conceded he had been right maybe not he agreed but a lot of the traffic into kuala lumpur stops over at other airports in the region where consignments might be loaded i hadnt thought of that i suppose the woman spoke with a pronounced glasgow twang a voice with muscles in it her accent was not unlike skinners lanarkshire dialect but it was rawer not dimmed as his had been by twenty years of east of scotland life i understand that he said youve worked at the sharp end of the business until now just as i did once upon a time operating in strathclyde you havent had the bloody time to consider the global aspects of the trade youve been too busy dealing with the problems on the streets but believe me it helps to have that broader understanding the supply chains are long but always theyre interlinked from the poppy to the needle the more of us who share our knowledge and experience the better chance we have of tracing each one right back to source and shutting it down for good is that why you brought me with you on this trip not to learn just to tell tales about pinching pushers in paisley he looked at her laughing at her boldness why i brought you its why i recruited you in the first place did you think i brought you through to edinburgh just on willie haggertys sayso hell no ive been watching you since well before he was appointed to our command corridor is that so she looked surprised i just assumed that acc haggerty had put a word in for me oh dont get me wrong said skinner quickly he did but only after i asked him about you chambers frowned and it was as easy as that was it she mused what you asking if strathclyde were happy to let you go well not a bit of it mary i promise you your chief was pissed off make no mistake about that but im not without clout and im playing a long game just now what do you mean she asked youll find out when its time he answered intriguingly but not just yet cabin crew seats for landing the captains instruction through the small loudspeaker above their heads seemed to emphasise that all discussion was at an end pc charlie johnston hated this sort of nightshift work sure his colleagues told him he was daft complaining about the cushiest job of them all but he couldnt help it he knew his limitations as a copper yet he was never happy unless he was in a position to explore them in his case that meant crowd control at football matches being on patrol in shopping malls to deter and when necessary pursue thieves or to come down on the occasional wee toerags who thought it was funny to harass and alarm respectable folks what he did not like was being sat on his arse in a decrepit sub office like oxgangs for hours on end catching calls which in practice rarely came in dealing with theoretical evildoers who were in practice tucked up in bed it was not unusual for nightwatch guys to spend their entire shift reading the evening news and listening to the insomniacs programmes on radio forth envying the discjockeys for the fact that at least they had someone to talk to envying the guys and girls in their panda cars just for the fact that they were out there no what charlie did not like was sheer bloody boredom yet when the phone rang at first he failed to hear it he was on the verge of solving a tricky clue in the sunday express crossword or at least he thought he was it sounded four times before it made its way through to his consciousness he scowled and picked it up oxgangs police office he barked hello there said a female voice sorry to wake you thats okay dear he responded his weariness in contrast with her chirpiness i was away for a hit and a miss lucky it wasnt a day and a night listen this is nicola ford im a paramedic and im at the doctors surgery just down the road from your station theres a dead man here johnston frowned aye well that happens doesnt it not in places like this in the middle of the night it doesnt surgeries are usually closed at two in the morning our night time callouts are either to houses pub fights or road accidents this mans had a heart attack here at the doctors so what do you want us to do about it i want your lot to attend what for is there no a doctor there yes but this is an unusual case dramritraj says the man called him at home bypassing the normal emergency service he was complaining of mild chest pains the doctor says that he offered to call an ambulance right away but the man refused he wanted a home visit normally dr amritraj would have referred him to the night service but he says that he knew him quite well so he went round to see him charlie johnston stifled a yawn aye so how did he get to the surgery i was getting to that the doctor says he was a bit concerned by his symptoms he wanted to take him to a e at the royal but the patient became agitated at the suggestion he said that he had a phobia about hospitals and he refused pointblank to go there the doctor has an ecg machine in his surgery so he decided that he would take him there for a proper checkup and that if he was having a heart attack hed sedate him put him under like then call us the patient agreed to that and they came here but before dr amritraj even got him hooked up to the ecg he took a cardiac arrest the doctor tried to resuscitate him he shocked him gave him atropine all the usual procedures but it was no use so he called us to take him to the mortuary thats fine hen but what do you need us for there was a doctor in attendance when the man died so we dont need to be informed thats what dramritraj said but theres the next of kin the paramedic answered a little less chirpily than before the man lived alone the surgery has no other family members on its books and no clue as to where they might be its your job to trace them not ours we cant stay here all night weve got to shift him aye all right said charlie ill get a panda round as soon as i can haud on a minute he laid the phone on the counter of the office and turned to the radio transmitter any car in the oxgangs area come in please he said into the microphone there was a crackling sound aye charlie a male voice answered need an attendance at the doctors surgery in oxgangs road theres a body there and nextofkin needin advised cannae do it man weve got a domestic here blokes thumped his wife were having taste arrest him what about jenny her cars down the bypass at a road accident aye okay he flicked the mike off and picked up the phone listen hen he said all our cars are occupied so ill have to come myself i can do that i just have to put my phone on divert and let divisional hq know why ill just be a couple of minutes excited at last by the prospect of escaping from his nocturnal prison the clerk dispatcher and occasional jailer made his arrangements slipped on his uniform tunic with its utility belt and made ready to step out into the fresh night air as an afterthought he took the offices polaroid camera from the desk where it was kept he liked the spring the renewal of gods promise he called it even though he had never been devoutly christian few things appalled him more in fact than his countrys religious right and their active involvement in the electoral process ensured that he was an everpresent at the polls voting the straight democrat ticket whatever the personal failings of its candidates indeed in the previous fall he had been proud to play his part in ensuring that party kept its grip on the new york state senatorial seat beginning in the process a career which he hoped would lead the new incumbent to the white house in her own right how the first gentleman would take that would be something else again but what the hell he had had his eight years he approved of women in public life just as well goddammit he thought with a smile with the wife and daughter ive got he had been an active politician himself once upon a time fortyfive and more years back a young man not fresh from law school but forged thereafter by bloody action in korea a short spell in the public defenders office in new york city had been enough to light the spark he had seen men die in battle and had accepted it as something that came with his birthright but the sight of one of his clients a young black boy barely out of his teens being dragged screaming to the electric chair strapped down and virtually burned to death had made him physically sick on the spot he was elected to the state senate and served for a total of six years through the cold dark years when elsenhower was president nixon was scheming to succeed him and john foster dulles and his spymaster brother ruled the country with the rise of kennedy friends of his from massachusetts persuaded him to put his own political career to one side for a while to work on the young senators presidential campaign team there had been a promise of national office at the first electoral opportunity but in the immediate aftermath of the narrow triumph his reward had been a post as second assistant attorney general in bobby kennedys team he and the new presidents aggressive ambitious brother were at odds from the start and relations between them had worsened when he had discovered that the new york senatorial seat which he had been told would be his in time was in fact earmarked for bobby and so a mere six weeks before the fall of the elected king arthur he had accepted an offer to become a senior partner in what was then known as mclean and whyte the largest legal firm in buffalo in his home state in the same month he had made an offer of his own one of marriage to susannah a young teacher he had met in washington yes he had seen a few springs since then he mused as he gazed out through the trees across the glassy great sacandaga lake its waters catching the last rays of the evening sun there had been thirtyeight of them to be precise every one memorable in its own way every one marked by increasing success professionally and privately where once he had dreamed on a national scale dreamed without limit for a brief period so caught up had he been in the seductive atmosphere ofcamelot now he reflected on the success he had made of his life materially and spiritually most of all there had been his daughter a special girl from the outset as she had grown blooming in her intelligence and her beauty he had looked at her looked at his wife and at himself far more of a golden family than any branch of the doomed kennedy clan and he had wondered that he had ever been so weak that he had been seduced by their promises of joy why had he ever sought to bask in their glory when such light had lain within himself waiting for its moment to shine he leaned back in his rocking chair on the wide wooden terrace under the eaves of their log cabin enjoying the shimmering colours of the lake before him a brassy piece ofaaron copland sounded from inside and he caught the aroma of brewing coffee couldnt get any more american could we he said aloud and wondered what his soninlaw would think if he could see him lounging there he frowned as he thought of his soninlaw now there was an individual who would have given them pause for thought back in the sixties there was still time for him to do that even now yes he had plans for his soninlaw he had to see him and soon for there was something he had to discuss with him something very serious the familiar creaking board sounded behind him susannahs footfall as she carried out the supper tray to lay upon their table he made to rise stiffly as always these days and then he felt the cold sharp thing whipping suddenly round his neck tightening so fast with a faint peculiar twanging sound he had no time to think only to feel his tongue swell in his mouth and his eyes bulge in their sockets to hear the roaring in his ears and to see the evening burst for an instant into sudden flaring light and then go black the man held the strangling wire tight for some time after the old mans stillmuscular body had gone limp after his bladder had given forth its own signal finally he released it letting him slump down into his chair and then he turned and went into the isolated lonely wooden house so willie how are you finding the air through here sir james proud asked his assistant his deputy in bob skinners absence pure and clear gaffer haggerty replied so fuckin pure that every so often it makes me dizzythe chief constables left eyebrow twitched slightly he realised that the dining room waitress was behind him and had overheard excuse my french maisie he apologised thats aright sir she said as she laid a bowl of thick pea soup before him ahm frae glesca myself originally ah know yis are a linguists through there still thought haggerty as she laid a salad before detective chief superintendent andy martin this is another kings court im in now even if the prime minister is away proud jimmy scratched his chin you know gentlemen he mused as an edinburgh man born and bred im bound to say that im beginning to feel like an outsider in my own force theres bob theres you andrew and now you willie west of scotland men all of you all my senior team mind you the balance will swing back in my favour in a couple of weeks aye haggerty grunted the tay the tay oh the silvery tay he quoted long may it flow from perth to dundee you looking forward to it andy martin shrugged his broad shoulders green eyes flashed sure on the whole i am itll be a wrench though ive been in this city for all of my police career so far which is exactly why you had to go for the tayside job son the chief interjected its the way things are you cant be a oneforce man any more not if you have aspirations to command rank he glanced at haggerty reading his mind im no example to quote either before you do im the last of the dinosaurs yes ive been here a long time too damned long a few of our councillors have been heard to say they think im just hanging on to spite them im not though he smiled wickedly weve got plans bob and i a couple of years will see them through to fruition then ill be off the outgoing head of cid managed with some difficulty to keep his surprise from showing on his face he had discussed the future with bob skinner his closest friend as well as his immediate boss but he had never heard sir james anticipate his own retirement he guessed that his imminent departure for assistant chief constable rank in the tayside force had raised him to another level of confidence so haggerty murmured pausing in his determined consumption of his soup the balance is swinging back is it is that still a secret proud jimmy sat back slightly in his chair it never was willie not from you im sorry i thought youd been informed it was decided before you arrived but i had to wait for the man at the centre of it to get back from holiday he did today and we told him dan pringle will succeed andy as head of cid when he goes in two weeks big clan eh hell be pleased hes like a dog with two tails willie like a dog with two tails martin grinned you should have seen him he told the acc pringles such a phlegmatic bugger i dont think ive ever known him to get excited before this when he was passed over last time he thought that was it for him he thought that brian mackie would be appointed out of all the divisional cid commanders so did i haggerty confessed either him or maggie rose at any rate bob and andy thought it was too soon for either of them the chief explained besides pringles done a fine job over the last few months in sharpening up the borders division we all agreed that he deserved it actually the truth is its very much an interim appointment dans not that far away from retirement so whos going to the borders mario mcguire the dcs told him hes done his special branch stint hes earned a move as well so hes off on promotion to a divisional cid command as a detective superintendent just like his wife and big mcllhenneys going to the sb job which leaves a vacancy as bobs executive officer haggerty mused indeed it does the chief agreed thatll be decided after bob gets back from his conference incidentally he and i have been discussing that subject more generally after all the fuss we had with ted chase weve decided that you should have the opportunity to appoint your own assistant sergeant rank think about it eh the new acc leaned back from the table as the waitress took away his soup bowl and laid a plate of braised beef carrots and chips in its place can i have maisie here he joked shes doing a great job so far proud jimmy shook his head the needs of the senior officers dining room supersede yours william the glaswegian laughed yes the edinburgh air was different but it was fresh and it suited him he had been astonished by bob skinners phone call asking if he would be interested in the job in the wake of the appointment of his predecessor ted chase to the office of the inspector of constabulary the bluntness of the question had taken his breath away he had felt himself to be in a rut his career path at its end marked down as too rough a diamond for the command floor an unlikely choice as a confirmed thiefcatcher to be given charge of uniformed policing apply for it willie skinner had said the jobs yours if you do jimmy and ill make sure of that but why me for rucks sake he remembered croaking the question im having no more ted chases in here pal its as simple as that aye we want new blood but this time im going to make sure i know what type it is youre my choice and besides itll be a damn good career move for you the dumfries and galloway post will be coming up in a few years thatd be a nice place to command jesus wept you think longterm dont you ive got fuck all else to do in this job other people catch the thieves and murderers now when jimmy said hed make a politician of me he didnt know the half of it i dont like the breed willie based on bitter experience but they exist so ill play their game only ill make up my own rules so he had applied and skinner had kept his promise despite what haggerty had regarded privately as the worst interview of his career he glanced around the headquarters dining room at the heavy silver braid on the uniforms yes indeed he thought a different air from glasgow he had almost finished his beef when martins mobile rang the chief gave a slightly tetchy frown he had a firm belief that there should be sanctuaries in which the telephone did not ring sorry boss the head of cid apologised but he answered its call nonetheless andy the word was a sob the voice on the other end of the line was so contorted that it was almost unrecognisable at first he supposed it was karen the fear of a miscarriage rushed into his mind then he looked at the number shown by the phones lcd display and he knew who it was sarah a muffled gasping sound was her only answer whats wrong andy it seemed to be all she could say sarah what is it are you ill is it one of the kids no she moaned andy can you come out here i need you i cant get through to bob sure ill come but what is it he heard her sobbing intensify i cant talk about it over the phone she whispered through her tears okay okay im on my way he ended the call proud and haggerty were staring at him and not only them he realised that the urgency in his voice had brought all conversation in the dining room to a halt what is it asked the chief i dont know he answered she couldnt or wouldnt say im off out to gullane thats where she was calling from he rose from the table and turned towards the door before he reached it it swung open and detective inspector neil mcllhenney came into the room shock and concern written across his face andy he said his voice low ive just taken a call from a guy who said he was the county sheriff in buffalo new york he was looking for the boss but the message was about sarah detective superintendent maggie rose was still on a high the phone call from mario had come as a complete surprise she knew that the special branch posting usually carried a reward thereafter but she had not expected that her husband would have jumped straight from his secretive office to the status of divisional cid commander how long have you known she had asked him with more than a hint of suspicion once the initial delight had subsided i didnt not until this morning when the chief called me in and told me honest love its the truth do you think i could have kept something like that from you after all that time in special branch too bloody right i do but ill take your word for it so whats happening to dan pringle early retirement he had hesitated for less than a second but she had picked it up far from it hes the new head of cid thinking back she had felt not even a twinge of disappointment no her instant reaction had been one of relief good for clan hes earned it aye sure but ive told you mario ive gone as far as i want for now that jobs about half a step below executive rank i dont have the experience for it besides ive outranked you for long enough you think well make the papers husband and wife team and all that are you kidding tfr im kidding the chief said he wants that aspect played down the press guys under orders not to mention it but someone would she mused as she stared out of the window of her small office all but deaf to the bustle of the haymarket traffic sooner or later some wag would decide to run a feature on the nick and nora charles of edinburgh cid and for all ofalan roystons contacts and negotiating skills it would happen she was brought back to the present by a knock on her door come she called sharply it opened with its familiar squeak and a freshfaced probationer constable came into the room he was carrying a brown folder she noticed that his hand trembled slightly as he held it out to her christ she thought is that how the youngsters think of me yes constable she greeted him deliberately softening her tone and offering a smile im sorry miss eh sorry maam but she interrupted him thats at least one sorry too many son youre new here yes first month maam whats your name pc haddock maam poor lad she thought you re going to have to be good when they sent you up here pc haddock did the lads tell you that i eat probationers for lunch more or less maam theyre right she paused but not in their first few weeks i prefer them a bit more seasoned now what have you got for me pinkcheeked the tall gawky young man looked down at her chief superintendent english called in maam she nodded english was the senior officer in the division the top uniform hes been detained up at headquarters the meeting with mr haggertys going on into the afternoon so he asked if youd take a look at the nightshift reports inwardly maggie bristled manny english was pushing his luck the nightshift reports were pure bloody trivia puffed up by the panda patrollers to make it look as if they had been rushed off their feet they could have been checked by a sergeant but the chief super was a procedural paragon in addition he liked to keep in touch with everything that happened on his patch still palming off uniformed officers reports to the cid commander as the next senior officer was taking it a bit far outwardly she smiled again at haddock and took the folder from him of course i will she said anything for mr english he stood there uncertain of what to do you can go she told him ill send them down to his office when im done very good miss eh sorry maam the constable left the room much more quickly than he had entered shaking her head as the door closed on him maggie opened the folder by divisional standards it looked like a light load a false alarm at a chemists shop in fountainbridge three assorted brawls two domestic callouts which turned out to be no more than loud arguments and one in which a husband had been arrested and charged with assaulting his wife rubbish she muttered and was on the point of closing the folder when her eye was caught by the last report there was a photograph clipped to it she slipped it out and looked at the polaroid it had been taken clumsily and showed only the top half of a mans body lying flat on a table he was dressed in a heavy grey woollen jerkin with a short zip opened at the neck he looked to be in his fifties he was bald with a heavy grizzled beard despite his weatherbeaten complexion from the blueness of his lips and cheeks the detective superintendent could tell at once that he was dead she picked up pc charlie johnstons report and read carefully through his policespeak prose the man had been identified by dr amritraj who had certified his death as magnus essary of leightonstone grove hunters tryst edinburgh single aged fortynine using keys found on the body johnston had gained entry to the house and had searched thoroughly for any references to family or next of kin thoroughly the constable insisted but without success there was nothing to be found and the neighbours delighted rose guessed to have been wakened by a policeman at that hour of the morning had all described him as a quiet polite man who kept to himself the report ended with the simple statement that its author had been unable to trace anyone who could be contacted and asked to take responsibility for the body this is daft the detective superintendent muttered as she finished the report this man cannot have been a complete loner he lived at a fairly posh address he must have had some sort of business life even if he didnt have any friends there must be colleagues we cant just let the guy lie in the mortuary she picked up the telephone and called oxgangs office she was put through at once to the duty inspector laurence gray an excid colleague laurie she began ive got a report here on a sudden death on your patch in the middle of the night man called essary it was written up by constable johnston oh aye our charlie gray growled with a faint chuckle ive been half expecting the chief super to call me about that one johnstons a book operator the trouble with him is that he hasnae finished reading the bloody book yet rose relaxed so youre following it up not just giving up on it come on maggie i was in cid long enough not to be doing that she accepted the reproof sorry i should have known better indeed maam the inspector rumbled as it happens the things sorted mr essary was in the wine importing business in partnership with a woman called ella frances she called fettes this morning and they put her in touch with me i told her to go up to the royal she did they called to let us know shes confirmed the identification and claimed the body shes had it uplifted from the mortuary already file closed thats good no thanks to johnston though its just as well for both of you that the chief super was tied up ach dont blame charlie he didnae make any mistakes he just focused a bit too hard on his finishing time thats all you know what the night shifts like short spells of action mixed in with long periods of nearterminal boredom youre right there but you wait till youre in my job there isnt a minute of your life you can call your own completely with no fear that the phonell ring itll be double for you from now on then wi your mans promotion maggie rose was rarely surprised how did you know about that so soon hah you think emails fast its got nothing on the force grapevine be sure to congratulate mario for me will you of course thanks laurie she hung up slipped the report and photograph back into the folder and leaned back in her chair musing on the curse that alexander graham bell had visited on mankind she was calm by the time she heard the big dodge caravan crunch its way up the gravel driveway she opened the heavy front door to greet them three of them andy martin neil mcllhenney and his wife louise picked up on the way to gullane the two women embraced neil called to tell me what had happened lou murmured he and andy thought you might welcome a womans company and since bobs daughter is working on secondment in london her voice faltered for a second oh i am so sorry she exclaimed hugging her again sarah felt herself begin to go again but held on to her composure steeling herself not to fold in front of the two men however close to her and bob they might be thanks lou she replied come on through to the conservatory she led the way from the entrance hall of the modem bungalow towards the big glasswalled room which looked out over the forth estuary drab and grey in the dull spring day can i do something asked louise making a conscious effort not to sound as if she wished she was somewhere else what about the children sarah gave her a weak smile theyre fine marks at school james andrews dismantling his toys in the play room and seonaids having her afternoon sleep tell you what though you could pour the coffee ive made some in the filter of course what does everyone take in theirs she glanced at martin nothing black please right now ill take brandy said sarah youll find the cooking stuff in the cupboard above the coffee pot thats a done deal she turned and walked through to the kitchen she had visited the skinners on several occasions and knew her way around left with sarah the two detectives looked from one to the other it was she who broke the awkward silence sorry i was useless when i called you andy but the phone call came as such a shock it just floored me i did the little woman thing went into complete hysterics and upset the kids in the process okay he murmured now sit down and tell us exactly what happened she nodded and settled into one of the caneframed conservatory chairs it happened just after one oclock i was clearing up after lunch with the kids when the phone rang its trish the nannys day off she added irrelevantly it was the new york state police a gruffsounding guy asked me if i was sarah grace the daughter of leopold and susannah grace of buffalo new york the sound of his voice was enough to scare me right there i said i was and he went right into it her accent seemed to roughen no messing about im sorry to have to tell you maam that im at the scene of a double homicide at your folks lakeside cabin it appears theyve been murdered i didnt say anything for a long time i remember holding on to the kitchen table and hearing the guy ask if i was all right eventually i said that i was far from all right i asked him to repeat what hed just said and he did i asked if he was sure of the identification and he said yes maam he suggested that i should maybe call a doctor i shouted into the phone i am a doctor and hung up that was when i folded up i was just scared witless andy i tried to phone bob but i got all confused by the international dialling code so i called you on your mobile once i knew you were on your way that helped that and james andrew he just begged me to stop crying so i did what did you tell him i said id had a nasty phone call from a bad man she shuddered he frowned at me with the same expression bob has when hes angry and said hell be in trouble when dad gets home the look on his little face was almost as scary as the phone call she glanced up at them could you call them back for me could you find out exactly whats happened mcllhenney shook his head we dont have to call them sarah theyve already been in touch with us i guess the guy who called you was a detective he also reported in to his headquarters and they passed the news to the local police force in buffalo sarah nodded that would be the erie county sheriffs department she murmured it was reported to the sheriff himself the inspector continued he knew your father well and he knew all about you so he called the office looking for the boss he wound up speaking to me he paused as louise returned with the coffee pot and cups on a green plastic tray she caught the moment and laid it on the glass table without a word im sorry her husband continued but there really is no doubt about the identification they were found in their cabin just before seven am local time they had been strangled both of them going by the information that sheriff dekker had from the men at the scene it looks like a robbery the cabin was ransacked money credit cards watches jewellery all taken the investigations still in its early stages of course a technical team from albany were on their way there when dekker called strangled you said her voice was a whisper yes expertly according to the sheriff he spoke on the phone to the me while she was still at the scene she told him that there were no signs of a violent struggle which indicates that they were both taken by surprise your father was killed on the veranda of the cabin your mother in the kitchen the doctor said that a ligature was used what type meil hesitated he wanted to avoid the detail but one look at sarahs face told him that he could not wire they were both garrotted from behind it must have been over in seconds your father didnt even make it out of his chair they dont know how many perpetrators there were but the police at the scene said that from the disposition of the bodies and the strength required theyre looking at least for a tall man her mouth normally soft and sensual seemed no more than an opening carved into her face for a few dollars and a few baubles she hissed lets hope they try to fence them i have a date with these people whoever they are i plan to be there when they strap them on to the execution table however long it takes however many years the appeal process drags on when they inject the bastards ill be there if theres a place worse than hell ill send them there her voice cracked and she leaned forward in her chair her face buried in her hands her shoulders shaking andy martin dropped to a crouch in front of her and put his arms around her okay love okay he said softly let it out theres a girl he waited until her sobbing began to subside listen why dont you take some time on your own take a sedative and lie down for a bit neil and i will phone bob he needs to be told she nodded and rose from her seat louise slipped an arm around her waist and walked her out of the room you got that hotel number asked martin taking out his cellphone mcllhenney nodded took a piece of paper from the breast pocket of his jacket and handed it over he watched as the chief superintendent keyed it in then waited hello he said at last i want to speak with one of your guests mr skinner yes ill hold the voice that sounded in martins ear a few seconds later was wide awake if more than a touch irritable yes it barked bob its andy whats up the testiness vanished replaced by concern some very bad news im afraid speaking carefully almost formally he told his friend what had happened to his parentsinlaw setting out the detail of mcllhenneys conversation with sheriff dekker when he was finished there was silence for one of the few times in his life bob skinner was lost for words hows sarah he asked eventually sounding strained and older martin thought than he had ever heard him hows she taking it as youd expect shes devastated im at gullane now with neil lous here looking after her and the kids theyre okay marks at school jazz is being man of the house and the babys asleep he heard skinner take a deep breath when he spoke again it was as if he was at a crime scene himself right he said this is whats going to happen im on the first flight out of here to new york whether theres a seat on it or not tell this man dekker that i want to be met at jfk either by the state police or his guys and transported straight to the cabin after that i want to be taken to buffalo to meet with him and with the officer in charge of the enquiry if it sounds to you like im pulling rank here andy well thats because i am just to reinforce that i want you to call my fbi pal joe doherty in washington and brief him joell smooth the way if its necessary i want to be at that scene within twentyfour hours and i do not want anything to be touched that doesnt have to be ill call dekker once my travel arrangements are made what will you do about the conference fuck the conference mary chambers can read my paper shes sound and shes not the nervous type i trust her to do that no problem okay do you want to speak to sarah let her rest for a bit ill call her in a couple of hours maybe from the airport if we can move things along that fast right martin paused you know bob i thought sarahs parents lived in florida they did for a while at least they had a condo there as well as the house in buffalo but susannah didnt like the climate in florida so last autumn they sold the place and bought the cabin in the adirondacks national park instead it was going to be a surprise for the kids next time sarah took them over shit some surprise his anger seemed to flow down the phone i tell you one thing though andy itll be nothing on the shock this man has coming however flicking tall he is oh boy does he have grief heading his way you know said the newly promoted detective superintendent mario mcguire we should do this more often he glanced along the length of umbertos restaurant surprisingly busy for a midweek evening for a dinky couple we definitely do not put ourselves about enough his wife shot him a puzzled look dinky come on dual income no kids ah she exclaimed you mean weve moved up in the world from being yuppies nah weve just got too old the acronym game keeps moving along and personally im looking forward to being a bobo what the hells a bobo burnt out but opulent ive always fancied making it to that level she chuckled softly as she sipped her chablis were well on the way to the opulent bit now with two superintendents pay packets coming into the house not to mention two superintendents pensions at the end of the day well be the envy of every copper on the force apart from big bob and the chief whove both filthy rich anyway aye i suppose we will be mind you id still chuck it just to be able to ditch the second part of dinky maggie frowned at him across the table well thats not a runner is it so dont brood about it sure i know but makes you feel less of a man does it something like that he muttered well dont let it for its nonsense thats a fine piece of ordnance youve got there officer its not your fault that it shoots blanks its not a sin not to have babies you know looked at from a certain angle its an advantage we can plan our future in the knowledge that its only the two of us on the payroll and always will be plus we can concentrate on making life miserable for the bad people who knows maybe thats what we were put here for the arrival of their starters forestalled his answer he sat in silence as the waiter set a warm goats cheese salad before maggie and served his pasta and bean soup from a tureen put here for he exclaimed as the young man headed back to the kitchens this is planet earth calling superintendent rose this is houston calling maggie in case youve forgotten i became a copper because if i didnt there was a fair chance that id have ended up on the other side of the fence or at the very least in regular skirmishes with the vat man like the rest of my family come on she retorted your familys very respectable specially your mother if you werent a police officer youd probably be in her business the light smile left her face and her eyes flickered down for a moment the fact is ive always envied you your family he caught something in her expression and in her tone sure because theyre alive but why do you say it like that mags youve been ifiy for a couple of days have you got a problem she opened her mouth to reply then stopped staring at the table as if she was considering something very important finally she looked up and into his eyes ive had a letter from my sister she told him shes had a birthday card from my father your father he exclaimed astonished you told me your father was dead oh how i wish the words came out in a long malevolent hiss i thought he was she continued no i hoped he was i prayed he was and eventually i let myself believe he was now it turns out but why he asked her what was so bad about him you dont want to know i bloody do and youre going to tell me she glanced around and over her shoulder checking for anyone who might be within earshot if you insist she said quietly her eyes narrowing with her frown you know why i really became a copper mario she hesitated for a second or two then leaned toward him her voice dropping even lower until he had to lean himself to catch it i did it to get even with guys like my old man you ask me what was so bad about him bad doesnt cover it not by a long way that bastard abused my sister and me damn it no he raped us and as if that wasnt enough he beat my mother bloody when she found out about it ill tell you something ive never told you or anyone else before mario i felt guilty for years after that not just because of what happened between my old man and me but because it was me who got her that tanking when i told her what he was doing to us do you know what happened the first thing she did was to beat the daylights out of me she glanced again at the nearest occupied table but the couple there were too far away to overhear thats right when i told her she knocked me right off my feet so i got up and showed her the bruises he always left on me she hit me even harder she actually knocked me out so i showed her the same marks on my wee sister when my father came in from the pub or the bookies or wherever he had been she confronted him and it was her turn for a thumping i hate to think what would have happened to eilidh and me if wed stayed in that house but i hauled her out of there and screamed bloody murder at the door of the woman downstairs she took us in and her husband a great big man whod been a boxer or something went up and stopped my father yet no one called the police it never occurred to them to do that it just wasnt part of their culture what went on between husband and wife was their business until the kids got hurt then the community usually took care of it thats what happened in our case my dad left for good that very night we were actually better off for my mother had always been the breadwinner he never had a regular job that i knew of although he was always out and about as far as i could see he just leeched off her after he went we never spoke about what had happened not even when eilidh and i were grown up it was always there though hanging like a curtain between my mother and me something unspoken that we knew nonetheless it stayed that way until she was dying she developed breast cancer she had a big lump but she kept quiet about it until it was way too late the afternoon before she died i went in to see her i was a probationer then she didnt approve of my joining the police and she didnt hide that from me she couldnt speak above a whisper at that stage but she beckoned me close to her and she said to me i never could forgive you margaret and i said for what mum and she said for telling me i loved your father and that was the last thing my mother ever said to me oh how i hated him then far more than ever before the fact is i dont think i really did hate him until that moment not even when he was doing all those things because he was my father and i didnt know any different and i didnt understand until someone at school said something and it all rushed in on me what it all comes down to is this what i said back there was only partly true i joined the police because of my father but not just because of him i joined because i wanted to change the culture i grew up in the notion that even in the direst circumstances the police are somehow the enemy of the working class i wanted to be an accessible copper to be the sort that people would rush up to in the street she frowned a deep dark frown which pained him for her yet somewhere along the line i lost that i became a control freak an authoritarian the sort of copper kids run away from in the street and now my junior colleagues see me as some sort of dragon and maybe thats what i am he waited until he was sure that she had finished that she had drained whatever well had overflowed inside her and brought her to spill out the deepest darkest truths that she had withheld even from him until that moment why havent you told me all this before he asked her quietly when it was time i suppose ive been afraid youd look at me in a different light now you know why im ambivalent about the kids thing the truth is there are times when im positively glad we cant have any why because youd be afraid to trust me with our daughters he put the question gently yet still her hand flew to her mouth in horror no not for a second no its because of me i never had a proper natural relationship with my mother im plain scared that i wouldnt know how to begin to build one myself he shook his dark head of course you would ill tell you something else youre no bloody dragon either youre a good a better than good copper you might not say that if youd seen a thing that happened this morning what was that something very simple but i cant get it out of my head a young probationer came into my office and he was shaking the boy was scared mario of me and thats not right course it is he laughed making light of it the traditional function of the probationer is to crap themselves when going into the supers office she did not return his smile look mags he told her you have to believe this you are an exceptional dedicated police officer bob skinner picked you out as that and shot you up the ladder because of it and thats all the commendation you need if you joined the force to be cuddly and nice you were fooling yourself for we cant be like that especially not in cid you are what you should be and you are where you should be whether its in spite of your background or because of it doesnt matter any more than a single bean in my rapidly cooling soup he grinned at her as he picked up his spoon and this time she smiled back weakly this birthday card your sister received did she say where it was posted london and it arrived out of the blue yes did he put an address on it no what concerns me is how he found out where she is the internet maybe mario suggested she has a website doesnt she with her design business and she has an unusual name that would do it maybe anyway shes scared and she wrote to me to warn me and are you worried she snorted the just let him come near me she stopped now please ive told you can we talk about something else at least till we get home mario nodded sure what did that lad want this morning anyway nothing he brought me manny englishs nightshift reports that was all what the hell for you know manny he was away and hes so bloody rankconscious that only the next senior officer would do to check them over a load of crap were they yup there was a funny one where someone had died in a doctors surgery but that was all death happens wherever there more than in most places i guess yes but not ach lets forget it enough shop have you had many well done calls since the press notice went out mario nodded a few and one that took my breath away my uncle beppe phoned me he and my mother want to have a family party to celebrate jesus your godfather called you what did you say what could i say i said okay i had to my mum and my nana might have been upset otherwise am i invited course you are will i have to learn italian songs and dances and such hardly he laughed however he acts my uncle beppe was born in newhaven not napoli this time sarah was awake when the phone rang howre you doing he asked better she answered not because she was but because it was what he wanted to hear in reality she felt cold and shivery slightly out of touch with the planet the initial shock had worn off to be replaced by a stunned disbelief that what had happened actually involved her and a feeling that instead she was a spectator looking in on someone elses nightmare thats good said bob knowing that she was putting on a front but going along with it you were zonked when i called earlier lou said youd taken a couple of pills yes on top of a couple of brandies not such a good idea it was if it did the job he hesitated and background noise flooded into her ear my love im so sorry he blurted out i wish i was there with you maybe thats where i should be im at kl airport but i havent picked up my tickets for the states yet if you want ill cancel them and come home instead i sort of went off at halfcock earlier when andy called and told me what had happened no she said quickly almost sharply you go to new york i might want you here but i need you there ill come over as soon as i can once ive had a chance to make arrangements for the kids meantime please you take care of everything that needs doing and make damn sure that the police throw everything into the investigation a quiet chuckle sounded down the line hey this isnt just someone elses force its someone elses country ill need to tread softly there you dont know how to do that she exclaimed i mean it bob keep them on their toes ill do what i can he promised do you know this man dekker the county sheriff no i dont ive heard my dad mention his name though hes been around for a while hes an elected official and hes part of the civic furniture in buffalo is he a talker or a doer youll have to make up your own mind on that one i will dont worry ill see him soon enough what time is it with you around three am itll be the middle of yesterday afternoon in new york right now so i should get there early this morning i reckon what time does your body think it is she heard him chuckle again my body doesnt have a bloody clue love i just have this strange feeling that when i get to the states ill be a day younger lucky you she muttered instinctively unable to keep the bitterness at bay i feel about ten years older hey im sorry look its still not too late shouldnt i come home first how many times do i have to say it her voice rose he had never heard her sound so strained not even at the worst of times in their marriage he knew how tough she was but he understood that this had to be the worst day of her life okay okay ill go straight there ill call you again from buffalo is that where youre going first no ive asked to be taken straight to the crime scene theyll fly me from place to place my us geographys crap but as i understand it the adirondacks are a couple of hundred miles east of the city then call me from the cabin she sounded calmer and he sensed her need to be involved if thats what you want it is where are you planning to stay in buffalo he paused i havent given that any thought i suppose ill check into a hotel no i want you to stay in my folks house get it ready for me ill be over as soon as i can ill arrange for trish to live in and ask lou or karen martin to look in every so often just to see that the kids arent giving her too much trouble i cant just sit on my ass here itd drive me crazy are you alone now no lous here the men have gone but shes going to stay over tonight with her having lost her dad last month were sort of good for each other sure just watch the brandy the pair of you alcohols a depressant but like you said it also helps you sleep dont you worry about your remy martin though were not going to touch that thats good no we plan an evening on the martinis american style what as in wave the vermouth lightly over the gin no thats too much im going to make them my dads way he believed that the gin and the vermouth could be allowed in the same room but only for a few moments thats all they lay in the dark silent but awake they had finished their celebration meal in a sombre mood had come home and gone straight to bed they had made love intensely passionately as if each had something to prove to the other only neither was sure what it was maggie rubbed the flat of her hand over the ridged muscles of her husbands abdomen not bad she whispered not bad hard enough for you she slid her hand down and held him not any more give it time she eased closer to him her head in the crook of his arm isnt it good she said suddenly you dont have to call me maam any more i wonder how long thatll last for good i think i reckon my only way up the ladder is to go for manny englishs job in a few years when he chucks it but i wont do that im tied to cid its what i do best dont be so inflexible he cautioned you put down english but were all in the same job what would you leave cid i will if i have to i dont feel tied to it at all for example i fancy commanding the city centre unit some day from what i hear youll have to shoot brian mackie if you do hes next in line for that job so they say yeah i know he conceded but still were living in times of change with andy going to tayside and haggerty in from glasgow yes that was a surprise which haggertys appointment not andy i know exactly why hes gone to tayside and i know who put him there who the chief no big bob why so he can bring him back eventually as his deputy she laughed softly almost in his ear you surely have been locked away in special branch for long enough youre out of touch with the politics no the whisper is theres another plan being drawn up such as well all know that when it happens but dont underrate andy martin hes his own man he was never going to live all his life in bob skinners shadow any more than you were in mine im happy to be in your shadow my love the prince consort thats how ive always seen myself three paces behind hands clasped behind back bullshit he gave a mock sigh aye okay bullshit the silence returned but neither felt remotely like sleep your uncle beppe maggie began taking a guess at his thoughts why dont you get on with him because hes a tit theres more to it than that well okay he conceded its not that i dont get on with him its more the other way round when i was a kid my papa viareggio my grandfather and i were very close i worshipped that old man and he trusted me with his confidence in a way he never did with my cousins paula and viola they were that bit younger and also they were girls beppe didnt like that he had always disapproved of my mother marrying a nonitalian catholic or not even though my papa and my nana were both fine about it when i was a wee boy he called me a fucking halfbreed once in front of my papa the old fellow carried this stick he didnt need it it was just for effect and he cracked beppe right across the shoulders with it whipped him as if he was a kid that didnt help things but the real problem was that beppe was afraid of me he was scared that papa would leave me control of the family business the cafes the delicatessen chain the properties the lot he might have too only he died and in the will that he left beppe was to be in control of the trust which is the legal owner of all the family businesses yes said maggie i knew that you told me but why have things still been cool between you since beppe is in charge she felt his shoulder twitch in a slight shrug i suppose its to do with a clause in the will i try not to think about it because i dont like it any more than beppe does what clause you never told me about that like i said i dont like it myself you see beppe inherited control of the business all right but its not as simple as that there are two trustees him and my mother but he has the casting vote but when my mother dies becomes incapacitated or just plain decides to retire the old mans will says that i take her place when beppe dies paula the older of my cousins succeeds him but control passes to my mother and through her to me she sat bolt upright what like i said its the evil day i try not to think about i love the force mags no way would i want to have to leave it well when the time comes cant you just decline abdicate or what have you the silence returned well she insisted its not as easy as that he murmured this is what my papa wanted its a family thing its an obligation and its in my blood the italian cells in it at any rate oh come on im serious beppe might have let it run down a bit but okay i go on about him but it cant be that bad or my mum would have done something about it years ago its still the business my papa built up and if i walked away from it id be snubbing him plus i dont know if i could just hand it over to paula why not is she that thick oh paulas not thick shes anything but does she work in the business ive never been sure oh yes shes involved she runs the deli down in stockbridge but she has other interests such as saunas you mean brothels mario grunted you might say that but i couldnt possibly comment she owns three licensed saunas in central edinburgh that belonged originally to tony manson she bought them when his estate put them on the market you know the way those places run she bought them with what family money no neither my mum nor i would have stood still for it if shed done that how could you have stopped it wed have raised hell with beppe and if that wasnt enough wed have got my nana to veto it my uncle would never disobey her no paula used her own dough to buy those businesses but i dont know where she got it are you saying that your cousins dodgy im saying that when i was in special branch i went so far as to keep a private file on her theres nothing in it to prove that shes bent but ive been a copper long enough to worry about her i like paula you see shes got a wildness about her same as i used to have till i met you what shes doing just now is within the law as it stands i keep tabs on her so that if she ever looks like stepping across the line ill be there to haul her back she settled back down beside him have you spoken to your mother about this i dont need to shes got her eye on the ball and on paula as well hmm she murmured so why this family party i wonder dunno maybe its my nanas idea could be her words still law for all shes eightyseven uncle beppe still jumps when she barks anyway well find out on wednesday thats when it is have i got to go like i said youre specifically invited my dear yes but have i got to go she could sense his smile in the dark id like you to with that lot i might need a witness bob skinners mobile phone stored ninetynine numbers he flicked through the index until he found number sixtysix then pushed the rapiddial button the call was answered on the third ring by a woman in that instant the policeman was taken by surprise his friend was single or had been the last time they had spoken is that the doherty residence he asked sure this is philippa dads watching the ball game of course he had forgotten that joe had a daughter the same age as alexis his own firstborn im taking my life in my hands in that case could you tell him that his friend from scotland is calling just one minute please dad in fact it took less than thirty seconds for joe doherty to come on line hey bob what gives your man martin called me this morning told me what had happened this fucking country i live in he broke off where the hell are you anyway im still in malaysia theres been a delay on my flight but i should be on the move soon sorry to come between you and the lakers or the bulls or whoever the wizards buddy said doherty always the wizards for my sins basketballs a closed book to me mate those two names plus michael jordan are the only ones i know what about magic johnson played for glasgow rangers as far as i know at least he did every now and again he drew a line across the sporting exchange hows the new job going he asked great so far truth is im glad to be back where i belong skinner had known joe doherty since the americans spell as the resident fbi man in the us embassy in london the election to the white house of an old college chum had led to his being plucked from grosvenor square to an exalted post with the national security council the change of tenancy in washington had brought that to an end but the new incumbent had been sufficiently impressed to send doherty back to the bureau as secondincommand and as most insiders saw it director inwaiting andy told you the story about sarahs folks then yeah im really sorry man of course ive done what he asked and a little more two of my people rather than the police will meet you at jfk and arrange your onward transport well fly you upstate in one of our aircraft hey joe i didnt mean for you to get the bureau involved in ferrying me about dont worry about that for one second we know who our friends are especially since last september and im sending a clear signal to the cops on the ground that you are one of them now what else can i do for you i know you didnt just call to improve your working knowledge of the nba skinner laughed lightly all knowledge is power mate i thought that was your lots motto but youre right i was wondering if youd get someone to look into that legendary computer of yours and see if you can come up with a list of unsolved homicides where robbery was the motive jesus bob itll take a lot of paper to print that out doherty interrupted humour me on this eh it was as if he could hear dohertys brain click into gear okay you want anything else while were in there yes can you also print me out a list of murders also unsolved where a wire ligature was used i guess we can manage that too but i hope you got a goodsized document case with you a zero halliburton attache my son the strongest there is well fill it for you you can bet on that doherty paused skinner heard a click and guessed that he was lighting a cigarette havent you chucked smoking yet he asked say that in a soprano voice and youd sound just like philippa have you any idea how many people around the world rely on guys like me to keep them in a job sure ive met several all of them were either oncologists or cardiologists i prefer to think about the little guys in the tobacco plantations and on the production lines but whatever way you look at it im performing a public service anyhow what are you going to do with all this stuff im going to get for you the nothing i just want to help the investigating officers all i can thats all sure by shoving firecrackers up their asses i know you the scot chuckled again if theyre not doing it already im sure theyd get round to it eventually i just thought we could help the process along thats all kid gloves joe ill wear kid gloves i promise you he paused for a second or two doherty thought they had lost the line he never did say it in the movie you know he resumed at last uh he never did say it what play it again sam skinner could almost hear the americans bewilderment as he ended the call and headed for the boarding gate still sleep failed them they made love again but again the usual drowsiness did not follow there was something there still something unsaid a question begging to be asked and so eventually mario did when was the last time you saw him i told you when i grabbed eilidhs hand and hauled her out of that kitchen the last time i saw my father was twentythree years ago and he was battering blood and snot out of my mother never since then never have you ever felt the need to find him never why in gods name would i want to do that the man was a beast how does eilidh feel i dont know because ive never talked to her about what happened she was very young to this very day she might not have realised what happened to her what if he does turn up out of the blue then you deal with him okay i really mean it if i confronted him i dont know what would happen okay she jumped out of bed and went into the ensuite bathroom returning she slid in beside him once more face down propped on her elbows looking at him in the dim crystal light of their beside alarm theres guilt there mario so much of it i feel guilt over what happened to my mother if id kept quiet it would have saved her all that pain on the other hand i feel guilt about not waking up sooner to what was happening to the fact that there was something terribly wrong about our wee secret my dads and mine if i had maybe i could have prevented it from happening to eilidh and even now when you ask me whether i want to trace him i feel guilt because i dont what if he found another woman what if he had more daughters what if he still has by doing nothing im shutting my eyes to that possibility the truth behind it all is that i dont think ive got the guts to face him i just hoped he was dead mario and now i find out that he isnt whats his first name he asked quietly jorge she answered pronouncing the name in the iberian fashion jorge xavier rose my grandmother was portuguese and he lived in lisbon for the first few years of his life his father decided to see out the war there thats where the christian names came from she guessed the reason for his question listen if youre planning to do anything about this i dont want to know she whispered okay she leaned across and kissed him now can we get some sleep unlikely id have thought he murmured cupping her right breast in his big hand not without tiring ourselves out a bit more they did until finally the drowsiness overtook them dc alice cowan was in the office when mcllhenney stepped into the small special branch suite morning sir she said with just a shade of caution in her voice and a good morning to you constable he greeted her if you havent heard im the new broom yes i had heard sir mr mcguire told me yesterday afternoon told you but has he asked you yet what do you mean she asked still in a cagey tone you know damn fine has he asked you whether youll go to the borders with him i know he rates you her cheeks turned a delicate pink yes hes asked me so so i told him that id like to stay here thats if you want me she added i know that special branch commanders sometimes like to bring in their own people their cronies you mean their yesmen like the guy you replaced tommy gavigan relax alice thats not my style if my friend mcguire rates you thats all the more reason for me to want to keep you he nodded towards the door of the inner office which would soon be his is he in yet she shook her head no hes a bit late its not like him ah he and maggiell have been out on the razzle last night bang on cue the door swung open and a slightly blearyeyed mario mcguire strode into the room sorry alice sorry neil he boomed traffic traffic my bottom mcllhenney grunted his marriage to louise had resulted in a moderation of his language that had surprised his friends male and female alike if you cant make it to fettes on time how are you going to manage the commute down to the borders mags and i were talking about that over breakfast he said we might move further out maybe to somewhere near the city bypass as long as you dont actually have to go on the thing in common with most edinburgh carowners the big inspector regarded the constantly overcrowded ring road round the capital as a bad joke how much time have you got mcguire asked him the rest of the day more or less ive gone through the bosss mail and there was nothing spectacular plus hes up in the sky somewhere over the north pacific so i wont be getting any surprise phone calls any progress on that by the way have the americans caught the guy who did it not that ive heard theyd better get their acts together though theyll be under scrutiny in a few hours i just hope theyre taking it as seriously as he thinks they should im sure they are sarahs old man was quite a local heavyweight anyhow apart from that im clear if anything unexpected crops up ruthie knows where i am fine this isnt going to be a short handover the mysteries of special branch are many and complex ive got to teach you all the secret handshakes and code words and of course the safe combinations which youll have to change once im gone so i dont know them any more he led the way through to the inner office so whats it really like this special branch mcllhenney asked his friend looked him in the eye the truth as between buddies of course its a rucking anachronism most of it a holdover from the cold war days in some ways its a wonder were still here because you would not believe how amateur this place used to be back in the fifties and sixties tommy gavigan told me a story about a guy back then name of mcginley the bloke he followed into the job who actually used to go around local newspaper offices offering to pay journalists for private reports on communist party meetings who was there who said what and so on some of the stuff he gots still on file and its rubbish its obvious to a blind man that the joumos just took the piss out of him and took the money as well mind you a couple of the informants are interesting back then they were juniors on local papers but now theyre senior guys one in newspapers the other in telly mcllhenney smiled do they know you know too fucking right they do when i found the file i went to see them both and gave them back the reports they had sold mcginley they were both deeply embarrassed i can tell you and of course since they cant be a hundred per cent sure i didnt keep copies although i told them i didnt and thats the truth i now have two bloody good contacts as a result so that money turned out to be a longterm investment ill give you their names and contact numbers you might like to pay them a call when youve settled in i will do okay where do we start ill brief you on the special branch network around the country youll know some of the names through your job with the boss but ill give you the inside on them but first ive got a bit of private enterprise to do while im still here you never heard any of this okay mcllhenney nodded as long as its not treason fine mcguire unlocked a door in a pillar of his desk and took out a drum like object which his colleague recognised as an oldfashioned rolodex this thing is the bible he said all sorts of surprising people are in this box its been part of this office for donkeys years and soon my boy it will be yours he spun it until he found a card and dialled the number printed on it dss he whispered as he waited ron he said at last mario mcguire i need a favour usual thing ill give you a name i need to know if hes still alive and if so where he is how soon end of the week will be fine okay the guys called jorge xavier he spelled out both forenames rose uk national portuguese mother last known address wellington street leith in the mid to late s hell be early sixties now too young to be drawing a state pension good thanks he paused oh you saw that did you yes im off soon di neil mcllhenneys going to be my successor whats he like he glanced across the desk and winked imagine if you can a grizzly bear with haemorrhoids the big inspector gazed at him as he hung up okay i never heard any of that but if its who i think it is why do i doubt that if you find him youre going to invite him to your place for christmas mcguire shot him a mournful look and shook his head slowly what im going to do mate is make sure that he never turns up at our place at any time of year although it hurt her to be thought of as forbidding nevertheless only one person ever came through her office door without knocking and then only under special circumstances so when it swung open she looked up automatically expecting to see bob skinner on the warpath just as she remembered that he was en route for america a man in a grey doublebreasted suit swept into the room he was squat and ruddy faced with greying crinkly hair which swept back in a v from his high forehead she frowned at him and the short fuse to an explosion started burning inside her until she saw his smile and realised that there was something familiar about him hello there superintendent he boomed in an unmistakable glaswegian accent aye youve come up in the world since the last time i saw you mind a few years back when we were chasing thon bloke that was chopping people up all over edinburgh of course she remembered they had never been introduced but she had seen him with skinner after they had cornered their suspect in his suburban villa willie haggerty the roughedged detective from strathclyde the new acc whose appointment had surprised everyone when andy martin had announced it at his weekly meeting of divisional cid heads the same gathering at which he had confirmed the open secret of his own impending departure for tayside good morning sir she said formally rising from her chair sorry if i disturbed you haggerty continued beaming they said you were on your own and i like to make an entrance stupid of me really just to march into a female officers room like that christ you could have been adjusting your dress or anything although she was careful to keep her face straight she smiled inwardly there was something unreconstructed about the man an innate charm that overrode the most outrageous comments and behaviour more than anyone he reminded her of her husband or touching up my makeup she suggested that sort of girlie stuff she could have sworn that his face turned a slightly deeper shade of red thats me sorted eh he chuckled oh by the way dont be sirring me when theres no troops around the names willie and mines maggie in the same circumstances she allowed her smile to break loose as she settled back into her chair so willie why the surprise visit just getting to know everyone he answered taking the seat opposite her the senior officers dining rooms all very well but by and large its only the headquarters brass that goes there and thats no where a police force is really run rose understood at once why bob skinner had such a liking for the man your predecessor held a similar view she commented so how come he pissed everyone off so fast who says he did mr chase was promoted promoted my haggerty snorted its all right maggie when he was moved into the inspectorate after only a few months every copper in scotland got the message so between us what was his problem she hesitated im not privy to what goes on in the command corridor she began cautiously considering her words but i do know there was resentment in the divisions over the way he went about things he didnt just drop in for a chat in civvies he turned up in full uniform and staged snap inspections okay an acc operations has the right to do that but when he started using inspector good his exec in his place that annoyed quite a few people ahh haggerty murmured that explains it he glanced at rose ive been told i can have an exec he said but the chief was very careful to specify sergeant rank tell me youve done that job for bob i know dyou think i should appoint someone depends how you work she answered if you have a personal assistant you have to keep him or her occupied ted chase appointed jack good as a sort of status symbol because mr skinner has neil but very soon he had to invent things for him to do and thats where a lot of the trouble started mmm thats what i was thinking maybe i should hold fire for a while maybe you should she looked him in the eye so willie is that the real reason why you dropped in on me just to ask me that i mean you could have spoken to neil right there in your office hed have given you the same answer nah theres more to it than that he gave her an innocent look like i said to you when i came in im just getting to know the divisional offices and the people in them sure you are but why me im cid youre acc operations youre not in my chain of command i report to the head of cid and through him to the dcc maybe i just heard so much about the great maggie rose i wanted to meet you for myself flattery and bullshit smell exactly the same i dont fall for either haggerty laughed out loud big bob wisnae kidding about you right enough you dont mess about i did want to meet you though that much was true i wanted to size you up get to know you like why because im on the lookout for a potential divisional commander no names no blame and all that but theres one thats past his sellby date and ive decided that im going to paint him a rosy picture of life after the polls you interested in filling his slot maggie shook her head i want the head of cid job when clan pringle retires even if it means kicking your husband into touch you and he are on the same rung in cid theres only one move up are you saying to me youd tramp on his fingers if you had to her eyes dropped from his and she shook her head no of course not it might come to that though if you set your heart on that job anyhow thats only a chief super post too and its a while off and also whats so great about it do you no fancy my job acc why not these are volatile days maggie unpredictable too it might come up sooner than pringles she looked back up at him the truth is ive never seen myself as a contender for chief officer rank ive come through cid fast but thats because im good at it im under no illusions that im cut out for anything else well hen other people seem to be but the thing is if you decide yourself you want to get there it would be in your best interests to broaden your experience youve been sent to tell me this havent you it was a statement not a question he shot her such a look of mock offence that for a second or two she took him seriously nobody sends willie haggerty he exclaimed oh sorry let me put it another way someones suggested it to you the grin was back in an instant well now you mention it bob skinner might have said something along those lines oh aye and the chief might have agreed with him an all he looked at her wholly serious for the first time im not saying that this is going to happen tomorrow but it pays to be ready all kidding aside ive been doing my homework since i got here as well as listening to what bob and sir james tell me you got me in one this wee chats a sort of informal interview and its confirmed what they say she looked at him with raised eyebrows youre easy to please i make up my mind about people on the spot its the old cid thing evidence is nice but trust your instincts in this case ive got both so please maggie think about it and if its just a matter of worrying about no looking nice in the uniform shirt her laugh interrupted him another girlie thing once more he flushed slightly see me see political correctness were strangers to each other let me put it another way if youre one of the many detectives whove got out of the way of wearing the blue serge youre like me i keep it to the minimum and i let others do the same another reason why you and mr skinner get on rose remarked she took a deep breath okay im duly flattered and i will think about it if for no other reason than that itll get me out of the same loop as mario pleased to hear it the acc said youve made my day it was his turn to pause in that case to help you make an informed decision i want you to sit in for manny for a week or so theres a situation in strathclyde thats needing investigation by senior officers from outside forces ive been asked to provide one and ive nominated him i briefed him on it yesterday that was why he was late back hes off through there as of now and i want you to take temporary charge of the division before you ask ive cleared it with andy martin and clan pringle im not asking you to do the job actively in the way manny does delegate as much as you can just take the command decisions and keep me in touch as necessary you game for that she scratched her chin well she answered thoughtfully we seem to be winning the battle against crime for the moment so im game youve been on the command corridor long enough to know what im talking about said mcguire sure mcllhenney agreed special branch still keeps an eye on the bogeymen its just that the accents have changed come on man thats too simplistic even for you the end of the cold war changed what we do sure but less so than people think the irish problem didnt go away still hasnt there are other international terrorist threats as the folk in lockerbie know too well and there are the general nuisances we watch just in case but on top of all that weve got a role to play alongside the mainstream police in tracking major or organised crime and in gathering information on unusual domestic situations when they might threaten the national interest those fuel demonstrations were a good case in point the first time the government was caught with its drawers round its ankles and the word went out that it wasnt to happen again i know about that mcllhenney chuckled i saw some of the correspondence that came our way at the time aye of course you did i reckon that was a real sea change in our remit which has always been in effect do what youre fucking told but dont let anyone find out about it for the first time it got us involved in keeping tabs on ordinary people folk who arent political or organised in any meaningful way they werent threatening the country as such just the government yet we were brought into the act i dont think i like that its a good time for you to be going then you approve of it no but the answer lies in the ballot box mcguire threw him a glance askance do you actually believe that no but fortunately it also lies in the hands of people like you and me and big bob using our common sense dont let the people in the home office or up the mound hear you say that worry not pal ill be a conscientious spock ill just do it my way like the boss told me to right lets get into these files mcguire was reaching for his keys when his direct line telephone rang he glanced at the panel on the instrument before he picked it up hello ron he said you really should block your number you know especially when youre phoning people like me not that it would do any good he waited yes excellent im impressed hang on let me grab a pen as his successor designate watched he made rapid notes on a pad on his desk that it fine thanks sure our debt to you is duly recorded he hung up tore off the note and put it into his pocket well mcllhenney asked heavily hes alive mores the pity because hes bloody well here theres a gap of twenty years in his uk social security record during that time he was living in portugal and apparently paying contributions there he came back to britain three years ago he spent a short time in london then moved back up to edinburgh only according to my pal he now calls himself george rosewell he lives in newhaven road why would he change his name does he think we might still be after him for wifebattering god knows maybe the portuguese police were after him maybe someone else was an anxious look crossed the big detectives face taking his friend by surprise listen neil he muttered youre my best pal you and only you know about maggies father knocking ten bells out of her mother and leaving them all thats the way its got to stay okay of course im huffed that you should even say that mcguire winced sorry mate i should have known better its just that she started talking about him the other night which shes never done before it came out the blue something trivial happened at work and just seemed to trigger it off lots of stuff shed never even hinted at that had been bottled up in there you think mags is controlled you dont know the half of it i wont go into detail neil but the guy was a real fucking monster worse than i ever suspected i just had to sit there in a bloody restaurant it was and let her get it all out doing my best to keep calm when inside im exploding wanting to kill the bastard i cant do that of course i cant touch him it all has to stay in the past for her sake still i had to find out at the very least whether hes still alive hence my call to ron but now im in a real quandary howzat because of what he does for a living mr george rosewell is the janitor in a primary school right here in edinburgh right here in maggies division it was just after midday yet skinner had to force himself not to think about the weariness which gripped him he had been such a short time in kuala lumpur that his body had not even begun to catch up with the time change before he had flown on to the united states threequarters of the way around the world and he had never been able to sleep on board aircraft his mont blanc watch still set on uk time told him that the jet lag should be no more severe than if he had flown across the atlantic but his biological clock ticked out a different message round the next bend there should be a turnoff to the right said the fbi agent with the map they had been driving for twenty minutes since they pulled off the highway along a road on the west side of the great sacandaga lake which was little more than a forest track the trees were mature and even as early in the growth cycle as they were the woods on either side were dark and deep he thought of robert frost and his horse as he looked at them and wondered what they would be like in winter the two agents isaac brand the navigator and troy kosinski the driver had been waiting for him at jfk as doherty had promised he had spotted them at once they looked the part fit lean and sharpeyed they had whisked him across the airport to a small executive jet which in turn had whisked them all to a local landing strip near saratoga springs in what had seemed to skinner after his two marathon flights to have been no time at all okay there it is brand called to his partner that should take us directly to the crime scene the scot glanced at the agent he had a cynics view of the modem fbi agent seeing them in his minds eye either as short feisty women or as squareshouldered cleancut guys and he was quietly pleased that this one was an exception to his rule his fine features gave him a vulnerable look although the dcc knew that he must have passed the toughest physical examination to have earned his seat in their car kosinski who did fit his mental stereotype made the turn the road narrowed and at once the day grew darker fucking hell skinner exclaimed either of you guys seen the blair witch project the driver looked in the rearview mirror catching his eye we cant comment on that sir he said in a lazy drawl its the subject of a continuing bureau investigation sure zak brand chuckled theres an xfile on it we could arrange for you to meet scully if youd like no thank you gentlemen he answered shes too short for me he was grateful for the banter it kept his mind off what was waiting at the end of the track all the way from new york they had exchanged only pleasantries and platitudes the fbi men had asked no personal questions nor had they referred to the reason behind his visit but finally they were almost there do you know the people wholl be meeting us he asked no sir said special agent kosinski glancing in the mirror once again were new york city operatives this is not territory where wed normally be deployed unless an interstate crime was involved skinner nodded he knew enough about american policing to understand the rivalries between the agencies this is the jurisdiction of the new york state police department homicide squad the local county police department is very small they dont have a detective division so when they run across something like this they call for help damn quick ahead the gloom seemed to lighten and the track widened out almost there sir the agent slowed the car a big general motors off roader as he approached a small clearing a black pontiac saloon with state police markings and a ford explorer were parked at its edge on either side of a mailbox which was set on a pole he leaned out and read the name on it grace yup this is it the three men climbed out of the vehicle skinner saw that there was a path behind the box through the trees he could make out the broad shape of a singlestorey chaletstyle house he sniffed the air it was crisp and fresh and in the distance he heard water lapping and birds crying they set off brand and kosinski taking the lead on the narrow walkway one crime scene looks like any other skinner thought as finally he reached his destination we follow the same rituals with the tape and everything as if thats worth a damn out here hey there in the house brand called out as they stepped around the side of the cabinfbi the front door creaked as it opened and two men stepped out as he looked at them the scotsman found himself thinking in american football terms a quarterback and his minder they were both blond and cleanshaven one was around six feet tall wide at the shoulders narrow at the waist probably in his midthirties the other a few years younger and enormous his body looking as if it was fighting its way out of his clothes about six eight skinner guessed weight at least three hundred pounds he wondered how he had squeezed into the pontiac hi the smaller man greeted them as he walked down the steps from the porch you didnt need to tell me you were the bureau guys id have known you by those suits im dave schultz lieutenant state police bureau of criminal investigation he directed their eyes behind him with his thumb and this is detective toby small one of lifes great ironies the giant gave them an amiable grin schultz looked at skinner so you sir must be the victims sonin law deputy chief skinner is that right the scot nodded reaching out a handshake there was enough in the lieutenants tone to tell him that alien or not his rank was going to count for something did you have a good flight from scotland sir no i had a long flight from malaysia he decided that a little more personal information would do no harm i was due to address an international drugs conference there you got that problem too asked small as if to prove that he could speak skinner glanced up at him detective everyone has that problem in our case we have one of the largest unprotected coastlines in europe so every comedian with a boat thinks he can stuff his ballast tanks with hashish sail it up to wester ross offload it and get away clean more often than not hes right as well his eyes snapped back on to schultz okay lets get something out of the way was it either of you guys who phoned my wife the new york policeman seemed to recoil slightly he held up a hand as if to ward skinner off no sir he said vehemently it was not we heard about that and we apologise that it happened it was one of the local guys playing detective before we got here dont worry hes had his balls fried well make sure hes kept out of my way or ill make him eat them he caught small gazing at him with an expression that he had seen once in the eyes of a police dog as it looked at its handler okay gentlemen he continued if i can have a look at the house are your technicians finished up here yes sir the lieutenant answered theyre all done as you requested weve left the scene as close as we could to the way it was when we got here apart from the bodies of course theyve been taken to the morgue in loudonville our regional headquarters after were done here the coroner would like you to go there he prefers for a family member to make a formal identification weve put a hold on the autopsies till youve done that skinner shivered inwardly outwardly he nodded briskly as he headed up the short flight of steps on to the veranda the new york detectives followed him up but his bureau escorts stayed below anxious he guessed not to offend local sensibilities by intruding on to their scene how were they found the dcc asked schultz that part of the story was pretty vague the lieutenant pointed out towards the expanse of lake which could be seen from where they stood as he did so skinner noticed a jetty with a small powerboat moored against it a neighbour of mr and mrs grace was out in his cruiser getting set for some dawn fishing he saw that the porch light was on and that the front door was open he came ashore to check the place out and found them he called the nearest police office in edinburg skinners eyes screwed up as his momentary bewilderment registered on his face where he asked edinburg schultz repeated its the nearest township although its barely big enough to warrant a dot on the map he shook his head wondering whether it was simply coincidence or whether it had been the name that had first attracted leo to this remote place i see he murmured this fisherman guy hes been checked out has he yes sir were satisfied thats how it really was the guys over seventy even if he had a grudge against the graces he couldnt have killed them like that no i guess he couldnt time of death around pm the coroner reckoned give or take an hour he said it was very cold through that night skinner looked down at the rocking chair at rest now on the wide porch to the left of the front door as he faced it a chalk circle had been drawn around it there was a cushion on the seat untethered but still in place the shape of its occupants buttocks still showing clearly in it nothings been touched that cushions as it was found yes sir youll see the crime scene photographs but the old man was sat in his chair just as if he had died in his sleep thats what mr southern the neighbour thought at first till he went inside the dcc nodded and walked indoors into a big living room with a great hearth filled with the grey ashes of a log fire he looked around the place looked as if it had been turned over by an expert in a hurry most of the cushions of the leather suite stood on end left in those positions by whoever had searched under them the drawers and doors of a big farmhouse sideboard lay open books had been stripped from their shelves flipped open he guessed then thrown on the floor his fatherinlaws flapfront desk which he remembered from the den in his buffalo house had been ripped open the chisel which the killer had used lay beside it the whole scene furniture books every loose object in the room was covered in white fingerprint powder youve been thorough skinner murmured yes sir the lieutenant agreed we always are did you lift any prints nada we got prints of mr and mrs grace mr southern and the cleaning lady plus one or two wild ones but we dont think that any of those belong to the perpetrator they were in the wrong places for him one perpetrator theres no indication that there was more than one perp there are creaking boards all over the deck outside yet mr grace was taken completely by surprise my gut feeling is that this was a lone burglar did he get anything do you think well need you or someone else to do an inventory but as far as we can tell he got money cards watches rings other valuables everything youd expect in a robbery the big scots policeman shook his head not everything lieutenant schultz not everything he picked up a book from the floor and held it out see this its a first edition ofmoby dick and its signed by herman melville he looked at the volumes on the floor and selected another then turned to the flyleaf that signature james thurber if you root around here for long enough youll find first editions signed by mark twain ernest hemingway margaret mitchell and god knows who else im no expert but theres thousands of dollars no tens of thousands lying on the floor here yet this guy looks through them all for some reason then just leaves them here and this you tell me is a professional thief whos prepared to kill he broke off wheres the kitchen he asked sharply through there said small pointing to a door to the left of the hearth skinner walked across and looked inside the inevitable outline was chalked on the floor there was blood too a lot of blood around where the body had lain streaking the pine doors of the wall cupboards and splashed across one of the work surfaces bastard he murmured the guy cut through an artery with the strangling wire schultz explained unnecessarily it must have been over in seconds though bob thought of his gentle parentsinlaw as he pictured the scene his head swam and for an instant it was as if he had been there and he could see it all happening he felt himself sway and grabbed hold of the nearest worktop to steady himself he knew that he could not postpone sleep for much longer as far as he could see neither detective had noticed his moment of weakness he led them out of the kitchen and out of the house as he stepped out on to the wide porch his cellphone sang out joe doherty was on the line where are you he asked at the cabin by the lake ive seen what was done and how thanks for brand and kosinski by the way theyve been great right now theyre down below practising diplomacy what you got a shitawful mess the officer in charge here feels there was only one killer and i agree with him leo and susannah were clearly killed by the same person expertly at that if there had been more than one theyd probably have taken one each where you going next were going back to saratoga springs to see the coroner and do whats necessary there then your guys are going to take me on to buffalo fine let me know when you get there by the way doherty added just when skinner thought he was going to ring off did you get that stuff i sent you yes what did it tell you what i thought it would he heard a heavy sigh okay i give in whats with the play it again sam what did you mean by that skinner chuckled but grimly without a trace of a smile its my suspicious mind at work the whole thing made me think of casablanca my favourite movie remember where bogart says of all the gin joints in all the world she had to walk into mine well my friend tell me this of all the vulnerable lakeside cabins in the great united states of america why did this guy have to walk into leo graces the chief superintendents office was bigger than hers but the view from the window was no better rose gave it only a brief glance and then turned her gaze back to the uniformed officers sat at the meeting table two superintendents clearly bristling that she was chairing the meeting and three chief inspectors of whom at least one was enjoying their discomfort thats the way it is she said briskly youve all seen the accs memo anything you would normally bring to mr english you bring to me in his absence otherwise its business as usual i know that the chief super is in the habit of holding monday morning meetings with this group ill continue that practice except that for the duration of this arrangement which hopefully will not be long theyll be on friday afternoons the monday timing clashes with the head of cids weekly briefing and i have to be there she caught the look of surprise on one superintendents face and shot the group a brief glance yes gentlemen im doing two jobs so please dont take the piss dont go bringing me decisions that you would normally take yourself the two senior officers stared back at her unblinking she would have welcomed haggertys presence to underline his message but she knew that this was part of the test cids going through a quiet spell just now she continued but the hooligans dont work to a timetable so that could go pearshaped at any moment to make sure that im always contactable im going to have a gobetween a runner pc haddock one of our young probationers will be my contact he will know where i am at any given moment hope hes up to the job grunted superintendent davie halliday backwatching calls for a bit of experience rose looked at him evenly i dont see why it should in this case she said i have every confidence in my fellow officers everyone in the room halliday included read the warning in her words she stood up ending the meeting okay gentlemen thats all barring crises ill see you here at three oclock on friday when we can run through the programme for next week if anyone does need me ill be in my own office im not moving in here she ushered them to the door then went back to her own room back in familiar territory she called the front office and asked for haddock and dont scare the boy this time she added pointedly no more than a minute later there was a knock on her door haddock was less nervous that on his first visit but still eyed her cautiously as he stood all teeth and sharp elbows in front of her desk you sent for me maam he ventured obviously what do they call you constable haddock whats your christian name harold maam he answered but everybody calls me sauce ye ken like in brown sauce like you put on a fish supper rose wrinkled her nose you might i certainly dont but sauce it will be if thats what youre comfortable with right heres why i wanted you she explained the duties she had in mind for the young officer as she spoke she fancied his chest puffed out a little and he began to look a little less awkward okay sauce have you got that whenever i leave the station ill tell you where im going and how i can be contacted if you see me heading out the front door and i havent told you stop me and ask me haddock nodded his face telling her that he hoped it would not come to that good you are now my official temporary gopher you can start right away youd better get me those bloody nightshift reports the bedside phone sounded at five minutes past seven sarah snatched it up on the second ring normally at that hour it would have wakened her but seonaid had done that already having claimed her mothers attention in the manner of infants she was asleep once more on the pillow on bobs side of the bed she knew who was calling before she heard his voice hi she answered softly where are you im in buffalo im sorry i didnt call you from the scene like you asked but i just couldnt with those guys around i understand how are you im fine you dont sound fine you sound tired if i do its because i am i fell asleep at seven oclock yesterday evening and i woke up an hour ago poor love you at the house no not yet i checked into a hotel for the night the hyatt regency in fountain plaza i just told the guys to take me anywhere i was so damn knackered i didnt think to look for keys at the cabin and anyway i dont know the alarm combination to make it hasslefree i called the security company that looks after the place theyve got everything ill need to get in my fbi nursemaids are taking me to meet them there at midday tomorrow hopefully ill have had some more kip by then have you seen sheriff dekker yet she asked speaking urgently yet quietly at the same time for fear of waking her daughter gies a break love i spent most of yesterday with little and large the state coppers how was the cabin upside down ransacked just as i was told id find it and where else did they take you he could hear her hesitancy they took me to the morgue ive done the formal identification and given the coroner signed authority to proceed with the autopsies hes doing everything by the book how how were they he had been waiting for that question he could still see their faces he always would leos eyes had been bulging almost out of their sockets and susannahs head had been all but severed by the wire garrotte peaceful theyd barely have known a thing he told her when can we have the funerals the coroner said hell open an inquest then adjourn it indefinitely after that hes prepared to release the bodies shouldnt be more than a couple of days ill contact an undertaker and get things under way be prepared for a big turnout love and not just of family and friends this is big news in the media here its all over television and the papers i was filmed going into the coroners office in loudonville i didnt want to speak to anyone so schultz and small the local guys took me out the back way after i was done i thought you said they were called

bureau escorts are collecting me at eleven well get the house opened and then ill go and see dekker although im not quite sure why in the circumstances what do you mean i mean that the investigation has sod all to do with him the crime happened a hell of a long way from here and its state jurisdiction quite clearly my seeing him is really no more than a courtesy call well just remember be courteous we set great store on that in the usa yes dear ill be nice i promise i might even call him sheriff she heard him stifle a yawn how are the kids he asked she looked at seonaid and saw that she was awake and peering back at her curious one of thems right here she answered say hello to her looking at it from the street mario mcguire could see that hargreen primary school had grown over the years and had changed rapidly in the process back in the days when colinton village really was a village it had probably boasted three or four classrooms in a small stone building and would have been perfectly adequate for its purpose given the standards and methods of the day happily not for decades had its pupils been crammed into classes of fifty cowed and frequently thrashed into obedience and attention the original school was still there but a brass plate on its door indicated that it was now the administration block a big modern structure seemed to burst out from it enveloping it in grey concrete and a second block of roughly similar design had been added at some later point the architecture was definitely not frank lloyd wright but neither was the surrounding area the detective checked his watch it was twentyfive past one and the playground was empty the hargreen primary pupils were back at work after lunch he opened the green wooden door of the administration block and stepped into a small vestibule its only furniture an umbrella stand well used on that showery day it opened out into a slightly larger hall its walls lined with the work of children straight ahead facing him there was a door with the word janitor printed on a burnished metal plate as he walked up to it mcguire took a deep breath then turned the handle and pushed it open the room was empty he looked around it was famished with a steelframed desk and chair a small fridge a grey filing cabinet a coatstand and a small table on which were a kettle a jar of coffee a box of tea bags and a jar of sugar a big white mug sat beside them with the word jannie emblazoned in big blue capital letters a dayglo yellow tunic and a crossing wardens hat were hanging on the stand and a tall traffic lollipop stood in the far corner he noticed a grey metal wastebin beside the desk he was about to look in it when an insistent female voice sounded behind him excuse me didnt you see the sign it asked as he turned all visitors to the school must first report to the office no he answered untruthfully i didnt see it he looked at the woman grey wellcut hair plump peachcoloured woollen sweater mocktartan mocktweed skirt brown tights sensible shoes inky fingers he guessed at once who she was but he asked his question out of politeness are you the head teacher as she smiled and gave a selfdeprecating shake of her head he knew that he had been right and that he had made a friend oh no she said im only the school secretary mrs dewberrys the head teacher shes in her room would you like to see her i take it youre a parent mcguire shook his head no im not a parent im a policeman detective superintendent mcguire the woman gave a small gasp ohhh youd better see mrs dewberry then just hold on a minute as she bustled across the hall and down a corridor leading off to the right mcguire glanced into the wastebasket it was empty quickly he tried the desks only drawer but it was locked he stepped out of rosewells room closed the door behind him and followed the secretary into the corridor at once his eye was caught by a big display panel along the wall on his left it bore the heading hargreen primary our staff and carried individual headandshoulders photographs of the teaching complement top front and centre an attractive woman in her thirties smiled out oval face glowing chestnut hair the sort of eyes that won your confidence at first sight mr mcguire he turned and the woman was looking at him in real life but without the smile im pat dewberry the head teacher come into my office she held the glazed door open for him and followed him inside as he entered the secretary gave him a quick smile then slipped out take a seat please said mrs dewberry he followed her pointing finger and settled on to a chair it was soft but for him uncomfortably low she sat facing him with a final tug on her shortish skirt he took out his warrant card and showed it to her she looked at it nodded and handed it back a superintendent eh she began and in plain clothes we usually have uniformed sergeants in here she paused mrs bamards bringing us coffee i assume thats okay with you i never met a policeman who didnt drink coffee youve still got a hundred per cent record then he chuckled her eyes stayed cool as she looked at him so what brings you here mr mcguire and what are you youre not a community policeman thats for sure he decided to volunteer a little of the truth not in the sense you mean im special branch highly predictable body language normally followed that disclosure the other person would draw back slightly and would throw him a look that registered either consternation or fear and sometimes both pat dewberry simply raised an eyebrow really she exclaimed i didnt think that existed any more youve made my day its not often you get to meet a genuine anachronism she caught his surprise stop it pat she chided herself sprry to be so flippant she continued but my grandfather was an oldfashioned communist through in glasgow one of the red clydesiders he knew shinwell very well he was in court with him although the sheriff decided he was too young to go to jail i grew up to tales of the special branch grandpa used to think of them as his regular companions in fact he was quite friendly with some of them i just thought that when his party disappeared so did you i wish we could said mcguire but there really are dangerous people still in the world and they have to be watched and in here she asked showing a trace of impatience have i got a terrorist on my staff he shook his head i doubt it no i didnt walk into the janitors office by mistake i was looking for him george rosewell whats he done mario looked the woman in the eye and decided that she could be trusted with more of the truth recently nothing that i know of hes my fatherinlaw ahh she exclaimed there i go getting my conspiracy theories sorted out and it turns out to be a family matter as it happens im looking for the old devil too he hasnt turned up for work this week and he hasnt called in sick either i phoned him but i got no reply i suspect youll find him in the pub or in the betting shop when you do tell him hes in bother and send him back in mrs dewberry stopped abruptly as the door opened and mrs barnard returned with a smile for mcguire and coffee for them both when she had gone she picked up her mug and glanced at the detective but why do i sense that this isnt really a family visit because youre a perceptive lady thats why rosewell or rose to use his real name walked out on his family more than twentyfive years ago he lived abroad for most of that time ive only just learned that hes back in scotland so youve come to arrange for him to be reunited with his longlost daughter not quite should i be looking for a new janitor that might be no bad idea after ive spoken to him he might not want to stick around he drank half of his coffee in a single swallow tell me mrs dewberry have you ever had any complaints about him what kind any kind from parents or children either a mother complained about him once she said that he had frightened her daughter i investigated of course but it came to no more than george having spoken sharply to the girl because she was slow in getting back to her class after the break i told him to leave that to the teachers in future since then ive had no bother she looked keenly at him as if for the first time he had really interested her youre not trying to tell me hes on a register somewhere are you if that was the case it would have been reported to the education authority at once no im not trying to tell you anything but to come back to your earlier question ill come off the fence yes you should find another janitor because im going to make absolutely certain that george rosewell never works in this or any other school again under that or any other name the teacher nodded and drank more of her coffee i wont ask how youre going to do that she said ill just report his unexplained absence to the directorate and insist that he be replaced ive been here for a while that will happen automatically he isnt a union member either so that wont be a problem mcguire glanced into his mug his italian blood rebelled against finishing what was in it he raised himself from his low chair thanks for your confidence he murmured thanks for yours dont worry none of this leaves this room if i was worried about that none of it would have come into it what will you do she asked go to see him at home yes first chance i get although that wont be today listen if he does turn up for work in the morning would you give me a call thats my direct line number if im not there you can leave a message with inspector mcllhenney or pc cowan he handed her a business card ill do that she opened the door for him and accompanied him along the corridor as they reached the display panel he stopped and looked at the photographs there on the bottom row he saw him looking a good deal younger than his years cleanshaven his face and bald head heavily tanned gazing out at him with eyes that were chilling in their familiarity he would have known him even without the name printed below can i have that he asked you might as well she said its no use to me now its a good likeness carefully she prised it from the board and handed it to him there will you show that to your wife good question mrs dewberry good question bob skinner stood at the foot of the driveway and looked up at the big house on stanford avenue it was whitepainted twostorey with a pillared front and a terrace which seemed to run all round the house at the level of the upper floor neocolonial his fatherinlaw had called it flashy had been skinners description he shuddered at the thought of leo and susannah in that smalltown morgue he with those terrible bulging eyes she with a towel draped over her savaged neck by a considerate attendant although his police mans training had forced him to remove it to see for himself what had been done to her he had been very fond of leopold grace and his wife they had never treated him with anything other than affection even when he and sarah had gone through their estrangement and when he had gone to the states to visit his son and to see whether there was any ground on which they might build a renewal his fatherinlaws legal career had made him tolerant and nonjudgemental and while their conversations at that time had been frank he had never come away from one without feeling at least understood the representative of the security company which monitored the alarm system was waiting for him at the front door as he approached with the dutiful brand and kosinski at his heels she was tall and long legged around the thirty mark and dressed in a pale blue business suit with her shoulderlength auburn hair she looked vaguely like sarah mr skinner she asked her hand outstretched he nodded and shook it im kelly lance do you have the court order yes he took an envelope from his jacket pocket it held confirmation from a probate judge of the district court that he and sarah were joint executors of leos will youd better have a look at it he said she glanced at the official stamp on the outside thats okay she undipped a slim leather case and looked inside eventually producing a thick folded document setting the case at her feet she unfolded the sheet and held it out for him to see this is a plan of the alarm system its wired into the nearest police precinct they guarantee twominute response if it lights up have they had any incidents in the last couple of days skinner asked no at least none theyve told us about and they would have since we hold the keys to the property so wheres the control box in the usual place just inside the front door the first sensor has a programmed delay so that once the owner unlocks he has thirty seconds to key in the code number and disable the system shall we go in he nodded yes lets get on with it whats the code kelly lance glanced at the plan eight nine two and seven she read fine security he thought leo s birthday she handed him the keys as they stepped up to the big solid white painted door indicating which two from the bunch he would need one was a simple yale but the other was for a fivelever doublelocking mortise he unlocked them both and opened the door seeing the sensor light flick on as he did so he saw the small control panel at once and flipped back the lid covering the number pad he looked at the indicators then at kelly lance this isnt active is it she shook her head no if it was there would have been an audible signal as soon as the sensor picked you up skinner frowned as he stepped into the big familiar house in which his wife had grown up in which he had spent happier times himself how long had they been away he asked the woman they advised us last saturday week that they were driving up to the adirondacks for a month we have their telephone number at the lake on our files for use in the event of an incident but you havent had one no everythings been silent since then but it would have been wouldnt it since mr grace didnt set the alarm i know they have a cleaning woman is it possible that she could have been in and forgot to reset the pad when she left thats possible but unlikely we require our clients to give us the names of all keyholders even those who might only have access for a few days theres no one on their list other than mr and mrs grace themselves and dr sarah grace skinner their daughter who has definitely not been here in the last ten days he looked over his shoulder and called to the fbi agents who were waiting outside come on in lads kosinski stepped into the entrance call with brand close behind everything okay sir he asked skinner shook his head no my brains not working very well have you got a number for lieutenant schultz yes sir he dipped two fingers into the breast pocket of his jacket and drew out a business card the scots cellphone was in his hand as he took it from him he glanced at it to make sure that he was tuned into a network and dialled the number shown new york state police loudonville drawled a nasal operator schultz was in his office deputy chief skinner he said what can i do for you you can find the guy who killed leo and susannah failing that tell me something before i got there yesterday were there any personal effects removed from the house specifically i mean keys no sir none at all that was in accordance with your request however since your visit we have removed certain valuable or sensitive items the books for example and keys will be among those let me check please this may take a moment would you like me to call you back no ill hold as it happened schultz was gone for less than a minute i have them here sir im looking at all the keys that were recovered from the cabin okay im looking for a brass fivepointed key with no manufacturers name and for ayaletype latchkey again without a manufacturers name they were supplied by my company kelly lance whispered to him as part of our security they are unmarked in any way no sir schultz replied in a slow deliberate tone after a few seconds perusal i have nothing like that here i two chubb keys and two mailbox keys and thats all he paused can i ask what this is about sir do you have a problem in buffalo i think we might have in fact i think your investigations just moved about three hundred miles west wed better get there in that case ill clear it with my boss put a hold on that for a bit said skinner ill have a look around here after that well get back to you he ended the call and turned to the two special agents leo grace might have been over seventy he told them but he was as meticulous a man as i ever met no way did he call ms lances office to report that he was leaving town then forget to set his alarm somebodys been in here impossible kelly lance protested no it isnt snapped skinner nothings perfect nothings foolproof how do you keep your records on computer all of them yes and if someone hacked into it would you know yes wed know straight away she hesitated ifthe system was in use exactly but if it wasnt youd have to check back to know that it had been accessed do that call your office and have them do it now his eyes flashed back to the fbi men whose bloody jurisdiction are we in now out here in the suburbs this still belongs to the erie county police department brand answered okay i want them here now im not going to see sheriff dekker in the circumstances i think its better that he comes to me ah bet you thought id have cotton wool stuffed in my cheeks beppe viareggios voice boomed around the room drawing sharp glances from his mother and sisters the look that maggie gave him was a mixture of genuine bewilderment and forced tolerance from the moment he had stuffed an envelope full of cash into her hand at their wedding reception she had never cared for beppe hopefully he looked at her eager for the slightest sign that she understood his joke marion brando ken he offered finally giving in in the godfather thats how he was able to mumble like that he had his cheeks stuffed with cotton wool mario laid a hand on his uncles shoulder okay don beppe he said quietly with a grin and a mock italian accent i come to you and i ask you humbly for your aid i ask you to do me a small favour as my godfather and as my friend please to knock off the mafia patter you know it really annoys my nana and my mum looks none too happy either beppe shrugged his shoulders okay my boy he mumbled i will do you this favour but one day i may ask you to do me a small service in return the policeman shook his head as he ambled away before casting his eye around the living room of beppes penthouse the biggest flat in a new development looking across the water to the offices of the civil servants who served the scottish executive there were ten members of the clan at the party in addition to maggie and himself his gaze took them all in his nana his mother his uncle beppe and aunt sophia his unmarried cousin paula her younger sister viola with her husband stanley coia and their children ryan and david stan was a manchester united fan and finally the venerable auntie josefina papa reggios ninetyfouryearold sister brought by beppe from her nursing home she sat in a chair by the window sipping from a glass of dark amarone having forgotten at least half an hour before where she was or why she was there taking his wifes arm mario led her over to his grandmother honest to god the old lady muttered glowering across at her son sometimes i wonder how that one manages to get up in the morning wi the little brain hes got if your papa had heard him talk that nonsense she looked at maggie im sorry lassie we dont get together enough as a family but i can hardly blame the two of you for steering clear of that son of mine nana viareggio may have been eightyseven years old but her back was still ramrod straight and she carried herself with the air of a woman in her seventies she was tall and slim with piercing brown eyes and silver hair which was always bound tight in a bun and she dressed predominantly in black from marios earliest memory of her she had never seemed to change indeed there were moments when he fancied that she was growing younger her christian name was maria he knew but he had never heard anyone other than his grandfather address her by it she was mama to beppe and sophia and to christina his own mother and nana to everyone else she and her only grandson had been close before papa viareggios death and they had grown closer since he and maggie saw more of her than of christina and visited her for lunch on the first sunday of every month she frowned at beppe once more listen to him she muttered you know son for all that big bogirish father of yours god rest his generous soul youre more italian than your uncle ever was or ever will be when they named you after your papa i think much of him passed into you you understood him and you still value the things he did like your dad he died too soon or a lot of things might have been different she put a strong hand on his elbow and drew him into a corner thats what we want to talk to you about your mother and i she said quietly what do you mean as he spoke he realised that maggie was no longer by his side aunt sophia had taken her off to meet the two boys who were dressed inevitably in manchester united shirts as he glanced across at them his mother moved towards him as if answering a private summons by nana christina mcguire was tall and handsome like her mother and like her she was a oneman woman who regarded her widowhood as a period not of mourning but of waiting i mean nana continued reclaiming his attention that theres family business to be talked about such as such as your part in it his mother answered pausing for a moment to let her words sink in ive made a decision mario im retiring im selling my share of the business to rachel and bert christina mcguire was an edinburgh player in her own right she had trained as a personnel manager after leaving university and had worked in industry until two years after marios birth and with backing from her father she had set up a recruitment consultancy she had begun by specialising in finding staff for the financial services industry and she had shared in its success and expansion over the years the scope of her business had broadened taking in new sectors including law and accountancy and adding on a training division christina had refused several offers for the company preferring to control her own destiny with the support of the two partners who had joined her in the eighties rachel dawson and robert ironside her son stared at her in surprise through all of his life her consultancy had been part of her when his father big eamon had died of cancer ten years earlier it more than anything or anyone else had helped her deal with the tragedy you serious he exclaimed never more so she assured him you realise that as soon as youre gone those twoll sell out good luck to them if they do im happy with my deal he put his hands on her shoulders and kissed her on the cheek in that case good for you mum if its what you want to do i couldnt be more pleased for you he frowned suddenly but what the hells it got to do with me im not just retiring from the consultancy son christina answered im going away ive bought a house in florence and im going to live there i want to study fine art i want to paint and i want to listen to music till my heads completely filled with it im selling my flat in northumberland street whenever i come back ill stay with mama or with you and maggie he blew out his cheeks youre taking my breath away but again if this is what you really want then go for it christina had never been a demonstrative woman but she pulled her son to her and hugged him im so glad you feel that way all things considered gradually the rest of the truth began to dawn on him and he understood the real reason for the family gathering wait a minute he exclaimed on either side of him the two women smiled youve got it said his mother im retiring from all my business including the family trust and in that event my place as a trustee passes to you oh bloody hell mum he protested i cant take that on not now ive just been given a division to run surely to christ you can still do that from italy no she answered adamantly i want my life back mario im sixty two years old and i still have things to do ive been a trustee since papa died and ive run my own business at the same time now its your turn but come on the paperwork can be couriered out to you you can fly back for trustee meetings no nana viareggio snapped it was the first time she had spoken sharply to him in thirty years your mother has made her decision the old woman declared in a judicial tone youve always known this day would come lad just you be thankful it hasnt been forced on you by him upstairs and anyway i know quite well that youve been keeping an eye on things all along i told you youve got your papas blood in you he needs you i need you its time backed into a corner mario looked from one to the other what the hell is this he grunted there might be only two witches here but i still feel like bloody macbeth you cant avoid whats for you said his grandmother besides theres a job needs doing that only you can do its beyond beppe hes not a bad man but hes a fool to himself and hes not up to this on his own whats that the old lady nodded almost imperceptibly across the room maggie and aunt sophia had been joined by another striking viareggio woman she was only an inch or two shy of six feet tall oliveskinned with dark eyes and lustrous hair which had turned silver prematurely she wore it undisguised with pride and to some it made her look around forty although in fact she was only thirtytwo that one there murmured nana you have to keep a very close eye on your cousin paula shes my granddaughter as much of my blood as you are so it pains me to say it but i do not trust that girl she patted him on the shoulder now mario son you call everyone to attention your mother has her announcement to make bob skinner looked at bradford dekker and thought of his own chief where sir james proud was silverhaired massive and statesmanlike in his uniform a man of gravitas his counterpart in buffalo was sleek sharpsuited around his own age and looked more like a stereotypical car salesman than a policeman this was not unnatural since he was a politician first and foremost on skinners first visit to buffalo leo grace had told him about a former sheriff of erie county grover cleveland who had gone on to become president of the united states as he appraised dekker he tried to imagine him taking the oath of office on the capitol steps he tried but he failed whether it was prompted by the murdered leo graces standing in his home town or by courtesy to a fellow police officer the sheriff had come to the house on stanford avenue without the faintest sign of annoyance at the summons he stood in the hall at the foot of the broad flight of stairs which led to the upper floor with skinner brand and kosinski kelly lance having been sent back to her office to check how often her companys computer had been accessed within the last few weeks and whether all of these searches had been authorised the two uniformed officers who had brought him to the scene were on guard at the open front door staring grimly at the few neighbours who had been attracted out by their car to see what might be going on how well did you know my fatherinlaw mr dekker skinner asked i knew him very well the sheriff replied i was an intern in mr graces law firm twenty years ago he took an interest in me and directed me towards criminal work then when my intemship was over he pulled a couple of strings to get me a post in the state attorneys office you must have impressed him dekker gave him a slightly sheepish look maybe but i had clout with him too he and my father were colleagues in the democratic party as a matter of fact my dad nominated mr grace for the state senate of course he wouldnt have gone to bat for me if he hadnt thought i was up to it but he reached out to the people in albany because of their history he still had contacts twenty years ago dekker glanced at him from beneath a raised eyebrow bob your fatherinlaw still had contacts last week mr grace told everyone that he gave up politics a long time ago but that wasnt exactly true shit it wasnt at all true he was a kingmaker among democrats and privately through his contacts he raised a lot of money for the party when the new us senator started angling after the nomination he was the second person she came to see straight after she saw the incumbent he must have approved of her because without the support of leopold grace well to say the least shed have found things a whole lot more difficult mmm skinner murmured thats a side of the man that i never knew at all mind you i have a natural antipathy towards politicians maybe he read that and kept it from me that would have been just like him dekker agreed other than in the courtroom or in negotiation he never forced his views in anyones face he was a very considerate very polite man and you wont find anyone in buffalo to disagree with that opinion not even our republicans the sheriffs jaw set in a firm line thats what makes what happened to him and mrs grace so hard to take be sure my friend the killings might have taken place outside my jurisdiction but im leaning pretty hard on the state police to get results in that case said skinner slowly you wont be unhappy if i bring the investigation on to your doorstep uhh how you gonna do that he glanced around the hall someones been in this house sheriff after leo and susannah were killed the cabin by the lake was trashed and the usual money cards and valuables were taken to make it look like a robbery but the keys to this place were taken too when i opened the house with the woman from the security firm the alarm had been deactivated he paused for a second let me ask you something knowing leo as you did would you agree that it would have been unlike him to call the company to tell them he was leaving town then forget to set the thing the sheriff nodded vigorously i sure would he was just about the neatest man i ever met and he didnt just phone the security people when he left he always phoned the precinct office as well to tell the desk sergeant there could you call him to confirm that he did the same this time sure he moved towards the hall table ill use this phone no said skinner sharply use this one he took out his cellphone and gave it to the police chief dekker gave him a puzzled look but took the phone and dialled turning his back to the three others as the call was answered after a couple of minutes he rang off and handed the phone back to the scot not only did he speak to the precinct he told him heavily he told the sergeant not to worry that he was about to set the alarm that tears it youre right someones been in here i knew that for sure anyway skinner confessed we had a quick look round before you got here dont worry we touched nothing just looked the house looks immaculate but its been searched look at that hall table and at the dining table and youll find thick layers of dust on them both then go into leos den and look at his desk and his filing cabinet theres hardly any to be seen someones given it an expert going over but god knows what he was looking for as far as i can see nothings been taken shit dekker hissed in that case we better get the hell out of here and call in a sceneofcrime team yes said skinner your people certainly but also of necessity the same team who went over the cabin inthe adirondacks they need to look for forensic matches you might waend for the state detectives too schultz and small this thing has to be coordinated shit again a territorial war with the state cops is just what i do not need that may be overridden said skinner what do you mean as if in reply the big dcc handed him back the cellphone first you give those orders then well take it back to your office and ill explain the sheriff nodded and made two calls one short to his own specialist unit the other longer to the head of the state police bureau of criminal investigation returning the phone to skinner he retrieved the key to his car from one of the patrolmen on the door then headed towards it beckoning the three to follow him the journey into the centre of buffalo took no more than twenty minutes the graces house was in an eastern suburb of the small lakeside city and as they drove westward the surroundings became first more industrial then as they passed the football ground more commercial the day was clear and cool sitting in the back of the car that the fbi men had hired skinner wound down the window to enjoy the fresh air and to listen to the universally familiar sound of the lake erie gulls dekkers office was on the top floor of the lowrise headquarters building on delaware avenue in the business heart of buffalo the city had always reminded him of edinburgh inasmuch as it appeared to be a tightknit community where everyone probably knew everyone else no calls the sheriff barked brusquely to his secretary as he ushered his three companions into his spacious room he pointed them at a small conference table and took a seat at its head okay bob i ought to call the chief of my criminal investigation unit but something tells me i should hold on that lets hear what youve got to say first he said skinner laid his big silver document case on the table opened it and took out a pile of computer printouts which brand had given him when they had met at jfk and which he had begun to study on the flight upstate he separated them into two bundles then looked dekker straight in the eye do you know how many burglary homicides we have in scotland in a year brad i have no idea none dont get me wrong we have an endemic burglary problem and we have our share of murders sometimes in fact it seems to me that in edinburgh we have more than our share he flashed an ironic grin at least when im around but our thieves just do not break into peoples homes not even rich peoples homes with the intention of killing then robbing is it all that much different here the erie county sheriff shook his head no i cant say as it is our homicides tend to be gang things or family things he paused but were not talking about buffalo here were talking about the adirondacks thats a whole different country maybe so but rural new york state actually has a lower homicide rate than you do in fact it hardly has any it also has a very low incidence of burglary the place where leo and susannah were killed is remote in terms of this part of the eastern united states at any rate and thats true of most of the communities like it from what ive been told by the bci chief many of them barely are communities just a collection of cabins gathered around lakesides many of them empty for much of the year furnished sparsely with no valuables left there whos going to travel upstate to rip off a tv set and a few cheap knives and forks answer no one so lets get real the guy who killed my inlaws went there to do just that he tapped the larger of the bundles before him this stuffs from the fbi computer he said countrywide in the last three years there have been fewer than ten genuine burglary homicides which match this one even remotely so lets forget that theory this was murder first and foremost if you want me to convince you lets look at the way leo and susannah were killed they werent completely in the back of beyond out there the nearest cabin is half a mile away and that lake is fished from dawn till midnight theres always some bugger out in a boat sound travels especially over water the guy couldnt exactly have walked in with a sawnoff and blown them all over the rucking place so he didnt instead he strangled them with a wire garrotte why because he was a pro and because that was his method of choice id guess he watched them for a couple of days saw leo sit on the porch around suppertime and chose that as his moment the old man was taken completely by surprise and so i guess was susannah since she was still in the kitchen when she was killed lets go on how many murders have there been in the entire united states in the same threeyear period in which the victims have been garrotted in the same way that is in which the killer has used a wire ligature dekker shook his head skinner ruffled the smaller bundle on the desk the answer according to the great big computer is twentyfive of these twelve took place in miami florida and were the tramblrk of a gang called the toledos who chose to use lengths of razorwire and to strangle their victims slowly they were distinguished by the amount of blood at the scene most of the poor bastards bled to death in fact of the remaining thirteen nine were domestic crimes in which the victims as it happens they included five wives one grandfather and three mothersinlaw were related to the murderer all of the perpetrators are now in jail other than one who refused to appeal his death sentence and was executed three months ago that leaves four not counting leo and susannah in every one of those cases the victim was murdered at home two of them were italians known to have been involved in organised crime and two of them were colombians a husband and wife drug dealers who had been ripping off their suppliers okay i agree said the sheriff but how does that tie in with what you said back at the house about jurisdiction over the investigation finally skinner smiled the big broad smile of a cardplayer laying down a winning hand on the journey upstate and in my waking hours in the hotel ive been through all of these burglary homicide reports theyre very detailed it says a lot for the fbi computer ask it a specific question and youll get an answer it took a while but eventually i found two files which set together make interesting reading one homicide took place in a suburb of las vegas two weeks ago the victims name was sander garrett he lived alone in a big new luxury development on the outskirts of the city he was found dead in his kitchen cause of death a single gunshot wound to the head his house had a security system which garrett normally set at night but when the cops arrived they realised that it wasnt activated there were no signs of forced entry the other murder was committed five days later in helena the state capital of montana again the victim was a lone male bartholomew wilkins he was found dead in the den of his home by his wife roseanne when she got back from the shopping mall the autopsy showed that hed been killed by a single blow from a slim stilettotype blade driven into his brain with great force in each case cash and other items were taken from the scene of the crime and it was written up as a burglary in which the victim had disturbed his killer until now that is the big scot leaned forward across the desk his shoulders hunching in the jacket of his dark suit you see sheriff there are three very remarkable coincidences in these two cases which tie them right to the murders of leo and susannah both victims were retired lawyers both of them were or had been active and prominent democrats both of them early in their careers had spent time in washington at the same time as leo grace dekker looked at him across the table and let out a long slow whistle fuckinga he murmured with a deep frown creasing his forehead brand and kosinski sat silent their slightly stunned expressions offering proof if any had been needed that they had not sneaked a look at the documents before handing them over skinner put the files back into his attache case i was asked informally i stress by my friend joe doherty the deputy director of the bureau to report to him on what i found at the lake he glanced at the two agents correct me if im wrong gentlemen but when a crime goes interstate it becomes your responsibility yes brand nodded firmly that is correct sir in that ease said the scot glancing back at dekker to come back to what i said earlier you may not need to worry about a turf battle with the state police i suspect that the fbi may want to take charge of this one the buffalo sheriffs expression was one of pure unadulterated relief he looked more than ever like a politician rather than a policeman do you want to call your friend bob he asked or will i seriously though andy is this job not what you choose to make it asked dan pringle with a trademark tug at a corner of his heavy moustache the outgoing head of cid looked across the desk at his successor as if trying to determine whether he was serious that depends entirely on the level of your ambition my friend if your main objective is to maximise your pension and get the hell out of here at the earliest opportunity you would certainly approach it in that frame of mind if on the other hand you do not fancy having your door kicked in every other day by a deputy chief constable waving worsening clearup figures in your face youll approach it with just one single objective that being to make sure that for as long as youre sat in this chair every cid division is working at its maximum efficiency aye said pringle a slow grin spreading across his face that was more or less what i supposed so every time you chewed us out at the monday morning meeting it was because big bob had given you a doing not invariably andy martin answered most of the time it was to make sure that he didnt give me a doing chief super or not you do not want his boot on your neck so as of next week when youre sat in this chair youll find yourself concentrating very hard on avoiding that possibility pringle gestured over his shoulder with his thumb by kicking the crap out of the likes of mario here you mean exactly give me a break mcguire protested from his seat against the wall im not even in the job yet and youre getting at me give me a chance to make mistakes before you take me to task for them why have you got any in mind asked martin one or two just for openers i was thinking of headbutting my new boss for pinching the best detective sergeant in the division pringle looked at him all innocence big jack mcgurk you mean christ and here was me thinking i was going to get away with that without you noticing think again then youre a fucking assetstripper with respect sir i was going to tell you mario honest i just havent had an opportunity until now i know mcgurks good thats why i took him to the borders division in the first place and thats why i want him in my office when i move up here theres more to it than that though theres his marriage as well if i leave him down there thats done for theyve tried hard but its just not working just now what are you a social worker too a flash of real annoyance showed for a second in the older mans eyes no but ive been long enough in my rank to have become a decent man manager we all have to learn that skilh mostly the hard way like you with that bloody tommy gavigan you could leave big jack down there and hed do a good job for you but if i give him a chance to patch things up with his missus hell do a better job for me anyhow dont get your calvin rucking kleins in a twist youre getting a firstclass substitute young sammy pyes going down to take his place mcguire looked at martin the chief superintendent nodded thats the game plan he confirmed sams been here long enough and hes every bit as good an operator as mcgurk you can take my word for that thats fine andy but am i going to find myself with another domestic situation there like dan did with jack what with sammy and ruthie mcconnell you mean no not at all theyre getting married in the autumn and theyre going to live in gorebridge they can both travel to work easily enough from there pringle nodded in confirmation then glanced at martin what are you and karen going to do about that andy he asked are you two moving house no choice the dcs answered hows karen doing asked mcguire blowing them away great martin replied firstrate blooming glowing with health and all that stuff now that shes well past throwing up every morning that is shes decided that were moving to perth rather than dundee were going to look at houses there at the weekend weve got to sort it out sharpish either that or put it off for a bit shes due in a couple of months a the big superintendent laughed softly how are you going to get a baby chair into the mgf andy sore point the sports cars going down the road as of next week its turning into a new mondeo bloody hell what happened to the andy martin we knew and a thousand women loved same as happened to you mcguire he met the right woman oh aye and that reminds me willie haggerty asked me for the okay to have your maggie stand in for manny english while hes away investigating strathclyde it came as a bit of a surprise even to me when he told me shes agreed it was a surprise to her too acc haggerty must be a persuasive bugger its only a temporary thing though just to let her get the feel of the job martin grinned so now shes responsible for everything that goes on in the division every crime every public nuisance every waif and stray aye said mcguire heavily and that could be a bit of a problem joe doherty sallowfaced as ever drew on a cigarette as he looked around bradford dekkers conference table he was the only person there who was smoking and the fixed expression on the face of the erie county sheriff made it clear that in his view that was one too many i mean it those things will kill you one day my friend murmured bob skinner sat on his right you keep telling me that replied the american quietly but living does that in the end any way you look at it look at your fatherinlaw i bet he never smoked in his life you lose said dekker close enough to overhear mr grace loved a monte cristo after dinner thats true skinner agreed he always had a supply handy wherever he went the dominican republic variety of course never cuban he added with a faint grin which vanished as quickly as it had appeared shit he whispered then glanced along the table lieutenant schultz can you remember did you find any cigars at the cabin i dont remember seeing any the new york detective frowned as he searched his memory then opened a folder on the desk before him and looked through several pages i dont recall that sir he answered finally and theres no mention of them on the inventory so could that be the first thing we know about this killer that hes a cigar smoker and couldnt resist taking them with him unless the first guys on the scene found them said schultz quickly those boys out there can be a touch i resent that lieutenant snapped dekker cutting across him on behalf of county police forces everywhere you state people resent all you like brad but its a valid point the only female voice in the room belonged to superintendent barbara weston the head of the new york state police a severelooking woman in her early fifties dohertys presence at the hastily called morning conference in buffalo had attracted a topdrawer turnout from the agencies involved there were nine people at the table three fbi the deputy director brand and kosinski three from the state police weston schultz and small dekker and his chief of detectives eddie brady and skinner himself the dcc had been invited by doherty with dekkers agreement to attend the conference as an observer although his presence had caused the superintendent to raise a disapproving eyebrow yes it probably is barbara doherty drawled it might have been more tactfully put thats all we will check it out discreetly i promise if bob and brad are certain that there should have been cigars in the cabin that may be significant as deputy chief skinner points out at the moment we know nothing about this man other than hes a professional if he took the damn things thats item number one in his personal profile hes hardly going to fence them is he no hes gonna smoke em he smiled trust me on this he paused stubbing out his cigarette in the heavy glass ashtray which dekkers secretary had found for him then taking a mouthful of coffee from the mug before him on the table okay lets cut the trivia end the interforce sniping and get this discussion on the road what are we looking at here with barely a break he answered his own question four homicides one of them a double in three different states all within the last month common factors are as follows we have three men and one woman all retired and aged over sixty over seventy in the case of mr grace we have three incidents reported initially as burglaryrelated homicide and accepted as such by the responsible jurisdictions common factors the mens profession their political allegiance and the fact that they all worked in washington at the time of the kennedy administration skinner raised a hand common factors that we know of joe threes enough for me buddy maybe but should it be barbara weston broke in they have crime everywhere even in asshole montana or wherever and the three locations are hundreds even thousands of miles apart okay three retired lawyers are burglarised lawyers are rich so they get robbed okay so theyre all democrats democrats get killed every day in this country so do republicans okay so they all worked in washington its just about before my time but in the early sixties its my understanding that every ambitious young democrat lawyer wanted to be there and that a hell of a lot of them made it leo grace wasnt an ambitious young lawyer barbara sheriff dekker interjected he was a senator in this states legislature for six years before he joined the attorney generals office under kennedy okay strike out the young lawyer part but dont tell me that he wasnt ambitious her gaze switched to doherty and what about garrett and wilkins do we know whether they worked in the same area as senator grace in fact do we know if they ever even met no we do not the deputy director admitted his face showing his impatience their files arent complete we only know that they worked in dc not what they did there come on superintendent spit it out say what youre leading up to if you insist mr doherty frankly i think that the bureaus grounds for showing up here are at best questionable and at worst contrived our friend from scotland your friend shows up here and is given instant access to material it would take me weeks screw out of you next thing we know hes used it to weave a fancy conspiracy theory and youre jumping in to back him up to the extent of letting him take part in a conference that he has no business even observing he sees a hitman rubbing out retired democrats i see a single burglary homicide on my territory and i see no reason why lieutenant schultz and his team shouldnt be allowed to clear it up as for your friend i sympathise with his loss but id advise him to bury his father inlaw and get the hell back home dohertys eyes narrowed i hear skinner put a hand on his shoulder looking past him along the table a second please joe superintendent i know that youre a career police officer but youre appointed by the governor and the state senate so let me ask you something have you ever in your life worked as a member of a criminal investigation team barbara weston hesitated for a second too long no he said fixing her with an icy unblinking glare locking eyes with her so powerfully that it seemed that however hard she might try she could not look away i didnt think so your type of copper exists the world over well madam i have dirtied my hands with crime for nearly all my professional career ive chased villains of all shapes and sizes serial killers gangsters thieves terrorists drug pushers and all the rest and do you know what ive caught nearly all of them apart from the ones that the competition got to before i did i havent done that by being lucky or weaving fanciful theories ive done it by being a bloody good analytical detective if joe dohertys htau stiul invited me to sit at this table he hasnt done so because hes my friend hes done it because he thinks i can contribute something and what im telling you is this these four murders are linked that isnt supposition at the least its a probability flowing from the facts as they exist and in my experience theres a very fine line between probability and certainty oh yes and one more thing if you want me to go home before this crime is cleared up you may have to deport me but i dont think you have the clout to do that he released the superintendent from his glare and nodded to doherty im sorry joe you were saying you just said it muttered the deputy director tersely and turned back to weston you want me to give bob status barbara okay as of now hes a special adviser in this investigation which will he leaned on the word be coordinated by the bureau we can do this one of two ways either we take things over completely or we work in cooperation with your department using the skills and local expertise of schultz and small partnered with special agent kosinski he glanced along at dekker same would go for your department brad given that were certain the killer came to buffalo also you two people up for that or would you rather butt out now im more than happy to work with the bureau replied the sheriff quickly he and doherty turned back to the superintendent im not being frozen out of my own jurisdiction mr deputy director not by you or by anyone else well go along with you but i insist on being advised of any development that could lead to an indictment in this state doherty nodded you will be so advised he agreed but you will not move for any such indictment nor release the identity of any person who might be a suspect my director was confirmed in office by a political colleague of your state governor remember that westons eyes blazed at his blatant threat but she said nothing more fine he said looking around the table once more lets move forward brand kosinski you are seconded to this investigation until otherwise advised by me troy you will remain in new york as i have said and will coordinate things here advising me sheriff dekker and superintendent weston of progress made you will concentrate first and foremost on putting a name to our killer how are we going to do that sir asked the special agent bob dohertys invitation took his friend by surprise come on dont hold back you are the senior detective here ive been out of the field for years you probably wont mr kosinski skinner answered bluntly like i said earlier this guys been covering his tracks pretty carefully so all you can do is to concentrate on the basics and hope hes made a mistake you have to look out for the use of a stolen credit card but that is not going to happen no i would send the forensic team back out to the cabin and keep them at the house until theyve been over every inch of it look for matches between the two locations fingerprints fibres from clothing cigar butts murmured barbara weston sarcastically yes skinner snapped at her you never dismiss anything until youve disproved it or youre in neglect of your duty as an investigator he looked at the erie county detective chief right mr brady absolutely sir the man concurred that being the case he continued leo lovecr ars but there were none in the cabin so its a real possibility that our man took them hes a cool bastard this one so maybe just maybe he smoked one while he was going through the house if he did then just maybe he left the stub criminals have been caught through simpler mistakes than that theres a guy doing life in britain who probably wouldnt have been convicted if hed paid cash for his petrol on a few specific days years before he was arrested he turned to schultz who looked back at him intently lieutenant you should send your people back to that cabin and you tell them to look for cigar butts tell them to look in the garbage if they have to if they find any tell them to take saliva samples from every one and do dna comparisons against leo grace if one doesnt match that could be your killer it would be surely sir kosinski said not necessarily son leo was generous with his monte cristos first christmas after sarah and i were married he sent me a box he could have had friends for supper any time before he was killed and handed them round i know that as part of your investigation youll be trying to trace everyone who was in the cabin that last time they were there to eliminate their fingerprints if you find any and if you find any butts you should take spit samples as well as prints however as i said thats a long shot back to the basics if you find any matching traces at both locations other than of leo and susannah youre on a winner but even if you dont you should feed every wild nnau anui print you have into your mainframe and see what you get fibre matches are more difficult but you have to do them too id suggest too that you make sure your teams take comparison samples from every garment every towel in the cabin and the house you think this is overkill superintendent he asked with a glance at eddie brady the erie county detective chief well it aint its what you have to do when youre dealing with a man like this you have to look closely at the scene then closer and closer and closer until you find that one tiny mistake the one thats going to catch him you also have to look in the right way i had an inquiry in scotland a while back that might have been written off as a suicide had a young police constable not looked at the scene and spotted something that to her eye was wrong he grinned at kosinski schultz and small sorry lads he chuckled youre in for some boring times but thats what you signed up for he leaned back in his chair thats what id do joe the deputy director nodded thats whatll happen now he went on briskly lets look at the other crimes were targeting first the murder of sander garrett special agent brand you will go to nevada where you will interface with the city of north las vegas police department i have already spoken to chief of police hall although i have not briefed him in detail on what this is all about his is a small department with fewer than two hundred officers so he may well be glad to see you zak i want you to examine the scope and structure of the investigation as it has been carried out so far looking initially at the forensic reports on mr garretts house chief hall didnt say so but i have a feeling that you wont find a hell of a lot if you feel that its necessary and the crime scene is still reasonably intact you have my authority to fly in a team of our people to go over the place with the same thoroughness that is being applied to the grace residences when youre satisfied that you have all youre gonna get touch base with troy to run comparisons on unidentified prints and fibre samples also i want you to find out everything you can about sander garrett give me a complete report on his career after his washington years he was still a consultant to his law firm in vegas so you should interview the partners there and find out what he was into speak to any family members you can find and to any friends he had locally put together an uptodate profile of the man and find out if you can just what he did in washington make your own judgement about the local resources if you have to call me and ill detach people from the la bureau to work with you yes sir brand exclaimed ill leave as soon as this conference is over you do that doherty agreed that leaves us with the firstdegree murder of bartholomew wilkins formerly of chicago illinois now of asshole or rather helena montana excuse me sir troy kosinski raised a hand his unlined earnest face looking almost like that of a schoolboy what about the political angle leave that alone for now it may be significant it may not lets just see what the coordinated investigation of the three locations has to throw up speaking of which dohertys lean face creased in a mischievous grin like i said ive been out of the field for years andthis whole business intrigues me so i thought id cover that end myself the helena police department has only seven detectives so the montana department of justice criminal bureau has been advising on the investigation im meeting their chief tomorrow he glanced at skinner bob itll be a couple of days before the sceneofcrime teams are finished at the grace residence when does sarah plan to arrive were looking at next monday she wants to get the kids used to the idea of the nanny living in before she leaves them in that case youll have nothing to do but sit on your hands unless youd care to accompany me to the queen city of the rockies as she likes to call herself the address which mcguires dss friend had volunteered proved to be a tenement flat in a culdesac off newhaven road not far from its junction with bonnington road the detective drove past the narrow entrance door parked as close to it as he could and walked back he glanced at his watch it was ten minutes to six even if george rosewell was a betting man the last race was long past the post there had been no call from mrs dewberry but his instincts had told him not to expect one his unwanted fatherinlaw was still an absentee from a job which he would find was no longer there if he ever thought to return to it he came to the dirty green door that closed off the tenement stairway it was one of the few left in the city in which an entryphone system had not been installed it was stiff but he shoved it firmly wrenching it back on its dry hinges hearing the squeal of wood on the concrete floor a smell of urine and cabbage rolled out to greet him reminding him of visits to prisons he had made in his younger days in the force nice daddy nice he murmured rosewells address was f second floor he trudged up the stone staircase noting that each step was worn in the centre with over a hundred years of use there were three doors on each landing left right and centre the one for which he was looking faced him as he reached the top of the stair it was grey the gloss of its paint was long gone and it was scuffed and scratched the name was there though on a cheap white plastic plate below the letterbox a narrow opaque glass panel was set at eye level no light shone through it he pressed the bell button but heard no sound from inside he did it once more for luck still silence bunching his right fist he thumped the door hard making enough noise to waken a deaf nightshift worker come on you bastard he muttered make it easy be in he listened in vain for sounds of stirring before pounding once more and waiting again listening to the silence where are you you old flicker he glanced to his right and left aye well he muttered family business after all the door was locked by a single yale he took out a bunch of skeleton keys and tried them one by one looking for a match he had third time luck the latch clicked and the door swung open it occurred to him afterwards that he had never considered the possibility that rosewell might be lying dead in his flat nor had mrs dewberry as a young constable he had opened a few houses after neighbours had reported a pileup of newspapers in the letterbox or a line of milk bottles at the front door he remembered the smell too right he remembered it but there was no trace of it in rosewells twoapartment only staleness only sourness the scent of a man on his own one with no great regard for his surroundings george mcguhtirked as he stepped inside surprise surprise its your soninlaw come to batter the crap out of you where the fuck are you you old bastard there were only three doors off the hall and all of them were open he glanced into them one by one the bathroom was to his left toilet seat up towel on the floor beneath the electrically heated rail the bedroom was straight ahead discarded underwear still on the floor duvet thrown back to reveal a sheet which had once been white but which now was grey and heavily stained the living area was on his right he stepped inside at once the heat which he had felt in the hallway became almost overpowering he looked round the door and saw an electric fire set in the wall its three radiant bars shining he found the switch and turned it off the room was furnished sparsely one old fabriccovered sofa facing a television set a small sideboard a kitchen table and two dining chairs there was a sink under the one window a cooker to the left and a small work surface and fridge on the other side a dirty plate and cutlery lay on the table he looked at it scraps of pastry from a round scotch mutton pie unmistakable a few beans in their tomato sauce and a sad solitary greasy chip youll have had your tea then george he murmured but when the answer came to him from the newspaper which lay beside the empty teastained mug it was open at the sports section his eye was caught by an action shot of two footballers green shirt and blue squaring up to each other like street corner punks without picking it up he looked at the top of the page the sunday mail he exclaimed and youve been off your work since monday he scratched his head it had been unusually cold on the previous sunday evening he recalled you had your tea and you went out didnt you he asked the empty room and you left the fire on was that by accident or was it on purpose to warm your old portuguese bones when you came in only you never did where are you you old bastard what are you up to i guess id better ask around he left the small flat leaving the door closed but unlocked and stepped over to the door on the right through which light shone the nameplate on the door read brennan he pressed the bell and as he did so heard a childs yell from inside daddy somehow he had been expecting a woman but it was a girl who answered fifteen maybe sixteen he guessed not yet grown to full height still no more than five feet tall she held the door on a chain and looked at him through the gap suspiciously i would be too dear he thought good for you miss brennan he asked giving her what he hoped was a reassuring smile ms she answered her expression unchanged there was something in her voice that struck him as strange she was barefoot he noticed with blond hair that might just have been for real and a waiflike look about her that would have pulled him in about two seconds flat when he was sixteen years old there was a toddler clinging to her leg a boy sorry to bother you he went on im george rosewells soninlaw and im looking for him only hes not in i wondered if you had seen him lately youre a policeman she said maybe so he agreed widening his grin but im also georges son inlaw i dont believe you her accent was unusual for the outskirts of leith he wondered if she might be english george told me he doesnt have any family sure and he told you his name was rosewell but thats not true either listen my names mario and theres the proof can i come in he showed her his warrant card she surprised him by reading it unusually in his experience a quick flash of the plastic was enough the youngster nodded and loosened the chain yes okay she said sweeping the child up in her arms his eyes widened as he stepped inside the hall was bright and fresh its carpet plush and relatively new the living area had been modernised completely essentially the apartment had the same layout as the one across the hall but the two were worlds apart this was a home adequately furnished and equipped comfortable and well looked after by comparison the other was no more than a dosshouse whats your other name asked mcguire ivy said the girl he reached across and tickled the toddler under the chin as he had done once upon a time with lauren and spencer mcllhenneys two children whos the kid your wee brother my son actually his names rufus he stared at her how old are you he blurted out without a word she turned and walked over to a tall unit set against the wall she opened a drawer took out a photographic drivbtocence and handed it to him its all right she told him in a patienttone yes definitely english he thought as she spoke im used to it im twenty two and every time i go out for a drink i have to carry that to prove it im walking justification for a national identity card he looked at the plasticcoated licence the photograph was unusually good it was her and she was indeed twentytwo im sorry he said rude of me no really she smiled for the first time i am used to it it can come in handy at times what about rufuss father is he hes gone im a lone parent does he visit you often when he feels like it but thats okay we get along fine although hes not really interested in his son he just goes through the motions of being a dad thats all does he support you no my parents do i have a degree in film studies and once rufus starts school ill begin my career but until then im okay there was something about the girlwoman that fascinated him what about this he glanced around him its very comfy and all that but this building aint the finest piece of architecture in edinburgh she laughed blame my father for that or his stupid solicitor the seller told them that there was an improvement grant in place and that it was all going to be done up wrong she sat rufus on the floor beside a large stuffed panda so what were you saying about george that isnt his real name no he took the school photograph from his pocket thats him yes she looked at it frowning yes thats george apart from the beard hes got a beard now how well do you know him just as a neighbour thats all hes the only one in here i do know so what is his real name go back twentythree years and he was called jorge xavier rose hes a mix of scots and portuguese and what happened twentythree years ago to make him change his name you dont want to know just you take my advice ms brennan if he shows up here again dont ever let him into your house i wont dont you worry do you think hes gone then mcguire shrugged he hasnt been home since sunday night of that im sure plus he hasnt been to work since then maybe hes had an accident ill need to check that out or maybe hes got second sight maybe he felt my hot breath on his neck and decided to leave town i dont think id like your hot breath on my neck ivy said she paused and looked up at him narrowing her eyes or maybe i would he felt heat on his own neck and found himself hoping that it did not show on his face did you really mean that george is over sixty she asked him stubbing out a fledgling fantasy hes sixtythree well thats something else he lied about he told me he was fifty five mcguire shook his head i dont think theres any truth in his life he looked at her then around the room are you on the phone i use a mobile let me guess you want me to call you if he shows up here again got it in one these are my numbers he gave her a card from the supply in his breast pocket she showed him to the door and out of her oasis back into the smelly grey place outside nice to meet you she said i will call you i promise maybe ill call you even if george doesnt show up he heard the door close behind her as he stepped back across the landing and into rosewells flat the living room had cooled a little while he had been gone but it was still uncomfortably warm he wanted to get out to leave the place behind him but there was something he had to do first he took a pair of surgical gloves from his jacket pocket and slipped them on other than the newspaper he had touched nothing since he had been in the flat and he wanted to leave the scene untainted the sideboard had three drawers the first contained cutlery and the second was empty except for a few tea towels he opened the bottom drawer the third and saw what he was after piles of bank statements and creditcard slips laid side by side he took them out and laid them on the table then leafed through them carefully there was nothing exceptional about either group the bank account showed rosewells salary paid in on the last day of each month plus regular debits for council tax and other withdrawals by cheque or cash card it was always in credit with a minimum balance of one thousand pounds the other stack of bills showed that the credit card was used infrequently but that when it was the balance was always settled in full before interest charges could accrue mcguire noted down the numbers of the bank account and the credit card plus the address of his clydesdale bank branch then picked up the piles in the same order as before to return them to the drawer he was about to put them in when he saw what had been lying underneath and froze in his tracks it was a cutting from a newspaper the scotsman he guessed by the typeface beginning to yellow with age it was a report on a high court trial and it carried a photograph of one of the crown witnesses he had no need to read the caption but he did seen leaving court after her evidence detective chief inspector margaret rose i guess this means you wont be at the football tonight neil mcllhenney grunted he stood in his living room with his sport bag in one hand and the phone in the other he had been on the point of leaving for north berwick only to be halted by its summons you guess correctly bob skinner agreed give my apologies to the rest of the thursday legends and tell them ill be back as soon as i can and when will that be dyou reckon jeez neil i wish i could tell you for sure the bodies will be released tomorrow by the coroner in loudonville and ive instructed an undertaker in buffalo to collect them and make all the arrangements sarahs booked a flight arriving next monday but theres no certainty that well be able to have the funerals next week leo was an important guy so the service will be public from what brad dekker tells me half the city will want to be there not just that the new senator and her husband want to put in an appearance that will get the secret fucking service involved i didnt break that news to sarah when i spoke to her im saving it until i see her so keep it to yourself for now of course mcllhenney hesitated boss what do you think youve got yourself into over there i wish i knew mate all i do know is that these three murders are linked as soon as i read the reports i was certain of that sos joe now hes looked at them every one of them was a professional job in every one of them the items taken were the same mere bloody trifles you do not put three bullets in the middle of somebodys forehead just to steal his rolex you do not ram a stiletto into someones head just for his credit card you do not garrotte a man and his wife because you want his cigars on top of all that you have the professional and political links and the fact that the three killings have all taken place within a twoweek period i cant be wrong can i well motherwell could win the premier league next year said the inspector i think the odds would be about the same no youre right but what makes you think its the same man who did all three he heard a soft familiar laugh on the other end of the line thats a question none of my distinguished american law enforcement colleagues has asked as yet who says i do think that were talking in terms of one man because thats the way the hare started running but its no certainty at all still there was a pause were into hunch territory now but my feeling is that it was like i said no ones questioned that assumption not till you he paused id expect no less of you mate but my gut still says its one man theres been an efficiency about each murder thats like a trademark if im wrong and theres a team of them out there were in real fucking trouble on that basis the fbis flexing its muscles joe has agents checking all passenger movements through greater buffalo airport mccarran in las vegas and great falls international thats around atfcidred miles from helena and its where were going this afternoon people go to vegas from all over the states for all sorts of reasons but if we find someone whos been there been to buffalo and been to montana all in the last couple of weeks hes going to be put under the microscope its right up your street all this isnt it mcllhenney observed i dont mean burying your fatherinlaw i mean jetting across umpteen states with an fbi bigwig on an investigation if it wasnt for the circumstances youd be like a kid with the key to an icecream factory youre not wrong there skinner admitted im glad joe asked me to get involved otherwise id have gone out of my tree just sitting here doing nothing god i might even have started my own investigation thats fine said his friend quietly until monday when sarah gets over there what do you mean i mean that when she does you should only be thinking of one thing that shes lost her parents shes borne up very well in scotland but when she gets back home its going to hit her hard shes going to want to see them shes going to want to see where they died shes going to have a lot to come to terms with so bob it did not occur to either of them that mcllhenney had only once before addressed skinner by his christian name you have to be with her and completely focused on her personal and emotional needs rather than teararseing around america on an inter jurisdictional investigation which professionally at least is none of your business im sorry to be so blunt he concluded suddenly awkward and if that didnt need saying i apologise but well what the hell i thought it did silence hung there for a couple of seconds aye said skinner finally and you were right thanks pal i appreciate it the only thing is i think that one of my big problems may be in keeping sarah from getting herself involved in the bloody investigation he paused again i do want to see her though id rather be with her than here make no mistake about that but thats how she wanted it im sorry to leave you guys in the lurch too in these times of change most of all im sorry to miss young acc martins farewell party wheres he having it there was nothing arranged when i left were going for a meal in la rusticana in cockbum street then were off to listen to jazz in the cellar bar in chambers street kicks off at half eight ambulances at one am what about jimmys senior officers dinner tonight postponed said mcllhenney the chiefs going to wait until youre back good for him i feel better about that that leads me to something i have to ask you what about my move to sb its supposed to happen on monday when mario heads off to the borders division do you want to put a hold on everything save clan pringles move and leave the deputy in charge in the borders pro tern no skinner replied firmly ive thought about that my private office is secondary in my absence you go ahead with your move keep an eye on my stuff long distance you and ruthie can manage that between you take anything with a health warning on it straight to willie haggerty but what i do want you to do he went on is to appoint your own successor eh you serious sure i am you know better than anyone bar andy how i think and how i work look at the available talent either a detective sergeant or a recently promoted di and make a choice id pick jack mcgurk right now said mcllhenney but mr pringle plans on bringing him in as his own exec skinner thought for a moment or two listen if you think big jacks the man for the job pull rank tell dan i want him and thats that hell huff for a bit but he owes me one and he bloody knows it go on do it ill hose down the new head of cid if necessary okay if you say so christ the inspector laughed you can cause bloody chaos from three thousand miles away well my god its our mario its not like you to frequent the family business what brings you here paula viareggio grinned at her cousin across the counter her dark eyes carrying a mix of mockery and challenge as they had done since they were children a packet ofporcini mushrooms and some seranno ham actually he said as he looked at paula across the counter he was struck by the contrast she presented to the girl he had just left ivy brennan was locked in a sort of extended childhood her life shaped by her diminutive size and her elfin features paula on the other hand was ageless her silver hair high cheekbones and velvet skin giving her the appeal of a work of art of an old master oil painting for a time in his late teens and early twenties mario mcguire had lusted after his uncle beppes older daughter something which paula had understood from an early stage the challenge had been in her eyes from that time on but he had been sensible enough to know that if he rose to it he would be setting off down a dangerous path from which there would be no turning there had been a couple of close calls though one at a party at beppes and another after he had left home when paula had turned up at his flat late at night with a couple of drinks under her belt and mischief on her mind and in truth there had been another night another party at which everyone had been very drunk after which he had never been entirely certain what had happened he had never asked and paula had never mentioned it mushrooms and ham indeed she laughed scornfully why not were having friends for dinner and maggies got this new recipe so she sends you here to shop for her he glanced around the big doublefronted shop this is still a deli isnt it for the moment yes come on cuz this is paula youre not kidding me your office is just along the road but in all the time youve been working out of it youve never set foot in here now the day after aunt christina drops her bombshell here you are this is an inspection visit by the new trustee isnt it he smiled at her the full highoctane mario smile the killer leg opener from his single days which he had always been careful until then never to flash in her direction for fear of what it might unleash no fooling you eh okay i admit it i thought id drop in for a chat ill chat to you any time big irish but why here you can come round to my place any time you like i dont like to drop in there unannounced you might have company not right now i dont the lady is on her own anyhow i never used to bother about paying you a surprise visit i remember much good it used to do me too so what do you want to chat about it was his turn to throw her a challenging look now whos being coy you know bloody well i want to talk about you our paula and your place in the family business by the way hows uncle beppe taking it i thought he was uncharacteristically quiet after mum made her announcement dads very sad that shes going hes relied on her advice whenever a major decision has had to be made in the past and hell miss her greatly mario laughed out loud hah thats a belter that one whatever mum said he did the opposite remember after papa died he left a plan to launch viareggio fish and chip shops as a franchise my mother was all for going ahead with that she pleaded almost with uncle beppe to agree to it but did he not on your life i was only sixteen then and more interested in birds than business but i remember mum coming home from that last meeting with him ive never seen her so angry before or since at the end hed laughed at her franchised fish and chip shops hed said never heard anything so fucking stupid in my life hes a real business tycoon is your dad he chuckled sarcastically if hed relied on my mothers advice hed be the chairman of a pie right now dyou know theres a harry bloody ramsden in singapore if papa viareggio hadnt dropped down dead twenty years ago it would have been his name and yours over the door paula looked at him coolly he had tried to rattle her but he had failed do you think youre going to change things then mario because if you do i have to remind you that my father still has the casting vote in the event of a disagreement between the two trustees youve got no more power than aunt christina had youll be a figurehead just like she was mcguire crumpled up his mask of false bonhomie and threw it away he looked at her without a flicker of humour in his eyes dont you believe that cousin not for one moment you see im not blind to my mothers only fault she had this classically italian thing against washing the family linen in public thats why she let uncle beppe get away with it that time and on every occasion since but im not like that if i believe as a trustee that the casting vote is being used in a way thats against the best interests of the beneficiaries then i wont hesitate for one second to go to court to have it overturned thats the truth a our dad better believe it you too for that matter a flame kindled in her dark eyes are you threatening me mario he shook his head firmly no im telling you thats all paula ive got my own life to lead and a career outside the family business so ive got no wish to get involved in daytoday management things i have got one or two ideas that im going to air but i dont think that uncle beppe will have a problem with any of them theres contracts of employment for example as i understand it our managers have none at the moment not formally at least thats dodgy legally and its not right morally so im going to propose that they have they dont need to be fancy just the standard rights and obligations and the customary loyalty clause whats that asked his cousin you know the one about no additional like employment without approval it just means that if one of our managers like you are wanted to take on a second managerial appointment in her spare time lets say she ran a few saunas for example she couldnt without the approval of her principal employer the trust he watched as her face seemed to set into a hard shell now he said his smile back in place about those mushrooms and that ham are you serious mcllhenney dan pringle growled oh yes sir im serious my boss has asked me to put my successor in place by the time he gets back from the states and detective sergeant mcgurk is number one on the list providing he accepts the job of course so thats what its going to be like at headquarters is it the dcc takes a fancy to my chosen exec and thats it i dont know if i fancy this job after all aye fuck it i think ill just stay on in the borders division big mcguire can get back in the queue and you can stay in skinners office mcllhenney glanced over his shoulder to make sure that the door of the head of cids private office was completely closed speaking privately sir you dont know how fucking near you were to staying on in the borders it was a tossup between you and greg jay in leith who got the head of cid job you won partly because the boss preferred not to have both mario and maggie based in the city if you really want to stay in the borders i reckon hed agree to let you make that choice but youll have to decide it right now the superintendent glared at him you know son he said you might look like a big amiable bastard but youre really good at putting the boot in no wonder you and bob skinner get on ill take that as a compliment then mcllhenney murmured but just sos you know the boss didnt take a fancy to mcgurk he asked me to find the best man for the job and i said that he was would you argue with that pringle lowered his eyes and shook his head no i wouldnt because youre right big jacks got command potential okay okay if the dcc wants him or if you want him whats the difference i wont stand in his way thats good sir mr skinner thought you would agree when you thought it through good for me it still leaves me stuck for backup though not necessarily theres ray wilding mcgurks old partner in central hes just been promoted to ds you could have him aye but would i have to fight maggie rose for him no said the inspector quietly hes yours if you want him im off to tell mcgurk hes got a new job as he turned to leave pringle called after him was this personal wi you mcllhenney he asked no sir i dont let personal issues cloud my judgement but you dont like me im entirely ambivalent to you chief superintendent aye thatll be right are you still carrying a grudge over that time i wanted to lift your wifes doctor mcllhenney looked him in the eye how could i sir stupiditys a condition not a vice we all have occasional lapses he closed the door on the new head of cid wondering how big an enemy he had made but not caring too much and walked the long corridor back to his old office in the command suite he asked ruth mcconnell to find jack mcgurk for him then cast an eye over the dccs morning mail spotting nothing contentious he took over the call to mcgurk and broke the good news is mr pringle okay about it asked the young sergeant hes very happy for you talk to him yourself and hell tell you that im sure report here on monday morning ill be a bit schizophrenic for a while jumping between this office and my new one but between us ruthie and ill show you the ropes and get you up to speed in time for the big man coming back when will that be not next week thats for sure see you monday jack having cleared his desk he asked ruth to redirect his calls to the special branch suite and headed off to meet up as arranged with mcguire he found him shut away in his private office seated hunched at his desk with the phone to his ear look mr gwynn lets not be fucking coy about this youve called me back through the switchboard so you know that i really am a detective superintendent and that this is not a hoax i know yours is only a wee branch and youre worried about being crapped on from way up there but i promise you that isnt going to happen im trying to conduct a discreet enquiry here now are you going to cooperate or do i have to make some waves he winked at mcllhenney as he poured a coffee from the filter jug yes i can promise you that none of the information you give me will be disclosed and nobody will ever know that you provided it what do you get from it he laughed you get friends in high places and two unlisted telephone numbers that you can call whenever youre kneedeep in shit thats a good swap believe me mcllhenney watched him saw him nod quietly good good okay the mans name is rosewell george rosewell he has a current account and a credit card thats also operated through your bank i need to know whether either of them has been used this week i need to know the last time either was used and in the case of the cash card i need to know how much money was withdrawn oh yes and id like the current account balance he nodded again sure you can call me back ill be here for a while use this number and keep a note of it for the future emergencies only mind he read out his direct line number thats changed every so often isnt it asked mcllhenney as he hung up aye but hell never use it the boy just needed to feel important thats all a lot of these small branch managers are shitscared of head office these days why do you need that stuff anyway im still trying to find maggies old man so i can beat his fucking brains in or at least run him out of edinburgh he hasnt been at work all week and his house looked like the marie celeste you went in youre dead right i went in i was paying a family visit neil and even if ithadnt been in this job i could have justified it the man has a history of violence and child abuse hes living under an alias and hes in a wholly unsuitable job child abuse dont ask anyhow there were the congealed leavings of pie beans and chips on his kitchen table with a halfread sunday mail beside them i spoke to a neighbour she hasnt seen him since then hes not in the nick is he no ive just checked that nor is he in any hospital in this area nor is he lying in a mortuary with a john doe tag on his toe all this weeks stiffs are accounted for he has either gone on a very lastminute bargain break to shagaluf or hes been kidnapped by international criminals and is being held for a multimillionpound ransom or hes done something or upset someone to the extent that hes decided to do a runner hes upset you aye but he doesnt know that at least i dont see how he could the phone on his desk rang his hand shot out and picked it up mcguire ah mr gwynn that didnt take long aye sometimes i wish the millennium bug had been for real the bloody things are ruling our lives now okay just hold on a minute he picked up a pen right as he listened he made notes on a pad on his desk thats excellent he said as he finished now heres that other contact i promised you he glanced at a list on his desk and read out a number thanks so long what was that one asked mcllhenney my new direct line in the borders you never know the boy might be moved down there one day indeed you have been here for too long just long enough mcguire glanced at his notepad it was useful though george drew thirty quid from his bank account on tuesday of last week since then neither his cash card nor his credit card has been used his account balance is eleven hundred and fortyone pounds he cant have run far then do you think he could be in the founds of a new building somewhere im beginning to wonder if he is i just hope itll be heavy enough to hold the swine down bob skinner had been several times to the usa before and since his marriage to his american wife he had been to new york city and state to florida and to the original california disneyland with his daughter alex to houston texas on an exchange visit and to atlanta georgia as a delegate to a security conference however he had never been to the northwestern states and nothing had prepared him for their size or for the spectacle they offered the flight to great falls montana was blessed with cloudless conditions all the way across the pale blue of the great lakes the green of michigan and the changing shades of the landscape below as they flew westward even skinner who tended to view the wonders of nature with a jaundiced eye spent the entire journey looking out of the window of the aircraft the hundredmile drive down interstate fifteen to helena was no less dramatic the first half of their route through cascade county ran close to the great missouri river the scot had had no idea that it originated so far north past cascade itself then into the great open spaces of lewis and dark finally they drove into the helena valley overlooked by its gently sloping mountain with the small state capital nestled at its heart well did you enjoy that asked doherty who had driven from the airport in a rental car as they cruised past the state capitol building to arrive at the investigations bureau headquarters on north roberts yes skinner admitted but enough of the tourist bit who are we seeing the bureau guys name is tad polhaus the police chief is chuck harris but hes on holiday so well be met by the senior detective lieutenant gordon sumner the montana investigators were waiting for them in the bureau chiefs office on the second floor of the building both were in their mid thirties polhaus was big and beefy his broad features proclaiming his german ancestry while sumner was lean and wiry equally tall but looking like a welterweight alongside his colleague ill as they ran through the formalities of the introduction and took their seats around a coffee table skinner looked for signs of one deferring to the other but found none state cop and city cop seemed to treat each other as equals there was no sign of the jurisdictional jealousy that he had found in buffalo however they were both visibly impressed by and slightly in awe of the deputy director of the fbi and his scottish companion welcome to montana gentlemen said polhaus he looked at doherty i dont suppose i need to tell you mr deputy director that your call took us by surprise make no mistake though were hell of a glad youre here weve run into a complete brick wall on this wilkins homicide investigation any input you can give us will be more than welcome lieutenant sumner nodded ill second that tad he concurred but tell me sir what brought this case to your attention you gentlemen havent come to the queen of the rockies just to see the sights i have skinner told him im an observer here just tagging along on mr dohertys invitation a visiting fireman i understand youd call me now why dont i believe that said the city detective i did some research on you deputy chief skinner i had a look at your forces website and at a couple of files on internet versions of your scottish newspapers i know who you are i know what youve been into you havent come here for the fishing doherty laughed goddamn internet pretty soon there will be no secrets left in this world but were not at that stage yet otherwise pretty as your city is we wouldnt be here tell me about the late bartholomew wilkins there isnt much to tell polhaus answered as far as his life around here goes he was sixtyeight years old but he had been among us for only the last three years since he retired from legal practice in chicago illinois he and his wife roseanne bought a house here at that time any family asked skinner they have a son named arthur who succeeded his father as senior partner in the chicago firm and two daughters annette and merle wheres the body it was released to the family last friday mrs wilkins and her son flew back to chicago on saturday with the coffin for burial in their family plot she said that the services were scheduled for wednesday is there a problem with that i shouldnt think so said doherty were either of you two gentlemen at the crime scene we both were sumner replied when she found her husband the lady assumed at first that he had fallen and cut his head she thought he was unconscious and she reported the circumstances as such so a paramedic crew was sent they realised that it was a fatality so they called for a patrolman to attend fortunately one of our smarter guys responded he saw that there was no obvious place for the victim to have cut himself and that there was no blood trail indeed that there was very little blood so he radioed in for detective backup when i got there i knew at once that this was no superficial head wound and i knew that i was going to need tads resources as well as my own going on the report that was filed and logged on to the national database you decided that this was a homicide committed in the course of a burglary thats what it was polhaus exclaimed were in no doubt about it there were articles removed from the house mr wilkins pocketbook was taken containing amex master and visa cards and over four hundred dollars in cash the man wore a tengrand breitling watch that was gone so was a heavy gold bracelet from his other wrist and a top specification laptop computer from his desk if that doesnt constitute a burglary sir i dont know what does neither do i chief skinner assured him no ones disputing that for one minute how about signs of entry the report i read didnt mention that there werent any gordon and i believe that mrs wilkins left the back door open when she went out to the mall and that the guy just walked in she recalled that she locked it but she admitted that she couldnt be certain shes been eliminated as a possibility i take it yes she has completely we did consider that possibility dont worry but the autopsy ruled that out straight away the knife wound in the victims head was five inches deep it went clear through his brain if the blade had been any longer it would have come out the other side of the skull that was a hellish powerful blow mr skinner she couldnt have done it did the pathologist give you a picture of the person who did yes a righthanded man he said probably as tall as the victim and he was six one mrs wilkins is five two were looking for a big guy not a little woman granted the dcc agreed how about location where did the attack happen in the victims den his study i suppose youd call it in england skinner smiled i wouldnt call it anything in england chief im a scot remember i know what a den is i know also from my fatherin law that quite often its in converted cellar space was that the case here yes it was its accessed by a door off the hall leading to a flight of stairs apart from the items you described what else was taken from the house skinner saw the frown gather on polhaus broad face nothing according to mrs wilkins what else was disturbed nothing but so what our theory is that the guy broke in started his search in the den and was disturbed by the victim he killed him grabbed what he could and ran for it there was a home gym next door and a showerroom beyond that maybe wilkins was taking a leak and came back in i dont deal in maybes when you found him were his pants wet excuse me did he void his bladder when he was stabbed i dunno gordon sumner nodded yes sir as i recall he did in that case he hadnt just taken a piss the visiting detective looked from one of his hosts to the other what forensic samples have you recovered from the scene none that have significance the lieutenant answered weve identified every print we found in the house no wild ones left fibres nothing out of place dirt from footwear none that we found skinners right eyebrow rose almost theatrically come on gentlemen he exclaimed the intruder comes through a door which mrs wilkins said she locked without leaving a trace he comes straight down here and kills his victim then leaves without disturbing anything in the house without leaving a single print or shedding a single body hair fine he takes the dead mans wallet and jewellery his laptop and a clock off his desk but none of the credit cards i dont even bother asking the question because i know the answer have been used and none of the other items have been offered for sale to any pawnshop or known fence in the massive and great state of montana you guys have been close up to this investigation i understand that and i respect it but now take a step back from it look at those circumstances and tell me what you see polhaus looked at sumner then back at skinner he sighed heavily ill admit it there was something about this investigation that didnt sit right almost from the start but out here we dont have much experience of burglary homicides like i said back then we welcome your input no one has much experience of burglary homicide chief said doherty gently even in the cities its a relatively unusual type of felony were here because of three incidents within a twoweek period and this is one of them three retired lawyers with career histories going back to washington in the sixties tell me was mr wilkins active in democrat politics in helena polhaus laughed unexpectedly sir this is montana there aint too many active democrats out here sure i knew that bart was on that side but it was in his past youre not suggesting thats what got him killed are you to be frank chief we dont know for sure but at this point we are not ruling out any connection past involvement in democrat politics is one of the factors linking the three homicide victims but lets go back there you said you knew mr wilkins the big investigator nodded sure i did and so did gordon here we both have kids in junior high school they have a football team touch football only at their age you understand and bart was one of the coaches football was his main interest in life apart from politics and the law i guess he was a pretty good player in his youth you have to be if youre a firststring linebacker for notre dame doherty was impressed instantly he played for the fighting irish yes sir class of fiftythree he had pro offers he said but he turned them down and went on to yale law school instead mr grace was at yale wasnt he the fbi man asked the scot yes but before fiftythree he was back from korea by then and starting out in practice skinner looked at polhaus did you play at college i wish i was good enough for high school but i didnt make the team when i stepped up too slow the coaches said and they were right did mr wilkins talk much about those days college well yes but afterwards too did he ever talk about his early career his washington days not much he told me once that his father sent him there to gain work experience outside chicago his law firm was founded by his grandfather and his greatuncle wilkins schwartz wilkins it was called at the beginning at least there never was a schwartz though the two brothers added the name on for lets say commercial reasons they wanted the jewish business as well as the irish the dcc nodded ive come across that one before for the last eighty years though polhaus continued itybeen wilkins schwartz wilkins and fellini the italian bit was for real bart said that the original mr fellini was made a partner in the early twenties when they saw the way things were going in chicago they couldnt pull the same trick with the italians for one thing a lot of them would only speak their native language when doing business are you saying the practice was mobconnected no and bart never did either but youre a smart man mr skinner youll realise that back in the roaring twenties in chicago it was bound to be and is it still it was joe doherty who answered no he said emphatically that was one of the first things i checked out when we became aware of the possible link between these three killings the bureau maintains a continuous investigation of organised crime in this country we know just about all of the law firms who deal with the mob knowingly mr wilkins firm isnt on that list nor is grace mclean wylie whyte and oakdale mr graces firm nor gregory mozlowski and harold the former practice of sander garrett these days at least theyre all clean although so much hot money is reinvested these days in legitimate business that its possible to be connected without even knowing it thats true in europe as well skinner admitted the mafia investigations in italy have thrown up plenty of names in other countries the uk among them who connect up to other things i guess were best off out here in the wilderness tad said sumner there is no wilderness any more pal i know a man an american who owns a large piece of scotland where few people even tourists ever go hes officially legitimate but still his fbi file reads like a novel i know in my heart that he was behind a major crime on my patch but ill never prove it because we killed the people who carried it out youve got a nice little city here in the heart of a spectacular state but make no mistake the world is coming to get you now he said sharply back to the crime scene did mr wilkins keep any business papers there was a filing cabinet in his den said the state bureau chief but we didnt check its contents i reckon we better had now i reckon agreed skinner come on lets do it now he could see as soon as he walked through the door that she was having a bad day frown lines showed on her forehead and her hair which was normally perfectly arranged was ruffled mario braced himself for the outburst you would think that in this day and age cash payrolls would be a thing of the past but no such honest to god some of our employers are still stuck in a timewarp we advise them we warn them we plead with them and do they take a blind bit of notice do they hell as like maggie frowned at him and you can wipe the daft bloody smile off your face you wont be grinning when you have an armed holdup in the middle of your division as you will sooner or later anyone hurt he asked at once no thank goodness they waved shotguns around but no shots were fired where was it at that massive private housing development up near myreside three guys sat round the corner in a battered old ford watched the cash drop off then just moved in and picked it up they drove off with twentytwo thousand pounds we found the car a mile away who were they this time she caught his meaning at once tony blair george dubya bush and lennox lewis check the toyshops maybe whoever bought them used a credit card teach nana viareggio mcguire thats already being done as it happens we found a schoolpatrol woman who saw them change cars she told us that they headed east in a dark blue peugeot saloon plus she gave us a pretty good description of one of them hes medium height she said with grey hair a broken nose and a birthmark on his cheek bluey scott to the life thats what i reckoned ive sent ray wilding and a dc round to his house with an armed response team because there were firearms involved i wonder which one he was lennox lewis ill bet he used to be a heavyweight boxer after all no dear he used to be an opponent they took his licence away in the end i saw him in the ring twice the two fights lasted a total of five rounds and bluey was knocked down a total of seven times that could happen again if hes still got the shotgun nah mcguire drawled bluey wont give them any trouble he might be punchy but hes not suicidal i lifted him once myself and he came along quietly enough youre more scary than wilding im not more scary than a heckler and koch carbine though lets hope so theres always hell to pay when a police officer shoots a suspect especially if hes carrying a table leg at the time and hes on his way home from hospital lets not go into that she said ending the discussion now get to the point whats brought you here if you thought youd pick me up so i could get ready for andys do ill be a while yet its barely gone five her husband shook his head no it isnt that sit down for a minute will you why she threw him a puzzled look but did as he said its about your father i told you mario she blurted out urgently i dont want to know yes but you have to as a police officer what do you mean has he been up to has he committed a crime not lately not one that i know of at any rate but he may just be a victim of one he told her about his discovery of her fathers new identity and of his fruitless search for him youre saying that my fathers a missing person she asked if you are he can bloody well stay lost that would be best all round in fact jesus christ what sort of background checks does the education authority run on the people it employs to work with children very careful checks he answered quietly and in this case what could it possibly have thrown up your father might be the worst sort of beast but the fact is hes never even been charged with anything far less prosecuted far less convicted to everyone but you and your sister hes clean theres been no trouble at the school none to speak of certainly none of the sort you mean and you say hes just vanished thats how it looks he told her again about the scraps of supper and the sunday newspaper that he had found in his flat hes a missing person love you have to treat him as such but whos missing him his employer for a start and i am too i want to find this man to make bloody sure that he stays out of your life our lives mario he probably has no idea where i am or what i am dont you kid yourself he reads the tabloids he told her about the press cutting in rosewells sideboard reading surprise and pain in her face all right she conceded at last ill circulate his details roiaall the divisions and enter him on the national register in that case youll need this he took the photograph from his pocket and handed it to her it took a great effort of will by maggie before she could look at the likeness of her father yet when she did to her great surprise she felt nothing his was just another face just another of the many that had lain on the same desk some of those had been missing as he was now others had been dead victims as she had been and in her mind still was while others had been criminals george rosewell fitted two of those categories and for all she knew perhaps he belonged in the third as well she looked at the photograph again there was a familiarity about it on occasion the man still appeared in her nightmares but that was all she laid it on the desk face down okay she said ill see about having it circulated if he turns up well lets just hope its after manny english comes back if doherty and skinner had driven around eight hundred miles down interstate fifteen from helena montana down across idaho and on south through salt lake city and st george utah skirting arizona and into southern nevada they would have come to las vegas they would have come also to the aid of special agent isaac brand thompson hall chief of police of the city of north las vegas had been less cooperative than doherty had hoped or expected at four pm almost five hours after he had touched down at mccarran airport brand was still seated in his outer office waiting with growing impatience for the conclusion of what he had been told was a meeting with the mayor he was staring at halls smoked glass door when his cellphone rang zak how goes it joe doherty sounded as amiable as ever until the young agent told him how it went you been sat there for four hours not quite sir the chief took a lunch break at one pm his secretary suggested that i do the same i know sir he admitted its almost intolerable but what can i do you can drop the almost son its completely fucking intolerable youve never had a detail like this before have you no sir then blaine me i should have made sure you got a better welcome is chief halls secretary close to you yes sir shes sat across the room then heres what you do dont ring off just give her your cellphone and tell her do not ask her instruct her to take it into the chiefs room and mayor or no mayor to stick it in his fucking ear you understand yes sir so go do it he rose from his chair and did what doherty had told him the secretary a frosty brunette who fitted every description of a vegas showgirl that he had ever read protested at first but brand knowing that the line was still live and that his boss could hear him stuck to his guns miss he said slowly and with emphasis on every word the deputy director of the fbi is on the line and requires to speak with mr hall do as i say she gave in took the cellphone from him as she stood and disappeared into the chiefs room without he noticed bothering to knock he looked at his watch as he waited watching the second hand as it swept steadily round it was just short of completing its second revolution when the door opened and a man appeared he was short for a policeman five eight at most several inches shorter than brand with a spreading waistline emphasised by a belt which was cinched at least or too tight from which the hem of his blue shortsleeved shirt was escaping he held the cellphone in his left hand the other was stretched out in greeting hi im thompson hall welcome to north las vegas son son he said with the forced heartiness ofatexan governor on the stomp as the agent accepted his handshake why have you been sitting here in silence for all this time goddamn if you had only said how important this thing is rosalie would have broken up my meeting mayor or no mayor come on come on lets waste no more time rosie fix us up with coffee and doughnuts he handed back the cellphone then led the way into his office and walked round behind his desk brand looked around there was no sign of any other visitor but at the back of the room he saw what could have been an exit door and so he gave the chief the benefit of the doubt nevertheless the last of his diplomacy had evaporated around an hour before and so as soon as he was seated he launched into the reason for his visit sander garrett yes son i understand from your boss that the bureaus got a burr up its ass about this guy to me this is just a runofthemill homicide so whats the story what do you know about the man chief the agent asked zilch the man replied abruptly i know that this is only north las vegas the poor sister of the big city but this place is still full of retired geezers come here for the golf the gambling and the girls garrett paid his taxes and didnt get into trouble so we had no dealings with him till he got his head blown off mr garrett may have been retired chief but as i understand it he was no newcomer to the area he was a partner in a law firm on the strip and still went in there occasionally is that so yes weve done some followup investigation through the american bar association hes practised law here since nineteen sixtyeight goddamn you say goddamn i do sir can you tell me how was mr garrett killed hall picked up a bound file from his desk and tossed it across to brand see for yourself the policeman watched with malicious amusement as his earnest young visitor opened the file what he had given him was a closeup colour shot of sander garrett taken on a mortuary table he saw brand look at it then in what seemed to be an involuntary reflex action close his eyes when he opened them again he seemed to focus on the mans small moustache and on a gold filling on one of his front teeth as if to help him cope with his revulsion where the centre ofgarretts forehead should have been there was a dark jagged hole speckled with white dots which he knew had to be bone fragments kinda grabs you kid doesnt it said the police chief thats what a softnosed fortyfive bullet will do on the way out if you put the barrel against the skull doesnt leave any room for doubt you might say garrett was in his kitchen when he was killed fixing his supper the way my guys read it the shooter just walked in through the back door which wasnt locked pulled out a cannon and shot him through the back of the skull spreading his fucking brains all over the malted milk and cookies then he got on with robbing the place halfway through his graphic description rosalie came into the room with coffee and doughnuts which she laid on the desk hall did not pause nor did she flinch as she left brand closed the folder hall offered him a doughnut but he declined did the back door open directly on to the kitchen no it opens into a laundry then you have the kitchen was the front door locked hell i dont know why you ask because we are not convinced that this was an opportunistic burglary as you have described it we believe that it ties in with two other recent killings if that is right the killer had the skill to come through the door whether it was locked or not brand tapped the folder are your forensic reports in here chief no thats just the photograph book but the guy didnt leave any traces there were no prints other than the ones left by garrett his cleaning lady and a fortyyearold blonde called charlene stacey garrett was widowed stacey was his ladyfriend we thought about her for a while but we couldnt tie her to it shes a sales rep and she was out of town at the time who claimed the body asked the agent she did brand opened the folder once more he flicked past the morgue photographs and turned to those taken at the crime scene several showed garrett face down across his kitchen table slumped in the midae of a lake of blood the guy didnt exactly barge in he said quietlybt how do you work that out v the victim was shot through the back of the head if he had heard the door open hed have turned around how about the gunshot itself did any neighbours hear anything nope the lab said he used a muffler just like your average burglar murmured brand he goes out on a job carrying a silenced fortyfive if hall picked up his irony he said nothing so what was taken from the house money garretts watch credit cards and other valuables the fbi agent spun the folder around and pushed it across the desk see the display cabinet in that photograph hall nodded its full of meissen pottery collectables very expensive those are valuables yet they were left okay the chief grunted irritably but they are also very identifiable this wasnt no collector it was probably some spic crackhead out to feed his habit so where did he sell the watch where did he use the cards he aint done that so far lets hope he does said brand maintaining his patience those other valuables what were they according to ms stacey he took two items an apple laptop computer plus wait for this he took a box of very expensive cuban cigars come on andy there was a challenge in mario mcguires voice tell us the truth are you really looking forward to dundee the jazz quartet was on a break and so the question carried to everyone in their alcove some of them seated at two tables pulled together others standing as he spoke he glanced around them all maggie willie haggerty brian mackie dan pringle the two other divisional heads detective superintendents greg jay and willie michaels neil mcllhenney sergeant sammy pye and his fiancee ruth mcconnell and karen the outgoing head ofcids heavily pregnant wife the chief constable had joined them for supper in la rusticana but had ducked out diplomatically to allow the serious business to begin martin leaned back against the wall of the cellar bar his pint glass almost disappearing into his big hand you know mario he said easily with a grin you always were a cheeky bastard he slipped an arm around karens waist as i think about your question i can only reply with three of my own first how have i stood you lot for so long second what the hells going to happen if theres a serious crime tonight since the entire cid command structures in the process of getting ratarsed third he spun his fingers and his glass appeared empty whos going to fill this up its deuchars he added in case youve forgotten sammy pye picked up the mug containing the remains of their kitty and the note of the round and headed off to catch the attention of the big redheaded manager are you going to give us the serious answer now andy asked maggie rose or is it too late for that the newest member of the association of chief police officers looked back at her one more pint and it will be one more pint and id be too maudlin to say this or probably id do something very embarrassing if i tried he started to put his glass to his lips before remembering that he had drained it ive been in the trenches with you guys and gals i include my beautiful wife in that and young pye up at the bar there and you too ruthie since you know where most of the bodies are buried and of course our absent friend who even as i speak is probably scaring the living shite out of some poor rural polisman in wild montana i love every last one of you he paused and ran his eyes around the group these have been the best years of my life so far and for them i thank you all mind you i suppose i should extend that vote of thanks to all those villains who over the years have been so fucking stupid that theyve let the likes of us catch them up at the bar sammy pye looked over his shoulder wondering what the laugh was about so said martin out of his earshot you want the serious answer mags well here it is through those years ive had some close calls the last one closer than most of you know the truth is i dont want any more ive used up all my luck i couldnt even trust myself to govft on an armed situation any more because i know that if i did i would pull the trigger at the first hint of a threat im looking forward to dundee because it takes me out of the line of fire im not saying that our jobs life and death every day because we all know that it isnt but it can be it has been for me and for some of you and we can all remember a couple of colleagues who arent around any more its not getting any less dangerous either wed an armed robbery this afternoon brilliantly cleared up inside two hours by superintendent rose and her team round of applause gentlemen and thanks mags for letting me sign off without any red marks on the crime figures he raised his empty glass in his colleagues direction while the others nodded agreement so yeah he went on ill put on my accs uniform on monday without the slightest qualm or pang or any of those things ill miss you all of course but ill have the consolation of a new job im going to be responsible believe it or not for community policing traffic patrols and public relations among other things and if any of you lot are caught speeding round the dundee ring road dont think ill pull the ticket far from it ill put on my pr hat and make sure you wind up in the courier he took his replacement pint ofdeuchars ale from the tray that pye had brought back there is one other thing i should say as some of you may know also i have been round the block a couple of times and more in a personal sense well finally ive found what was meant for me all along im looking forward god willing to many years of coming home safely at night to karen and our daughter when shes born i think she deserves that security i think they both do he took a long swallow from his glass right thats it speeches over lets get on with the business of the night the others rendered silent for the moment by the frankness of his admissions took their drinks from pyes tray as the musicians wandered back to their corner of the bar and picked up their instruments they had reached the third bar of stormy weather when a mobile phone sounded in the middle of the detectives alcove gonnae no dae that said martin theatrically looking round for the culprit and smiling as an embarrassed greg jay took his handset from his pocket be firm with her greg he called out the leith cid commander turned his back on the group and held the phone to his ear the rest could not hear what he was saying but they saw his body stiffen slightly in his chair a reaction that killed the smiles and stilled the laughter jay ended the call then turned back to face the table his eyes picking out a colleague mario he said beppe viareggios your uncle yes mcguire nodded in that case i think we should have a talk outside what do you have for me special agent kosinski asked joe doherty i dont have anything new sir the forensic specialists still havent secured a positive result from their sampling how about our interview with the man who succeeded mr grace as senior partner of the buffalo firm have you set that up yet the link flickered for a second forcing the deputy director to repeat his question yes sir that is arranged the mans name is jackson wylie he says he recalls meeting mr skinner at a party at the grace mansion in his and dr sarah grace skinners honour since its saturday hes asked if youd mind meeting him on board his cabin cruiser in the bayview marina he told me that he always spends saturdays on the boat doing maintenance tasks i said okay sir i sort of assumed you wouldnt mind given that deputy chief skinner has met the man sure thats no problem what time have you set one oclock sharp sir your flight from montana is due in to buffalo at eleven fortyfive but i left you a little leeway mr wylie said hed provide some lunch on board there will be a fax for you at the airport showing the route to his mooring i fixed the meeting through mrs thorpe mr wylies personal secretary she also worked directly for mr grace when he was at the law firm i asked her if she recognised the names bartholomew wilkins or sander garrett she didnt sir but she has undertaken to check through his personal files theyre still held at the firms offices to see if either name comes up but she wasnt hopeful shes very efficient sir i dont expect results no and neither do i but im not beyond the age where i can take pleasure from a surprise so lets just wait to see what she finds while shes doing that troy i want you to book yourself on a flight to chicago on monday i want you to interview mr arthur wilkins hes the son of bart wilkins and he succeeded him as senior partner in the family law firm wilkins schwartz wilkins and fellini i want you to find out what he knows about his fathers business and political life and about what hes been doing since he retired yes sir kosinski seemed to hesitate eh sir he continued tentatively about the weekend you done all you can there asked doherty yes sir i believe so then go home to new york son just keep your cellphone switched on so that special agent brand or i or your area saic can reach you i will sir thank you sir the deputy director ended the call shaking his head these young guys he murmured to skinner i love em they come out of the academy these days trained as well as the guys in special forces and as committed i worry about my country sometimes then i think fifteen years down the road to a time when the director and i are gone and goodhearted boys like brand and kosinski are running the show the big scot shrugged you may not be too good at running elections i like the oldfashioned way where voters put a cross on a piece of paper and theyre all counted by real people but usually you wind up with the right guys at the top doherty held up a hand index finger pointing in the air ah but now we live in an age when the outcome can depend in part at least on how funny the candidates are on fucking television chat shows now it really has started to get dangerous now if the wrong guys had the power in that case my friend it is all the more important that you and your director get hold of the young guys like troy and zak and the young girls too and teach them the things they havent learned at the academy teach them your values and teach them that patriotism really can be the last refuge of the scoundrel we havent got all that many years left to do it said doherty lighting a cigarette fewer if you keep doing that the american smiled christ youre getting to be a zealot yourself on that subject no one has so many friends that he can afford to lose a single one to those things blah doherty exclaimed but he dropped his marlboro crushed it under his foot and kicked it into the gutter skinner looked back up bart and roseanne wilkins driveway so what do we do now he asked were done here i reckon and our return flight isnt until half seven tomorrow ah hell well see the sights of helena eat some prime beef and try to drink the napa valley dry but first lets see if the other young soldiers getting better treatment in vegas than he was when we spoke last he dialled brands number skinner watched as his friend spoke to the special agent his expression was serious matteroffact as he listened until all at once it broke into a wide grin you say he exclaimed kid youve made my day thanks ill see you monday back in buffalo meantime if you want to spend the weekend in vegas continuing your investigation thats all right with me just dont let me see any roulette chips on your expenses claim he pushed the end button and put the cellphone back in his pocket well skinner demanded w youre going to love this pal said doherty superintendent barbara weston will not but you will the guy who iced sander garrett stole his cubans bob he took his goddamned cigars mario mcguire clad in a white sceneofcrime suit looked at the sheet in the corner of the room and shivered at the recent memory of what lay under it to escape it as much as anything else he rose from his seat by the wide window and walked through to the apartments main bedroom his aunt lay on her bed fully dressed she was staring at the ceiling he sat beside her and took her hand how you doing sophia she turned her head to look at him her eyes were rimmed all round with red made all the more vivid by the paleness of her face mario it was a whisper and it was all she could say yeah yeah he stroked her arm doing his best to soothe her listen he said his voice not much louder than hers the doctor will be here soon shell give you a shot and then i want you to go with maggie back to our place shes downstairs in a patrol car you cant stay here she frowned her eyes almost crossing as she tried to focus on him she raised herself off the pillow bracing her weight on an elbow but will the police not want to talk to me yes we will but no ones going to do that until youre fit and ready for it and the guy wholl decide that is me youre my auntie and no ones going to impose on you but whos going to tell the girls whos going to tell nana whos going to tell your mother ill do all that dont you worry she nodded and lay back on the pillow once more staring upwards again why son why she murmured why would anyone he had no answer for her not so soon he was about to tell her as much when the silence of the big flat was shattered by a scream he jumped up from the bed his foot slipping for a second on the plush carpet and headed back to the great openplan living room almost at a run his cousin paula was standing with the sheet in her hands staring down at her fathers body she was wearing a designer trouser suit and most of her long darkskinned back was bare as he looked at her jesus he gasped crossing the room to her side in four long strides as detective superintendent jay drawn by the commotion emerged from the kitchen greg mcguire roared at him are your people asleep out there he turned her round forcibly twisting her away from the sight on the floor who let you in here he asked a guy outside tried to stop me she hissed but i kicked him on the knee and came in anyway mario what is this whats happened she wriggled in his grasp she was big and in her heels almost as tall as he was but still he was much too strong for her were way short of being able to answer all of that he said quietly but your fathers been shot and hes dead aunt sophia found him when she came in from the theatre she and my mum took nana viareggio to the show at the kings he paused letting it sink in what brought you here at this time of night he asked her i was out for a meal at the malmaison when i was leaving i looked across the water and saw the ambulance outside the building then when i got here i saw maggie sitting in a patrol car oh mario finally paulas hard outer casing seemed to crack she laid her forehead on his shoulder and cried like a baby he released his grip on her and enfolded her in his arms hugging her to him as he did so something came to him a fragment of memory from a very drunken night many years before okay kid he whispered feeling her tears dampening the front of his tunic let it out let it outas they stood there embracing his own grief for his dead clownish clumsy but ultimately likeable uncle came to him he buried his face in paulas silver hair kissing it gently okay okay okay he murmured over and over again feeling her hold tighten on him feeling the warmth of her all the way down his body feeling himself reacting involuntarily to it the weight of greg jays hand on his shoulder brought him back to the time and place mario said the superintendent gently the doctors here he blinked and nodded paula she looked up at him her face a mess of smeared mascara and eye shadow go see your mother he told her shes in the bedroom okay she agreed beginning to gather herself together once more thanks cousin look take care of things will you violas going to be out of it that brotherinlaw of mine will be no better and mums going to need me can you do that of course ill handle everything she kissed him on the cheek thanks she murmured love you for it he turned steering her towards her parents room as he did he saw sarah grace skinner standing in the doorway waiting for him sarah he exclaimed thank christ its you im so glad you were able to come no problem she assured him i havent retired you know the nannys living in for now at least so i could leave the kids she frowned at him this is your uncle mr jay told me yes should you be here try to keep me away he grunted should the boss be with the fbi you got me there she admitted lets get to work then okay but first could you talk to my aunt she needs a sedative then paula and maggie can take her out of here paula oh yes that was your cousin i remember her now from your wedding reception a strikinglooking woman isnt she hows she taking it shes made of solid steel inside shell be all right ill decide that i might just stick a needle in her anyway you wait here she turned medical bag in hand and followed in paulas footsteps going into the bedroom after a gentle knock on the door mario heard the sound of his aunts sobbing as she entered he stood in the living room for several minutes watching inspector arthur dorward and his crimescene team beginning their task of gathering all the tiny pieces of potential evidence that the room might hold watching the photographer as he took picture after picture of beppes body finally sarah reappeared looking sombre this is unusual for me she confessed quietly to mcguire in fact its unique invariably when i arrive at a scene the grieving relatives are long gone but not this time the detective looked at her with a trace of alarm in his eyes you want us to get someone else he asked oh no im ready to go to work once your aunt and cousin have gone okay ill see to that meantime you really should talk to greg jay this is his division and his investigation sure but isnt andy here no he ruled himself out of this one technically he might still be in post but thats only for another day or so as for his successor hed had a couple of pints too many at the leaving do please go and talk to greg sarah did as he asked while he went back into the bedroom to take charge of sophia and paula and escort them down to maggie in the waiting car when he returned she had put on a white overall suit and was waiting for him standing beside beppes body with detective superintendent jay she looked at mcguire you absolutely sure you want to see this she asked him absolutely certain in that case to business gentlemen she took a small tape recorder from her pocket and switched it on first of all i need to know if the body has been moved no jay replied i understand that mrs viareggio found her husband youre sure she didnt touch him no way mario volunteered my aunts a nervous woman shes k scared of her shadow she told me that she took one look screamed and ran to the downstairs neighbour how about him her shes a single lady her names dr alexander and shes a civil service medical adviser she came up and took a quick look to verify that beppe was dead then closed the door and called the police she didnt touch him in checking for life signs no said greg jay the leith divisional cid commander was tall and pearshaped with shoulders that appeared narrower than his waist and a small round head his manner was as ponderous as his appearance she didnt need to doctor take a look he pulled back the sheet from the body beppe viareggio lay on his stomach with his backside sticking up in the air and his arms by his sides palms facing upward his forehead was on the birchwood floor in the centre of a small round pool of blood which had run in streaks down both sides of his face sarah whistled quietly this was not a suicide she murmured no gun at the scene jay told her you could have found an arsenal here and still that couldnt have been selfinflicted not from that angle look at that she knelt and pointed with her tape recorder at a great wound just at the point where the spinal column descended from the skull she peered at it closely taking in a mass of congealed blood hair and bone matter to shoot yourself there youd need to be a contortionist not a fat man on the threshold of the third age she pushed herself up and walked around the body slowly looking at it from every possible angle okay she said finally has the photographer finished she looked across at the redhaired inspector arthur dorward who was lifting fingerprints from the front door he nodded in reply then turn him over please gentlemen mcguire and jay did as she asked mario flinching slightly as he rolled his uncle on to his back expecting to see a grotesque exit wound but there was none apart from the blood on his forehead and his cheeks beppes dead face was unmarked sarah read his thoughts whoever did this used a hollow bullet and probably a large calibre firearm this was an execution pure and simple very similar to a case we had a couple of years back id say from the way hes fallen that the victim was forced to kneel and was shot once through the base of the skull the bullet flattened out on contact with the first and second cervical vertebrae shattered them and passed on through into the brain pulverising it i wouldnt look to get ballistic markings when its recovered itll be pretty much destroyed this wasnt a contact wound or else it might well have blown the mans head clean off the killer probably fired at a distance of two or three feet sarah looked at jay was dr alexander in all night do you know yes mcguire answered her and did she hear anything at all that could have been a gunshot or hasnt anyone interviewed her yet i spoke to her and i asked her that no she didnt the only unusual sound she remembered was a thud coming through the ceiling at around nine thirty as if something heavy had been dropped in the flat above she leaned over and touched beppes waxy face he isnt stone cold and theres no rigor as yet so that may well be the time of death the thud could have been your uncle falling forward as he was shot mario big gun like this he must have used a silencer otherwise she would have heard it theres no doubt in my mind gentlemen she said firmly that this has all the signs of what the media love to call a ganglandstyle killing or a contract hit for what its worth i havent had anything like this on my autopsy table what about that other case you mentioned the one a couple of years ago asked jay there were two of those in fact but that investigation was solved at that time in any case there are some significant differences here in those murders a rifle was used a lower calibre higher velocity weapon and there was another signature a very distinctive thing no this isnt related ill trust your judgement on that especially if the person involved is locked up the superintendent said hes dead actually couldnt have been him then mcguire grunted from the side when can you do the post mortem on mr viareggio dr skinner tomorrow morning mr jay first thing if thats good enough for you yes thatll be fine she looked at the other detective mario can i ask you something are you aware of any health problems your uncle might have had anything i should look out for in my examination no none at all beppe might have been a bit on the plump side but he took his health seriously he had regular bupa medicals and came through them all with flying colours come to think about it he had one a few weeks back he was crowing about it at our family party on wednesday night why do you ask she grinned at him wryly thoroughness thats all convince me of that youre too suspicious by half mcguire okay she confessed i saw a case like this back in the states once when i was working there it was similar to this a prominent man shot dead in his home and the cops tore up half of gangland over the next couple of days then the coroner found that the man was riddled with cancer subsequently the police spotted a large cash withdrawal from his bank made just a couple of days before his death they never did find the shooter but they started asking different questions and came up with the answer the man knew he was dying and had actually chosen to put a contract on himself but if your uncle beppe was physically fit and financially sound which he was mario confirmed sarah glanced down at the body once more her smile had disappeared then that cant apply here so how did your uncle come to have upset someone badly enough for them to do that to him do you know much about his business not as much as im going to as of three hours ago control of it passed to me what i thought your mother was the cotrustee my mothers retiring he explained im taking her place and with beppe dead im the senior partner with the casting vote god wont that make things difficult for you i guess it will i didnt ask for this sarah i assure you but it all goes back to my grandfathers will i cant walk away from it however messy it is not even if there was a conflict of interest with your duty as a policeman not even then couldnt you persuade your mother to stay on for a while he gasped after this what if beppes murder is connected to the business do you think id put her in the firing line no of course not she replied quickly im sorry i wasnt thinking straight there is one upside though he told her greg jay wont have any trouble gaining access to the books and records of the viareggio trust you ever been in an air terminal that you really liked as a place asked joe doherty barcelona lucky you i hate em all of them whether theyre monsters like heathrow and ohare or smalltown operations like this one and when its dark outside i hate em even worse bollocks skinner laughed what youre really saying is that you hate flying his friends lip curled into a sneer show me a man who says he actually likes it especially since september and ill show you a liar you dont have to like it joe you just have to do it personally i cannot see how heavierthanair machines ever make it off the ground but they do so i take it on trust now if you were talking about sailing that would be different uh you dont like boats the smaller they are the more i dislike them ill go on cross channel ferries when i have to like when i take the kids on holiday but thats it you get seasick dohertys sallow face was lit by his broadest smile the great bob skinner gets seasick no ive only ever felt seasick once in my life and that was on the waltzer at portobello funfair with alex when she was a kid all i could think about was how wide it would spread if i actually did throw up i made it to the end of the ride just but boats i dont like them thats all its a childhood thing my mum used to tell a story about a time she and my dad took me to millport for the weekend when i wasnt much more than a baby somehow my old man managed to miss the last ferry on sunday night and since he had to be at work next morning he hired a local bloke with a motorboat to take us across to largs ive got no conscious memory of it but mother said that it was a hell of a choodv trip and that she was terrified i suppose that communicated itself to me and that its stayed with me ever since oh said the american in that case theres something id better share with you the location of our meeting with jackson wylie your fatherinlaws expartner skinner stared at him not his fucking boat christ when i met the guv at leos place i had to dredge the bottom of the barrel to find an excuse not to go out fishing with the two of them joe tell me kosinski hasnt booked us on to his fucking boat wylie calls it his cruiser but you got it buddy thats where its at you want to duck out the stare became a glare duck out so you can tell your pals in washington all about it theres two things in this life i dont like small boats and looking at dead bodies from time to time i have to do the one and ill fucking well do the other if its necessary not liking is a human feeling not doing is a human weakness ill go across wylies gangplank dont you worry in that case the good news is that itll be moored in the marina this aint no fishing trip other than for any information the guy might have the airport announcer broke into their conversation calling them to the boarding gate for their flight to buffalo skinner glanced up at the departure hall clock it showed twelve minutes after six through the glass walls he saw the lightening sky realising that already it was breakfasttime at their destination and that further east sarah and the children should be having lunch a wave of homesickness washed over him he took out his cellphone and called home trish the nanny answered she was a friendly girl the daughter of a barbadian mother and a yorkshire father who had met on a county cricket tour of the west indies no mr skinner she told him sarah isnt here shes up at the royal doing a post mortem on a murder victim he laughed she cant resist can she im married to a workaholic trish i guess you are although she did say there were special circumstances involved with this one wonder what she meant by that he mused aloud shell tell me i expect meantime let me have a word with mark he had a brief conversation with his son as he walked to the gate catching up on school news then switched off the cellphone and put it away as his boarding card was checked the flight was even and uneventful after a while joe doherty almost relaxed this time there was no view other than of a cloud blanket that lasted all the way to the great lakes so instead of sightseeing skinner passed the time thinking searching in vain through his sketchy knowledge of his fatherinlaws business and personal history for any pointers to the mystery of his death the flight to greater buffalo international ended with a textbook landing and a sigh of relief from the deputy director of the fbi as they stepped out of the aircraft they were hit by the warmth of the morning a contrast from the montana chill nice day for a sail doherty remarked fuck off skinner grunted grimly they collected kosinskis fax in a white envelope from the airport information desk and returned to the rental car in the longstay car park doherty climbed in and turned the ignition nothing happened shit he swore dud battery luckily they were parked close to an exit booth within ten minutes an airport worker arrived with a fully charged startup pack and they were mobile once more still they had lost time and were tight for their scheduled waterborne meeting with jackson wylie the scot took the special agents map as they set off as soon as he looked at it he realised that the drive would be longer than they had anticipated the airport was around ten miles north of buffalo and bayview on lake erie where the marina was located looked to be the same distance to the south the route that had been plotted for them took them round the outskirts of the city but nonetheless the saturday traffic on lakeshore was heavy fortunately bayview was a small community the signs were poor but still the marina was easy to find they found a space at the rear of its dedicated car park and set out to find wylies cruiser the marina was a bustle of activity skinner guessed that most of the boatowners were strictly fairweather sailors and that the fine spring day had drawn them in droves to ready their vessels for the summer to come says here that were looking for mooring number twoseven three doherty muttered the boats called the hispaniola treasure island eh dyou think our man fancies himself as long john silver maybe so robert louis stevenson spent some time in new york state ah come on next youll be telling me that john logie baird was an american skinner paused hey wait a minute he pointed along a boardwalk jetty not far from the gateway to the marina where they stood see that cruiser there about ten boats along a big bugger of a thing with an awning on top theres a guy on deck and im pretty sure thats jackson wylie fuckin hell the policeman chuckled hes got a barbecue going hes on a boat and hes got a barbie lit you should be pleased then it means he really aint planning to sail anywhere doherty glanced at his watch come on then lets go see him its not too bad were only just over five minutes late skinner nodded looked down automatically to check his footing among the ropes and paintpots that littered the wide walkway and set out after him he had taken two steps when with no warning he felt his head swim and his knees buckle the strangest sensation swept through him it was as if he had stood in that spot before had played the same scene in a parallel life he felt as if he was in a throng of rushing relentless people joe he heard himself call out hoarsely the american stopped and looked over his shoulder frowning as he caught sight of his friends face bob you okay he asked but skinners spell had passed as suddenly as it had come upon him yes yes he said quickly you sure you look as though youd seen a ghost he walked back towards him for a minute i thought i had it was shit i dont know for a second there i thought i was going in the drink you know what i reckon it was the water the way it moves as you look through the planks i know i said i dont get seasick but i think i was pretty close to it there listen said doherty go back to the car if you want i wont tell anyone honest dont be daft man ill be all right they waited for a minute or so until skinner nodded no its gone im okay come on lets not keep the man waiting any longer he took a step along the boardwalk and then the whole world turned orange and red and black all in the same instant a great invisible force seemed to pick the two men off their feet and hurl them backwards sending them crashing on to the jetty they lay there stunned until the noise caught up with them followed almost at once by the awareness of great heat a second explosion sounded not so fierce but closer this time skinner propped himself up on an elbow and looked along focusing his blurred eyes the hispaniola was nowhere to be seen not in its original form it was at the centre of an inferno in the midst of which he thought he could see a figure staggering jerkily around a human torch its arms waving in slow motion and then seeming to sink into itself the boat next to it was on fire too that had been the second explosion he guessed since it was closer to them its flames in rum were licking another large cruiser even nearer to where they lay if its tanks went up he scrambled to his feet looking at his friend as he did so doherty was unconscious stunned either by the blast or by the force of his impact with the boardwalk skinner knelt beside him grabbed his left arm and his right leg and in a single powerful movement stood once more heaving the american over his shoulder and then he ran as if doherty weighed nothing at all as far and as fast as he could hearing the crackling of the flames and feeling their heat as they crept towards him bob skinner ran carrying his friend for their very lives mario had always been slightly in awe of his grandmother as a child he had loved papa viareggio almost to the point of worship but nana had inspired something different in him she had never been forbidding but there had been something about her that had marked her out from the norm an inner strength that at times could make her seem aloof even from her children and grandchildren she had always dealt with the world on her terms and never in his life had her grandson seen her give an inch in the face of misfortune and so he was not surprised when he went to visit her in the terraced house not far from murrayfield stadium that had been her home for sixty years to be greeted at the front door with a steely look which betrayed not a sign of frailty well she demanded what have you come to tell me son he did not answer her instead he kissed her on the cheek and allowed her to lead him into the living room where his mother and aunt sophia sat stunned by the loss of a brother and a husband where are the girls he asked our paulas in the kitchen cooking something or other for our supper violas gone home to her family where she should be so come on laddie out with it have your policemen caught the evil man who murdered my son her voice was full of controlled rage he read it at once for he felt the same way himself were doing all we can nana he began but she cut him off i know that she snapped i trust you not to let them do any less but thats not what i asked you in that case the answers no we havent caught him the truth is nana we dont even know where to begin to look weve got not a scrap of physical evidence we recovered the bullet that killed him but as the pathologist predicted before she did the pm it was too distorted for us to have a chance of identifying the gun that fired it if the weapon had been used in another crime you see ach i know that mario the old lady retorted i watch quincy she looked away from him for the first time can you tell me this did he suffer he could see out of the corner of his eye his mother and his aunt tense as she asked the question no he answered as firmly as he could not a bit it was instantaneous i doubt very much if he even heard the gunshot paula heard a policeman say there was a silencer he glanced at his cousin as she came into the room they just muffle the noise nana he said and this was a big gun so what have you been doing all day ive been helping my colleague detective superintendent jay you have to realise nana that im a witness in this investigation not a participant ive spent most of the day so far in uncle beppes office with two specialist detectives going through all of the books of the business in the hope that we might find something that pointed to a reason for the murder you mean you were trying to find out if beppe had been up to no good no nana i didnt mean that she patted him on the arm and settled stiffly into her highbacked armchair throwing him a faint smile of course you did son but you dont need to softsoap me i could have told you youd be wasting your time there your poor uncle might not have been about to win the businessman of the year award but he wasnt a crook and remember even if he had been that stupid your mother was there as the second trustee shed have stopped him in his tracks i know i know he agreed but this is a police investigation and things cant be taken on faith they have to be looked at weve done that now and of course there was nothing there in a way i wish there had been it would have given us a bloody lead aye the old lady said sharply and dragged our name through the mud at the same time i would rather that you didnt catch the man who shot beppe than for that to happen oh well catch him nana dont you worry about that the mans not walking away from this as for the family name ill keep it as safe as i can i may carry my fathers surname but im as much a viareggio as anyone in this room mario his mother called to him from across the room he turned to face her she was as redeyed as her sisterinlaw and at the sight other the memory of his fathers death flooded into his consciousness ive been thinking all day about this ever since you told me about beppe i think id better stay for a while stay in the trust i mean he shook his head there was a slow finality about the gesture no he said thats not going to happen ive been thinking about it too dont worry this day was always going to come one way or another beppes gone and youre gone paula and i are in control of the businesses now and thats how its going to stay its papas will and you cant fight that but wont it conflict with your duties as policeman its unlikely but if it did theres a way around it i have a lawyer someone i know and trust on thursday i had her look at the trust provisions they allow for me to appoint her or someone else suitable as my proxy to exercise all my powers on my behalf if im advised that its necessary i may well do that but first were going to find the bugger who made my aunt sophia a widow of all the fatally stupid things i have seen sir said the sheriffs marine patrol lieutenant they dont come any more stupid than that or any more fatal lighting a charcoal barbecue in the middle of a crowded marina with all that fuel around dwayne traylor shook his head and looked at skinner so far in addition to mr wylies cruiser weve lost four other boats and had serious damage to three others there are no dead other than the guy himself and hes as dead as you can get but one lady has gone to the emergency room with burns to her arms and face and with most of her hair frazzled the young man glanced into the treatment bay behind the yacht clubs reception area joe doherty lay on a long leathertopped table a doctor was leaning over him putting stitches into a long gash on his cheekbone hows your buddy he asked okay i hope the scot answered he was out for three or four minutes after the explosion i told him he should go to hospital he told me i should go to hell he glanced at the officer did you call sheriff dekker as instructed sir he was on the tennis court but when i gave him your names and told him what had happened he said to give him ten minutes to shower and hed be on his way traylor frowned he called you deputy chief skinner sir from where exactly may i ask edinburgh as in edinborough scotland more or less deputy chief of what well im not a fucking visiting fireman however you put it here skinner snapped irritably he stopped then apologised im sorry son no need to bite your head off im a policeman deputy chief constable and your buddy mr doherty there is he scottish too son of a bitch came a shout from the treatment table does that answer your question lieutenant traylor grinned i guess so tell me the scot asked do you have many incidents involving moored boats not like this one sir im happy to say last thanksgiving i arrested a guy who was drunk and launching fireworks from his boat in a marina complex a little further down the lakeside he told me they were distress flares they may have been but i still charged him with public disorder and breach of halfadozen county ordinances and took him into custody for his own safety and everyone elses that was an exception though most boatowners are responsible people they have to be theyre indulging in a very expensive hobby apart from the capital cost of these cruisers the berths in places like this are expensive and marine insurance doesnt come cheap so what jackson wylie did was exceptional too traylor hesitated cooking on deck on an open fire rather than in an enclosed galley is stupid sir like i said but truth be told its common enough behaviour have you seen many accidents like this one a couple of small fires maybe but nothing on this scale do you know if theres a mrs wylie i dont believe so i heard she died a few years back children none that i know of in that case the executors whoever they are had better pray that the insurance company takes a sympathetic view otherwise the other boat owners and especially that lady with the frazzled hair will sue the ass off the estate if that happens mr wylie better leave a hell of a lot of money to pay off all the claims the lieutenant was looking over skinners shoulder as he spoke towards the door to the marina reception suddenly he stood and came to attention good afternoon sheriff he exclaimed afternoon dwayne said bradford dekker barely glancing at him instead he looked anxiously at the big scot bob how are you hows mr doherty for a second skinners inbuilt cynicism came to the surface and he wondered whether the sheriffs concern was for his friend or for the potential fallout from the fbi if its deputy director had been injured seriously in a sloppily managed facility in his territory im fine he answered joes got a hole in his head but theyre stitching it up right now what happened traylor gave me the outline but there wasnt much more than an outline brad we were walking towards wylies boat when it went up like a fucking candle there wasnt any warning the dcc shook his head not that i can remember all i saw was the fireball he frowned as the recollection of his dizzy spell came back to him for a second he thought he was about to have a recurrence but the feeling passed i cant really swear to anything the neither said joe doherty from the doorway to the treatment room i remember turning to talk to bob then coming round in here was there anyone else on wylies boat traylor sucked in his breath we have no reason to think that there was sir none of the other owners saw anyone else however we wont be able to say for sure until weve been over whats left of the hispaniola you mean its still afloat just and no more they have pretty good firefighting equipment here and the local volunteer crew responded quickly they got the fire under control before she burned down to the waterline doherty raised his eyebrows as he looked at skinner wincing as the gesture tugged at the fresh stitches along the side of his head thats a break eh bob maybe but if it is itll only be a small one and none at all for jackson wylie what the young lieutenant looked at them puzzled tell your technical people to stand down sheriff said doherty to dekker im bringing my best team up from quantico to go over that wreck you think theres a connection to mr grace exclaimed the police chief god preserve my country from elected public officials skinner bellowed of course there is brad they were partners in the same law firm theyre both bloody dead and neither from natural causes his cousins house was a bit like the lady herself all designer chic and soft furnishings on the bits that showed but rocksolid underneath or so mario mcguire had thought until that moment the paula viareggio who sat in the passenger seat as he drew up outside the converted warehouse just off great junction street was someone he had not seen since they were children after her pet rabbit had been eaten by the cat next door she was sobbing quietly into the handkerchief that he had given her not long after he had driven away from murrayfield leaving nana to comfort her daughterinlaw and her daughter were here he said gently not knowing what else to do he reached across and patted her on the shoulder come on ill see you inside okay she mumbled through the handkerchief and then waited unpaulalike again he thought as he walked round the car to open her door she took his arm as they walked towards the building normally he would have driven into the courtyard but it was saturday and he had guessed correctly as it happened that the car park would be full and that maneuvering would have been difficult as they turned in off the street two figures were waiting both young men one of them holding a camera the other what looked like a small tape recorder they turned to look at them and as they did mcguire heard the reporter exclaim thats her before the photographer could fire off a single frame the big detective stepped slightly in front of his cousin dont do that mate he warned the man moved to his right hunting for paula with his lens but he was too slow marios hand shot out grabbed the camera and ripped it from his grasp hey gimme that you cant do that i just did now stop shouting or ill give it back to you piece by piece want me to get the police he is the police said the reporter quietly close to he looked a few years older than the photographer as if he had left his thirtieth birthday behind him on the road as he turned back to the couple the evening sunlight seemed to glint on his designer jacket youre chief inspector mcguire arent you im christian sanderson of the sunday mail id like to talk to miss viareggio about her fathers murder weve just come from mr pringles press conference at fettes are you involved in the investigation chief inspector thats detective superintendent mr sanderson mario told him as he looked at him he could see the front page of the following days sunday tabloid but he knew that if he held back the truth and sanderson found out the headline would be that much bigger and the answers no im not part of the cid team this is a family matter beppe viareggio was my uncle he heard the reporters gasp above the sound of a van roaring past on the street outside mr pringle and mr jay never told us that why should they im as entitled to privacy as the rest of the family aye but now its known can i talk to you about it no mcguire bellowed dont be daft i might be family but i am still a copper and i couldnt tell you anything about my colleagues enquiries suppose i knew anything its been suggested that this was a contract killing said the journalist is that right was mr viareggio involved with the mafia you he heard his cousin standing beside him now begin to explode but he squeezed her arm hard enough to silence her outburst what bright spark suggested that he asked my news desk had a phone call halfanhour ago a guy rang in and told us that it was and did he leave his name and number many a journalist would have looked sheepish at that question mcguire knew but sanderson kept a straight face no it was anonymous surprise surprise the big detective laughed but only for a second right he said abruptly i will give you a statement but its not from the police its from the victims family represented by my cousin and by me as the viareggio trustees my uncle was an honest upright well respected businessman as was his father before him anyone who suggests otherwise in the press or elsewhere will find themselves dealing with our solicitors you give that to your news desk word for word he looked sanderson in the eye now the policemans back this is private property and my cousin is asking you to go fair enough said the journalist but what about my colleagues camera sure here you are he held out the nikon to the photographer pressing the shutter button as he did so and hearing the whirr of the motor drive as the rest of the film inside was exposed by the way he called after the two men as they left dont approach any other members of my family youve been fairly reasonable so far but you dont want to piss me off thanks paula whispered as he took her key and opened the door to the building i dont know what id have done if id come in on my own mario grinned probably the same as you did to that copper on the door last night it would have made a great photograph bloody vultures she muttered nah he countered just guys doing a job what acting on an anonymous phone call no just checking it out the police get anonymous tipoffs all the time do you think we dont follow them up just because the caller doesnt leave his name to tell you the truth cousin he said the thing that worries me about the call to the mail is that it was bloody close to the mark your fathers murder did look like a professional job they stopped at the elevator and he pressed the call button the doors slid open at once i think ill come up with you there are a couple of calls i should make paulas flat was on the top floor not unlike her parents in that the living space was open plan mario had never been inside in the two years she had lived there he looked around taking in the fabrics wound round the pillars the tasteful modern paintings on the walls and the expensive lighting which hung from the high ceiling the sauna business must be good he chuckled she bristled at once not bad thank you very much god you sounded just like my dad there never in my life have i sounded like your dad rest his soul well stop going on about it then i saw a chance to get a wee business for myself and i took it whats wrong with that in principle nothing its the wee business you chose to get into that i dont like you know what these places are paula theyre knocking shops theyre all licensed by the city council she protested which turns a blind eye to what goes on in them because it gets the girls off the streets tell me this do you pay the girls who work there or do they pay you they dont pay me a penny and they get decent wages the punters pay for their saunas cash or credit card what happens between them and the attendants is their business but i do not take a cut she stepped up to him her dark eyes flashing with real anger ill tell you what i do though i insist that they use condoms and i make them have monthly blood tests not just for the clap but for drug use if someones working just to feed a habit she wont get through the door if someones working to feed her kids shes welcome thats very moral cousin very moral he flared back his gaze as fiery as hers youre a madam with a heart of gold but what about the guys whose kids go short because they spend their dough getting blown on your massage tables what about them eh would you rather have them prowling the streets looking for it better they pay for it otherwise even some of those kids youre talking about might not be safe you he stopped himself short as a vision of his wife filled his mind until then he had been at pains to keep it at bay but in the heat of the argument it managed to sneak under his defences paula turned away from him lets call a truce mario just make your phone calls then you can go fine he agreed but tell me this did uncle beppe know about those places she paused i never told him she answered you only know because youre a clever bastard copper but my mum doesnt know nor does nana mario smiled at her the latter goes without saying ill tell you this too if she ever finds out shell boil you down for soup thats your hold on me she grinned back her olive skin had a weary yellowish tinge whove you going to phone anyway he walked over to a big soft armchair sat down and picked up the mockfifties telephone that lay on a table beside it listen in he made two calls the first was to greg jay to advise him of the anonymous tipoff to the sunday mail the second was to john hunter a trusted veteran freelance journalist to whom he repeated the statement that he had given to christian sanderson there he said as he put the big black handset back in its cradle johnll put the word around if that bastards called any other papers he wont go unanswered miau anui she stood in front of him laying her hands flat on his broad chest running them up under the lapels of his blazer raising herself slightly on her toes she kissed him quickly on the lips then again longer then a third time drawn out her tongue flicking his teeth at last he gripped her by the elbows and held her away from him hey he whispered what was that for it was for not being such a bad guy after all dont tell anyone else though i promise would you take me to bed please cousin weve been over this before and i was single then we have indeed she murmured pressing her body against him and i wasnt as drunk as you either you do owe me one you know there is absolutely nothing worse for a girls morale than when a guy fucks her and cant remember it next morning unless its when theyre in bed together and he doesnt fuck her at all so which was it then he asked eventually it was a question he had put off asking for years actually she gave a deep throaty chuckle truth be told she looked up at him with laughter in her eyes it was more a case of me fucking you big boy or as i remember very big boy she slid her right hand down searching for him he did nothing to stop her oh yes she hissed thats the fella all right she gave him a quick squeeze then slid her arms around his waist come on find out what you snorted and mumbled your way through last time who was bridget by the way he frowned she was the barmaid in my local why thats what you kept calling me she took his hand in hers and turned pulling him towards a door off the big pillared room he stepped into her bedroom but then tugged her back towards him dont play games paula all right we gave each other one when we were youngsters and im sorry i wasnt more up for it her laugh cut across him what do you mean even in your sleep you were as up for it as you could get maybe so but it isnt going to happen again and you know it listen its been a hellish twentyfour hours i know why dont you just have a big drink and get some sleep she looked up at him and he saw that her eyes were glazed with tears once more just stay with me mario please i wont threaten your virtue if you dont want me to but dont go i cant get the sight of my father out of my mind whenever i close my eyes i can see him lying there with his arse sticking up in the air and the back of his head blown out youll see that whether im here or not love so will i i wish i could tell you different but youll see it for a while when someones murdered theres usually more than one victim she seemed to slump against him its not just that though she cried into his chest what if there is something about the business or about dad that we dont know what if it passes to us now youre a policeman no ones going to threaten you but what about me what about me i dont want to be next bob skinner and joe doherty stood on the gangway beside jackson wylies mooring looking at what was left of his boat all of the superstructure and the deck had gone save for the twisted metal framework of some of the fittings below virtually all that was left was a black soggy mess where the firefighters hoses had pounded the blaze into extinction the exception was a rectangle ofdayglo yellow a tarpaulin laid by the sheriffs deputies over the remains of leopold graces former partner well bob asked doherty what do you think was it a stray spark from the barbecue and its hooray and up she rises its possible the big scot murmured so im told are interstellar travel miracle cures for terminal illnesses and peace in the balkans as a friend said to me the other day its also conceivable that motherwell football and athletic club could win the scottish premier league in my lifetime but i dont believe that any of those things is actually going to happen any more than i believe that this was a fucking accident if our theory of a link between the murders of leo wilkins and garrett is correct then that thing lying under the sheriffs groundsheet done to a cinder is number four youre not going to tell me any different are you no sir i am not wed better find out all we can about him quick as we can how much do you know you met the guy after all skinner shook his head i know nothing about him yes we met one time at my fatherinlaws but we didnt exchange life stories did mr grace ever talk about him very little he mentioned once that he had brought wylie into the law firm back in the early seventies and that he had appointed him as senior partner on his retirement on a sort of caretaker basis a safe pair of hands while the younger guys were gaining more experience how old was he about ten years younger than leo id have guessed hed have been looking towards retirement himself now married widowed his wife died a few years back when we spoke he mentioned a son in florida a journalist with the miami herald doherty touched his head wound gingerly gotta take another painkiller he muttered taking a small bottle from his pocket lets go back to the office i cant take these damn things without water they walked silently along the gangway eventually the american gave a heavy sigh guess id better break into the guys weekends to do what asked skinner they cant make any progress on garrett or wilkins till monday were on the ground here we can get dekkers men moving on this new investigation and we can do a couple of things ourselves such as well eventually we can sit down and think but first we should find mrs thorpe wylies secretary we need to find out who might have known that hed be on that boat brad dekkers digging up her address for us yeah who knows maybe she can tell us a lot more than that she worked for both him and grace maybe she can tell us what this is all about the scot grunted i hope not for her sake if she could i have a hell of a feeling were going to find her dead come on take your pill and lets get moving when she saw the woman standing in the hall holding a blue leather overnight bag maggie could not keep a flash of surprise from crossing her face but it was suppressed almost at once to be replaced by a welcoming smile mario stood behind his cousin ive invited paula to stay the night he explained to his wife shes still a bit shaken up nanas got a full house with mum and auntie sophia and violas is full of weans so shes best here of course she agreed at once standing aside to allow them to pass into the living room come on in mario put paulas bag in the spare room and stick a sheet on the bed while youre there the duvets okay i think yes boss we got enough grub for three or will i get a takeaway no weve got plenty i raided marks and spencers food hall this afternoon big time i decided we should invite the whole family for lunch tomorrow ive spoken to nana and stanley and its all set up just as well youre here paula itll save you a drive tomorrow she looked at her husband thats okay with you isnt it sure it is man u are on telly tomorrow afternoon thatll keep the kids quiet paula laughed softly and their father and their uncle maggie she asked can i use your bathroom of course down the hall first on the left your rooms the one beyond fine ill drop my bag off myself while im there maggie waited until she heard the bathroom door close then gave mario a long appraising look youre being very solicitous towards your cousin arent you i thought you didnt even like her no thats not true i dont trust her he said and i dont like some of the things shes done but we were kids together shes family and shes scared scared paula he nodded even tough girls other than you my dear can get their knickers in a twist sometimes some nutter phoned the papers saying that beppes murder was a mafia hit paulas afraid that might be true and that she might be next and might she i doubt it but the shooting was premeditated thats for sure it was efficient and there was nothing random about it and might you have something to worry about she asked quietly mario put his hands on her shoulders and looked her in the eye im a police detective superintendent love and on top of that im quite a formidable bastard whos going to come after me honestly i think paulas worrying unnecessarily once shes had a day or two to get over the shock of seeing her father like that shell come to realise it somewhere theres a reason for uncle beppes murder but i cant see it having anything to do with the business have you spoken to your mother not about that anyhow i dont have to shed never have tolerated any nonsense within the trust and shes too good a businesswoman for beppe ever to have been able to hide anything from her maggie dropped into an armchair this thing seems to have exposed a big gap in my knowledge she mused aloud theres a lot of stuff youve never really told me isnt there mario he looked at her from beneath raised eyebrows such as your papas will for a start and your place on the trust in succession to christina he shrugged as if it was no matter i didnt want to think about it myself i suppose and youve kept a couple of things from me remember she flinched for a second but ignored his comment okay but theres more than that i have a rough idea of the familys interests but no more than that exactly what does this trust control it was paula who answered her as she came back into the room we own a classic mix of scotsitalian businesses she said theyre up and down east central scotland in strong retail centres there are ten cafes doing tea and coffee catering each selling our ownbrand icecream which we also supply to cooperative food stores then we have five takeaways two in edinburgh one in dundee one in st andrews and one in falkirk originally they were big chippies with sittingin areas but when fish prices started to rise we started doing pizzas and roast chickens as well and took the seats out my dad wanted to do kebabs as well but jicai snui my mum said no because theyd stink the shops out there are eight delicatessens in the chain in edinburgh dundee st andrews dunfermline dalkeith and north berwick we specialise in imported italian food and wines from suppliers that papa viareggio set up years ago thats all the retail side alongside it theres our property holdings we own our own premises and in several cases the buildings in which theyre located the other shops and the flats above thats the side of the business thats grown in recent years stans started making investment purchases outside our traditional areas of operations hes been buying office property around edinburgh outside the city bypass with good solid tenants and the potential for expansion stan maggie asked surprised yes said mario you know stan coia violas husband hes a surveyor by profession and he manages the property side i thought uncle beppe ran everything he had overall control sure but he had help aunt sophia looks after the cafes viola supervises the takeaways stan like i said handles property and paula although she works in the stockbridge deli is general manager of them all they all reported back to the trustees she looked at him her mouth hanging open slightly i knew hardly any of this i didnt have a clue that stan and viola were in the business too and now youre the senior trustee i didnt ask for it love honest nor did i expect that it would happen for a while possibly not till i was ready to retire from the police force and how are you going to handle it maybe by appointing a proxy i dont know thats something paula and i are going to have to sort out between us but not tonight eh there was a tired plea in his cousins voice to the immense relief of skinner and doherty mrs lucinda thorpe came to the door of her small suburban buffalo home alive and well if slightly hysterical she was a tall sturdily built middleaged black woman with an imposing presence and so the white kleenex with which she dabbed at her pufty eyes seemed entirely out of place this is not a good time to be calling gentlemen she told them in a strong deep voice we know mrs thorpe said the scot but its necessary i guess youve seen a news bulletin on television mrs thorpe shook her head no but i had a call from my husband hes at his golf club and he saw something there it really is true oh my poor mr wylie my friend told me that the police are saying that he lit a barbecue on the deck of his cruiser boat and it blew up thats all true but what they still have to prove is that the explosion was actually caused by a spark from the charcoal her eyes narrowed slightly and let me guess you dont think it was she paused who are you guys anyway youre cops but you aint the local police thats for sure no were not mr doherty here is with the fbi as he spoke the american pulled out a laminated identity card from his jacket and held it up for the woman to see lets call me a consultant in his investigation im a detective from scotland im also leo graces soninlaw ah said the secretary flicking through her memory banks the guys mr wylie was meeting so youre miss sarahs husband yeah i heard she married an older guy skinner heard joe doherty stifle a chuckle but i heard it didnt work out its working fine now i promise you look can we come in we need to talk to you she held the door open for them and ushered them indoors through the living room and out into a sunny back garden complete with a small bluetiled swimming pool she pointed to it that was a personal gift from mr grace when he retired nice man what happened to him and his poor wife was just awful and now with mr wylie she paused as they settled into white plastic chairs set around a table of course she murmured you guys think theres a connection lets just say that were blessed with the cynicism for which the fbi is famous doherty answered mrs thorpe looked at him almost for the first time her eyes drawn to the gauze that had been taped to the side of his head over the stitches what happened to you she asked i got a shade too close to mr wylies boat when it blew up it was as well i was with this big old guy here he hauled my ass out of there you were actually there when it happened yup her curiosity broke through her shock so what did it look like like the biggest bonfire night youve ever seen skinner answered mrs thorpe he continued over her puzzlement after agent kosinski arranged our meeting with mr wylie who would have known about it just about anyone in the firm she told him yesterday we had our monthly lunch for partners and associates and mr wylie mentioned there that the fbi wanted to talk to him about mr graces murder there were around thirtyfive people present so he might as well have run an ad on television doherty gave a soft moan superb he muttered ah but he didnt say that it had been arranged the deputy directors face brightened mrs thorpe do you know if mr wylie had been in touch with mr grace recently depends what you mean by recently the deer hunting trip was in january but im not aware of their having spoken since then of course that doesnt mean that they hadnt i dont know absolutely everything that my boss did as well as his office engagement book he kept a private diary on that laptop thing he had laptop skinner repeated yes sir an apple mac ibook hes had it since the beginning of the year it has a plumcoloured casing and a builtin modem everywhere he went he took that damn thing with him would he have had it with him on the boat today for sure the scot looked at doherty wilkins had a laptop remember it was stolen i sure do remember without another word the deputy director took out his cellphone and called the fbi lab alan he said quietly i want you to contact the team we have heading for buffalo and ask them to look specifically for the remains of a laptop computer as he replaced the pocket phone he turned back to skinner did leo grace have a laptop i wouldnt know the dcc paused sarah used to get emails from him his address is in the book on our computer at home but theres a desktop in his house down in his den so he probably used that still its possible that he had a laptop as well its possible mrs thorpe asked the american the names we mentioned wilkins and garrett agent kosinski told us you were going to look through mr graces files for references to them have you done that yes sir i did that yesterday afternoon and i told mr kosinski the result there is no mention of either of those gentlemen in mr graces papers theres nothing on the firms computer files either i ran a check on them at the same time i even asked mr wylie if he had heard of either of them he just shrugged his shoulders and gave me a blank look in that case that completes our business thank you for your time and our condolences over your loss he stood with a sideways glance at skinner bob yes but theres just one thing you mentioned a hunting trip earlier she smiled and her pleasant ebony face seemed to light up sure the deer hunt that was back in january like i said mr grace and mr wylie decided to take themselves off down to the appalachians for a week blowing the hell out of those poor animals didnt your fatherinlaw mention it to you i cant say that he did never mind thanks anyway she showed them out and down the path to their car as they stood on the sidewalk doherty took out his cellphone and dialled in a number zak good something i need to know was there a note on the garrett inventory of a missing computer a laptop there was excellent thanks he ended the call and nodded to skinner the kid confirmed it garrett had one too as he closed the passenger door of the saloon the scot turned to his friend joe theres something wrong with mrs thorpes story leo grace was a korean war hero he saw a lot of action it affected him so much that after he got back he never picked up a gun for the rest of his life he detested the national rifle association and i never met anyone who was more strongly opposed to blood sports jlcau smul no nicking way did he go shooting deer in the appalachians or anywhere else so i wonder what he did in that backwoods week maybe sarahll know when she gets here monday maybe roll on the day doherty smiled do i take it from that that youre not looking forward to a quiet sunday in buffalo you take it right well thats good because i have another day trip planned for you we are heading my friend for the show that never ends our nations capital its time we took a look at the politics of this thing the gathering was sombre even ryan and david were subdued although they were barely old enough to comprehend the meaning of death maggie wondered if they were simply behaving as instructed or if their mothers nearparalysing grief had scared them into silence she asked their father as much as they stood together in the conservatory salad plates in hand looking out on to the mcguires neat and orderly garden stan coia sighed its a bit of both really they were well warned not to upset their grandma or nana or anyone else by screaming and shouting like they usually do but the way violas taken it aye youre right the poor wee guys are frightened shes excitable at the best of times but this id to get the doctor to her you know the emergency callout service id to get them out in the middle of the night after mario came by to tell me what had happened the poor lass she was hyperventilating i thought she was having an asthma attack and you can die from them how is she now maggie looked back into the living room where viola stood blackeyed whitefaced beside her aunt christina doped up to the eyeballs if you really want to know it was touch and go whether she came today but i managed to persuade her that her mother and her nana needed her his eyes flicked quickly around the room the viareggio women are a funny lot you know you must see that too as an inlaw like me theres old nana at the top of the tree if you leave out old auntie josefina who doesnt know whether its breakfast time or easter and never did from what beppe said then look at aunt christina and at paula theyre just like her the pair of them big attractive women very feminine both of them but as tough as teak underneath on the other hand theres viola and her mother complete contrasts to the other three nice and goodhearted but softcentred where the others are hard you could explain it away as coming from sophias side the rossis are a funny lot her father was a lapsed catholic a real outcast apparently only you cant because its not just the women that are mixed up i mean god rest poor beppes soul but where the hell did he come from i never knew papa viareggio he was dead years before i met viola but from everything ive heard he was some man yet he and nana managed to produce beppe as well as christina i mean he wasnt a bad man and he didnt squander the family fortunes but he was weak and if he hadnt had paula and me and aunt christina around him he might have as it was that business with the franchising when he cancelled it after his father died that was a fiasco its funny isnt it stan mused unknowingly giving voice to maggies own thoughts the viareggio clans a real matriarchy and yet its set up so that ultimately theres always a man in control its a real italian thing isnt it there was papa then there was beppe and now theres mario whos a throwback to his old grandfather so they say he grinned at maggie his eyes distorted by the thick lenses of his spectacles genetics eh a load of crap she smiled with him looking over at her husband who was installing ryan and david in front of the television set in the far corner of the living room what about you stan she asked him do you see yourself as part of the family or still as an outsider as i do for all that marios done to make me feel like one of them im a wage slave pure and simple he answered at once i dont know if id even be that if nana hadnt insisted on it okay ive got my chartered surveying practice and the viareggio trust is my most important longterm client but thats it more than that when im ready to chuck it thats all my boys will have assuming that theyre interested in coming into my business the way that ryan talks about his uncle mario and his aunt maggie i think hes halfway to being a detective already i resent that a bit i have to confess not about him being a policeman he added quickly but i resent the fact that the way the old mans inheritance was set up my lads will miss out who are the beneficiaries of the trust nana christina beppe and sophia and their children theres no right of succession after that for all that he was a very clever and successful man old papa didnt or couldnt think more than two generations ahead i see what you mean maggie conceded but it would have been very difficult for him to do more as i see it he trusted beppe overseen by christina to carry the business on for a bit until mario and paula were ready to take over they were his real heirs those two and youre right the italian in him made sure that there would be a man in overall control theyre the future of the business those two and there are no restrictions on them other than looking after nana and aunt josefina they can consolidate they can expand or if they choose they can liquidate sell the bloody lot and distribute the proceeds ill promise you this though stan whatever happens mario will take his nephews interests into account and im sure paula will go along with that too she has no kids yet and neither do we nor will we unless we adopt so your boys could have quite a rosy future thats good to know thanks mind you that assumes that any of us have a future i saw the sunday mail front page today what is this mafia stuff maggie i know that uncle beppe used to joke about it all the time but should we take it seriously no more than beppe used to take it himself it was always a joke with him even if it did wear thin from time to time there is no organised crime in edinburgh not any more we finally broke that a couple of years ago when the last of the big drugs barons got sent down for most of the rest of his life even when it did exist it wasnt italian what if this came from outside edinburgh the deli side of the business has all sorts of italian suppliers no it doesnt we went over this with paula last night the deli suppliers are all wholesalers and most of them are public companies or part of public groups the business deals with them and nobody else it doesnt pay off middlemen and it never has there are no supply problems just now and no arguments with anyone over prices like most businesses the biggest threat comes from the vat man so who killed old beppe then if it wasnt gangsters wed have told you if we knew now stop fantasising off you go and watch the game with the rest of the boys she glanced at the women gathered around the table ive got to stop nana from pouring any more chianti into your wife god knows how itll mix with the sedatives as it transpired the combination proved as effective as any sleeping pill viola was put to bed by her mother and slept solidly until seven thirty when stan decreed that the boys had to go home the others decided to leave at the same time sophia and christina going back to titlajlj stiul murrayfield with nana and paula her courage restored returning to her warehouse apartment in leith uttering threats against the person of any journalist who might be lying in wait for her as soon as they had gone mario began to clear away the debris left over from the extended lunch he had just loaded the last of the crockery into the dishwasher and selected a programme when he noticed through the open kitchen door that his wife was seated at the dining table making her way through a stack of papers what the hells that he called to her as he strolled back towards her stuff i brought home from the office yesterday its the first chance ive had to look at it bloody hell he laughed youre not turning into manny english are you hardly its just that i feel that while im filling his shoes i should try to do things his way like spending every weekend shovelling shit no she said severely not every weekend only those when i find myself giving shortnotice lunch parties for your family we wont make a habit of it i promise anyway i dont have any more uncles maggie winced sorry that was a bit crass i was glad to do it honestly and i think it did everyone a bit of good apart from viola that is nana fed the best part of a bottle of chianti into her before i could stop her stan could have stopped her before you did mario pointed out but he wasnt bothered true i dont think its his style though he loves his boys but i get the impression that he and viola arent all that happy together theyre fine youre not seeing either of them at their best thats all anyway a couple of drinks and a few hours sleep were exactly what she was needing trust nana to spot it too oh yes trust her she paused paula seems to have got herself together aye shes fine ive asked jay to keep an eye on her place but she doesnt need to know that you dont really think shes in any danger do you no but i know a bloke that won the lottery last year you can never be quite certain he saw her frown who did it mario who could have i dont know but my uncle beppe always had an eye for the ladies its got him into bother more than once i just wonder he paused as his eye was caught by a sheet of paper on the table here whats that she handed it to him its the missing person poster on my dear father oh shit he muttered sorry i forgot to mention something hes grown a beard since this was taken this isnt a current likeness he laid the flyer on the table picked up a pen darkened the jaw and top lip on the monochrome photograph and handed it back to her maggie gazed at it hes still an evillooking bastard ill have a revision issued though she laid it on top of her out pile then hesitated thats funny looking like that he reminds me of someone but who the hell is it search me love nobody i know thats for sure damn as he spoke he was interrupted by a distant muffled tone whats that his wife asked my mobile i left it in my jacket i must have forgotten to switch it off he strode through to their bedroom his wardrobe door was open and as he approached the ringing tone grew louder he snatched the cellphone from the pocket in which it lay and pressed the receive button the voice at the other end was light teasing and very female mr superintendent it began this is ivy uhh ivy brennan georges neighbour remember oh yes what can i do for you has he shown up no its nothing to do with him i saw the sunday mail today about your uncle then dont talk to me call the leith office and ask for the incident room ask for superintendent jay tell him i said you should call no she said firmly i need to see you now the thing is i might know who killed him he hesitated picturing the dolllike girl in his minds eye where are you he asked at last my place stay there ill be half an hour oh and by the way youd better not be kidding me on he took his jacket from its hanger and walked back through to the living room wondering how much he should tell maggie and in particular whether he should tell her that he was going back to see her fathers neighbour what if she wanted to come with him to see the place where he lived would that be good for her his worries were academic let me guess she exclaimed as he appeared in the doorway you have to go and see an informant its okay i know by now what it means when that phone rings when youre off duty you might as well ive still got a bit to do here he smiled at her more gratefully than she realised never mind love once neil gets bedded into the sb job itll all pass to him and how will louise take to that i wonder he leaned over and kissed her on the forehead with the same understanding youve shown over the years he whispered get out of here she laughed slapping him on the shoulder just dont be late thats all its like stepping into history joe said skinner a man not normally impressed by his surroundings especially if they were late twentieth century and architect designed but ugly or not the watergate building was something else having been the centrepiece of the biggest international political scandal of his life thats all it is now doherty told him the democratic national committee aint here any more its on south capitol street i just thought youd like to see where all that started head on down there max please yes sir the deputy directors driver nodded and slipped the anonymous black car into gear the scot had never seen his old friend on his home patch before he sensed the difference at once he was more formal and had seemed almost to grow in stature from the moment their flight had touched down an impression confirmed by the deference of the chauffeur when he had picked them up they moved south away from the heart of government and came quickly into south capitol street should you be seen going in here skinner asked with there being a republican administration these days ahh shit its sunday afternoon look around you it was true for any capital city the streets were exceptionally quiet there seemed almost to be more tour buses than cars anyhow congress has been gop for years doherty added its only the white house thats changed hands but suppose this was a weekday thered be nothing exceptional about me going to meet with rusty i do it fairly often just as i keep in touch with the republican party organisation who rusty savage hes the guy were meeting hes deputy chief of staff of the dnc organisation and hes been around for years almost as long as me does he normally work weekends when theres an election yes he does but not right now hes here because i asked him to meet us in his office the car drew up at the entrance to south capitol street and the two passengers stepped out sunday or not there was a receptionist on duty in the foyer she recognised doherty at once good afternoon sir she greeted him with the same clear show of respect that skinner had seen from max the driver at the airport how good to see you again mr savage is in his office if youd like to go on up in the elevator ill let him know youre on your way rusty savage was waiting for them as the lift doors opened doherty greeted him warmly and introduced his companion as they walked towards an office across the hall its an honour to meet you sir said the american taking the scot by surprise i know who you are and i know what you did at that conference a couple of years back skinner looked at him a touch warily wondering how much he knew most of the detail of that incident had been kept away from the media its okay savage grinned i heard the whole story at the time from the former white house chief of staff the man himself is in new york for the weekend otherwise i know hed have wanted to meet you he might not have wanted to hear what we want to talk about though muttered doherty yeah what is that joe you were damned mysterious when you called me i had to be i know that the bureau isnt bugging your communications but i cant be a hundred per cent sure about anyone else wow savage whistled he looked around his modest office as he closed the door behind him you can relax in here though we have these offices swept for devices once a month theres nothing recorded here unless we want it to be sit down guys he poured three mugs of black coffee from a jug by his walnut desk and handed one each to his visitors now whats so redhot that its come between me and my sunday golf game a double homicide the deputy director answered a week or so back in the adirondacks national park in new york state leopold grace and his wife said rusty savage at once i heard about it tragic altogether that such an eminent couple should die like that mr grace was a democrat from way back and a personal friend of the former first family too matter of fact i had a call from one of the new senators aides a couple of days back asking me if i could let her know about funeral arrangements still how come the bureau is involved and whats your interest mr skinner mr grace was bobs fatherinlaw surprise flashed across the officials face ahh he exclaimed so thats why youre here when joe said he was bringing you along i didnt ask why i just assumed you were on some sort of an exchange visit he looked back at doherty that doesnt answer my first question though joe how come you guys have picked up on this the man wasnt a public figure any more although he was a former chairman of the new york state democratic committee and his word was still the law when he offered an opinion on something or someone do the names bartholomew wilkins and sander garrett mean anything to you savage leaned back in his chair sipping his coffee as he thought bart wilkins he murmured at last chicago illinois i think he was head of a law firm like mr grace and retired like mr grace but his involvement in active democratic politics ended way back when governor dukakis was adopted as candidate to fight bush the elder in wilkins thought it was a disastrous choice he was right as it happened and withdrew from the illinois party executive sander garrett yes that name rings a bell i remember meeting him in los angeles a while back probably in the mideighties he wasnt a califomian though he was from nevada as i recall and involved with the party as a volunteer fund raiser doherty nodded thats very interesting let me throw another name at you jackson wylie leo graces former partner savage replied at once he worked for him in the attorney generals office nearly forty years ago and followed him into the law firm in buffalo hes still an active democrat and a member of the state committee i think youll find hes less active from now on the deputy director drawled with a trace of a wry smile playing at one corner of his mouth how come whos upset him the guy who blew up his cruiser yesterday afternoon with him in it hes dead my team confirmed this morning that the explosion was no accident dead as a rucking doornail rusty and so are wilkins and garrett they were both murdered in their homes within the last month their killings ok like they happened in the course of burglaries but they nla nro hits both of them as were the graces deaths the wylie homicide wasnt disguised as anything there was enough explosive one of his cabin lockers to have made a goodsized hole in the battleship new jersey so thats why were here my friend we have a problem and so have theres someone out there whos making serious inroads into the roll of registered democratic voters if he isnt stopped you could start to run out of them how can i help were looking for connections said skinner we have several already from the backgrounds on the victims gathered by the police officers who originally investigated their killings we know that these men were all active members of your party we know that they were all lawyers we know that they all worked in washington in the sixties during the kennedy administration but thats as far as it goes theres something we dont know something that links all four men together something thats got them killed theres nothing in the files of my fatherinlaws old firm we have people asking similar questions about wilkins and garrett but if theres nothing in buffalo theres unlikely in my view at least to be anything in chicago or las vegas so were here youre the end of the road more or less we need to go as far back as we can into your records to see whether they got involved in something through the party thats led to this the democrat official took a deep breath and pushed himself up from his chair he walked over to the window and looked out over the city back up towards the seat of national government you tried the state department he asked or the attorney generals office they were questions that skinner himself had not asked but doherty answered of course i have theres nothing that helps us savage turned back to face them in that case guys im sorry but im dont think im going to be able to help you either he paused you are correct to assume that we do store biographic material on our activists usually going back to the earliest days of their work within our movement however these days we keep very few longterm paper records just about everything we have is on computer last week when i heard about mr graces death i went into our mainframe and called up his file it wasnt there i asked our head of information technology what had happened to it he looked into it and reported that it had been erased weve lost all the bios beginning with the letter g and all of the was too we interrogated all our users but nobody admitted to doing it accidentally or otherwise his conclusion although he couldnt be certain was that someone had hacked in and done it he frowned down at them looks like now we know for sure this is a mistake he whispered to no one as he stood on the dark landing he had knocked on george rosewells door just in case there had been no answer but he had decided against taking another unauthorised look inside he had almost gone back downstairs but instead against his instincts he had rung ivy brennans doorbell hello mr detective she was taller than she had been the first time she had looked up at him in that doorway he glanced down and saw that she was wearing thicksoled shoes with high heels she was better dressed too in a closefitting blue dress and this time there was none of the waif about her come in she said holding the door wide for him are you going out somewhere he asked as he followed her through to the living room no i was expecting someone so i thought id get dolled up for him who rufuss dad no thicko i was expecting you now listen ivy she laughed a sound as gentle as wind chimes fanned by an opening door dont get all heavy on me now i could have stayed the way i was no makeup and all smelly like the first time you came here would you have preferred that he smiled in spite of himself no this versions more to my taste oh she murmured turning and stepping close to him do you fancy a taste then ah christ mario exclaimed i knew i shouldnt have come here ah but you did though in spite of all your better judgement you did his grin was gone he glared down at her you know fuck all about my uncle do you girl i know that hes dead because i saw it in the mail today thats how i knew he was your uncle because youre mentioned in the story you and your cousin paula i know her though she owns a sauna round the corner from here and along the road a bit mcguire gasped with surprise are you on the game certainly not she laughed in a tone of mock protestation im a good mother ill have you know and im not a junkie ive met many a working girl who was a good mother he told her as for being a junkie youre acting like youre on something he seized her wrists and turned them looking for needle tracks along the flat of her pale forearms and in the folds of her elbows but they were unmarked when he let her go she took a pace back from him and hoisted up the blue dress showing him the inside of her thighs dyou want to check there as well she challenged dyou want to check anywhere else she slid the dress higher she was wearing a gstring but he could tell that she was blonde for real just chuck that he warned her or im out that door right now are you really she reached behind her and in a flash pulled down a long zip and wriggled her shoulders the dress fell in a circle at her feet see not a needle mark anywhere her tiny body was almost classic in its proportions a little wide in the hips perhaps after rufus but otherwise perfect small budlike pink nipples seemed to wink up at him want to make certain she slid her thumbs inside the black thong and began to roll it down suddenly he was aware that every muscle in his body seemed to be tensed he could feel them bunched under his shirt and jeans he could feel them and more with an effort of will he turned and headed for the door okay she called after him okay ill behave myself just dont go he stopped in the doorway get dressed then im doing it im doing it there when he turned her back was to him zip me up he did as she asked drawing the dress closed and tight to her one thing you should know about me he told her i love my wife anyone who harms her or who even threatens it in any way is in big big trouble understand me she nodded yes thats why you want to find george isnt it he hurt her before he went away now hes in bother with you is he ever so you havent found him not a trace hes either gone back to portugal or hes in the water of leith i dont think the fish would fancy him and then she grinned up at him you have to admit though i did give it a good try did you like the quick flash just a bit the girlwaifwoman look was back in her eyes somehow he found it disturbing as if the poisoned apple had been offered and he had begun to reach for it a work of art ivy he said acidly but a bit small for me never mind though one day youll make some guy a fine desk ornament ohh we do have a way with the insults dont we although thats not what that lump in your jeans was saying a minute or so back still far be it from me to come between a man and his wife want a coffee no thanks but if you have any mineral water id take some she nodded and went through to her small kitchen returning with a bottle of san pellegrino and two tumblers thats how i got to know paula by the way she said holding up the bottle as he took one of the glasses i shop in her deli i go in there quite a lot with rufus she likes him shes very fond of children shes very fond of men he grunted but im not so sure about kids she is take my word for it anyway shes my pal she told me about the sauna thats how i knew where it was and thats where i saw your uncle you really did know him mario exclaimed that wasnt just rubbish well i wouldnt exactly say i knew him i did exaggerate a bit when i phoned you i was passing the place one day and i saw him the door was open and he was standing framed in it he looked at her doubtfully are you sure it was him beppe had nothing to do with those businesses there was no reason for him to go there most men go to places like that for a pretty good reason not beppe im pretty sure ivy assured him that was a good photograph in the mail and when i saw him he was dressed much the same okay you saw him once but how does that tell you who killed him i didnt just remember him because i saw him like i told you he was standing there and he was having a screaming argument with someone beppe he wasnt the screaming type he was when i saw him and who was he screaming at ah well i laid that on a bit thick too when i called you the other person was inside the place i couldnt see who it was and i couldnt hear their voice other than that it was raised but i can tell you this your uncle was shouting at whoever it was as if he wanted to kill them if the other person was as mad with him as he was with them all you have to do is find him well sauce what do you have for me this morning weekend reports maam the probationer replied the front desk said that mr english normally checks them over first thing on a monday morning ill bet he does thought maggie just put them in my intray she said leaning back in her chair and looking up at the young man did you have a good one then haddock stared at her bewildered good what maam weekend son did you have a good weekend oh that yes maam it was okay went out wi my girlfriend on saturday like watched the fitba on telly yesterday just ordinary like what about you maam he asked emboldened mine family stuff mainly ahh he said i suppose he paused they were saying downstairs about your husbands uncle like that must have been an awful shock for him she grimaced a bullet in the back of the head usually is haddock gasped at her response and maggie saw him go pale sorry son she exclaimed that was a bit blunt but you do know what you can come across in this job dont you aye maam the probationer replied but you dont do you at least no very often potentially every day you pull on that uniform youre going to see something very unpleasant the second week i was out on patrol i was called to a traffic accident out on queensferry road three young girls all pissed in somebodys daddys rover all pissed like i said and all very dead i picked one kids head off the road and put it back in the car then i was sick in the gutter two weeks later my partner and i answered a call to a flat in morningside one of the neighbours had complained about the smell as it happened it was coming from an old lady whod died of a heart attack in front of her electric fire about a week or so earlier we had to break into the house i dont want to sound hard sauce but if youre squeamish about this job youd better get it out of your system have you been out in a patrol car yet or on the beat not yet maam how long did you say youve been with the force four weeks now maam its about time you had some outside experience then ill arrange it with inspector wright yes maam thank you haddock left looking significantly more serious than when he had arrived maggie shook her head sighed then drew her intray across the desk towards her she had just picked up the first of the weekend reports from the oxgangs police office when there was a faint knock on her door come in she called but it was opening as she spoke chief superintendent dan pringles lugubrious form stepped into the room hello sir she exclaimed surprised aw come on maggie the new head of cid protested dont start wi the sir bit not after pouring me into a taxi last friday night i hope that sitting in for manny english isnt turning you into a book operator too sorry clan she said but you might be right our new accs a clever soandso you know ive only been doing the job for a couple of days and parttime at that but already its got me thinking like management ive just had a probationer in here the lad whos acting as my runner the boys nice and willing and all the rest but doesnt understand what the jobs really about or what it can involve so youve told him too right im going to make bloody sure he sees what it can involve too young sauce has potential but hes got to get his feet on the floor and his head out of the clouds sauce nickname bet you manny english doesnt know his nickname pringle murmured maggie shrugged her shoulders so so for all that hes the very model of a modem divisional commander thats something missing in him guys like him think they have to be aloof from the people under them ill bet you know the christian name of everyone in this office she thought for a moment i probably do she conceded most of the nicknames too manny doesnt though i used to sit in this very office so i worked with him and i know that for a fact hes a decent man you cant fault his motives and he never puts a foot wrong but he doesnt know his officers hed never call your lad sauce to his face or behind his back i doubt if he even knows that the chiefs called proud jimmy or that bob skinner and andy martin used to be batman and robin or that you and mario are he stopped short as he saw her eyes widen oh yes she said trying not to smile and what do they call my husband and me behind our backs pringle grunted as if you dont know you two are dark and lois to just about the entire force apart from manny english i must tell mario to stop wearing that bloody cape maggie retorted anyway she continued all that and willie haggertys deviousness aside whats brought you in here the big middleaged detective tugged his moustache im the new head of cid he answered blandly i can come in here any time i like i will too she leaned back and waited ach it being my first day in the job and all that i thought id get out and about i did think about calling in all the divisional cid heads for a roundtable session but then i thought better of it nothing against andy but im not going to run things quite like he did ill still have the odd headquarters meeting but not every monday maybe one every three months something like that no my idea is that ill come to see you rather than the other way around i figure i might learn more that way if someones got a problem he or she might be more likely to come out with it in a onetoone session than across the big table with everyone listening in he looked her in the eye youre the newest in the rank but dont tell me you havent picked up on the politics of it every one of us at those meetings knew that andy wasna going to be in that job long hell be a chief constable by the time hes forty maybe in dumfries and galloway maybe somewhere else he was bound to move on up the ladder why didnt he get the job here us humble mortals can only guess at that maggie mine would be that it didnt fit in with bob skinners plans but youd know more about that having worked for the big man anyhow those monday sessions used to amuse me watching certain people grinding their axes and jockeying for position fancying themselves up as andys successor big mcgrigor he was near retirement so he didna give a stuff as for me i thought id been passed over for good when andy got the job then i was sure of it when i was shifted down to the borders the others though they all had ambitions and two of them jay and michaels dont even like each other they never offered an opinion they said what they hoped andy wanted to hear thats not true of brian mackie rose protested even brian was careful before he stuck his neck out the chief superintendent laughed suddenly god it was funny though when you came into the meetings that changed the whole thing around wi you being so close to the boss and everything when you were promoted straight into the central division job greg andwillie were really rattled i cant say i noticed well by christ i did he laughed softly anyhow i dont fancy listening to any more of it and id have to i wont be here all that long myself and wi mario in the mix those twos jockeying will be even worse no im going to do it my way mmm the redhaired superintendent murmured just remember who started those meetings it wasnt andy or roy old it was mr skinner himself oh i remember that all right there was no bullshit in those days though they were all too scared of the big fella to take any chances wi him theres no problem there anyway the dccs told me i can run things any way i like so this is the start of it then youre going to be peering round my door every monday morning from now on no no no no he assured her quickly this is just to tell you how things are going to be from now on therell be no surprise visits after this but howre you doing anyway and hows your man taking his uncles death that was a hell of a shock halfratted as i was at the time i remember thinking ive never seen him so rattled he had a rough weekend the whole family had as youd imagine and that crap in the sundays didnt help but hes okay now he headed off down to gala at halfsix this morning its his first day as well remember the head ofcid rose to leave but as he did so his eye was caught by a paper in her outtray he picked it up it was the flyer on george rosewell on which mario had doodled a rough beard whos this ugly bugger he chuckled in spite of herself she felt a cold tug at her stomach hes a missing person its got to be recirculated since hes thought to have changed his appearance since that photo was taken hence my husbands artwork pringle gave his moustache another tug you know he murmured this looks a hell of a lot like someone whose mug turned up on my desk this morning it came through from strathclyde a notice about a guy theyre looking for through there its the sort of thing where youd say hes just done a runner but theyre taking it seriously since the guys a parish priest could you send me a copy asked maggie sure if you like why i dont know i suppose id just like to see a priest who looked like him what do you think of the borders so far sergeant detective superintendent mario mcguire asked his new assistant as they strolled around the main thoroughfare of galashiels enjoying the midday sun sammy pye ran a hand over his dark hair come on sir ive only been here for four hours come on nothing you make up your mind about a woman in about half a minute flat so give me an instant opinion about our new surroundings if its an order boss i know we havent been out of gala yet but if this is the hub of the division as far as populations concerned whats the rest going to be like even in comparison to dalkeith and east lothian where i was before i was in mr martins office its quiet mcguire smiled maybe so but your predecessor in this office got a lump shot off his ear not that long ago there was no danger of that while you were working for the head of cid maybe not sir but is it going to be that much different here that thing they had last year was a oneoff and everybody involved got such heavy time that there wont be any repeat performances dont get me wrong i jumped at the chance to get out to a division again but my roles going to be much the same isnt it i was mr martins exec now im yours itll not be the same though because my jobs different at least the way i do it will be after doing my stint in special branch i was as keen as you to get out in the field again im not going to drive this division from behind a desk im going to take the lead on most investigations as they come up and youll be there with me weve got a small team here i know but even if id been given an edinburgh command thats the way id have handled it the downside of sb is that it doesnt let you do any conventional cid work you spend all your bloody time gathering and exchanging intelligence unless youre alee bloody smith and look what happened to him he reached out a shirtsleeved arm and punched his sergeant lightly on the shoulder so you and i sammy were going to make this place sing and dont you worry the borders might be quiet but there are people here and where theres punters theres crime theres also a substantial amount of moneyed folk down here it follows that there are also lessmoneyed folk some of a mind to do a bit of redistribution weve also got colleges and where you have colleges you have young people where you have young people you have discos and stuff and where you have them you have guys peddling class a drugs you get my drift sammy pye nodded good the superintendent stopped in front of the police office i dont like to speak ill of my predecessors and i wont to anyone else bar you but this division was a problem for a while when mr skinner became head of cid he inherited john mcgrigor as his commander down here and john was a problem he was a former rugby international that made him revered down here and got him his job but he was a piss poor detective nonetheless the boss couldnt move him anywhere else that would have been a disaster he couldnt stick him back in uniform because he wouldnt have been any better there so effectively he and later roy old and andy martin commanded this division from fettes when john took early retirement the sigh of relief was heard all over headquarters dan pringle started to get this place up to the same standard as the other divisions but hed tell you himself as hes told me that theres still work to be done especially on pushing crime prevention down here we havent been sent down here for a rest sam i promise you that they walked back into the grey stone building past the front desk and through to the cid suite the outer office was manned by a lone detective constable message for you sir he said to mcguire as pye resumed his seat behind his new desk would you call mr jay in leith as soon as you can aye okay bert thanks he went back to his room without a view and called the leith divisional office mario old son greg jay greeted him down the line when eventually his call was put through sorry to keep you hanging on how are things in the borders warm and sunny thanks greg im just getting the feel of my new office youll be having a visitor in it soon dan pringles doing the rounds and hell be heading your way this afternoon i just thought id call to warn you thanks but i know that already maggie was second on his list she phoned me after she had her official visit good for clan if thats how he wants to play it thats fine by me i couldnt see him chairing a formal meeting anyway not his style you might find a flea in your ear after hes gone when he was here he asked me if i was happy with everything he caught me at the wrong moment cos i told him that as it happened i was a bit pissed off with you i saw the report you faxed in about your meeting with the brennan woman i know youve got a personal interest in the viareggio investigation mario but if you thought she had information you should have passed it on to the investigating officers i wouldnt even have minded if youd called me at home seeing her yourself was a bit out of order son and im afraid i told dan pringle as much mcguire felt the fuse of his temper burning away fast as he fought to control it he held the phone away from his ear for a second or two and stared at it noticing that he was gripping it so hard that his knuckles were white finally he put it back to his ear theres a couple of things i should tell you greg he said evenly to begin with please dont call me son ever i dont like it also next time you try to score points off me with dan pringle or bob skinner or anyone else then whether were senior officers or not ill take you somewhere quiet and do something serious to your head for the record ivy brennans on the fringe of something else im involved in something personal when she called me last night i didnt really think she knew anything about beppe or his murder im still not sure she didnt make up that story about the argument in the sauna but she volunteered it so i passed it on to you informally shes a funny one is ivy but she does know my cousin paula ive checked that out if youre running your investigation properly youll send a couple of officers along to reinterview her for the record or are you going to surprise me have you made an arrest already if i had youd have been the first to know jay replied stiffly have you got any new leads then we might have we found a taxidriver who said he dropped a couple off on the corner of the street that leads to your uncles place just before nine descriptions she was late twenties he was older that was the best he could do you know how many fares these guys have on a friday night anything else weve been looking at the property side with your other cousins husband stan coia to see whether your family might have had any tenants with a grievance against the landlord i doubt it stans a good bloke he keeps the portfolio in firstclass shape maintenance can be a good investment in terms of lower insurance premiums i cant see anyone having grounds for complaint not to the extent of wanting to put a bullet in beppe maybe not jay paused did you know that the viareggio trust owns a bonded warehouse he asked yes i do know that as a matter of fact we use it to bond wines from italy for the deli chain and we rent out space there to other importers yes thats right there was one funny thing that mr coia mentioned a firm rented space but never used it they didnt pass a single case of wine through there a few months back your uncle wrote to them well coia wrote the letter but mr viareggio signed it and said that he intended to terminate their lease so that it could be made available to someone who actually needed it theres a clause in the agreement that lets him do that the tenants response was very angry and aggressive it was so threatening in fact that mr coia was going to back off but your uncle beppe insisted that they go ahead so legal papers were served a couple of weeks ago what was the name of the firm essary and frances limited its registered at the office of its solicitor and the directors are named as mr magnus essary and ms ella frances you following it up ive got people on it as we speak oh and by the way mario this time id be grateful if you left it to them mcguire slammed the phone back into its cradle he was still scowling when dan pringle walked into his office you set it up right here in the heart of the city said detective chief inspector mary chambers as she gazed at the young man her plain square face was lit with a mix of incredulity and amusement excuse my use of industrial language but did you clever boys really think were as lucking stupid as that well yes actually he replied they think that in malaysia too i was there last week at a conference theres a queue of guys like you in prisons out in south east asia all waiting to be hanged she sighed not just in the heart of the city mind you oh no you two have to set up your ecstasy lab less than half a mile from a divisional police office she paused as the midday train rattled by outside and looked around the windowless space of the small industrial unit which had been turned into a chemical factory where better to hide than the heart of a city the tall youth asked just about anywhere maggie rose told him weve got a concentration of manpower here that you wont find anywhere else he looked at her scornfully you didnt catch us we were grassed up you know all the slang too said chambers shaking her head you poor lads all those brains and no common sense you made the tabs locally you sold them locally and you used stupid bloody students like yourselves to peddle them for you of course you were grassed up did you really think those two kids were going to do time for you once they were offered the chance of being crown witnesses its their word against ours the chief inspector looked at the second young man there was raw fear in his voice and his chin was trembling no son she said wearily its your word against ours mine and detective superintendent rose and ds mcconochie and dc guthrie whos taking photographs of your equipment in situ just as hes been taking shots of you two and the others coming in and out of this place for the last week theres that and then theres the name on the lease for this place i have got that right havent i im not mixed up between the two of you am i you are brian litster and hes raymond weston the boy nodded right thats enough beano snapped the other no more talk arrest us and caution us if thats what youre going to do inspector too right thats what im going to do mr weston good he took a phone from his pocket then ill be entitled to call my father chambers shrugged her broad shoulders you can call him right now if you want tell him youre being arrested and taken to the torphichen place police office raymond weston looked at her in surprise for a moment then dialled a number dad he said and as he spoke his voice took on an urgent frightened tone that had not been there before ive been picked up by the police theyve set me up i told you that guy martin would have it in for me and i was right he paused for a few seconds torphichen place they said no i wont say anything till you and he get there he put the phone back in his pocket the head of the drugs squad shook her head and smiled i see were in for a busy day george she called to detective sergeant mcconochie go through the formalities with these two and then get them round the corner i dont imagine that this ones dad will be too long in getting there she turned to rose will you come back to the office in my car fine the superintendent replied a frown on her face and followed her outside whos his father i wonder chambers mused as she slid behind the wheel i can tell you that hes professor nolan weston and hes a surgeon at the western and what was that stuff about the bit about us having it in for him the superintendent took a deep breath then blew it out potentially its a mess if weston goes to trial there was an investigation a while back into the death of his girlfriends uncle dan pringle was in my job then and he thought weston might have had something to do with it he offered an alibi he told dan that hed been in bed with someone at the time not his girlfriend someone else it turned out that he was telling the truth the other woman was andy martins fiancee what karen no this was before karen at the time andy was engaged to bob skinners daughter alex oh jesus exclaimed chambers westons not still seeing her is he not a chance alex is working in her firms office down south the last i heard she was going out with an actor guy she met at neil mcllhenneys wedding still if his defence alleges that weve got a down on him because of that and weve fixed him up you never know with juries at the very least itll be all over the tabloids i can see the headlines and the pictures even now she flashed a quick engaging smile by the way did you know that elvis presleys song one night with you was originally called one night of sin rose chuckled no i did not i was never into elvis or much into nights of sin for that matter but before you go offering weston a deal to preserve the reputation of the force theres something else you should take into account whats that the bob skinner factor there arent too many people whod fancy throwing mud at his daughter if youd like a wager on how this will turn out id say that litster will catch the lot since his name was on the lease and that ray weston will plead to a reduced charge being involved in manufacture but not supply river done id better get on with it then said chambers she drove round the twisting haymarket junction and drew up outside divisional headquarters to let rose out of the car then pulled away again heading for the park at the rear the redhaired superintendent was frowning as she strolled back into her office on impulse she picked up the phone and called the special branch number the one that had been her husbands until the previous friday di mcllhenney a familiar voice answered hi neil how are you settling in rushed off my feet mags is this a wishmeluck call not exactly somethings come up that the boss should be aware of but its far too delicate for jack mcgurk to handle on his first day in the job and now that andys gone youre the only man i can talk to about it quickly she explained what had happened at weston and litsters ecstasy factory i see what you mean the big inspector muttered you dont think the lad would really be that stupid do you im betting he isnt but ive been wrong before not very often you havent but i agree the big man needs to be told alex too in case his lawyer gets cute and starts leaking stuff to the tabloids leave it with me ill take care of it thanks you know i wouldnt have figured on alex getting into a jam like this why not neil drawled her father did not that id be daft enough to remind him of the fact she laughed as she hung up finally she turned back to the papers on her desk able to give them her full attention for the first time since mary chambers urgent call two hours before the photograph other father still lay on top of the pile she thought of dan pringles comment and then another recollection came to her the memory of another face she had seen a week before she picked up the phone once more and dialled the general office extension sauce she began as haddock answered i want you to dig out a file for me if its still there it relates to an incident reported on night shift up in oxgangs she gave him the details then waited her door opened in less than five minutes the gawky haddock appeared slightly breathless and laid a file on her desk thanks she said you dont need to wait as the door closed behind him she flipped up the folder and took out charlie johnstons polaroid of the late magnus essary then laid it on the desk before her alongside the amended likeness of george rosewell she stared at them for over a minute looking from one to the other then back again there was no doubt about it the likeness was remarkable the nightshift constable was a truly bad photographer the snapshot of the body was fuzzy but he had caught all essarys essential features save for the eyes which were closed in death the balding head the sharp nose and the heavily bearded chin they were all there she snatched up the phone again and dialled sauce ive got another job for you i want you to ring around all the undertakers and find out which of them has made funeral arrangements for a man called magnus essary get a couple of people out there to help you if necessary when you find the right one then even if theyre in the act of lowering the coffin into the ground i want the thing stopped i want to take a look at the body the risen sun was still low in the sky bathing the shuttle in a soft yellow light as he watched it taxi in from the runway the jetties were filled by outgoing commuter flights and so the passengers disembarked using rollup stairways boarding a long bus for the transfer to the terminal bob felt his heart jump as his wife stepped out of the boeings door into the bright morning she was dressed entirely in black boots jeans and teeshirt with her big leather bag slung over her shoulder and she carried herself tall and upright her auburn hair shining as it fell about her shoulders for a moment he was overcome his head buzzed and he felt his knees weaken he leaned against the glass wall of the terminal building steadying himself gripped again by an odd feeling that somewhere else in another place time or even dimension he had played this scene before it passed in a moment and when it did he realised for the first time just how much he had missed her brad dekker had pulled strings at buffalo international sarah had cleared customs at boston and so when the bus arrived she was met by a groundcrew member and brought straight to the reserved vip room where he waited alone hello love he said quietly welcome home she crossed the room in three strides and threw herself into his arms the tears came then sudden and uncontrollable taking her by surprise he held her to him until they were spent feeling his collar dampen stroking her soft shining hair feeling for her in her explosion of pentup grief yet perversely and guiltily happy that it had brought them back together oh bob she murmured eventually ive needed you sditouch i wish now i had asked you to come home well youve got me now he answered smiling as she looked up at him stroking the wetness of her face with his fingers and for the avoidance of doubt ive needed you too have you been bored waiting here alone for me i havent had time my darling he told her honestly ive been chumming joe doherty around america talking to people who might have been able to tell us something about leo and susannahs murder in the last few days ive been upstate ive been to helena montana and ive been to washington dc and did you learn anything sarah asked urgently we learned that they still havent found all of the was that the democrats swiped off the computer keyboards and that the new people still dont see the funny side of it but did we learn anything positive no love im sorry but we didnt bob whys joe involved hes back with the bureau now isnt he and homicides state business what have you been stirring up have you been upsetting sheriff dekker he looked at her innocently the no well not much anyway brad laid on this room for us so hes okay the state cops got a bit precious at least their boss did but joe sorted her look she demanded lets cut to the chase do you have any idea who did it bob frowned no but sarah love i have a lot to tell you but not here okay your luggage should have been picked off the carousel by now so lets grab it and get going where are we going exactly home like you asked but if youve changed your mind and you feel it would be too much to go straight back into the house we can check in to a hotel no lets not do that it would be worse for me to be anywhere else in buffalo i promise you thats fine then i should warn you the place is still in a bit of a mess after the fbi technicians dusted every imaginable surface looking for a usable print but ive booked a cleaning service to come in this morning come on wed better get going or theyll be there before us the airport staff member who had brought sarah to the vip room was waiting outside the door with the single large samsonite suitcase that held the clothes she had brought with her bob thanked her took it from her and wheeled it behind him as he led the way to the staff car park in which he had been allocated a space i brought leos jag from the garage he told her i wiped the powder off that though they printed that honey this is the bureau were talking about they even printed all the toilet roll holders in case the guy took a dump while he was searching the place my god but bob what were the bureau doing at the house in the first place dad and mum were killed up at the cabin later love ill tell you all about it later he loaded the case into the boot of the dark blue jaguar and walked round to the passenger door to open it for his wife he settled into the cream calfskin drivers seat switched on and pulled smoothly out into the exit roadway as they drove out on to the highway heading south sarah stroked the smooth leather of the console between them dad always liked to have a good car she mused i remember the smell of newness coming off them from when i was a little girl it was the only way he spoiled himself really she flipped up the lid of the compartment and looked inside then took out a pair of rayban sunglasses in their case do you need these she asked not right now she replaced them and closed the central console do we have a date for the funeral it was as if she had been avoiding the question but finally had plucked up the courage to raise it to make herself part of the process friday he told her its fixed for friday morning theres a memorial service in the lutheran church and a burial after that i left all the arrangements with the undertaker once release of the bodies was confirmed hes fixed the time to suit the secret service the what you heard the new senator wants to be there and shes bringing her husband you mean that id hardly kid you about your parents funeral now would i she whistled you know bob all my life i sort of knew that my dad was an important man beyond buffalo but i never really understood how important did he ever talk about his interest in politics no or about his time in washington he used to say that teddy kennedy was the best of the brothers and that hed have made the best president but that was about it there was a time in my late teens when i kept trying to get him to talk about it but he always shut me down what did he think of jfk i once heard him say that he was shot at the right time to ensure that he would be sanctified rather than vilified after his death i think he approved of him i recall once hearing him say to jack wylie that if adultery in office was a ground for impeachment congress would have been too busy with that to do any legislating make of that what you will she paused have you seen jack since youve been in town i was supposed to see him on saturday only bob hesitated then decided to economise with the truth he had an accident on his boat oh no poor jack was he badly hurt that was something i was going to tell you when we got home he was killed she seemed to sag into her seat as she buried her face in her hands oh no she moaned what next ive known jack all my life he was like an uncle to me and he was as close to my father as andy is to you what happened the gas tank blew up he was barbecuing on deck she sighed that was jack all right he was at his happiest when he was wearing an apron or playing around on that boat of his or both yeah or both suddenly she reached out for the radio controls goddamn it lets have some music in this car anything to lighten the atmosphere she pressed the button and a heavy classical piece boomed out through the speaker system i dont think so she murmured and changed channel wagner was replaced by a nasal country voice not you either emmy lou she switched again to hear jon bon jovi going down in a blaze of glory this is a conspiracy she shouted hold on maybe dad had some cds here she opened the console again took out the raybans laid them on her lap and began to rummage in the deep compartment she felt around for a few seconds until in an instant her expression changed her frown of irritation replaced by something much deeper from within the box she withdrew a gun a dark metallic welloiled automatic pistol what the hell is this she gasped holding it up for bob to see he stared at it oblivious for that moment of the straight road ahead jesus he murmured he took it from her slowing his speed as he did and looked at it for a few seconds before handing it back thats no replica and it is loaded now just do what i say the safety catch should be on the side at the top of the grip check that its on then put that thing back where you found it she did as he had told her then closed the console lid slowly and carefully she looked up at him at his grim profile as he drove along bob you know my father hated firearms he wouldnt even watch a charlton heston movie because of his nra connection so what was he doing with a loaded automatic in his car what the hell was he into he shook his head slowly i wish i knew love i wish i knew for im damn certain that it got him killed often during marios special branch days he and maggie would meet for lunch the venue usually depended on the weather sometimes it would be the canteen on other occasions a restaurant or a pub but occasionally when the weather was warm and fine they would buy sandwiches and eat them at a table at the piazza in princes street gardens watching the children on the roundabout and talking above the noise of the traffic up in the busy thoroughfare she went there again on his first day in borders division feeling lonely already without him and tried to remember her life before they met before they got together on that crazy stakeout in fife she had been wary of him at first of his big outgoing personality of his smile and of his bedroom eyes all of them so much in contrast to her own makeup yet when the time came it had been she who had made the move she had been a private person until then showing a reserved and often a severe face to those around her she had had few interests outside the job and even fewer friends once she had tried to break the mould by placing an ad in the dating column of a sunday newspaper it had led to a few encounters and eventually when she had plucked up the courage to her first adult sexual experiences clumsy fumbling affairs in drab hotel rooms for she had refused to take her partners home with her or to go with them to theirs quickly she had come to the conclusion that she was very bad at sex and had given it up virtually until her big irishitalian detective had come along to stir genuine lust within her for the first time in her life yet for all that she had developed as a person since her marriage maggie knew that many of her work colleagues could still see only her old self they did not know the social animal she had become they could see only the severe strict senior officer on her way up the ladder she had heard her lots nickname long before dan pringle had let it slip but she knew that she had another one she still bore in the eyes of some resentful colleagues when she had overheard a special branch typist ask ruth mcconnell the dccs secretary in the ladies room at fettes how are you getting on with rosa kleb she had known about whom the woman was talking even if her loyal friend ruth had ignored the question she threw the wrapping of her sandwich into a bin and walked up the steps and out of the gardens then along shandwick place towards her office all the time her mind was gnawing away at her concern that a few days earlier a probationer constable had actually been afraid to come into her office for all the encouragement ofwillie haggerty and clan pringle she knew that someone with aspirations to chief officer rank should inspire respect not fear in their juniors but the question that maggie still had not answered even in her own mind was whether she actually had such aspirations walking briskly in the sunshine without stopping to windowshop she reached torphichen place in less than fifteen minutes she had only just hung her jacket in its usual place on the back of her chair when there was a knock she called and young pc haddock entered wearing his diffident expression excuse me maam he began okay youre excused he stopped and stared at her oh go on sauce she exclaimed we dont need the preamble every time very good maam well its like this she sat behind her desk and waited for him to come to the point weve found the undertaker maam the firm that made the arrangements for mr essary it was the coop up at fountainbridge he paused again the only thing is the funeral was on saturday damn she hissed that makes it difficult wheres he buried aye well maam thats the other thing he was cremated down at seafield oh damn she snapped just our bloody luck ah well that was good work son to come up with an answer so quickly what was the undertakers name mr jaap maam walter jaap he held out a piece of paper torn from a notebook thats his number i thought you might want to talk to him you thought right thanks anything else sergeant wilding from the head of cids office dropped in an envelope ten minutes ago maam its in your tray there apart from that theres nothing else okay on you go then as haddock left she flattened out his note on her desk and dialled the number he had written on it funeral services a solemn voice answered mr jaap please this is he how can i be of assistance i want to talk to you about a funeral certainly madam shall i call on you no that wont be necessary this is detective superintendent rose edinburgh cid the funeral i want to ask you about took place on saturday in seafield crematorium the guest of honour was a mr magnus essary yes jaap replied i attended that one myself he paused but everything was in order i assure you the body was released from the mortuary with a cremation certificate issued by medical staff at the royal infirmary im sure it was im not questioning your procedures sir im interested in the funeral itself for example id like to know who was there how many mourners the names of the pallbearers anything else you can tell me ahh came a sigh but thats the pity of it the poor man had no one to see him on his way no one not a soul other than myself and my staff but who instructed you a lady a miss ella frances she phoned me and asked me to collect the deceased from the mortuary and bring him to our chapel of rest here at our salon i did so that very day and next morning she came to see me she showed me all the necessary paperwork by which i mean the cremation certificate and the death certificate itself she told me that the late mr essary was her business partner and that he had no relatives she asked me to book a cremation i did it there and then she chose a simple coffin and reserved a hearse i asked her if she wished me to place an intimation in the press but she declined can you give me an address and telephone number for miss frances jaap sighed again alas no superintendent she gave me neither but what about payment rose asked how are you going to invoice her i dont have to she asked me what the bill would be i told her that her requirements would cost just under nine hundred pounds and she paid me there and then in cash she gave me one thousand pounds the balance being a gratuity for my staff and then she didnt turn up for the funeral is that what youre saying thats right she told me to proceed as instructed she said that the late mr essary had been a humanist and had wished no formal ceremony she also told me at that time that she would be unable to attend herself as she had to be in france unavoidably on business she did lead me to expect that there would be mourners from mr essarys circle of friends but on the day there were none this stinks the detective exclaimed i agree said the undertaker i must admit i was concerned by the circumstances i had it in mind to discuss it with my chief executive i have an appointment to see him this evening and i intended to tell him about it then your call has anticipated that give me a description of this ella frances woman she was small in her twenties id have said but id hate to put an age to her she was dressed in mourning black nothing unusual in that given the circumstances with a widebrimmed black hat and heavily tinted glasses which she never removed during our meeting voice accent she was quietly spoken i cant recall whether she had a particular accent of any sort but people often sound strained when i meet them so it can be hard to tell okay rose paused thinking thank you for that mr jaap listen if by any chance miss frances should contact you again get a number for her i may have to speak to you again but for now thats all she hung up and pulled the essary folder across to her charlie johnstons note was all right as far as it went but it stopped well short of being comprehensive she snatched up her phone once more and dialled haddock sauce i want you to get someone for me hes a doctor dramritraj and he practises up at the health centre in oxgangs find him and make an appointment for me to call on him maggie was aware of a long awkward silence this is not a personal matter she added heavily i want to talk to him about a death he certified but do not tell him that she sat back and waited and as she did her eye fell upon an envelope on the top of the pile in her intray with her name scrawled across it dan pringles package she guessed she picked it up and tore it open inside there was a twopage missing person report circulated by strathclyde police the man pringle had thought looked like her father she looked at the name on the heading reading it aloud father francis donovan green a turbulent priest i wonder probably done a runner with a married parishioner she scanned the report father green was a fiftyoneyearold parish priest in the appropriately named district ofholytown in lanarkshire ten days earlier he had gone off on a weekends leave to visit his spinster sister in crieff maggie was struck by the adjective spinster eh i could have been one of those she thought she read on the priest had been due back on the following monday ready to take confession but he had not reappeared on the following morning his curate had telephoned his sister who had told him that she had not seen her brother since christmas and certainly had not expected him that weekend the police had been informed the curate and housekeeper had been interviewed but father green had given no hint as to where he might really have been headed midlife crisis maybe the superintendent mused and then she turned to the second sheet of the report the photograph seemed to become almost holographic as it jumped off the page at her jesus she shouted involuntarily she laid it on the desk grabbed the polaroid of magnus essary and laid the two side by side this time she had no doubt what she needed was confirmation she snatched up her phone once more and dialled haddock sauce she barked have you got that doctor yet sorry maam he answered fearfully im having trouble finding the right number thats okay put a hold on that for now anyway i want you to get me someone else pc charlie johnston hes stationed up at oxgangs too i dont care what shift hes on suppose hes still on nights and in the land of nod find him and tell him to be in my office inside an hour bob handed the keys of her parents house to his wife you do it love he said she took them from him and unlocked the big front door then stepped slightly hesitantly into the hall the heat of the day was building up in the morning sunshine but inside it was still cool sarah looked around the familiar entrance bob had done as much as he could to clean up after the technicians but she could see that the rest was a job for the professionals much of the panelling on the walls and the woodwork on the stairway were still streaked with their powder once more it got to her she knew that there would be many such moments over the next few days but it was comforting to know that with her husband at hand she enjoyed the luxury of being able to yield to them from time to time excuse me she whispered and walked upstairs into the bedroom that had been hers as a girl and in which she guessed that bob had slept the night before the sound of her crying carried down to him in the hallway for a moment he thought of going up to her but instead he left the suitcase at the foot of the stairs and walked back out to the drive he found a cloth in the jaguars glove compartment and used it to wrap the pistol which he retrieved from its hiding place and carried into the graces spacious reception room indoors he was able to give the weapon a thorough examination he recognised it at once as the double of several owned by his own police force not his own firearm of choice but one which was popular with his colleagues because of its reliability a mm glock compact model he slid the fifteen shot magazine from its housing in the butt and saw that indeed it was fully loaded he laid pistol and ammunition on a side table then reached into a pocket of the cotton jacket he had bought a few days before and took out a small notebook searching through it until he found the number he needed he sat in his fatherinlaws armchair picked up the phone and dialled schultz a strong voice answered lieutenant good morning its bob skinner here i hope im not interrupting anything no sir i have this morning off ive just been running and im about to step into the shower but otherwise im clear how can i help you leo and susannahs car the scot began the ford explorer they had up at the lake where is it now we have it in the park at my office would you like it delivered back to buffalo i could have toby drive it down with a patrolman following to bring him back no big deal thanks maybe ill take you up on that but first theres something i have to ask you have you searched it the explorer that is no sir okay id like you to do that first chance you get i havent had a chance to check my copy of the inventory you took at the cabin but i dont recall seeing any mention of any firearms being found there youre correct there were none in that case id like you to look in the car in the glove compartment central storage box under the seats my wife and i have just found a loaded glock in his buffalo car if leo was carrying a gun it was unusual behaviour for him so if he had one in buffalo it stands to reason he paused there isnt another in the house here the bureau have been all over it and theyd have found it for sure so search the car please id just like to know sure sir schultz responded ill go in soon as im showered apart from anything else we have occasional thefts from cars even in the police park if mr grace had a second gun it should be under lock and key in my desk for safetys sake ill get back to you thanks skinner hung up and leaned back in the comfortable chair thinking after a few minutes he picked up the phone again and called joe dohertys washington number tell me about the registration of firearms in the us he began when finally he was put through to the deputy director you wont be here long enough his friend replied tersely be specific my fatherinlaw had a gun maybe two would there be a record of where and when he bought them for sure said doherty quickly federal law requires all dealers to be registered and also it requires them to keep a record of every sale made but if someone buys two guns the dealer has to report their sale to the atf thats the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms i know what the atf is you wanna find out whether mr grace is on their list itll take me one call yes please joe if you could and if he did buy two firearms would you find out when the automatic sarah found in his car looked more or less new gimme your number there ill call you back skinner replaced the phone then reached out and picked up the unloaded pistol once more he was used to guns he had been a qualified marksman since his earliest days on the force he felt the weight of the glock in his hand admiring its balance he worked the slide mechanism silent and smooth sighted along the barrel and pulled the trigger i can understand why mcllhenney likes this baby he murmured to himself he thought nothing but the best for my old man said sarah behind him it didnt do him any good though did it are you ready now to tell me what this is all about he opened his mouth to reply but the phone rang silencing him one call just like i said doherty drawled leopold grace bought two identical glock automatics from a dealer in buffalo just over two months ago in accordance with federal law the transaction was reported to the atf two days later on form number point the american laughed if you think you have a bureaucracy in britain you wanna get a load of the paperwork our government can generate at least weve taught you something skinner grunted have you heard from kosinski yet no hes due to see arthur wilkins around now he said hed call me straight after ill let you know if anything fresh comes out of the interview okay he hung up and turned to sarah your father felt under threat love he began i dont know why but he did he stopped in midsentence as the dejd vu feeling he had experienced earlier that morning and before swept over him once more he had become used to it and so this time he simply made himself wait it out when it cleared after a few seconds it was as if a door had been opened in his mind bob what is it for a second there you just glazed over wait he waved her to silence snatched up the phone and dialled dohertys number again this time he was put straight through joe he snapped i must have had a bang on the head as well as you on saturday the device on wylies boat have your people found any traces yet of a timing mechanism yeah they did i just got the report so what it stands to reason there was a timer sure but think about this if you and i hadnt been delayed in transit and if i hadnt stopped for a few seconds on the boardwalk wed have been on that boat too suppose just suppose jackson wylie wasnt the only target yeah the deputy director responded slowly so who knew we were seeing him there and at that time who set up the meeting fuck the single hissed syllable took about five seconds to form hold on a minute bob hes one of mine sure but suppose just suppose shit shit shit skinner had never heard his friend raise his voice before yeah okay okay i get the picture i dont believe it but ill have him intercepted and brought to me for questioning before he sees wilkins joe yes youll do it right now yes goddammit right now sarah was staring at him hard as he put down the phone the device on jack wylies boat she exclaimed what device you mean someone planted a bomb on board and you and joe were meant to be there when it went off he held up his hands as if to ward her off i dont know he said yes there was a bomb but it might have had nothing to do with us its just a possibility but it has to be checked out whos being checked out this kosinski guy you mentioned yes who is he an fbi agent one of joes team on the investigation he looked at her to go back to what i was saying before joes confirmed for me that your dad bought two guns a couple of months ago he kept one in the jag the other id guess he kept around the house and took with him to the cabin either the guy who killed him stole it or its still in the offroader they had up there i want to ask you something he said and i want you to think long and hard about it do the names sander garrett or bartholomew wilkins mean anything to you either or both of them she frowned and sat on the chair facing his no she answered slowly i dont think they do no im certain ive never heard of either one of them were they associates of my father so it seems let me tell you the whole story she nodded looking at him intently bart wilkins and sander garrett are both dead he began they were both murdered shortly before your father they were lawyers democrats and they both worked in washington at the same time as him and jackson wylie suddenly her eyes widened and she sat up in the armchair hey wait a minute wait a minute she cried out bart and sandy bart and sandy i know those names when my dad was in washington a bunch of the guys used to play touch football every sunday dad said it was the most exclusive club in dc at the time because the star player was you know who i do you sure do the president himself he turned out on most of the sundays he was in dc bobby played too sometimes two of the guys in the squad were called bart and sandy i remember that now although he never mentioned their surnames jack wylie was in it too how did they get together through their jobs the president himself invited dad to join them but all the others were in the secret service looking across the room at his new boss sammy pye was surprised by the gleam of satisfaction that was written on his face dan pringle had gone back to edinburgh and they had been in the middle of a team meeting with the available divisional cid staff when the phone had rung mcguire had frowned at the interruption at first but had taken the call when he had heard who was on the line yes greg he murmured pleasantly what can i do for you company business mario his colleague replied in a tone that was just a shade too affable you could say that this is an interview rather than a conversation oh aye do i need a lawyer then he grinned at the reactions of some of his sevenstrong squad sat around the conference room table greg he continued im just coming to the end of a meeting here hold on for a minute while i wrap it up he wrapped a massive hand around the mouthpiece and looked at pye sammy take the lads across the road to the pub and buy them the last beer theyre going to get out of me till next christmas ill square you up when i join you he waited while they filed out of the room then put the phone back to his ear okay he resumed briskly whats this interview about then joking mario i was joking said detective superintendent jay actually i was sort of hoping you could help me indeed tell me that crunching sound i hear in the background could that be a portion of humble pie being eaten with salt and pepper good so whats your problem its that company i told you about essary and frances the wine importers who rented space in your warehouse the lot your uncle was trying to turf out my people cant find hide nor hair of them how hard have they tried as hard as they can the company has no listing in the telephone directory or in yellow pages nor are there any private subscribers named magnus essary or ella frances we checked with the solicitors who registered the company theyre a small firm out in corstorphine they know virtually nothing about them they took all the instructions at a single meeting which was attended only by ella frances handled the setup for them sold them one of the shell companies they keep for the purpose and registered the name change with companies house in castle terrace they sent them a fee note and it was paid in cash they havent heard from them since then no one could even recall an occasion since that first meeting when either one has called at the office where did they send the invoice to the address they gave leightonstone grove hunters tryst a couple of days later a woman handed in an envelope to their reception desk with the exact amount in cash the office was just closing so she didnt wait for a receipt it was posted out to them same day youve been to the house of course no answer the place was locked up whos the registered owner of the property a mr lyall butler weve checked with the city chambers hes retired and shown as being normally resident in portugal and getting a fifty per cent discount on his council tax have you contacted him hes not on the phone there it would mean asking the local police to interview him if he speaks portuguese or they speak english chances are theyd need to find an interpreter if i did that it would take a long time to get a result no what i was hoping was that you might ask around for me within your family to see if anyone has actually met these people and knows where or how they can be contacted other than at that address didnt stan tell you that there was a silence then a sigh we didnt actually ask him jay admitted i just tried to call him back myself but hes gone out his secretary said that hed gone for a meeting with a client and that he didnt take his mobile i dont really want to send officers to his house in the evening so i wondered its all right for me to get involved when it suits you eh greg said mcguire okay ill have a word with stan and ill ask my mother about them beppe might have discussed the tenancy with her you never know thanks s jay stopped himself just in time charlie johnston was none too pleased to have been summoned from the betting shop in the middle of his day off but the big career constable knew better than to show it to the acting chief superintendent he stood to attention in front of her desk in his hastily donned tunic all too aware suddenly that it was covered in fine cat hairs you wanted to see me maam he began his speech as stiff and formal as the rest of him yes relax and sit down please i want to talk to you about something that happened a week or so back when you were on nights minding the oxgangs office you were called out to a sudden death i understand in a doctors surgery johnston nodded vigorously aye thats right maam dramritraj then he paused as if it had dawned on him that for all young haddock had said he might be on the carpet after all ah didna like leaving the office like he assured rose but abody else was busy and the paramedics were gettin bolshie she read his thoughts its all right im not questioning your judgement charlie dont worry no i just want you to tell me what happened when you got there the constable leaned back in his chair and scratched his head well maam there wisna much to it really there was this bloke and he was deid he chuckled grimly no doubt about that right enough he was as deid as hes ever goin taste be tell me about the doctor theres no much taste tell about him either he was an asian bloke nothing unusual about that these days and he was in a hurry taste get home did you question him johnston looked offended oh aye maam its all in my report fine but tell me how did he explain the man being there in the middle of the night he said the bloke had called him complaining about chest pains he said the guy was feart of hospitals so rather than upset him he took him taste his surgery to give him a checkup put him on a machine like and he had hardly got there when the fella took a big coronary and popped off he said he was ten minutes trying to bring him round but it was nae use so he just called the ambulance taste take him away rose looked him in the eye not the police only the ambulance youre sure about that dead sure maam it was a wee paramedic lass that phoned me and how did the doctor react when you arrived the middleaged officer cocked an eyebrow ye mean was he pleased taste see me like she nodded thatll do naw he was just wantin hame like the ambulance crew were wantin back taste the royal had you ever met him before who the deid fella like no rose said patiently the doctor naw naw naw naw naw never in ma life he was a new one on me like do you know many of the doctors up in oxgangs charlie ah thought ah knew them a maam but like ah said no this one have you seen amritraj since then no maam she leaned across her desk and pulled her intray towards her the dead man essary she said youd remember him if i showed you a photograph would you oh aye maam ahve got a good memory for faces especially if theyre deid she ripped off the second sheet of the strathclyde memo and slid it over to him is that him johnston picked it up and gazed at it for a few seconds then he nodded slowly he looks a bit better there maam a bit mair life about him ken but thats him aright no doubt about it i always meant to ask your father about this thing american men have with their dens bob murmured as he and sarah looked around the converted cellar space beneath the mansion it was a big room with walls and ceiling panelled in pale beechwood comfortably furnished and geared to play rather than work simple they express the part of them that never grew up that was well over fifty per cent in some men ive met i can tell you in my fathers case probably about five but he wasnt exempt as this place shows like the rest of the house the den bore the marks of a thorough sweep by the police and bureau technicians this photograph you remember asked bob he would have kept it here would he rather than in one of the public rooms here for certain she said without a moments hesitation my dad wasnt showy he met presidents and senators and he had been one of those himself at state level but he never talked about it unless he was asked and he never displayed any photographs from those days all those and his few bits of memorabilia were down here skinner laughed i was in a guys office once and you could hardly see the walls for pictures of him with the rich and famous they were arranged in a sort of pecking order the actors and pop stars were on the bottom rung then politicians then up one more to the royals and right at the top of the ladder was him and the pope whom youll be meeting yourself quite soon yes but dont lets go into that where did leo keep his photographs they were in albums lets see she pointed to a sideboard against one of the walls in there i think sarah stepped across to the cabinet knelt beside it and opened a door on its right yup here they are she reached in and withdrew a stack of red leatherbound volumes she passed them to bob then reached into the small fridge in the corner took out two bottles of budweiser uncapped them with a tool fixed to the wall and handed one to him wassup he muttered as he sat in a rocking chair the albums on his lap he glanced at the covers and saw from their labels that they were in decade order from the thirties on laying the others on the floor he opened the s volume and handed it to his wife this is where it should be she muttered sitting on a threeseater couch and wiping a line of foam backhanded from her top lip he watched her as she looked at the first few pages smiling at some photographs passing others by quickly she had reached only the seventh page when she stopped and turned the album towards bob look skinner had only known his fatherinlaw as an old man even then he had been strikingly handsome the photograph that his wife showed him filled a page of the book leo grace smiled out at him in his early thirties with moviestar looks that made even the man by his side seem ordinary the man by his side bob had been a child on the twentysecond of november barely halfway through primary school yet the memory of his parents shock when the newsflash confirmed his death had remained vivid the president must have been at least fifteen years older than leo a veteran of the war before his yet an innocent looking at the two of them razorsharp in their evening dress could have been forgiven for wondering which of the two was the leader they seem to be fairly chummy he murmured they were it was bobby whom dad never liked no it was really the other way round the attorney general didnt get on with him my father didnt care about him one way or another he never talked about it though that was the way jack wylie told it what else did jack say he asked as she turned back to the album he reckoned that bobby was jealous of dad and that he was afraid the new yorkers would pick him for the senate vacancy when it came up i can see why they might have but your father never ran did he no he decided against it was he warned off youre kidding if anyone had tried that he would have gone for it the truth for it was one of the few things he did tell me was that he felt it would have put the president in a difficult position if he had run having to choose whether to endorse his brother or his friend so when the offer to join the firm was made he decided to accept thinking that he might give it a run when he was a little older and a little richer he never did though did he tell you why sarah nodded yes he did she answered it was the assassination the effect it had on him he wasnt afraid she added quickly he wasnt afraid of anything after korea he said he left all his fear out there the thing that horrified him was that when they shot the president the first lady was in the car she could have been hit rather than him as well as him dad said that hed only have gone into politics with the intention of making it to the top of the tree but when he saw what happened in dallas he decided there and then that he could never put my mother in that position she stopped as she realised that he was gazing at her with a faint curious smile on his face you said they just now did you realise that did i well if i did thats what my father said because i remember having that discussion with him as clearly as if it was only an hour ago i was barely in my teens and president reagan had just been shot are you sure think again she closed her eyes for a second or two no i dont need to think again thats what he said he didnt say when the president was shot no goddammit he said when they shot the president but so what its a colloquialism almost lots of americans say that i suppose so he admitted letting the matter drop as sarah went back to the book she had not gone much further when she stopped staring at the pages that lay open in front of her look here she exclaimed he jumped from the rocking chair in a single easy movement and sat on the arm of the couch looking down at the album he saw two photographs one on each facing page the image on the left showed leo grace and another older man bob realised with a start that it was j edgar hoover with the vice president of the united states in the other he stood alongside dr martin luther king but it was not the photographs at which his wife was staring beneath each one was a rectangular shape whiter than the rest of the backing page two photographs have been taken from here she said the corner fixings are still in place even go through it and see if any others have been removed she did as he asked no longer studying the photographs only flicking from page to page looking for what might not be there no she said at last only those two still you should check the rest of the book just in case leo took those two out and theyre not the ones were looking for the photos you remembered could still be there she seemed to nod then shake her head all in one movement yes no wait there was something else she turned to look behind her at a series of shelves fixed so that they seemed part of the panelling dad had a football she exclaimed it was signed by the president and by all the guys they gave it to him after the last game he played with them he kept it on a shelf up there and now its gone he sensed her hesitation bob i hate to say this but this has been done by someone with access to all sorts of files and places someone who knew about the connection in the first place are you sure about joe doherty can you trust him in this bob drew in a deep breath i hear what youre saying honey this could be coming from inside and joe is inside very high up too except joe didnt hold us back on saturday when we went to see jack wylie i did if it hadnt been for me stopping on the boardwalk wed both have been on that cruiser when it went up on that basis alone i can trust him i trust my own judgement too joes straight if youre sure of that it reassures me but even at that where do the two of you go from here good question if we go anywhere we go very carefully however important joe might be but we do have a couple of leads for a start theres the mysterious hunting trip what exactly your father and jackson wylie took themselves off on a trip to the appalachians last january ostensibly to shoot deer dad never maybe not but the two of them did go off somewhere and that was the cover story id like to know where they stayed and who else was there although i can make a pretty shrewd guess then there are the laptops he added what computers wilkins garrett and wylie all had portable computers the first two were stolen from the crime scenes in montana and las vegas we think that wylies went up with the boat do you know if your father had a computer apart from that thing over there he pointed to the compaq on a table beside the television set if he had ive never heard of it but the ringing of the phone on the computer table interrupted her bob walked across and picked it up lieutenant dave schultz was on the other end no gun in the car sir he said ive just searched it as thoroughly as ive ever searched a vehicle without cutting open the panels there is no firearm there also ive rechecked the crime scene inventory and there is definitely nothing of that nature listed do you want me to check with at and f ive done that the scot answered or at least mr doherty has mr grace bought two matching glock s a couple of months back he kept one in his jaguar my bet is that the other was for the house and that hed have taken it to the cabin you want me to run another search no it would have been found by now if it was still there as he spoke to the detective the cathedral tones of the doorbell boomed out in the hall above sarah ran upstairs to answer its summons he thanked schultz and hung up then followed her out of the den he had assumed that the cleaning service had arrived finally and so he was slightly surprised to see a youngish man in the doorway following his wife into the house taken off guard skinner gave him the classic enquiring look of policemen everywhere bob said sarah with the faintest hint of sharpness this is lan walker our lutheran minister ive told you about him as well as being our pastor hes an old friend ian and i were at high school at the same time then later at college yes the newcomer concurred for a while i graduated two years before your wife he was a mediumsized man with dark crinkly hair and round piercing eyes informally dressed in a sports shirt and slacks sure confirmation in the circumstances bob thought that they were old friends indeed there was something in the way they looked at each other that made him wonder for a moment just how friendly they had been the mortician told me you were due in town this morning sarah the clergyman continued i had to come right away to express my condolences and to pay my respects thank you lan thats much appreciated wed have called you later today in any case we need to discuss the arrangements for the funeral service come through to the drawing room will you have coffee she realised that she had brought her budweiser upstairs with her or a beer walker smiled coffee will be fine you know how it is with us guys we cant be breathing fumes over the faithful not even us lutherans ill make it bob volunteered you go on through he headed for the kitchen as his wife ushered the minister through to the reception room i cant tell you how appalled i am by whats happened he said as the door closed on them babs is distraught too how is she asked sarah how are the kids shes very well she still looks like a teenager just like you knew her in school and matthew and daniel are growing by the day and yours mark our adopted son is turning out to be a mathematical whiz the other two james andrew and seonaid are just ordinary peaceable children even if jazz is built like an outhouse and eats more than his brother whos twice his age im happy to hear that babs is just the same i couldnt imagine her any other way than just as she is i must see her can you get a sitter tomorrow or wednesday maybe and come to us for dinner no said lan weve thought of that much better if we do it the other way round we thought that you might like to come to us on wednesday a couple of nights before the funeral service to talk about the running order as well as to catch up she yielded to his logic okay thats a date good i have to tell you that were getting in first if you see all the people whove asked me to pass on condolences and ask if they can call on you then youll have little or no time to yourself i have a list of all their names thanks she smiled at him but as she did she read something in his eye there is one in particular though when you and the baby were back home a couple of years back that time that you and bob had troubles in your marriage remember you came to see me and we had a heartto heart about a guy you were dating the guy you were with when we went out on that foursome she smiled at him hearttoheart indeed thats a sweet way of putting it truth was i used you like a confessor i told you that i had had sex with him sure and i didnt have any problems with that im one of your newfangled clerics sarah you know that as well as anyone but the thing is youll find the name terry carter on that list he called me last week and said that because he knew that i was your friend as well as your family minister hed like to ask me a favour he said that hed like to meet you when you got here to express his condolences in person damn she whispered is he in buffalo no he told me that he works in new york and he gave me a cellphone number for you to call should you decide to should i decide to yes should i she asked herself not if ive any sense but fact is lan ive always felt just a little guilty about the way i treated him i know he probably didnt want any more than to get himself fucked pardon my language padre but i didnt even want that not really she shrugged her shoulders and flashed him a quick grin okay i cant lie to you of all people sure i wanted it but i had other things in mind too i used him deliberately as a counterbalance against bob not to get even with him as such but to put us on the same footing for the future afterwards i tried to hate myself for it but i couldnt not like i did after you and i had our college fling when i knew all along how babs felt about you even if you didnt walker looked at the floor yeah he murmured but we were just kids then and we didnt do anyone any harm ive never felt guilty about that and ive never seen why you should any more than i see why you should feel guilty about terry carter or hate yourself for having a relationship with him given your circumstances at the time to lapse into professional language i dont see the sin in it as far as you and i went babs and i werent dating then thats in the past and it can stay there you and terry though im not advising you understand but from what youre saying it sounds as if theres some closure lacking there the phone rang beside her but she made no move towards it knowing that bob would pick it up in the kitchen maybe she conceded as it fell silent once more ill have to think about it she looked up at him you got that list on you skinner reached out and took the kitchen phone from its cradle on the wall the grace residence he answered you sound like the fucking butler said joe doherty tersely with none of his usual dry humour sounding in his voice kosinski if only i knew for sure i tried to call him myself on his issue cellphone but it was unavailable for connection so i sent two guys from the chicago office to intercept him at arthur wilkins office but by the time they got there hed already been and gone they werent briefed to interview wilkins so they left and reported back to me i called the guy myself and had him call the switchboard back to verify me i spun him a story that id wanted to catch troy at his office and with more than my usual subtlety asked if their meeting had gone okay he said that it had that kosinski had asked him about his father whether he had done or said anything strange recently he told him that last time he saw his father before he died he had given him an envelope he knew from the feel of it that it had a computer disk inside and he asked him what it was about his father replied that it was a copy of something on a new laptop he had bought a memoir of his time in the secret service he asked arthur if he would keep it in the office safe kosinski told him that the computer had been stolen when he was murdered but that if the disk did contain material relating to the service that might make it a matter of national security so he asked wilkins to give it to him and the guy after some thought did so troy thanked him and left interesting said skinner but it sounds on the upandup id agree replied doherty except for two things kosinskis cellphone is still out and i cant locate him plus this less than half an hour after i spoke to him arthur wilkins left his office to go home for lunch he was shot dead in its private parking garage just as he was climbing into his lexus my chicago guys heard the police department alert and called me and you guess right no the police didnt catch anyone suppressed fury exploded from the deputy director bob i have a renegade a fucking renegade within the bureau when i trace this bastard hes as good as dead hey cool down man who says youre going to have to trace him asked skinner you may be jumping to a big conclusion you kidding no im not kidding whether its kosinski whos been taking these people out or not the killer is a very clever guy he also has access to files and information that i suspect are beyond even you we suspected kosinski because of the timing of the explosion and the theory that it could have been set to kill us as well but this guy has the resources to hack into sophisticated computer systems and delete records do you think he couldnt have bugged jackson wylies office or the wilkins firm in chicago so why cant i contact kosinski now maybe his cellphone batterys gone soft maybe his pagers lying on the bathroom shelf maybe by now hes been taken out himself if that envelope wilkins handed over is significant you see your man may be a suspect but by now he may also be a victim if hes either the odds are that youll never see him again oh no why not if kosinski killed these people then after wilkins hes blown and hell disappear back into whatever outfit planted him in the bureau in the first place if he didnt and that envelope contained what i think it might have it made him a target as soon as he left the wilkins building if he has been killed theyll make him disappear so that you being essentially a dumb copper like me will assume that he was the bad guy all along i wish i was a dumb copper like you doherty grunted any way we can tell which is which no but if you find that wilkins was killed by a bullet from kosinskis bureauissue firearm youll know that hes gone one way or another he either killed him or they made it look as if he did they the same people who killed the president what the word escaped as a cutoff scream bob what the f skinner laughed okay okay okay calm down joe im about seven steps ahead of myself but heres what i know from sarah wilkins garrett and jack wylie were all members of the secret service back in the early sixties sharp kids straight out of law school looking for something extra on their curriculum vitae leo grace wasnt but he was one of their circle they all knew him because they all played on the presidents sunday football team and so did leo according to sarah he was the only guy there who wasnt in the service when leo left washington eventually they gave him a football signed by the man and all the guys thats been stolen from the house up here so have two photographs of the squad shit doherty squealed aye anyhow he settles in buffalo and a few years later he invites jackson wylie into his firm they all live happily ever after theres no mention ofgarrett or wilkins and no contact we know of either through the law or through their shared political interests then last january out of the blue wylie tells his secretary that he and leo grace who hasnt shot anything since korea are going to kill deer in the appalachians this is peculiar also since leo doesnt own a rifle id like to know who else went on that trip and where exactly they went id like to know also about the purchase by one of the four somewhere of three possibly four identical apple mac ibook laptop computers most of all id like to see the secret service duty rosters for november it would be interesting to know whether wylie garrett and wilkins were on duty that day why for gods sake the only time leo ever talked to sarah about those sixties years he referred to them shooting the president sure i know its just a word but leo weighed every word he used joe when all else fails i go by hunches in this case my nose tells me that these three guys either knew who killed the president or they did it themselves doherty sighed i dont know if i want to hear this bob if youre crazy im crazy for listening to you and if youre right im still crazy for listening to you he paused but what about leo how did he know my guess is that jack wylie told him at some point maybe not that hed done it but that there had been a plot and he knew who was involved i guess too that with old age looming and all it brings with it the three of them wylie garrett and wilkins may have decided that at the very least they had to make a record of the truth but they needed someone else someone from that time who could vouch for them all so wylie approached leo they met up in the appalachians or wherever and from that point they were done ill bet you joe that these guys have been watched from the day they left the service watched by who by whoever set up the assassination the cia the mafia another agency i dont know but theyve been keeping tabs on these guys for the last thirty years and more why not kill them back then then kill the guys who killed them where would it end how long before the last gullible american died and there was no one left to believe that oswald did it no you dont take that risk till you have to but when those three guys plus leo grace the presidents friend got together that time had come they must have realised the danger though or at least leo must have straight after that trip in january he went out and bought those two automatics there was a long silence skinner let it run its course kosinski said doherty after fully two minutes if it was kosinski why him why someone in the bureau deniability the organisation that planned or commissioned the hit wouldnt then or now use someone who led back to its door but like i said it may not have been kosinski he may be dead himself wait till they dig the bullet out of wilkins see if its fbi issue and if it isnt then theres a fair chance itll have come from a glock leos second gun is missing what will that tell us fuck all except that itll mean kosinski could still be in the game jeez so how dp we investigate all this you want to investigate it sure as hell i do i guess id better brief the director though can you trust the director bob could you trust kosinski aw hell okay what do i do use special agent brand have him go through the bank and credit card records of the other three guys i have access to all leos stuff see if they tell you where they were in january see what they tell you about those laptops thats all for now okay ill do that and ill ask for a copy of the wilkins autopsy report no you do the wilkins autopsy through your own people you have the authority father and son murdered in different states makes it your business yes youre catching on ill get chicago on to that be back in touch what about the secret service rosters now you are being crazy that stuffs off limits tell me joe arent all records in the us computerised by now pretty much and is the bureau the only law enforcement agency in the us that doesnt know how to hack into a computer bob you didnt say that i could have you deported just for thinking it never mind suggesting it to a federal civil servant ill call you skinner hung up the coffee filter had completed its programme and the jug lay steaming on the hotplate but he had forgotten his task entirely honey sarahs voice from the kitchen doorway brought him back into contact with his surroundings yes sorry bob are you all right you didnt seem with it there and its not the first time its happened since ive arrived im getting worried about you im fine honest i just had a call from joe thats all i got wrapped up in it ill bring the coffee through now forget it she said lightly lan had to leave we thought youd gone to colombia for the beans she walked across to the work surface and picked up a mug ill have one now though you he shook his head unusually he found that he had no taste for coffee did joe speak to his agent asked sarah bob looked down at her when they had been reconciled after their split part of their deal had been that there were to be no secrets between them none of any sort yet something held him back from answering held him back from telling her the whole story of arthur wilkins murder on the heels of kosinskis visit and dohertys phone call instinct told him to protect her from that knowledge to protect her from it all yet he did not know why not yet he answered and left it at that better to be economical with the truth than to bend it even as he spoke he saw something on her face that told him that she had a preoccupation of her own he said nothing leaving her to spit it out in her own time he had to wait for little more than a minute watching her as she sipped her coffee holding the mug in both hands bob she began remember when i was over here with jazz how could i forget he chuckled much as id like to yeah me too but that wont happen id just hoped that it would all stay in the past his smile turned into a frown yes the guy she said quietly the man i had an affair with when we were apart the guy you worked beside in the hospital i didnt work beside him exactly he was a visiting consultant in another department one that had nothing to do with me but yes the guy you mean the guy i told you about terry the thing is he wants to meet me does he now bob murmured his face unreadable he called ian when he read about the murders he knew that he and babs are the best friends i have in buffalo and he asked ian to pass on his condolences he said also that hed like to express them in person if id be prepared to meet him and do you want to no i dont i hoped id never see him again but he held up a hand listen sarah he said firmly you told me about you and him you hit me over the head with it in fact yes you told me why you let it happen you did it to put us on an equal footing in the infidelity stakes you said and ive always forced myself to see it that way yet when you boil it all down thats just an elegant way of saying that you did it to get even with me to be dead honest i wish youd put it that way from the start she looked away from him if thats the way you want to see it fine she snapped okay lets cut away the soft words and tell the truth of it you wrecked our marriage because you were wrapped up in your job and your obsessions and eventually wrapped up in screwing your lady detective sergeant you didnt have the guts to tell me that at the time though you just froze me out of your life so i came over here i missed you every moment waking and sleeping and worse my selfesteem was in pieces then someone took an interest in me he wasnt pushy he wasnt devious he saw me as an attractive unattached woman and he told me so better than that he made me feel attractive again when i slept with him i had decided more or less to go back to scotland but yes youre right i did feel that it evened the score between us whether you want to put it bluntly or gently as i tried to but if you want it straight here it is i also felt that i owed him for being there when you werent and for picking me up after you had knocked me down i felt that it was right to give him something of me and truth be told i wanted to i hadnt had any for a while since way before i left you as youll recall and i was missing it so why the hell not just the once you said bob murmured just the once i said last time i saw him the fact is i thought about spending the whole night with him but id have had to call and tell my mom where i was i felt guilty when i left him knowing that i wasnt going to see him again and knowing that id used him for mostly the wrong reasons ive always felt sorry that i didnt say goodbye properly he gave a short fierce laugh seems to me you couldnt have said it better sarah shot him a quick glance why do you feel the same about leona mcgrath she bit her lip almost as soon as she had said the words sorry cheap shot yes but so was mine he reached out put his hands on her shoulders and turned her to face him anyway so what all thats in our past and weve owned up to it both of us look love im not going to jeopardise what weve rebuilt by getting uptight over this he grinned at her even if ive got double standards just like most blokes and regardless of what ive done myself my natural instincts are to kick the shit out of anyone i catch screwing my wife if you feel you need to see this guy terry to sign off so to speak thats up to you i dont want to know and i sure as hell dont want to see him dont call him direct contact him through lan and arrange to meet him just dont do it anywhere that could compromise you and dont do it in too public a place either nowhere you could be seen and talked about he grinned grudgingly but to her enormous relief oh yes and dont go kissing him goodbye again either you going to like it here dyou think ray the head ofcid asked his assistant as they sat in the office that had been andy martins until the previous friday headquarters sir its a nicer building than torphichen place i have to say that actually son i meant are you going to like it in my office is the job going to be exciting enough for you id have said no thanks when i was offered it if id thought that sir its always been a wee bit exciting around you i dont see why it should change just because youre in this job jesus said dan pringle vehemently you think that and heres me hoping for a quiet couple of years up to retirement youve got a foot in every division now boss i dont see how that could happen you were hardly in the job when we had that murder down in leith aye but that could be our quota for a while we might not have another major investigation this year rising to leave detective sergeant ray wilding paused to throw the chief superintendent a sceptical look implying that a flight of pigs was passing the window as he did so there was a soft knock on the door and maggie rose came into the room not waiting for a summons got a minute sir aye sure mags pringle nodded to wilding on you go ray see you in the morning he waited as the visitor took the seat vacated by his assistant what can i do for you rose laid a brown a envelope on his desk remember that flyer you sent me from strathclyde she began the missing priest well hes not missing any more as the head ofcid drew out the report she took charlie johnstons polaroid from her pocket and laid it alongside it he died just over a week ago in a doctors surgery up in oxgangs death was certified by a dr amritraj an officer from my division attended and took that photograph and the body was removed by ambulance to the royal infirmary mortuary pringle beamed with pleasure magic he exclaimed reaching for his phone well just call strathclyde now and tell them to come and pick him up ah well clan said rose slowly its not going to be quite that easy the man im certain is father green was identified by dr amritraj as mr magnus essary of leightonstone grove hunters tryst the body was claimed next day by a woman named ella frances who said she was his business partner it was cremated at seafield last saturday morning aw shite pringle cried out why the hell did i not stay in a division the frances woman what do we know about her next to nothing dr amritraj gave pc johnston charlie johnston thats the man itll be right then big charlies a chancer but hes a sound copper sorry mags on you go okay amritraj named ella frances as the personal contact listed with the practice he gave johnston a mobile phone number ive checked with the practice already they had magnus essary listed all right but he had a fictitious nhs number the entry in their records was made by dr amritraj lift him said pringle immediately i wish i could rose countered but he doesnt work there any more he was a locum hired on a twomonth contract he didnt appear for surgery on tuesday and they havent seen him since he lodges with an indian family out in livingston ive got officers going out to see them now you know the chances of him being there bloody hell what about frances the mobile number she gave was a prepaid type it was bought in the name of ella frances all right but the address given was as phoney as essarys nhs entry pringle tugged at his moustache so violently that maggie wondered that he had any left what have we got here he muttered time will tell she answered but once my people confirm that amritraj has gone from his digs as well ill put a trace out for him right across the nhs since nothing else is as it seems in this business its a pound to a pinch of shit that father francis donovan green didnt die of natural causes i agree with you but how the hell did he come to wind up in a doctors in oxgangs in the middle of the bloody night good question clan well need to involve strathclyde in that end of the investigation father green came from north lanarkshire ive got a contact in cid there so if youre happy ill call him quietly and start them to work building up a profile of the man do that pringle exclaimed theres another thing you should do as well unless amritraj is stupid enough still to be in livingston you should get a warrant to search his digs and the surgery in oxgangs just in case the landlord and the doctors dont cooperate were no going to be able to do a post mortem on a pile of ashes so weve got to look everywhere we can to see if we can find out how he was killed i dont fancy the crown offices job in this one mags once we catch this fella someone in theres got to decide what the bloody hell we can charge him with mario ill search my memory banks all night if thats what you want but i promise you i never met either of those people stan reported to your uncle and me that he had been approached by a new importer wanting to rent space in the bonded warehouse we agreed and later he told us that a deal had been done he needed the signature of one trustee beppe said he would do it and that was that later i heard from stan that there was some difficulty with them but he said they were dealing with it and that i shouldnt bother he sighed partly out of relief that his mother had taken no part in the familys business with the elusive importers all afternoon since greg jays second call he had felt a growing unease a detectives sense that something was very wrong with the firm of essary and frances okay mum he said im waiting for stan to call me when he gets in ill get chapter and verse from him im sure yes im sure you will stans very efficient whats the fuss about anyway nothing really im just doing a favour for greg jay why is he interested in these people does he think they might have been involved in your uncles murder nah he just wants to eliminate them from his enquiries thats all christina mcguire snorted down the phone mario this is your mother youre talking to not the crime reporter from the evening news dont give me any of your official police language are these people suspects or not he laughed reproved no not exactly beppe had a dispute with them over the tenancy thats all greg needs to check them out but he cant find them i see you might have said that in the first place your colleague must be scraping the barrel thats all i can say whos going to resort to murder over a few feet of warehouse space youre absolutely right it has to be done though mum if you say so just make sure it doesnt distract your friend from pursuing the real criminal sophia and viola are at their wits end thats not very far mario thought but he knew better than to say it well catch him dont you worry hmm now youre talking like a policeman again good night darling night mum he cradled the phone and checked his watch it was pushing nine yet maggie still was not home she had called him to say that she would be delayed and that she would bring in a takeaway he was hungry enough to eat a bear but there was still no sign of his wife or of the chicken madras or the naan bread the phone rang stans late back too he muttered thinking it would be his cousins husband but he was wrong is detective superintendent rose in a man asked no but im a detective super as well will i do i suppose so sir the voice was smooth confident with a hint of a laugh in there this is di david mackenzie n division strathclyde police ms rose called me this afternoon and asked me to make some enquiries about a priest off my patch whos turned up dead on hers she said i should call her whenever id something to report mario had heard of bandit mackenzie from maggie flash was how she had described him but beneath that tooselfassured exterior she had also said there lurked one very good detective and that was not her view alone bob skinner seemed to rate the guy too fine do you want to tell me or leave a number for her to call you youll do sir its my wifes birthday today and im in bother as it is would you tell her that ive spoken to father greens curate father tomkinson i put him in the confessional so to speak i didnt tell him his boss was dead but i did lean on him a bit and he was a bit more forthcoming than in his first interview he admitted to me that the late father wasnt exactly celibate he liked the ladies and he liked them youngish and attractive naturally he was discreet about it he never fished in his own river so to speak he used to go cast his line through in edinburgh whenever he went off to visit his sister thats where he was really going how did the curate know this father green told him whether it was in formal confession or a casual conversation i dont know i didnt ask and the lad didnt say green said that he used to go down the pubs in the royal mile in his dog collar never failed he claimed his experience was that theres any number of women out there wholl jump at the chance to shag a priest its an interesting thought that eh sir any time you fancy an illicit leg over all you need to do is put on a dog collar ill bear it in mind inspector ill give your message to my wife youd better hurry off home to yours i just hope you dont find her dressing up like a nun when you get there mackenzie laughed nice one sir ill be in a bit late tomorrow if ms rose wants to talk to me about what the curate said did he mention any specific pubs no but now you mention it he said the busy pubs yes he did say that the busy ones thanks that cuts a few out good night inspector he hung up then made a brief note of mackenzies information on a pad beside the phone he had barely finished when it rang again this time it was stan coia on the line mario told his cousins husband briefly about greg jays problem murder investigations are about talking to people and knocking them off one by one as potential suspects thats all greg wants to do with essary and frances but we cant find either of them theres no answer at their registered address and no trace anywhere else have you got a contact for them ive got the address on the lease but i dont remember having any other details i can guess what the address is how did you set the tenancy up can you remember ella frances phoned me she said that she and her partner were starting an import business and they needed to show customs and excise that they had the facility to bond stock in the uk she asked if we rented out space i said yes we did she asked how much per square metre i told her and she said fine and asked to lease some for a year with an option for a further twelve months i sent her a standard draft agreement and told her wed want payment in advance she called me back a couple of days later i said that id draw up the official document and fixed a date for us to meet them to sign it i insisted that both of them had to sign it in person on the premises she huffed a bit but eventually they met beppe at the warehouse they did the business there and they paid up so youve got bank details cash mario they paid in cash i remember beppe bringing this wadge of money back to my office and asking me to bank it in the property account i when did all this happen last september and when did beppe write to them about terminating the lease a couple of weeks ago mmm he stood with the phone in his hand aware vaguely of the livingroom door opening is this significant mario asked coia could those two have been behind beppes murder i cant say yes stan he answered and i cant say no all i can tell you is that greg jay and i want very much indeed to speak to mr magnus essary and his partner from behind him there came a crash as a chicken madras takeaway still in its carrier bag hit the floor what did you say he turned and surveyed the scene incredulous is that our dinner on the floor he asked irrelevantly never mind that what did you say there what was that name you used he realised that he still had the phone in his hand sorry stan he said got to go he hung up and turned back to face her magnus essary he and his partner rented space in our bonded warehouse a while back beppe wanted to terminate their lease and they were kicking up about it greg jay wants to talk to him but he cant find him im not surprised maggie exclaimed magnus essary was identified as having died of a heart attack just over a week ago in a doctors surgery in oxgangs ah shit gregcan take him off the list then oh no he cant were one hundred per cent certain that the man identified as essary was actually father francis donovan green a parish priest from holytown in north lanarkshire who liked to cruise the royal mile pubs looking for friendly ladies with an eye for a new experience like screwing a priest so they could tell their pals about it how did he cut her off in midexclamation bandit mackenzie phoned a few minutes ago greens curate told him the whole story who certified the death a doctor named amritraj a locum whos now missing of course leaving a mountain of debt in his wake i was late home because i had to dig up a sheriff to give me warrants to search his digs and the surgery wheres he from goa in india he wont be goain back there then she groaned at his bad joke they both became aware at the same moment of the odour of spilled madras she bent to pick up the bag and carried it into the kitchen mario watched her as she scooped the curry into a pyrex bowl then transferred it to two plates laying a naan bread on each one he pulled up two stools and they ate hungrily at the breakfast bar what do you think all this business is about mario she asked he smiled his cheek bulged out with a chunk of saucedipped bread money he answered when he could two people go through all the motions of setting up a company they register they take commercial space they have a business address but they never use the space and they can only be contacted by mail through the address a rented house near where amritraj worked she interposed why would they do all that as a front of course smuggling he frowned at her how about insurance weve got an essary dead only he isnt really and who it turned out never existed in the first place not as essary anyway but what if theres a bloody great policy on his life the kind small companies take out to cover the death of directors so that their shares can be bought in maggie nodded what if indeed wheres the body up the chimney at seafield it was claimed by the partner of the so called deceased ella frances the same she had him cremated on saturday mario laughed out loud first thing tomorrow love youd better check with all the main corporate insurers a day in the rank she snorted and youre telling me how to do my job funny greg jay said much the same to me today here thats a point whose investigation is this anyway yours or his ritirtl onvn its dan pringles and you know what im going to see him right now he looked at her his frown back in place you do that he murmured and while you do im off to visit our paula no one else but beppe has seen essary that i know of at any rate but she was close to her old man you never know maybe she can shed some light i made that call to lan said sarah i told you i dont want to know anything about it okay i just thought dont start thinking about this at this stage bob snapped youll only confuse yourself she looked at him across the bedroom angered and hurt by his retort he softened at once and moved towards her hey im sorry love he said wrapping his arms around her in a great bearhug you do what you have to do its just that this is going to be a difficult week for you as it is im not sure you need this added complication you aint kidding there she murmured her voice muffled by his chest but i have to deal with it if im ever going to feel right about that time i wont mention it again i promise fine the main thing for you for us both indeed is to get through friday i know the meeting at the law firm whenever it happens is going to be tough too and theres something else i have to do before that whats that i have to see them bob i have to say my goodbyes i called the mortician and arranged it for this evening now i do understand that love do you want me to come with you she looked up at him her eyes glazed take me there please but give me some time on my own sure the phone beside the bed began to ring softly at first then growing in volume youd better take that said bob just in case its your reverend pal calling you back she nodded and went to answer the call he was on his way into the ensuite bathroom when he heard her speak joe hi how are you thats good yes hes here hold on he was already by her side hello mate he said as he took the phone what you got you want the interesting news or the really interesting news doherty answered work me up to really okay ill begin in new york troy kosinski large as life called me half an hour ago from the bureau office there he reported on his meeting with wilkins and he told me about the floppy he took from him i told him to send it to me by courier pronto did he know wilkins was dead when i told him he whistled and went wow read into that what you will have you recovered the bullet yet fast work but yes i have i commissioned a trusted pathologist in chicago rather than send someone in it was a nine millimetre could have come from a glock but itll take specialist testing to prove that it didnt come from kosinskis standard issue piece thats for sure okay but if he didnt do it and wilkins office was bugged how come he was allowed to get back to new york with that disk good question maybe well find out when it arrives at my home this evening skinner frowned joe your daughter lives with you if that thing is hot not a problem phils out of town with the airline skinner had forgotten that philippa doherty was a flight attendant she wont be back for a couple of days anyway the deputy director continued you wanna hear whats really interesting okay you know bob im always amazed by how open our socalled secret service really is goddammit it even has a website with the directors resume on it and every detail of its operation it has several functions but the one everyone knows about is presidential protection this openness doesnt extend to its personnel records though they are not for public consumption still i have some clever researchers here and sometimes i dont ask how they go about their work they tell me that wylie garrett and wilkins were indeed all on the presidential security team during but the really interesting thing about them is that november twentysecond of that year was the only day on which they were all off duty at the same time what do you make of that there was a long silence nothing said skinner at last i dont think i want to make anything out of it and at this point i dont think you should either joe too late to stop me now as van the man used to say hey you got me started on this thing buddy come on look at the circumstances the only day of the year bob the only day of the year when these three guys were off duty at the same time was the day when their man the president was shot now nearly forty years later they all get together in secret and a few months later theyre all dead now come on copper do you believe in that kind of coincidence no sighed skinner no i dont thats good dont want you going coy on me when its starting to light up my friend cos theres a twist my very clever researcher took things a little further he looked deeper into the careers of these three guys they were all still in the service five years later but they were no longer on the presidents team no on the fifth of june when bobby was shot wylie and garrett were working out of the los angeles office and wilkins was in san francisco you going to tell me they were off duty that day too or were they guarding him when that guy walked up to him and shot him the secret service didnt start to protect candidates until after bobby was hit so it doesnt matter whether they were on duty or not but two out of the three were based in la where it happened and bob there have always been conspiracy theories around that shooting just like the other one come on man dont tell me your detectives pulse isnt racing at the very thought of uncovering them skinner took a deep breath as he pondered what doherty had told him then let it out in another long sigh joe my friend he said im more than just a detective as you know back home i have connections to a national organisation that deals in secrets and i know the steps were prepared to take to protect them when theyre important enough but this isnt back home this is your country and i dont know what your people are capable of in the same circumstances what i do know is this if we have stumbled on to what youre suggesting then six people have died so far because of it as for my pulse it isnt racing as a matter of fact its beating nice and steady and i want it to stay that way i can see whats happening and i can also see that it could have been sanctioned very far up your national chain of command but its a crime bob doherty protested and im sworn to fight crime and uphold the federal law sure i know that so listen i got involved in something like this a few years back and i ended up killing someone i shot him in cold blood well no thats not quite true actually i was fucking angry with him at the time that was covered up too and so was he very quickly nasty things happen in the dark joe sometimes its better to leave the light off so you cant see them hear what im saying loud and clear so what are you going to do with that floppy when you get it if it turns out to contain what i think it does im going to print it and take it to my director what if he tells you to bum it then ill resign and give it to the washington post and what if your floppy turns out to have nothing on it ifkosinski is clean and he still had the thing when he got it back to new york whats the betting that before it gets to you someone manages to run a strong magnet over it and wipe it then my friend ill still have my ace in the hole this is the rest of it two days before he went off to meet up with leo grace jack wylie and bart wilkins in a small lodge in altoona pennsylvania sander garrett went into a computer store in vegas and purchased four identical apple mac ibooks he used mastercard incidentally we know that his and wilkins computers were stolen by their killer and we can assume that the same happened to leo graces i have no doubt that those machines were used to make four copies of a declaration a confession it may be of their knowledge of the dallas assassination and maybe los angeles as well id guess it may cover how they were recruited to the plot what the plan and layout was how the patsy oswald was put in place and also most important of all who gave them their orders why was leo there you said that yourself to legitimise the whole deal as an independent witness a person of standing who was around at the time and who could verify in the event of official denial that these guys were who they said they were doherty paused skinner thought he heard a chuckle so back to those computers three were stolen like i said the fourth went up in the explosion on wylies boat only this time there was no doubting the laugh those boys at apple mac make a damn fine computer you know its amazing what it or at least its central core the hard disk can withstand today we recovered what was left of jack wylies ibook my technicians reckon that with care they can recover the data thats stored on it one way or another bob the floppy or the hard disk ive got it the big scot sighed as doherty finished cowboy he exclaimed have you any idea how far this shits going to fly off the fan have i ever what about your career do you think youre going to get a medal for this maybe unless the director decides to grab all the glory for himself when i tell him if i were you pal said skinner heavily i would let him you dont need to ask me how close to my father i was mario you know quite well i inherited his pushy gene while our viola takes after my mother all the way theyre both classic types keep outa ma kitchen she mimicked in harsh scots italian but keep me outa the rest of the world he looked at his beautiful cousin her silver hair glinted in the flickering light of the candles arranged around the spacious apartment she was seated in a deep armchair barefoot her long legs tucked up under her with a goblet of red wine warming in her hands you know something else ive never asked my mother about it mind you but i think their marriage was arranged by papa or nana or maybe even both of them mario laughed quietly sure kid i know that ive known it since i was fifteen years old papa viareggio told me himself he said that when beppe was a lad they didnt trust him an inch and even less when it came to fixing himself up with a wife so the two old devils looked around for a nice quiet girl from a suitable italian family in other words one with no money folk who would just be grateful for the match and wouldnt try and influence the family business and they found auntie sophia from the belmontes in dunfermline nana knew your other granny as a girl she made the approach and a meeting was set up between your dad and mum they both knew the score plus your mother was a very attractive girl as she still is her mouth gaped open is that right she exclaimed thats what our grandfather told me you know paulie its a shame that you never really got to know the old man but you were just too young for him to take you under his wing the way he took me plus of course youre a girl thats why the trust was set up as it was with beppe in ultimate control then me she smiled in the candleglow she looked devastatingly beautiful so papa was an old chauvinist was he yes but no more than your father was they were both wary of women with ambition which is ironic since papa was ruled by the most ambitious woman ive ever met nana too right our granny is the archetypal matriarch thats why my mother made her way outside the family she knew that our hive could only support one queen with every respect to beppe my mums forgotten more about business than he ever knew yet papa only gave her the minor role in the management of the trust and he ensured that ultimately it passed to me rather than you regardless of how we grew up youre just like him you know said paula i looked through my dads office today and i found an old piece of cine film that had been transferred to video it was a family thing a holiday in italy when dad and aunt christina were kids papa must have been around the age you are now and honest to god mario it could have been you i was a bit scared of him when i was a kid and of you too i imagined all sorts of things about him i really did think he was a godfather type and i thought that you were a sort of apprentice he wasnt though mario told her he was one of the most honest men i ever met even if he was one of the craftiest too you were wrong about him and youre wrong about yourself as well youre just like my mother youve got nanas blood flowing in your veins too thats why she doesnt trust you she stared at him in amazement that might just have been genuine what my own granny doesnt trust me its true she doesnt because she knows she cant control you she even told me to keep an eye on you hah doesnt she know that youve been keeping an eye on me for years only discreetly and i havent really been keeping tabs on you id rather you thought that ive been looking out for you i was worried when i heard that youd gone into the sauna business especially those ones the guy who used to own them was the biggest fucking hood in edinburgh until he got topped are you happy now now that i understand why you did it yes i am he flashed her a smile where did you get the money to buy them anyway go on tell me paula sipped her wine the air between them was sizzling and they rtcau snui both knew it if you insist she said but dont blame me if you dont like it your mother gave it to me it was marios turn to gasp in astonishment you what sorry but its true are you imagining the headlines detectives mammy bankrolls brothels is that it could be he retorted well relax theres nothing to connect her with the businesses so how did you talk her into it i didnt have to your mother and i arent strangers you know shes my favourite aunt and we talk we were sharing a bottle in a restaurant in leith one night and a prostitute walked past the window auntie chris gave one of her classic humphs i thought she was disapproving until she started on about a society that forced women to walk the streets like that and about how anyone who thought you could make prostitution disappear by outlawing it was off their head she said that what we should really be doing was giving women like that decent working conditions and regulating what they did rather than arresting them for it i said that to an extent that was what was happening in the saunas but that the danger there was that the wrong sort of people might get to own them i mentioned tony mansons saunas being for sale and she said why didnt i buy them then and run them the way they should be run i said buy them with what and thats how it came about she put up most of the money and i bought them through a shell company no one knew about it but auntie chris and me till you started sniffing around marios eyes narrowed slightly you mean you really didnt tell your father no way did i hed have raised merry hell if i had done and got my mother all worked up too my dad might have liked a bit of skirt but he was prudish too all right he did find out on the grapevine eventually he wasnt best pleased to put it mildly he said i was on my own that hed never set foot in such places and that if i came a cropper he wouldnt bail me out then why the hell he frowned paulie remember that wee girl i asked you about the one who said she knew you ivy brennan yes she asked me straight out one day what i had to do with the bonnington sauna she said shed seen me going in there a few times at first i thought she was implying i was on the game but actually she asked me if there would be any chance of a job there what did you tell her the truth i told her that she looked about fifteen and that shed attract the wrong sort of customer you know what i mean there are guys out there who have a physical need to get their ashes hauled every so often and my places cater for that but there are other guys too perverts and i wont have any truck with them anyway what about ivy maybe nothing only im trying to work out why she told me she had seen uncle beppe having a shouting match in the doorway of the bonnington place with someone inside youre kidding no then she was not only would my dad not have set foot in one of my places he wouldnt have had an argument in public either no mario mused he wouldnt would he not uncle beppe yet thats what she told me she called me yesterday and said she had to see me thats what it was about paula smiled is that all it was about he took a deep breath and grinned back at her well no she did have something else in mind but she had to tell you something to get you to see her so she made up that story knowing that the place was mine i suppose so hey mario you didnt did you certainly not the fact is with her kit off she still only looks about fifteen gradually his frown deepened he sat in the chair facing his cousin but staring into the far corner of the room whats up asked paula breaking the silence do you wish you had now no just a thought that occurred to me thats all she shook her head bloody policemen you never stop working i went out with a copper for a while a bloke called stevie steele he was exactly the same in the middle of god knows what hed be away in another world mmm he murmured our stevie eh he never told me that when we worked together probably because i told him i still fancied you something rotten what else did you tell him nothing that didnt happen she answered mischievously are you kidding me she raised an eyebrow and smiled maybe yes maybe no well if youre not hes discreet ill say that for him but back to this world did uncle beppe ever mention to you anyone called magnus essary never sure certain or ella frances no why were trying to find them thats all he saw her stiffen momentarily are they suspects no theyre just a lead were having trouble following up sorry i cant help then he stood up from his chair never mind but if you do find anything to do with either of them let greg jay know i will do promise she gazed up at him and candleflames twinkled in her eyes you sure you have to go she whispered he took a step towards her leaned down and kissed her long slow soft breathtaking until eventually she broke off with a cross between a gasp and a sigh yes paulie he murmured wickedly im absolutely certain dan pringle sat with his face buried in his hands where are you when i need you bob skinner he exclaimed in a muffled grunt the coffees on the dining table had grown cold in their mugs as maggie had explained the remarkable appearance in two investigations of the late magnus essary a man who it seemed was not so dead after all he looked up and across at her youre telling me that this father green was picked up in a pub by some young tart killed in some way or another and certified as a heartattack victim by this bent doctor amritraj whos now done a runner himself rose added youre also telling me that this same magnus essary and his partner ella frances who claimed the body and had it cremated set up a wineimporting company together and rented space in the viareggio family warehouse which they never used and when the deal was done the only guy who saw either of them was beppe viareggio himself that sums it up and your theory is that it has to be an insurance scam its got nothing to do with the wine business that was a pure front theres no evidence that they imported a single bottle my bet is that if we trawl round the major companies well find a large term insurance policy written on the life of magnus essary why would they set up a company to do that asked pringle i can think of a couple of reasons better rates for a start also its common practice for small businesses to have big policies on the lives of key people but an individual doing it might attract more attention and if youre right how quickly would they pay out after a death i have no idea thats one of the many things we need to find out which is why im here tonight who does the finding out this man essary is central to a crime thats been committed in my territory but greg jays looking for him as well we dont want to duplicate effort so she let the rest of her question hang in the air hes yours maggie the head ofcid answered at once you picked the ball up so you run with it ill brief jay in the morning do you need anything from me other than that decision i dont think so but if i do ill give you a shout dont worry what do you plan to do then ask around the major life offices first thing in the morning thats top priority but im also going to find out as much as i can about essary starting at the general register office good idea pringle muttered do we go public on this he added almost to himself please no clan said rose quickly the real essary is still out there thinking hes got away with it ive already got strathclyde to agree not to release the news that father greens been traced i need him to think that hes in the clear okay you play it that way but dont be surprised if hes no just in the clear but in the bloody bahamas by now are you going to be able to talk to me about your new job she asked neil mcllhenney propped himself on an elbow and looked down at her then reached under the duvet and pinched himself on the right buttock hard enough to make himself wince what are you doing she asked again amused making sure im awake he answered and that i really am in bed with louise bankier actress im surprised youve never caught me at it before youre in bed with your wife my darling what my day job used to be is irrelevant its yours that matters now not to the kids it isnt have you any idea how many brownie points theyve picked up at school since you and i got hitched laurens become a sort of icon among her pals and as for spencer ive told that wee bugger that if i ever catch him selling your autograph again ill ground him for a year he reached over and flicked a strand of hair away from her eye anyway youre not completely out of your day job they havent even finished the edit of your edinburgh movie and therell be the premieres and all that other stuff well the kids will love that too but once its over im out of the business for at least five years thats what i promised you and i will stick to it its a promise i never asked you to make i know thats what makes it all the more important to me im your wife neil and ive never been so happy in any role honestly she looked him in the eye remember what i said about me having a baby he gasped youre not are you no not as far as i know anyway however i have been to see a specialist up at the murrayfield hospital and she assured me that physically everythings fine and that theres no reason why i cant we know youre in good working order youve just proved that so he laughed ill keep my efforts up so to speak but remember its pot luck at the end of the day i know look at maggie and mario how long have they been married now his expression changed ah but that isnt a matter of luck well maybe it is but its bad luck on marios part randy big sod that he is hes unfortunate in that respect dont tell him i told you though as if i would its bad luck for maggie too though i know she maintains her careerwoman image but the truth is i think shed like to have a baby she tell you that not exactly its just a feeling i have but dont you mention it to her of course not he ran a finger round the edge of one of her big brown nipples speaking of keeping secrets i know this sounds a bit silly in this day and age but when youre doing the publicity interviews and stuff for the new movie if any joumo asks you about me and about what i do tell them im a copper thats fine but dont get specific okay i mean i will talk to you about my job but it is a bit sensitive and i wouldnt hold it long if it was mentioned in hello magazine and the like i understand i promise my angel you will remain a man of mystery as far as my public is concerned she gave a shiver under his touch hey she murmured do that some more im approaching peak fertility just now you know neil moved closer to her ill have to see what i can do then he was about to show her when the bedside phone rang mcguire she heard him growl as he picked it up this is just like the old days when you were single and used to phone me at all bloody hours perish the thought his friend answered im sorry pal and say sorry to lou as well but this is important and i didnt want to call you about it from home in the background neil could hear soft music where the hell are youthen im at paulas wed some business to discuss you just watch it there son i remember her from the old days as well aye but were grown up now though listen now you got a pen handy as always right get it because theres some stuff i need checked out on the qt and i cant do it myself without making waves its the sort of thing thats best handled through your office not mine i need chapter and verse and i need it damn quick bob skinner sat in the waiting room of the place that morticians or undertakers around the englishspeaking world describe discreetly as the chapel of rest the showroom for their skills as he thought of it he had seen his parentsinlaw in death and although he knew that they would look vastly different when presented to their daughter he did not wish to repeat the experience he had been in similar places before in his life for his parents for his maternal grandmother who had died when he was twentytwo and for myra his first wife whose death in a speeding car had haunted him for almost twenty years to a point at which it had become the catalyst for his brief separation from sarah no he had sworn and he had meant it the next time he would be in another of those softlit wellventilated rooms the serene madeup face in the whitelined coffin would be his own he sat alone with his grim thoughts for twenty minutes for most of that time he pondered the chain that he and doherty had uncovered connecting the four men who had met a few months before in altoona pennsylvania and who had all died violent deaths if the fbi hackers had indeed uncovered the truth about their service past then circumstantial or not it was dynamite and if their record of those days did exist and said what doherty believed it could go nuclear yet skinner was wary he was an experienced detective with the hunting instinct of a jungle animal but he was in someone elses forest now a place where the prey had sharp teeth too he snapped back to the present when the waitingroom door opened sarahs freshened makeup just failed to hide the blotches around her eyes but she was composed okay he asked okay she replied they walked through to the reception area of the funeral home where mr poe the splendidly named mortician was waiting for them he handed sarah a white envelope that is a note of the timings which we agreed for the funeral service and for the burial the hearse and your limo will call at your residence at ten after ten precisely on friday morning well be ready said skinner im sure sir there is one change of which i have to advise you the senators office just called me to express her profound regret that she and her husband will not be able to attend after all theres a confirmation hearing that may come to a vote on friday and its essential that she be there he feels that it would not be appropriate for him to come alone thats a pity yes it is sir however if i may say so it may be a blessing in disguise i once officiated at a funeral where president nixon was a mourner and the requirements of the secret service left me in no doubt as to who was really in charge of proceedings its unfortunate for you though in that it denies you the opportunity of meeting our former president ive met him bob told him casually mr poe was lost for words for a microsecond ah he exclaimed in that case sarah kept her face straight until they were outside in the car park where her smile escaped that was wicked the poor man was only being an american you could have gone along with him maybe he replied straightfaced but i dont like politician worship at any level i dont like politicians period anyway its true i have met him he offered me a cigar okay hes got more charisma than all the hollywood alist put together but hes still a politician as far as im concerned they should be an endangered species in this country honey she said quietly they are a small shiver ran through him he was on the brink of telling her about dohertys discoveries but stopped himself instead he reached into his pocket and switched on his cellphone it showed one call unanswered at first he thought it might be joe but when he checked the log he found that it was from the private handphone of sarahs lawyer clyde oakdale interim successor to jackson wylie as senior partner of her fathers firm he made the return call and handed the phone to sarah as it was put through clyde youre working late he heard her say as he opened the jaguar with its remote and walked towards it he was in the drivers seat with the engine running when she ended the call and slid in lithely beside him the meeting he asked yes he wants to do it tomorrow he says itll take him that long to complete the audit of dad and mums estate what time five she answered he heard an awkwardness in her voice bob i know youre named as joint executor but clyde said that hed like to see me alone for the formal reading its the way dad wanted it apparently you dont mind do you he smiled and shook his head i never questioned anything leo did when he was alive im not going to start now well be a bit tight for the walkers though arent they expecting us around six yes but how about if you go there on your own and ill join you once im finished with clyde you can walk to their place from here its only a couple of blocks yes i suppose i could do that thats good she reached over and patted his hand okay thats all todays difficulties over what are we going to do now he grunted i reckon its about time you got some sleep then tomorrow im going shopping shopping too right i left home with a case packed for a few days in malaysia i have to buy a suit thats appropriate for a funeral in buffalo how quickly do you want this maam stevie steele asked mmm maggie rose lowered her coffee mug from her lips and glanced back across the table at the recently promoted detective inspector sorry i was away somewhere else just for a second late night does it show i suppose it must i feel bleary enough yes i had to go and see mr pringle about this thing and then mario got in from paulas at god knows when to answer your question stevie i want it to be exhaustive first and urgent second ive established that when this ella frances woman registered the death she asked for five copies of the death certificate thats more than the norm why would she need that many it suggests to me not just that were right and there was an insurance policy on essarys life but that there might have been more than one so take as long as you need shed need at least one certificate for the undertaker so dont stop till youve been round all the life insurers or until youve traced four policies give it top priority though this is a key part of a murder enquiry and its down to you steele nodded understood maam ill get on it right away he stood then paused by the way maam he asked is there anything on the viareggio case yet nothing i want to talk about even to you why do you ask suddenly the detective normally confident looked awkward i thought you might know i went out with paula viareggio for a while it never got too serious we were friends as much as anything else no the superintendent answered truthfully i never heard about that did you know beppe yes i met him almost by accident it was we were out for a meal and he came into the place with a couple of pals he came over and she introduced us he was not at his most charming i have to say hed had a drink and when paula told him what i did he said in this loud voice that the whole restaurant could hear oh dear no im not having another policeman in the family or words to that effect and then he said to me a lot quieter confidential like you want to watch her son shes an effing pimp you know nice man rose nodded uncle beppe had his faults ill agree how did paula take that the inspector whistled i never knew she had a temper until then she went dead white and the look she gave him scared even me there was a steak knife on the table she picked it up and started out of her seat i grabbed her wrist quick and forced her back down i told her father it would be a good idea if he went somewhere else and he did she scared him sober ill tell you was that the only time you met him yes it was never the same after that between paula and me about a month later we decided to pack it in you both decided well she said it first but i didnt argue did you know what beppe meant by his remark no i never asked and she never said the superintendent sighed i almost wish youd never told me that story stevie but you have so i have to ask you whether you think you have to tell it to detective superintendent jay as well steele sat back in the chair he had just vacated ive been asking myself that maam thats probably why i brought up the subject to get a bit of guidance you dont really need it though do you no ill go to see mr jay today like hell you will youll concentrate on our investigation get greg to send a couple of officers along here to take a statement from you he stood once more very good maam but to tell you the truth i dont see her having done it there and then maybe but not in cold blood like that why not asked rose she surprised you that night tell me do you know anything about other men in paulas life steele took a deep breath as he considered his answer there werent all that many as far as i could tell i remember she did say to me once that she was a oneman woman but that there were lots of reasons why that couldnt happen actually i was pretty certain that she was talking about her brotherinlaw stan coia after he had left the room maggie sat for five minutes staring at the wall she thought about calling mario to tell him steeles story but decided that some news is better broken in person eventually she stirred herself looked at her private address book picked up the telephone and dialled a direct line number in the general register office it rang three times before a cheery voice answered glossop jim hello its maggie rose here central division cid remember me of course i do you were in bob skinners office a while back werent you the statisticians accent had originated in the north of england and had remained untarnished by decades in scotland thats right i wasnt sure whether youd still be in yours though hah you just caught me my bags are packed and im ready to go i take early retirement next week can you do me a favour for the road then sure what do you need everything you can tell me about a man named magnus essary his death aged fortynine was registered in edinburgh just over a week ago we have no leads to next of kin the mans a mystery is the body unclaimed then no it was claimed next day by his business partner a woman named ella frances but we cant find her she paused jim im going to tell you something thats very confidential the death was registered as that of magnus essary but it wasnt him at all we know whose the body really was and it certainly wasnt his bloody hell the registrar general wont like that its a serious offence to make a false statement to a registrar its a serious offence to kill someone as well this man was murdered were sure of it but thats another problem the body was cremated at the weekend who signed the death certificate a locum doctor why cant you arrest him not for the want of trying but hes vanished too how about the partner her names ella frances but we know even less about her probably shes in her twenties but frances could be a married name and ella could be short for a few things aye said jim glossop it could couldnt it essary was fortynine you say yes she spelled the surname for him leave it with me ill get back to you soon jim yes too bloody right he laughed remember im retiring next week my first leaving do is tonight and after that i wont be worth a stuff she hung up and went back to her intray cursing manny english and willie haggerty for their combined roles in introducing her to the job of divisional commander of operations yet interested in spite of herself in the different tasks and responsibilities which the role involved gradually she became immersed in the papers before her considering each one delegating most tasks but taking command decisions on a few to her surprise she was actually annoyed when the phone rang interrupting her mags dan pringles gruff voice enquired yes sir there was background noise on the line she guessed that the head of cid was on the move im on the al on the way to gifford i want you to head out there and meet up with brian mackie and me at the goblin ha you know it sure its right in the middle of the village fine as quick as you can then but i want you to bring charlie johnston with you brians got another deid bloke up the lammermuirs we want him to look at you know sir when i phoned you i didnt expect you to come yourself come on son replied detective superintendent gregory jay amiably id hardly send a dc to interview a di now would i im glad i did come too that was a very interesting story you just told me maybe so sir stevie steele interposed quickly but i wouldnt read too much into it i would though inspector i surely would you have to prevent the woman from attacking her father with a knife and later hes found shot dead two years later sir yes and so what that makes her a suspect in my book and it would in yours too if you hadnt been so personally involved steele said nothing for he knew that jay was right what about this chap coia the superintendent continued what did you make of him nothing much i met him a couple of times casually but he didnt make any impression on me his beard was his most interesting feature i reckoned i could see that he and paula hit it off though they were comfortable together or maybe she was just sorry for him being married to her sister shes an absolute mouse beside paula you dont really fancy coia and paula for this do you sir jay smiled start thinking with your policemans brain son and not with your dick you slept with her so she cant be a murderer is that what youre saying the fact is ive got no one else to fancy for this but a stray lead to this character essary and his partner frances but where are they who said they ever existed maybe they were just a front for coia and your bird fictional culprits set up for when they did in her father steele hid his surprise clearly dan pringle had chosen not to tell jay about the couples involvement in the death of father francis donovan green but why would they do it sir beppe viareggios murder was premeditated and planned okay paulas got a temper but theres nothing coldblooded about her money son what else the father controlled the business and they wanted him out of the way but paula doesnt inherit control she told me that when we were going together mario mcguires mother becomes head of the family business and after her mario does or are you going to tell me that detective superintendent mcguires involved in this as well jay sat bolt upright in his chair certainly not he snapped well thats where your logics taking you said steele quietly go with paula as a suspect and youre bringing him into it as well are you ready to go to dcs pringle and to the dcc when he gets back and tell them that the drive to gifford went by mostly in silence charlie johnston sat in the passenger seat content he was back on day shift and did not mind one bit that he had been hauled off patrol to go on a jaunt with a detective superintendent he liked the country too and spent the latter part of the journey staring out of the window admiring the scenery on the winding approach to the village nestling at the foot of the lammermuirs dan pringle was waiting for them leaning against his car when rose drew up outside the goblin ha hotel she rolled down her window as he approached wheres brian she asked hes waiting for us what hes gots no here its up the lammermuirs a couple of backpackers found it this morning well take your car up there this used to be your patch so you know the way without waiting for agreement or invitation he opened the rear offside door and climbed in maggie felt her blood run cold she had been on the lammermuirs before and pringle knew it at the scene of a terrible air disaster which had ended so many peoples lives and changed several more irrevocably she had never been there since nevertheless she clenched her jaw and drove off out of the village and up the winding undulating road that led to the great heathercovered moor they seemed to go on for miles until they reached the junction offering a choice of routes to duns cranshaws on the left longformacus on the right take right grunted pringle from the back you got wellies on she asked as she followed his direction no why should i its been fine weather for days thats right so the addersll be out sunning themselves there are a lot of them up here you know she took a quick glance in her rearview mirror and was quietly pleased to see the head ofcids frown beside her charlie johnston flinched suddenly his day out seemed a little less cushy she drove on looking straight ahead as they passed the crash site she guessed that they had reached the highest point to the road when they saw the vehicles pulled into a layby a patrol car an audi estate a nissan saloon and an ambulance on the other side of the singletrack carriageway a land rover was parked on the heather as she looked towards it the tall domeheaded figure of detective superintendent brian mackie stepped out of the front passenger seat afternoon he said as they approached it was two minutes past midday but mackie was famed for his precision hello brian pringle answered where is it then its not far but ill take you in the fourbyfour rose followed behind the head of cid and the constable looking on amused as they picked their way through the heather to the waiting vehicle they scrambled on board awkwardly in the cases of pringle and johnston and the uniformed driver set off up a steady incline no one spoke as they drove johnston knew his place while the senior officers knew that the questions in their minds would be answered soon enough the terrain was rough even in the agile wagon maggie found it impossible to judge how far they had travelled but as they drew to a halt she looked at her watch and saw that they had been travelling for around three minutes were here said brian mackie superfluously as he opened the door and jumped out this way he nodded towards a group of whitecoated men and women spread out in a line around thirty yards away heads down studying the heather intently at their centre a big white frame tent had been erected mackie headed towards it pringle rose and johnston following close behind as they reached it the flap opened and a tall young man stepped out maggie recognised him at once hello dr brown she said cheerfully havent seen you since north berwick the medial examiner smiled a touch ruefully im sure youre very nice socially superintendent he replied in a light irish accent but every time our paths cross professionally youve got a real ripe one for me cause of death doctor mackie asked briskly as it seems id say gunshot wound from close range in the back and through the heart death would have been instantaneous is the bullet still in situ the doctor shook his head not a chance you might find a fragment but youll be lucky theres an exit wound the size of a golf ball in the chest heavy calibre weapon undoubtedly was he killed here id say not theres very little blood around the body no he was shot somewhere else and brought kere when i honestly havent a clue hes been dead for several days but if i ventured anything more than tliat it would be pure guesswork its been warm so that would accelerate decomposition and a few things have been gnawing at him too many variables ill leave that to the pathologist fair enough said mackielet me have your report as soon as you can he turned to the driver jimmy give the me a lift to his car and then come back as the doctor left he tumedtowards the tent with a glance at pringle its all yours sir i want nothing to dowith it the head of cid retorted thats what charlies here for on you gojohnston take a look the big constable stared atliim the sir aye you did you think superintendent rose brought you as her bodyguard take a look at the deceased and tell us if youve seen him before johnston paled visibly very good sir he answered on you go charlie said ease lifting the flap once more ill come in with you she had known since pringles phone call who or what they were likely to find it was breezy on the moor md the air was redolent with the scent of heather as soon as they stepped inside the tent another smell overwhelmed them the odour ofrecent death maggie steeled herself to ignore it as she had done many times before at her side she heard the constables stomach heave the photographers had finished their work the body lay on its back staring upwards through sockets whose eyes had been supplanted by a mass of yellow movement it was fully clad but the shirt had been ripped open below the ribcage and sc had the abdomen the work of foxes or carrion birds rose guessed tley had been at work on the face too but it was still recognisable as a human being possibly for skin discoloration made it uncertain of asian descent well charlie she asked do you know him i know its not pleasant but take a good look as if she had pulled some internal trigger the constable vomited voluminously against the side of the tent pringle must have been standing close to it for his muffled curse floated in from outside rose waited until johnston had calmed himself okay she said now thats out of the way the big veteran sighed and leaned over looking the corpse in the face he stared at it for almost a minute before straightening up its yon doctor he announced at last the one frae up in oxgangs dramritraj thats the boy its him all right he looked down again so what did you get yourself into my mannie he pondered more than he could handle rose muttered thats for sure thanks charlie youve done your bit she held the flap open for him and they stepped outside into the clean air once more she nodded to pringle its him all right looks as if mr essarys been cleaning house he doesnt take any chances this fellow does he it was a bit of a chance leaving him up here was it not the dcs grunted not really this place is vast we were very lucky that those walkers happened upon him when they did another day or two in the open and hed have been unrecognisable fine brian mackie exclaimed are you two going to tell me what this is about now aye said the head of cid i think we can the stiff is dr raj amritraj we were after him in connection with an investigation that maggie has underway at the moment as you can see someone didnae want us to find him you stand down on this one brian its part of the ongoing investigation and maggiell handle it send all the technical reports and witness statements to her and tell the pathologist to do the same with the pm report with pleasure i wish all my murder investigations were that easy as he spoke the land rover appeared at the top of the rise above them lets get back then pringle grunted they were halfway to the vehicle when maggies mobile phone rang she stopped in her tracks and took it out leaving the others to go on ahead yes she answered tersely miss rose yes sorry thats all right we cant be too careful these days jim glossop here i rang your office and a young lad there gave me this number i told him to do that but i admit i didnt expect you to call back so soon she heard a chuckle ah the things we can do these days it makes me sorry in a way that im retiring maybe i can get some freelance work off your lot compiling criminal stats and the like he seemed to sense her impatience anyhow ive got a result for you magnus essary no middle name was born on the fourth of august fortynine years ago in bathgate west lothian his parents were alexander and margaret essary mothers maiden surname smith residing at dundee terrace edinburgh no one else of that name registered in that year or during the tenyear periods before or after thats great jim at least it gives us somewhere to start looking i can probably tell you exactly where to start looking i did another check just out of curiosity your man essarys going to earn himself a special place in our museum according to our records this is the second time hes died poor little magnus succumbed to meningitis aged three years and one month maggie threw back her head and stared up at the blue sky now why doesnt that surprise me she murmured in that case said glossop this wont either i did another check off my own bat this time i looked at infant deaths in the edinburgh area over a fifteenyear period between twenty and thirtyfive years ago under the name frances guess what little ella frances of prince street polwarth edinburgh died of leukaemia at the age of fouranda half just under twentyseven years ago shed have been about thirtyone now had she lived the two deaths were nineteen years apart but they both took place in the same registration district in edinburgh i cant check this from here but ill bet you a pint of guinness that both those children are buried in the same cemetery someones gone round looking at gravestones taken the details and then gone along to register house and picked up copies of each of their birth certificates can you check that rose asked dan pringle looking back at her from the open door of the land rover read the urgency on her face i have done already they were both issued to the same person on the second of july last year she said she was a research student doing some genealogical work the clerk took a note of her name and address as usual and what was it paula viareggio penthouse one colliers court leith the cellphone slipped from maggies fingers to land softly on the heather at her feet you shouldnt be telling me this stevie said mario mcguire mind you when we worked together last year you might have mentioned that youd been giving my cousin a seeingto maybe but it was all over by that time and i didnt want to dig it up again as for the other thing im telling you put it down to professional courtesy appreciated thanks you dont really think that jays going to pull paula in for questioning do you its hard to say steele replied evenly down the line but hes under pressure to come up with something the new head of cids got a hard act to follow and hes not going to fancy starting off with an unsolved investigation still hed better be careful if he involves me in it even by implication i really will do the bastard that would sound really great if this call was being recorded wouldnt it true mcguire muttered ruefully the sooner we find this essary man the better how are you getting on with your inquiries maggie told me what she was going to have you do dont tell her i told you first said the inspector but im finished good news she wont see it that way there were four policies on the life of magnus essary each one with a majorleague edinburghbased insurer for a quarter of a million claims were submitted in each case on tuesday last week all four companies have paid out two on wednesday one on thursday and one on friday the cheques were all paid into a clydesdale bank account in the name of ella frances it was closed yesterday and the funds were transferred to a numbered account in a bank in basel can the money be frozen there thats doubtful given the reputation of the swiss but chances are it will have been moved again by now itll be pretty well untraceable as will magnus essary and ella frances mcguire grunted have you put out an allports alert i wanted to talk to my boss first whats stopping you shes not here i went to look for her but young haddock her gopher told me that she had a call from dcs pringle and headed off to meet him with a big fat pc in tow if i were you stevie i wouldnt wait for her coming back its too late to be coy about essary now you get that alert out pronto mind you its a case of for what its worth if theyre travelling as essary and frances then my passport says im cliff richard i wondered how long it would take you to get to a loose end bob acc willie haggerty laughed are you worried that edinburghs descending into lawlessness with the chief on holiday this week and you in the states i have no doubt skinner replied his voice echoing on the satellite link that my city is safe in your hoary hands but i just thought id give you a call to say hello see how youre doing im doing fine big fella just fine hows it with you hows sarah coping simply coping is not a term you apply to my wife she deals with life with a capability thats just well fucking awesome as they say over here were more or less set for the funeral on friday the cleaners have done their bit here at the house and now shes taking me out to find a caterer for a reception afterwards how about the investigation it seems to have run into a series of brick walls from what i gather not mind you that the police need to tell me anything im just a civilian you understand aye and so was attila the hun haggerty barked but still if theyre stalled and its over a week we know what that usually means we do willie we do it means theyre stuffed so hows it going over there anyway have i missed any action the dcc heard a loud booming laugh in his ear have you ever and im loving it pringles taken over from andy and found himself in the middle of a right pile of shite first mario mcguires uncle gets his head blown off in his own living room next maggie rose discovers that a parish priest from lanarkshire whos on the missing persons list was actually certified dead of a heart attack in edinburgh under another mans name and turned into ashes at seafield last weekend then the man whos no dead after all turns out to have been a tenant of beppe viareggio whos well and truly fucking dead the faked death skinner interrupted an insurance scam a big one there were four policies adding up to a million so pringle just told me they were written on the basis of an outstanding medical report by a gp the same doctor who certified the phoney death theyve all been paid out and the moneys been moved the dccs mind raced as he took in and analysed everything that haggerty had told him have we gone public on all of this he asked only on viareggios murder good thats a help wheres this doctor now found this morning up the lammermuirs with a big hole in his chest fucking hell but what about beppe viareggio skinner asked himself aloud he was just a harmless clown with a marion brando fixation whod want to kill him his daughter paula haggerty answered or so pringles telling me greg jay took a statement this morning from her exboyfriend a di no less who said that he once stopped her from sticking a steak knife in her old man in the middle of a restaurant whos the di steele sound lad not prone to exaggeration so im told but this is where it gets nasty ive just had pringle in to see me and not before time either the couple in the insurance fraud had false identities built around two birth certificates of longdead people obtained from register house paula viareggios just been fingered as the person who obtained them as it happens greg jays had her under observation since last weekend in case whoever killed her old man had it in for her as well his people reported that mario mcguires been seen with her twice since the murder once on saturday then again last night he arrived at her place about ten and stayed till after midnight now pringle tells me jay wants to lift mcguire for questioning as a suspected accomplice in the conspiracy and maybe as the brains behind the whole thing what willie haggerty had the foresight to hold the telephone receiver away from his ear just before the explosion sounded across the transatlantic link you tell him from me skinner roared that if he does hed better get his lawnmower sharpened because hell be spending a fucking long time in his garden from now on and you can tell pringle the same while youre at it relax bob i have done already jays been told to wind his neck in ive asked mario to come up to see me personally this afternoon hes on his way now the dccs rage abated good for you if the latenight visit means that marios having it off with his cousin well id be disappointed in him but until it affects his work its his business unlikely as that is its far more credible than the notion that the pair of them are involved in a conspiracy i know paula viareggio and i know about her sauna businesses too mario told me a long while back shes a classic case that one her granny reborn she didnt kill anybody least of all her father tell me willie do you think its occurred to detective superintendent jay that if someones going to acquire a couple of copy birth certificates for an illegal purpose theyd be major league stupid to use their own name when theyre doing it i dont know said haggerty evenly but im going to find out it certainly hasnt occurred to him that if the moneys gone then so are the couple behind the fraud yes indeed so youd suppose willie skinner continued after a moment this conman how did he come to be beppes tenant it looks as if he and his partner set up a fake wineimporting company to show the insurance companies so that they could take out key executive policies on his life the names they used were magnus essary and ella frances whos met them according to pringle beppe signed the lease personally hes the only one who actually saw the man who called himself essary then thats why he was killed so that he couldnt identify him but if the bloke and his partner are long gone with the money why bother about that haggerty exclaimed i see what you mean bob right as an entity magnus essarys dead and gone no ones left to identify him and the moneys in the bank therefore this man and his lady accomplice can go back to being who they were before if we havent publicised the fact that weve identified the body theyll be sitting there thinking theyve committed the perfect crime there was a silence or maybe just maybe before he heads off to the sunshine with his woman and his million hes got something else to do this is getting crazy maggie murmured almost to herself what else did haggerty tell you that was about it her husband answered after your man at gro came up with paulas name and you told pringle he went haring into leith to see jay the two of them pulled the watchers notes and saw that ive been to her place twice since the murder and gregjust went crazy i must really have upset him he was for sending a couple of senior officers down to gala to bring me up to edinburgh for questioning old dan was sensible enough to tell him to hold his bloody horses while he went to see willie haggerty the acc ordered him to calm jay down and said that he would talk to me personally which he duly did mario sensed her bristling and saw her sit stiffly upright in her dining chair that was as close as her icy control would allow her to come to fullblooded exploding anger the nerve of that man jay she exclaimed just as well that dan was there or he might actually have done it i tell you love if he had done that it would have been him or me id have gone to the dcc and told him that you wouldnt have had to first of all id have beaten you to it and second the big man wouldnt have needed any threats from us the acc told me he had a call from him this afternoon they discussed the case haggerty said that he sends us his condolences about beppe he also said that theyve come to a conclusion about essary that hes still around even though the moneys gone thats right and that hes sitting there thinking hes a genius having pulled off the perfect crime and that we dont know that hes even done it far less that we know who he is the second part of thats true maybe so but if big bob and haggerty are right hes still around for you to catch mario paused to slice off a strip of his fillet steak there was something else though he continued forking it up i wasnt late home because i was with haggerty she looked at him curiously as he chewed i was just leaving fettes when i had a call from paula doing her nut so i had to go back there again another one for greg jays book no doubt she was still shaking with anger when i got there apparently while dan was off having his arse chewed by willie haggerty jay went ahead and lifted her he had her picked up from the deli and brought to his office then questioned her about the restaurant incident and about those birth certificates what did she tell him she accepted the story about the restaurant although stevie steeles had his last christmas card from her i can tell you and she told jay that shes never been in register house in her life far less gone there to pick up other peoples birth certificates he hammered away at her for over an hour then he let her go with a warning that when they found the clerk who issued the certificates he was going to stick her in a lineup he paused to eat the last of his steak hes wasting his time though he added at last why because although she was too shaken up to remember it at the time on the day in question paula was on holiday in italy can she prove that oh yes it was a girlies trip she went for a week with her mother and her favourite auntie ill tell you something greg might have been within his rights in questioning paula but if he has my mother hauled down to leith in a patrol car he and i are going to have hard words again mmm said maggie so paulas well off the hook is she yet someone used her name to get those certificates why i wonder why hers thinking ahead probably this whole thing was planned in minute detail i reckon that if stan had gone to sign those leases rather than beppe hed be dead now or your mother maggie murmured and regretted her words as she saw the look which passed across his face im sure youre right she went on quickly yet i wonder maybe paulas met magnus essary or ella frances and doesnt even know it he looked at her darkly never mind paula love maybe we have thats how clever these people have been he was in the act of rising to clear the dinner plates from the table when the doorbell rang grumbling at the interruption he walked through to the hall to answer it neil mcllhenney stood on the doorstep glad it was you he said i dont have to persuade maggie to let you come for a pint but i dont want a pint mcguire protested and you dont drink any more remember nonetheless were going for one ill wait you get your jacket that quick that quick mcllhenneys car was parked just along the road what did you tell maggie he asked as they drove off the plain truth that you had turned up out of the blue with a pink ticket from lou and were hauling me off into the night shell be used to that by now tell me some more truth are you screwing your cousin paula dusk was gathering so was the silence inside the car at last mario broke it why are you asking me that because i hear things even more in this new job than i did before a little bird to be exact a woman dc in special branch whom you know well told me this afternoon that she heard that you were from a pal in greg jays team so the words got out has it mcguire growled i wonder who else alice cowans pals talked to does that mean that you are what do you think i dont think youre that stupid daft yes but not stupid mind you shes some piece of woman your paula i can see how anyone who saw you go into her place at night and stay for three hours might jump to that conclusion aye well you tell alice from me to let her pal know that if one more whisper of this reaches my ears then ill pull every string ive got to make sure that a few detective officers down in leith wind up on uniformed night shift in craigmillar or worse find themselves transferred down to the borders under my command she needed no telling thats exactly what she said to her pal shes a fan of yours even though she didnt fancy the borders herself im touched said mcguire sourly as his friend drew up outside the liberton inn why here he asked its as good as anywhere else plus they know us here from the old days and theyll give us a wide berth itll be as good as talking in a phone box youve got something for me then oh yes mcllhenney grunted as they stepped into the lounge bar have i ever a few heads turned as they entered then looked away quickly neil went to the bar while mario found a table in the furthest corner well the big superintendent asked quietly as his friend returned with a pint of lager and another of orange squash tennents bugger the beer what is it okay to business ive done those checks you asked you wanted to know all about your dear old dadinlaw and here it is for a start he has no criminal convictions either here or in portugal where he lived from the time when he made his sharp exit from maggies mum until about three years ago when he went back there he settled in setubal just south of lisbon where he lived with his parents during the war i spoke to the chief of the local police who was very helpful when he arrived in town jorge bought a bar and restaurant that had been pretty well derelict and turned it into a decent business good enough to keep him in a degree of comfort but not one that was ever going to make him rich like i said he has no record of any sort but that doesnt mean that the portuguese police never took an interest in him some of his customers were pretty tricky you know the sort wide boys who find all of a sudden that londons too noisy for them but not just english jorge xaviers bar that was the name he used over there was a hangout for expats in general there were suggestions that he was involved in more than alcohol the place was raided a few times over the years but it was always clean the closest he came to being in bother over there came around twelve years ago when a kid disappeared she was a portuguese girl aged twelve the daughter of a woman who worked in jorges kitchen and she just vanished she was never seen again a lot of people were questioned about her disappearance including him the kid used to hang about the place apparently he was friendly towards her and he used to let her wait on tables the portuguese police didnt go as far as to say that he was a suspect but he was the nearest they had they had him in three times and they gave the mother a hard time too but she told them nothing that would have incriminated him shit mario growled if only theyd asked over here and if they had what would they have got the guys clean here too remember anyway it died down after a while and jorges life got back to what passed as normal until that is three years ago when he did another vanishing trick he sold his bar to one of his german customers for a hundred and twenty grands worth of dmarks and he disappeared but not alone it seemed for the daughter of one of the expats a widow named baldwin left home at the same time without as much as a goodbye note to her old lady the girl whose name was ivy had worked in jorges place as well she was a very striking kid the locals said very attractive but the thing that made her stand out was the fact that she looked like a wee doll when she left she was eighteen but she could make herself up to look midtwenties or dress down to look early teens that was the way jorge liked her to dress when she worked he said it put the punters off groping her how did ivys mother take the news she raised the roof apparently she had a fancy man one of the londoners and the word was that jorges card was marked if any of his old friends ever caught up with him but like everything else out there the excitement died down after a while neil looked across at mario he was grinning from ear to ear its about to get stirred up again george rosewell lives down in a tenement in bonnington next door to a dolllike waif called ivy brennan and her twoyearold son george is the kids father but hes sixtythree ivy said he told her he was midfifties he snorted not that that makes a hell of a difference but now to the killer bit did you drop that other name it was mcllhenneys turn to grin i did indeed its well seen why youre the superintendent pal and im only a scruffy di the police chief in setubal recognised the name at once he lives most of the time in setubal in fact hes officially resident there although he still has his house in edinburgh and as far as anyone could see mr lyall butler was jorge xaviers best pal yes mario exclaimed loudly enough for heads to turn once more so what does that prove then the two detectives looked at each other i reckon said mcguire slowly that it means that my fatherinlaw killed my uncle or at least hes a prime suspect you mean that this magnus essary the dead guy who wasnt is really maggies father you know about essary that was supposed to be under wraps mcllhenney looked at him youre gone less than a week and youve forgotten what sb is like not even i worked that fast yes george rosewell the janitor and magnus essary the nonexistent wine importer are one and the same he used lyall butlers house in edinburgh as an accommodation address for his phoney business and rented our warehouse space as premises just to have a lease to show anyone who asked questions about the setup i see it all now he probably planned the scam out in portugal thought about it for years maybe then he had a complication in his life he was banging wee ivy baldwin in her schoolgirl gear and he put her in the club rather than hang around in setubal and wait for ivys mums boyfriend to have him dumped off a trawler into the atlantic he sold up and came back to edinburgh to put his plan into operation so as not to look conspicuous he bought two flats side by side one for him and the other for ivy and the baby when it came along her cover story was that her father had bought it for her george got himself an ordinary job waited for a while then put the plan into action why did he wait this is a pure guess but id say he was waiting for dr amritraj to get set up over here he must have been in on it from the start the medical report for the insurance companies so good that it was just accepted was written by him then he certified the late father green as magnus essary dead of a sudden massive heart attack raj amritraj was from goa in india not all that far back goa was a portuguese colony until the indians booted them out check that out for me too with the gmc but im right i know it jorge and raj met in portugal the poor old doctor probably thought he was in it for half a million but all he got was a bullet in the back and maggots in his eyes mcguire stood abruptly and walked up to the small bar returning with another pint of lager and another squash for mcllhenney dont let that go to your head he said acidly so his friend asked does that make ivy this ella frances then thats what logic tells you except for two things ivys age is pretty flexible but all the descriptions we have of frances put her around the thirty mark and that would be pushing it for the wee lass plus when i showed ivy george rosewells photo she told me that he had a beard thats what started this ball rolling in my head now why would she do that if she was in on it he paused which begs another fucking big question but meantime pal you and i better go and see ivy in the morning no way im going to be alone with that one not again but i need to know everything she knows about old jorge neil raised his eyebrows hey hold your horses mcguire youre divisional commander borders cid remember this is not your investigation its maggies first and its greg jays second thats where youre wrong i saw willie haggerty this afternoon this things gone above dan pringle about matters not unrelated to the story alice cowan told you i told him what i suspected and that i had you checking it out for me on the quiet he told me i was a rucking chancer and then he said i was dead right as things stand now mags is in charge of an investigation which if it succeeds will lead her to her own father as the culprit that cant be allowed to happen at the same time greg jays compromised himself as far as the accs concerned after haggerty heard my story he called the big man himself in the states as of now in the light of what youve confirmed im ordered by him to take this thing forward myself to trace jorge rose and ella frances whoever she is and to arrest them if theyre still in our jurisdiction ive also got discretion to choose my own team and you di mcllhenney are it thanks a million so who gets to tell detective superintendent rose about this haggertys going to brief jay but that job is down to me very definitely fine and when you break it to her im going to be somewhere else you did what she screamed at him just run that past me again you had neil mcllhenney make enquiries that related directly to my investigation and you never told me then you told the acc about it not just over my head but over dan pringles head as well and now as a result im being fucking well stood down is that it does that sum it up he stood there like a schoolboy their living room had become the head teachers office and he was well and truly on the carpet she was in a rage the like of which he had never seen before not from her and rarely from anyone else sometimes he had wondered what it would be like if his wife ever lost the selfcontrol which alongside her talent was one of her twin trademarks now he knew he could see the result and big and tough as he was it scared him yes he replied baldly put that sums it up now would you like to hear why no i would not she yelled im not interested all i can see is the sneaking conniving ambitious toadying bastard that you are three days its taken you to trample my fingers on the ladder thats all three fucking days listen damn it he protested his own voice raised for the first time i didnt tell you because neils checks might have come to nothing and if they had all it would have meant was that your father had done yet another runner from his job and his life i dont want that man to appear in your life one more time if i had even floated the possibility that he might be involved in all this far less behind it i was afraid it would do your head in as it has done when i told haggerty this afternoon it wasnt just because i had to it was because i was concerned about you and about the position you might be in he agreed with me bob skinner agreed with me and where is my career now alongside yours up shit creek in their eyes in mine in yours and in the eyes of everyone who ever finds out about this youve rucked me mario just like he did youre just the same he recoiled from her words i suppose you told neil everything she hissed of course you did you always do no i didnt i told him that the bastard knocked your mother about and left but i didnt tell him why and he hasnt guessed by now dont make me laugh dont you compare me to your father either he retorted the man is a beast hes a pederast a thief and a murderer when he was in portugal he probably raped and murdered a child only they never found the body when wee ivy came along he must have thought all his christmas days had come she looked fourteen she was willing and it was legal no do not compare me to jorge rose okay i wont compare you to anyone you are unique i had complete trust in you and you betrayed it you undermined my career as you were advancing your own when i think of it what have you ever given me jesus you cant even give me a kid she exploded into tears he put a hand on her shoulder but she shrugged it off violently get out of here she screamed get out before i call my office and tell them youve been thumping me that would look really good in the news wouldnt it get out god damn you he was in the doorway when she called after him you dont get it do you you dont get the worst part of it since ive been a police officer ive wanted him its been my dream that one day i might arrest him i wanted it so badly it hurt me i wanted to see him in cuffs humbled being slippery and slimy then scared in the interview room i wanted to leave the likes of charlie johnston alone with him for ten minutes or so i wanted all of that for my mother for my sister but most of all i wanted it for me i was seven when he started on me mario seven mags shut up just get out or i pick up that phone and start screaming into it where did you spend the night then asked neil mcllhenney under the dean bridge maybe you look like death warmed up in the micro i thought about going to my mothers but that would have involved her and thats the last thing i want so i went to paulas instead so now greg jays lot really have got something to talk about oh christ mario you didnt did you did i sleep with her do you mean keeping it in the family like no i didnt but if i had it would have been he stopped himself short the word appropriate frozen on his tongue not that paula was offering not last night not with the mood i was in she switched into motherhen mode instead even did me a cooked breakfast whether i wanted it or not have you called maggie this morning yup the sound of the phone being slammed down is still ringing in my ear aw shit i knew shed be mad but not this mad do you want me to phone her thats very brave of you pal but theres no sense in the both of us being disembowelled is there no he pushed himself up from his seat in mcllhenneys office lets go and see ivy instead we might do some good there the two big detectives strode outside the headquarters building my car said mcguire i know where she lives its not that far actually in fact it took less than ten minutes for them to drive up to ferry road and along to the crossroads that led down towards bonnington on the right ive seen better ive seen worse mcllhenney murmured as he looked up at the shabby frontage of the tenement you sure this girl will be in theres more chance other being in than ofjorge mind you well check his place just in case mario led the way upstairs to the rosewell apartment without bothering to knock he used his skeleton key to slip the lock once more nobody was in and nothing was different the apartment had not been touched nor as far as he could see entered since his last visit they stepped back on to the landing closing the door once more and across to ivys flat mcguire rang the doorbell then leaned down and shouted through the letterbox ivy miss baldwin open up its the police he straightened up and waited for the sound of her coming to open the door smiling as he imagined her face in the knowledge that they knew her real name but there was no sound of ivy only a thin wavering cry the tired wail of a child rising to a scream of panic or even pain he thumped the door this time but still she did not come rums screams grew louder stand back said mcllhenney i was always better at this than you even when i was a fat bastard he jumped high kicking out with the heel of his right foot striking just below the lock which gave at once under his violence in a shower of splinters the door swung open mcguire reached the living room first but stopped at its entrance filling it with his bulk his colleague eased him out of the way and moved ahead ivy was lying naked on the carpeted floor in the middle of the room her tiny body was covered in contusions and her face seemed to be one single bruise her left eye was closed and her nose had been broken great angry welts stood up round her throat strangled the poor wee thing mcllhenney sighed beaten half to death then strangled he turned to look at his friend and saw him still in the doorway tears streaming down his face too much neil he moaned its just too much when i find this man im going to kill him nice and slow thats why we have to find him together pal so as you dont do that very thing the inspector reached for his phone better call it in we cant deal with this one on our own phone haggerty said mcguire pulling himself together with an effort not pringle or jay i dont trust either of them tell him where we are and what weve found let him decide who deals with it he turned and moved towards the bedroom where rufus screamed on but tell him to get the childcare people here pronto bob skinner had sensed the tension building in his wife from the moment she had wakened in a sense he welcomed it she had been entirely too cool for his liking when she had viewed her parents bodies too composed by far but this was the day when the tough stuff would begin again she had her meeting with her lawyer and then the funeral runthrough lan and babs walker were good people to think of easing things for her with their supper invitation but he knew that she would not relax again any more than he would until she had laid leo and susannah to rest he had that burden on his shoulders too and more besides he had told her nothing of dohertys discoveries and of the awful place to which they led he did not know if he ever would for all of his experience as well as his instinct for selfpreservation told him that the secrets buried there had to be left undisturbed too much time had passed for any good to be served by the truth whatever it was being uncovered he knew that and he only hoped that he had been able to bring joe doherty to agree with him whoever was behind the deaths of leo and the others was not kidding not at all and besides similar things had happened in his own country he dreaded to think what would happen if his own story and that of his friend adam arrow ever found their way into the public domain few things ever worried bob skinner but that was one of them he was relieved when sarah told him over breakfast that she planned to spend the morning indulging in retail therapy and asked him to join her in fact he jumped at her suggestion buffalo is not the most sophisticated shopping city in america but it had enough to occupy them he had already bought his funeral suit and so while sarah shopped for clothes for herself and seonaid he concentrated on the boys he had just bought a new york mets cap for mark and the smallest baseball glove in the store for james andrew when his phone sounded in his pocket when he took the call willie haggertys gravel voice sounded over the satellite link he checked the time ten fifteen midaftemoon in edinburgh mcguire was right bob the acc said without pleasantries mcllhenneys enquiries confirmed what he suspected but its worse it looks as if the man rosewell is still around hes getting ready to move though he told skinner about the discovery in bonnington and about the dead girls link to the man they were after who knows that hes maggies father asked skinner only mcguire mcllhenney and me i didnt see the need to tell pringle good keep it that way when was the girl killed yesterday afternoon the doctor reckoned do we know for sure it was rosewell hes the only runner in the field plus we can check the lass put up a fight they found skin under her fingernails so we have a dna trace were going to have to take a blood sample from maggie rose if it matches its him bloody hell whos going to ask her if it comes to that itll be down to me things are bad between mario and her just now skinner sighed i was afraid of that willie i reckon we should take mcguire off this investigation as well who else is there bob he knows the case he joiows the people involved if rosewells killed the girl hes maybe gone already but if not he wont be here for long my feeling is that we let mario run but have big mcllhenney at his side all the way to keep him in check hes the only man i know who could do that the dcc admitted okay do it but keep tabs on it all the way sarah was frowning at him as he returned his phone to his pocket business at home he told her nasty but you dont need to know right now beppeviareggio she asked partly but lets drop it she looked as if she had no inclination to do so but he was saved by the bell or the tone of his cellphone as it sounded again yes he answered expecting haggerty again mr skinner it was an american womans voice low and even yes this is philippa doherty i have some bad news for you bobs head swam and his stomach lurched he leaned against the store counter feeling the blood rush from his face i got back from my flight this morning when i let myself into the apartment i found dad dead in bed oh no he hissed the doctor reckons he had a massive heart attack in his sleep he heard the girl catch her breath keeping hold of her control weve been warning him for years about his smoking she said i guess its finally caught up with him i know you were in touch with him recently and i found your number on his pad so i thought id better tell you along with his other friends and colleagues as she spoke a wholly unreal feeling swept over skinner it was as if he was in a room full of people everyone on the move steadily not rushing but heading somewhere he started to slide down the counter until sarah caught his arm bob she exclaimed what is it slowly he realised that he had passed out for a few seconds but his wifes touch her voice and that of philippa doherty asking if he was still there seemed to have brought him back to the present he nodded to sarah and spoke into the phone yes yes its a terrible shock thats all poor old joe i will miss him so much my condolences to you and all the family for a moment he was on the verge of asking if she had found a floppy disk in the house but he realised that would have been pointless and maybe even dangerous for her there would be no floppy disk and jackson wylies recovered ibook would either vanish or yield nothing philippa he told her instead im still in the us as it happens so please let me know the funeral arrangements and thank you for thinking of me thank you for letting me know for the second time in five minutes he ended a call but this time looking stunned not just worried joe doherty asked sarah incredulous he nodded coronary they say you doubt it no at least im sure thats what a post mortem will show ive never yet heard of a cat that actually died of curiosity mario mcguire hated plastic coffins the containers the mortuary guys brought with them to murder scenes whatever little dignity they allowed was more than offset by their odour a mix of polyurethane and disinfectant and by the brutal truth that they had been used on uncounted occasions in the past to carry victims of all shapes and sizes he had seen people being crammed into these things one corpse that of a man stabbed to death in a pub fight early in the career of young pc mcguire had been so gross that the crew of the meat wagon had simply left the arms hanging over the buckling sides as they had carried it away as they lifted her into her container ivy brennan who had been baldwin looked like nothing more than a broken doll there was something especially tragic about her the tiny flawed innocent who had deserved so much more from life than to be the victim of george rosewell that even the black humour of the attendants was silenced mario had banished his earlier weakness grateful that only his friend had been there to see him overcome it had been replaced by a huge towering rage which seemed to emanate from him in waves as he thought about everything that had gone wrong so suddenly in his life and contemplated what he was going to do to the man who had brought it all about are you absolutely sure asked mcllhenney forcing his way into his musing that ivy couldnt have been ella frances mcguire turned away as a mortuary porter placed the lid on the coffin he walked across to the window and peered through the slit between the drawn curtains im as sure as shes dead he answered harshly ivy lived her odd life with her old sugar daddy next door but she had no idea of what he was really up to if she had she wouldnt have pointed me at him with the tip about the beard or made up that daft story about uncle beppe no shed have done the opposite of those things what she might have done though innocently was set up the viareggios uh maybe i asked paula some more about her last night she started coming about the deli in stockbridge when rums was no more than an infant talked nineteen to the dozen according to paulie she asked all sorts of questions about the shop she told her that she didnt just come to buy stuff she said that she liked being there she liked the smell of it she said that she liked just to stand there and breathe in because it reminded her of where she used to live although she never said where that was and paula never asked she asked her about the special wines we stock as well and whether you can buy them anywhere else paula remembered telling her no that we imported our own and that we owned a commercial warehouse where they were bonded there was a man too said mcguire she told me that once or twice at weekends a bloke came into the shop with ivy an older bloke stocky swarthy hardlooking with a grizzled beard paulie thought he might have been her father but she never asked about that either she said that she was happy to talk to the kid she liked her well enough but she didnt want to get involved in her life so she always tried to keep her at arms length she never spoke to this man and he never spoke to her but you think he was listening asked mcllhenney chances are that he was maybe he told ivy what to ask maybe not but the likelihood is thats how he came to know about our warehouse and to know paula viareggio by name and sight i agree thats probable but youve still got to convince me that ivy wasnt involved everything youve told me about her makes it seem that she was quite an actress okay ill convince you theres some more checking i want you to do then a man i want you to see whos that walter jaap funeral undertaker hes the only man alive i know whos actually met ella frances as such okay said mcllhenney but im not doing it we are ive got orders from very high up not to let you out of my sight is that right in that case i might have to sleep with paula tonight if youre going to be on the sofa it occurred to sarah that clyde oakdale looked more like a lawyer than anyone she had ever known he wore a threepiece pinstriped suit the jacket cut long a blue shirt with a white collar and he peered at her over halfmoon spectacles as she laid the last will and testament of leo and susannah grace on his desk youre sure you understand all of this now youve read it asked the interim senior partner of grace mclean wylie whyte and oakdale i think so but perhaps youd summarise it for me of course he answered some time ago your father consolidated all his investments into a trust fund for his benefit and that of susannah during their lifetimes with their deaths you inherit everything other than his continuing interest in the law firm which is distributed among the surviving partners you and your husband are joint executors of the estate and have absolute discretion over its disposal you can dissolve the fund or continue it in being for your own benefit alternatively you may appoint your children as beneficiaries the will places no constraints upon you of any sort it does not require you to resume residence in the united states nor does it require your children to become american citizens as a condition of benefit in case youre surprised by that remark i have seen such conditions imposed in situations such as these whats the total value of the estate the current valuation of the fund is just under eight million dollars and the two properties are worth in the region of oneandahalf million there are no borrowings attached to either sarah whistled i always knew i had a rich daddy but that surprises me i have to tell you that it would be to your advantage to continue the ftmd in being for the immediate future at least said oakdale it is extremely taxadvantageous and the firm would be happy to continue to manage it for you through our associated brokerage for the same fee arranged with your father ill come back to you on that obviously ill have to discuss it with my husband however in the meantime would you please proceed as soon as possible with the sale of the lakeside cabin neither bob nor i have any wish to see that place ever again i dont blame you ill instruct a real estate agent on your behalf once the police give me the all clear to proceed good she said now if thats all i must be going i have another engagement oakdale held up a hand there is just one more thing he rose ponderously and walked towards the wall of his office behind a mirror there was a wall safe which he opened by dialling in a combination he reached in and took out a long legal envelope with a red wax seal on the back a few weeks ago he announced leo gave me this with the instruction that should he fail to reclaim it before his death i was to give it to your husband to no one else but him i have spoken with him by telephone and he said it was okay for you to receive it on his behalf as long as you dont open it he handed it to her i must say that i was surprised that he gave it to me rather than to jack who was after all my senior partner at the time do you have any idea what it is she asked no all i can tell you is that from your fathers demeanour when he entrusted it to me it is very important skinner was still dazed by the enormity of joe dohertys death as he walked along the treelined street in which the walkers lived he had stopped believing in coincidences when he was around eighteen years old why couldnt you take a hint old pal he muttered sadly as if wylies boat blowing up when we should have been on it wasnt enough to give you the message the thing that surprised him to an extent was that he felt no real threat to his personal safety he was sure beyond any doubt that the explosion had now been reclassified as an accident and that the remains of jack wylies computer were as useless as they had no doubt looked when they were recovered from the hulk the secret was buried once more there would be no sense in disturbing the ground by killing a foreign national and a policeman at that yet he could not be one hundred per cent certain that was why leo graces glock all fifteen rounds in its magazine was tucked into the waistband of his slacks nestling cold but comforting against his back the day was still warm when he reached the clergymans house large by british standards but modest when set against leo and susannahs home he crunched his way up the drive and rang the bell after a few moments the door was opened by a pert blonde woman around sarahs age until then he had not been aware that he had met babs walker he remembered only an encounter with one of his wifes friends during the period of their separation when he had been in buffalo to visit his son rather than with any hope of patching things up the thing he recalled most clearly about that meeting was how frosty the woman had been towards him there was still a faint chill about her as she greeted him at the door bob right on time wont you come in she held the door open for him then escorted him through to their main reception room where her husband was waiting from somewhere below the den he guessed he heard a childs laugh welcome said the minister its good to see you again but for the circumstances yes babs added we never seem to meet in happy times do we bob he had no doubt from her tone that she still disapproved of him he guessed that there was little forgiveness in the preachers wife he glanced around the room the walkers were keen collectors of family photographs they stood in frames on every surface parents he supposed children at various stages from birth and the couple themselves individually in high school graduation robes and together on their wedding day nice he said absently i hope sarah isnt too much longer she said shed get done with oakdale as quickly as she could a glance was exchanged between husband and wife he caught it and ian realised as much she will be a little later actually bob he confessed she has another meeting to fit in babs walker was out of his vision as he looked at her husband but he knew that she was smirking at his discomfiture that guy he asked yes he called this afternoon and said he was in town i caught sarah on her cellphone just as she was driving to meet the lawyer she agreed to see him immediately afterwards skinner shrugged feeling the gun move against his back fair enough shes thought it through she reckons its the thing to do will you have some lemonade while youre waiting bob babs asked no thank you very much but coffee would be appreciated sure said lan ill make it he headed off towards the kitchen leaving his visitor with his wife she shot him a vixen smile as soon as they were alone please be seated she urged indicating a deep blue couch as he settled himself in she went over to a sideboard took something from it that he could not see at first then walked round to sit beside him it was an album while were waiting she said i thought you might like to see some more of our photographs that would be nice he answered insincerely she opened the volume at the start the first page showed two girls they were in their very early teens at most but he recognised them both one of them was by his side the other was his wife most of these have sarah in them babs told him as she flicked through the pages it was almost a montage of his wifes life school student prom queen diploma winner undergraduate and then there were adult shots the two of them together sarah and babs friends together at barbecues on a ski trip some with ian and with other young men boyfriends of the time of whom he had heard no doubt his hostess stopped to point one out thats ron neidholm the football player he and sarah had this red hot thing going while she was in med school they couldnt keep their hands off each other but he went off to dallas and she got bored she was quite a girl in her youth was my friend bob kept an icy smile fixed on his face finally she came close to the end this is the most recent one i have she exclaimed as she turned the page her last big fling to which she was certainly entitled since you were being a very naughty boy at the time the photo showed two couples in evening dress at a formal dance sarahs hospital ball babs explained she had one too she said with a lascivious chuckle he stared at the photograph his smile gone looking at the two walters at sarah and at another man young confident handsome smiling a big cigar held between the first two fingers of his right hand thats him she said the guy shes gone to meet he was on his feet in a single lithe moment where he barked what where are they meeting i cant tell you that she protested he reached down and yanked her to her feet you can he hissed and you will she looked at his face and realised that he was right at lans church she croaked where is it go left to the end of the street then right and its about half a mile but what he shoved her back on to the couch and left her speechless as he ran out of the house racing for dear life towards the meeting place of his wife and the man he had known until that moment as special agent isaac brand the two detectives stood at the door of the secluded detached house in the east lothian village of onniston if were wrong mcllhenney grunted were up to our armpits in shit and when the teabreaks over well be back to standing on our heads were not wrong mario mcguire whispered he flexed his shoulders to ensure that his pistol was loose and accessible in its holster your checking revealed that shes resigned her job it turns out that george rosewells absence from work has never been reported to the council walter jaap more or less identified her from her staff mugshot as the woman who paid for magnus essarys funeral aye only more or less i like my witnesses to be definite she didnt tell me about the beard neil she gave me rosewells photograph but she didnt tell me that he had a beard his smile gleamed in the moonlight it was enough for the sheriff to give us a warrant be content with that my life in your hands pal it was ever thus mcguire glanced at his luminous watch then at the light in the bedroom window upstairs just after eleven if hes there theyll be tucked up by now he reached out and rang the doorbell keeping his finger on the button for at least ten seconds hearing the strident call from inside the house pat dewberry came to the door attractive in a long pink nightgown even without makeup and with her hair ruffled from the pillow dont tell me youve forgotten your she exclaimed stopping with a gasp as she saw the two figures on the doorstep she gave mcguire a look of pure terror and in that instant even mcllhenney was convinced that they had come to the right house he drew his gun as mcguire pushed the woman into the house and closed the door behind them you take her he said ill get rosewell theres no one here mrs dewberry called out theres no one here nevertheless said the big inspector he headed upstairs how did you kill the priest mcguire asked once he was gone she was deathly pale and shaking violently like a tree in a gale what priest she wailed father francis donovan green the man you had cremated as magnus essary was a catholic priest didnt he tell you that when you picked him up the womans eyes seemed to glaze over she started to buckle at the knees but the detective caught her by the arms and held her up she seemed to crumple into herself as he looked at her i didnt kill him she whispered george did he used an electric stun gun and then he suffocated him it was horrible i had no idea he was going to do that he told me he just wanted to talk to him that was all dont make me laugh where did you pick up father green but its true pat dewberry pleaded we saw him at a pub called the last drop in the grassmarket appropriate how long did you have to trawl there we didnt trawl there at least not that i was aware of it was just one of the places we used to go for a drink we chose pubs well away from the school where there was little or no chance of bumping into parents then one night george pointed out that man he was on his own and looking around he told me that he was his brother and that he hadnt seen him for years he asked me to pick him up and bring him outside so he could surprise him and you believed that yes they could have been brothers twins almost so you did what he asked yes it was easy really the man was only after one thing in less than half an hour we were on our way i took him across to the car knowing that george would be hiding in the back he got in and that was when george hit him with the stungun that was when it all went crazy so why didnt you stop it why didnt you go to the police why didnt you tell me everything when i visited the school because i was afraid by then she whispered you didnt seem too scared when you opened the door just there she looked at him her eyes shifting around as if she was searching for something in her mind listen she exclaimed in a voice that was suddenly stronger as if she had glimpsed a ray of hope ill give evidence ill do anything you want mcguire smiled at her mocking her im sure you will but only if we let you said mcllhenney appearing downstairs with a shake of his head how did you get into this he asked it was all georges idea she answered at once you have to believe that i fell in love with him we had an affair it began not long after he came to the school hes an extraordinary man mesmerising charismatic ive never met anyone like him but theres another side to him we know the inspector growled and its pure evil yet you went along with him just the same i thought the wine company was real she protested he told me that he knew a lot of good portuguese wines that we could import into this company and sell to private customers some janitor it was only a job to him he told me it was just something to keep money coming in while he set up the business then he asked me to be his partner using false names mcllhenney exclaimed he told me that he didnt want any hassle from the education authority i thought that made sense so i agreed its not illegal after all what about the insurance policies george told me it was common business practice for partners to insure each other why werent there any policies on you he said we could do that later after the business was established first he said we had to set it up properly i believed him really and then that awful thing happened with that man when george shot my uncle were you there too mcguire demanded your uncle beppe viareggio she shook her head violently i drove him there i thought he was just going to talk to him about the lease i didnt know about the murder until i read about it in the papers next day george told me that it had to be done that with him out of the way we were free and clear and able to go and join our money without anyone ever being any the wiser okay mcguire snarled so where is he now this charismatic devil you were expecting him back so wheres he gone he said that he had one last thing to do one last loose end to tie off he muttered something about someone who had crossed him a long time ago and before he could go anywhere he had to get even with her suddenly it was the big superintendent who was trembling oh christ he gasped oh christ neil hes gone after maggie the knock at the door was gentle almost apologetic she was in the kitchen when she heard it in her towelling robe and almost dry from the shower making herself a cup of hot chocolate to take upstairs to bed for a moment she thought about ignoring it she had heard nothing from mario all day not that she would have taken his call if he had rung but his failure even to try to contact her pained her and made her wonder how much she had hurt him with her final withering remark she could guess where he had spent the night it had been too late for him to go to neil and lou and he had never in his life been one to run home to mother so paulas it must have been and in the mood he had been in there was no doubting either what had happened still she cant be as good a lay as everyone imagines she found herself thinking if he s knocking on my door tonight rather than going back for more the gentle knock came again a little louder but not much oh hell she said aloud and headed for the door when she saw who was standing there her mouth fell open and she stopped herself only a fraction short of collapse she had forgotten or made herself forget many things about him over the years how blue were his eyes how cold how hard and how merciless how deep was his tan some of it complexion the rest the result of years in the sun how rough were his hands how brutal he had been as he invaded her and most of all she had forgotten until that moment just how much he terrified her he stood there with a terrible smile on his face not only was his beard gone but his head was shaven and gleaming like a brown egg in the moonlight he looked ageless unchanged from the day he had left she was frozen as he stared at her and as he brought the massive automatic made bigger still by its silencer from behind his back well then margaret he murmured in the strange accent that had brought her terror then as it did now how youve grown ive been watching you for a while watching and waiting for that man of yours to leave you alone and now he has ditched you finally has he for miss viareggio he moved towards her and she staggered backwards helpless before him come on now lass invite your daddy in ive waited a long time to visit you again you with your big mouth you that couldnt keep a secret ive waited a long time to pay you out he moved into the darkened hall and closed the door behind him still she backed off into the light of the living room where the curtains were drawn superintendent now i believe he murmured it counts for nothing now my girl for nothing before me he jabbed the gun at her then laughed as she flinched lets see how youve turned out then woman he reached out fast with his left hand and tugged at the cord of her robe ripping it from its loops then staring at her as the garment fell open not bad not bad bigger than your mother for sure and now well see what else she stepped away yet again as he moved towards her her foot caught in the hem of the dressing gown it slipped from her shoulders and she fell backwards fulllength on the floor she lay there paralysed staring up at her monster of a father as he towered over her the vestry door was open when she arrived as ian had said it would be there had been no other car in sight as she had parked the jaguar and so she assumed that she had made it there before him she was mistaken there he sat in a wooden chair under the high vestry window caught in the rays of the westbound sun smiling as she entered the room leaving the door ajar behind her thank you for coming he said its very important to me much more important than you can guess she looked at him and that old feeling of lust swept over her there had been so much she had not admitted to bob and never would she could recall every one of the several lovers she had had in her life since she and ian walker had deflowered each other in her freshman year at college but none not even ron her footballer with such clarity as she remembered terry carter the perfect beautiful musculature of his body the easy skill with which he had aroused her to frenzy so often in their brief energetic affair his knack of entering her at exactly the right moment and his ability to stay there all rockhard velvet holding himself back until she was absolutely ready for him to let go yes she had been demanding of him yes made bitter and revengeful by her husbands betrayal for all the watereddown story she had told bob eventually she had demanded plenty now once more in the vestry of a lutheran church of all places she could feel herself moisten at the very sight of him she laid her capacious black leather bag on the carpeted floor and knew that if he asked her they would probably join it there yet lust was all it had been for all of his beauty and grace as a lover she had never felt herself falling in love with him there was something about him that had precluded that from the start a distance kept between her and the real man inside him and so she had gratified herself with him readily and frequently in friendship and without shame in fact she had felt no guilt over their parting as she had pretended to bob she had simply wanted to see him again he rose and she went to him they kissed briefly then again for longer hello terry she murmured as they broke off their embrace this was probably a lousy idea but im glad i agreed to it the too he said how are you sarah are you happy back in scotland with your policeman she nodded yes i am hes the foundation ive always needed in my life not that i didnt appreciate the time we had together thats why i said i would meet you i suppose to thank you in a way i never did before you thanked me every time we made love he told her ill never forget you and much as id like to reprise those days theyre over im afraid you have something i need the package mr oakdale gave you he glanced at her bag and saw the long envelope with its seal sticking out of the open top thats it i guess she frowned at him honey what is this how did you know about that oakdales office is bugged i heard every word you said in there her look had become one of astonishment and confusion terry she exclaimed what are you saying my name isnt terry he told her but you dont need to know what it really is im afraid you have been unfortunate in your choice of father your old man was one of a small group of people who have been watched for a long time by a succession of people like me in senator graces case it wasnt so much because of what he had done but because of who his friends were in particular his friend jack wylie the leader of the group those men were entrusted with one of the deepest secrets of our nation not i nor any of the other men who have watched them over the years know fully what it is they were rewarded for what they did and for many years that kept them happy but there was always the fear that one day one of them might have an attack of conscience so they were kept under constant observation in their places of work in their homes and in their recreation sarah stared at him her eyes narrowing and you and me that was part of it yes im afraid it was after your father retired it became difficult to keep him under complete surveillance then you showed up back in buffalo his beloved only daughter one of my superiors had the bright idea that you could be used as a conduit to him so to speak and so i was ordered to get close to you an order which he added with a grin if i may say so i carried out to the best of my ability like i say your father was included because of his links to those men it was all a precaution you understand but as it turned out a precaution that was very necessary for eventually one of them did get flaky and persuaded the rest to follow your father was enlisted to be their messenger their most honest of brokers in those circumstances action had to be taken she stared at him incredulous you are saying that you killed my father and mother you bastard that is correct them and a few others and now of course since you are privy to all this you have to go too he reached into the jacket of his dark suit and took out a gun a compact weapon that she recognised as the twin of the one in her fathers car he levelled it at her head you may prefer to turn around he murmured and you may prefer a rough breathless voice said from the doorway to lay that weapon very slowly and very carefully on the ground at your feet no dont even think about pulling the trigger son and dont get any other ideas either i may be out of puff but you wouldnt get halfway round towards me before your brains were all over that wall very slowly and very carefully isaac brand did as he had been instructed thats good said skinner now slip off your jacket so i can see you arent carrying anything else he waited as the special agent dropped his coat on the floor okay thats good now turn slowly and face me brand inched round until he could see the big figure of the scot holding an identical glock to the one on the floor the barrel was a black dot and he was transfixed by it almost casually skinner took one pace forward and kicked him in the testicles as hard as he was able the american squealed and fell to the floor clutching his crotch and squirming thats for fucking my wife im an unreconstructed caveman where that sort of things concerned its also out of frustration that i was so stupid from the moment i told joe doherty to use you to check on wylie garrett and wilkins i should have been suspicious from the moment you didnt tell joe about the stolen laptop we were all wrapped up in kosinski but it was you all along you were the plant troy had nothing to do with it thats right isnt it on the floor brand gurgled its okay said skinner ill take a nod as a yes purplefaced the man nodded i wish i could kill you now the scot told him for leo and susannah and for all the others youve no idea how badly i want to or maybe you do if this was my country youd be well dead by now id have dropped you as soon as i came through that door and saw you with a gun on sarah but it isnt and i dont want to import any shit to scotland so i dont want to take a chance on shooting you ive been in your world and so i know how it works so my proposal is that were going to go now and were going to leave you with the thing you came after he glanced towards sarahs bag on the floor is that it in there yes she replied a catch in her throat okay take it out and leave it there then pick up the gun and come over here she nodded and did as he said then moved over to the door behind him i want you to carry a message from me brand to whoever pulls your strings i dont want to know who was behind it or even how you killed joe the end of the storys in that envelope im going to leave it for you and im going to walk away you have two choices son you either take that package and whats in it and give me your personal word that you will never come near me or any of mine again anywhere or ill yield to my basest instincts and put a bullet through your head right where you lie which is it to be are you going to be sensible or are you going to be dead zak brand twisted his head to look up at him sensible he hissed in an agonised voice just as well stay where you are until you hear us drive off and dont think of calling any backup you may have out there if any vehicle as much as moves towards us as we leave here or tries to tail us i will turn right round come back in here and kill you do you believe that yes then just keep on believing he put an arm around sarahs waist and steered her through the door she said nothing until they were in the jaguar then she turned to him is that it she asked with fury written on her face that man killed my parents and were just going to leave him there do you really think i want to he snapped back at her thats the way it has to be but he hasnt got away with anything what do you mean i mean this i cant shoot the bastard because i need him to deliver his message to whoever sent him much as id like to get them all i never could because wherever theyre from and whatever their background be it state organised crime or foreign government their resources put them beyond even my reach if i tried to track them which i could do by tailing brand brand she frowned in spite of himself babs walkers drawingroom tour of sarahs past flashed through his mind your lovers real name is isaac brand he told her coolly hes a special agent of the fbi and he was one of the two guys joe doherty assigned to me only he had other loyalties if i did tail him id be putting you all of us at terrible risk so i cant skinner looked at her and a hard light flickered in his eye but hes at risk himself now brand took his orders from someone and even if hes only met that one link in the chain of which he himself is a part now hes failed in his mission and been exposed a look of bloodchilling satisfaction crossed his face it might even have been taken for a smile and that makes him he murmured the weakest link goodbye he switched on the engine of the big car i could have made him dead but you could say ive done worse he isnt a pursuer any more ive made him a target hes got two choices either he takes a big risk and tries to bargain for his life with that envelope probably not even knowing whats in it or he takes a big risk and runs either way hell never know anything but fear for as long or as short as he lives she looked at him as he drove off for the first time he noticed how pale she was and us well be safe youre sure im sure when we get home ill go to see a pal in whitehall just to make certain ive already sent him by courier via the british embassy the item that clyde oakdale gave me this afternoon when i passed by him by accident in a crowded shopping mall out of shot of the video cameras and where we couldnt be overheard by any nearby microphones like those which are undoubtedly planted in his office she gasped with surprise then frowned but how did you set a meeting up without that being overheard i sent him a text message on his cellphone you cunning soandso she exclaimed so what did clyde give you a copy of everything in the envelope we left back there do you think im completely bloody daft you mean you expected someone to come after me when clyde gave me the original no i knew that someone would come after it not after you i just didnt expect it would be so soon or that the guy who would do it would be the same guy i asked to keep an eye on you after you left oakdales office you mean you asked brand to look out for me thats how good he was or how stupid i was and terrys brands people how will they know about the duplicate theyll figure out that i wouldnt have given it up unless i had some sort of pretty good insurance he looked at her now trust me on this he said with your life and the lives of our kids sarah was silent for a long time knowing that he was the only man she had ever met other than her father whom she could trust to that extent since you put it that way i must she murmured grimly they drove on in silence for a while back to the walkers home how much did you overhear back there she asked him eventually nothing i got there just as he was getting ready to shoot you why did i miss something no she said nothing at all she had no idea how long she had been sitting there staring numbly at the wall somewhere in the back of her consciousness she heard the door open again somewhere behind her she heard two men enter the room one of them her husband she knew the very sound of his footfall and the other certainly neil mcllhenney for wherever mario went in a crisis his friend would not be far away but she made no move to turn she simply sat there on the edge of the armchair her fathers gun and his body at her feet oh my lord mcllhenney murmured mario heres where i disobey orders this is for you to deal with on your own if you need me ill be in the kitchen doing something useless mcguire barely heard him instinctively he snapped off the light and stepped into the living room in the second before neil turned away she looked round and up and he saw her face in the moonlight her expression made him shudder it was that of someone he had never seen before someone who for all she knew was fully dressed and greeting a surprise visitor not sitting naked on a chair looking up at her husband as if nothing untoward had happened whoever she was she wasnt maggie rose not as he had ever known her i didnt appreciate he heard her begin in a chillingly calm voice not hers someone elses as he left mario to what he had to do in the kitchen he filled the kettle found three mugs and dropped a tea bag into each one he had no idea why he was doing it other than to pass the time he stood there and waited trying to imagine how pat dewberry would embellish her story now that no one was left alive to contradict her they had had no time to arrest her formally all they had been able to do was call two constables from the nearest patrolling car to sit with her until dc alice cowan from mcllhenneys special branch team could get there to relieve them neil mcguires voice came from the hall mcllhenney stepped out and found him on the stairs one hand on maggies waist as if he was steering her he had put her bathrobe around her shoulders but it hung loose on her and he looked away embarrassed mario tossed him a car key on its dealer fob i dug that out of his pocket his motorll be outside find it and run it into the driveway as close to the house as you can get it what are we going to do im going to take him somewhere else you dont need to have anything to do with it fuck off the big superintendents smile gleamed since you put it that way id welcome your help neil nodded and headed off out into the night he looked at the key and saw that it was for a ford a mondeo and a focus were parked close to each other less than fifty yards away squinting in the street light he found the button which operated the remote central locking he pressed the unlock sign as he approached the two vehicles heard a clunk and saw the courtesy light come on inside the focus he slid in behind the wheel adjusting the drivers seat to give himself more legroom then started the car and reversed quietly up his friends drive positioning the front passenger seat less than six feet from the side door of the house he glanced around as he stepped out mario and maggie lived in the sort of neighbourhood where people kept conventional hours all the curtains were drawn in both of the houses that overlooked the drive mcguire was back in the living room waiting for him he winced as he took his first close look at the body ouch what did she shoot him with a cannon more or less here help me get him into this he held up an old parka he had unearthed from the depths of his wardrobe it was a winter garment with a big hood come on he said kevin omalley the consultant shrinks on his way here and i dont want him to see any of this where are we taking him home together they heaved the dead weight of george rosewell into a sitting position forced his arms into the jacket which was fortunately two or three sizes too large for him and zipped it up then pulling the hood as far over the ravaged face as they could they pulled him upright and hauled him out to the car looking to any distant observer had there been one as if they were seeing off the last drunk to leave the party they wedged him into the passenger seat where mario fastened the safety belt as tightly as he could across his chest and round his waist last bloke i saw looking like that said mcllhenney as they finished was dan pringle after a cid dance this bastards luckier than clan at least he wont feel like shit in the morning mcguire went back into the house and returned with the rolledup bloodstained rug which he shoved behind the front seats on you go now you head off to bonnington dont park just drive around till you see me there ill be as quick as i can neil nodded hows mags he asked in a trance lying on the bed staring at the ceiling what have you told kevin that shes had a breakdown and that i want it kept quiet hes going to take her to his clinic and keep her sedated and under observation for a couple of days hes used to working with us hell keep it under wraps all right wouldnt she be better here i mean shouldnt you be with her when she comes out of it she may not want to see me when she comes out of it and to tell you the truth old pal i dont know if i want to see her the bathroom was lit only by the striplight above the mirror in which he had shaved less than a day before he lay back in the great oval tub in the middle of the night more exhausted than he had ever been in his life paula sat beside him on the lid of a laundry basket nursing a mug of coffee with her hair tied in a ponytail and wearing only the long tee shirt in which she had been sleeping when he had leaned relentlessly on the entryphone buzzer after mcllhenney had dropped him off is this going to become a habit she asked i couldnt honestly tell you mario sighed she stood drew her makeshift nightgown over her head and lowered her long oliveskinned body into the bath beside him come on then move your bum she murmured he made room for her it was big enough and then some it wont do you any good he murmured you know that dont you maybe not she replied but i know when a man needs a hug its been a bad day then the worst of my life he told her truthfully remember wee ivy shes dead neil and i found her at her place this afternoon paula sighed oh no the poor kid what was it an overdose an overdose of life and what about the man who killed my dad are you any nearer catching him he nodded sending ripples across the surface of the bathwater we know where he is well go and get him tomorrow you wouldnt kill him for me would you she smiled as she asked but he knew that she was deadly serious i wont have to go that far she pulled back an inch or two focusing on his face what do you mean by that dont ask dont ask any more questions in fact shut your bloody mouth he turned half round towards her drew her to him and kissed her even in the warm bath she could feel him shiver here she whispered i thought you said this wouldnt do me any good it wont he told her were going to hate ourselves in the morning you speak for yourself big boy they arrived outside the tenement building just after ten on thursda morning mcllhenney looked the fresher of the two but it was marginal mario had awakened in paulas bed three hours earlier to find her propped up on an elbow beside him looking down at him with a smile on her face you did it again you big bastard she had chuckled you fell asleep on me oops sorry he had murmured in reply reaching up to draw her down beside him but im halfawake now you really know how to make a girl feel wanted he had barely finished shaving the sign of the modem single woman he had decided was a gillette mach iii still in the wrapper and a can of foam in her bathroom cabinet when his friend had arrived to collect him he had asked no questions on the drive out to ormiston and mario had told him nothing pat dewberry was cleaned up made up and composed when they walked into her living room after alice cowan had let them in he hasnt come home you know she had said mcguire had simply shrugged well have to look somewhere else then they had cautioned her and had told her that she would be taken into custody for questioning in connection with fraudulent claims from several insurance companies and had called in a team from detective superintendent brian mackies division to take her to their office in lasswade and then they had headed for bonnington where they had found willie haggerty dan pringle stevie steele and four armed uniformed officers a sergeant and three constables waiting for them whats this about then mario asked the head ofcid stevie said you wanted me here and an armed response team but that was all i thought id better tell the acc too then i found youd phoned him youre fuckin about

brennans tapedover apartment told them they had been heading mcguire pointed to rosewells flat and one of the constables stepped forward he swung a heavy wooden bludgeon at the door the frame shattered it swung open and the armed team rushed inside their shouted warnings announcing their presence inside a minute the sergeant stepped out on to the landing on floors above and below they heard doors opening hes in here sir the officer told haggerty the acc led the detectives into the flat following the armed sergeant george rosewell lay on his back on a bloodstained rug with half his face gone a great silenced automatic hanging loosely in his right hand haggerty looked down at him youve done us a favour then pal he said as if the man could hear him good idea bad bastard that you

ceiling as she had done almost two days before mags he whispered she turned towards him she was deathly pale her eyes were hollow her red hair was lifeless well how much do you remember he asked her face twisted all of it she hissed every last bloody second being paralysed with fear thinking i was dead him the beast getting down on me i remember all of it and i know for sure that i always will she grinned but there was only bitterness in it kevin says im suffering from some sort of posttraumatic shock he thinks it might go back to the plane crash how gallant of you not telling him what i did or what he did either the brief smile became a scowl youve stuffed me too you realise getting me out of there nobody took a vaginal swab nobody went over me for body hair there was no forensic examination nothing ill have no defence now have they decided what theyre going to charge me with are they going for murder or will they accept a plea to culpable homicide or is kevin going to certify that im crazy is that what this is all about he sat on the bed and tried to take her hand but she yanked it from his grasp we recovered george rosewells body in his flat yesterday morning he shot himself we believe that he saw a police car outside his accomplices house and realised that we were on to him she gazed up at him her fuzzy brain trying to follow what he was saying but he didnt her voice was hoarse i shot him right in the fucking face we did a residue test which proved that he fired the gun would you like us to do one on you itll be clean i promise he committed suicide thats what it says on stevie steeles report to the fiscal approved by the head ofcid in your absence accept what kevin says she resumed her examination of the ceiling and suppose i do she said and suppose

sends his best wishes for your speedy recovery does willie haggerty know she asked him her eyes suddenly sharp mr haggerty knows what ive told him he didnt get to be an assistant chief constable by asking the wrong bloody questions you are a cunning bastard arent you i suppose i should be thanking you now he shook his head no you shouldnt not now and not ever if you dont want to if you want to thank anyone thank neil he put his arse on the line for you and he really didnt have to he had more to lose than me i can walk away from the police if i want and run the viareggio trust with paula if he was disgraced all the shit would come down on lou and the kids and heavy at that because of who she is then thank him for me no you have to do that yourself when youre ready meantime just get over that flu while youre doing that im going to give you something to think about he left the room only to return a moment later carrying a toddler a young fairhaired boy this is rums he told her hes ivys wee lad shes dead and hes lost his mum only he doesnt realise it yet he has a grandmother in portugal but she doesnt want to know about him not that id let her anywhere near him even if she did that makes him our responsibility yours and mine because you see mags hes your halfbrother who said i couldnt give you a kid mario said bitterly and sat the child on the bed beside her if he had expected her eyes to fill with tears at the very sight of the boy he was disappointed for what she did was look at him with something akin to fear in her eyes i dont know if i want this particular kid she whispered if what youre saying is true as i look at him all i can see right now is our father his and mine i dont know if i can handle that but you have a sister wheres the difference why do you think i dont see her he lifted rufus again betting him up on to his shoulder well i tell you this mags im looking after this boy from now on im going to bring him up and teach him my values and beliefs and im going to prove that when it comes to character heredity counts for fuck all but i dont have to do that really because youre living proof yourself paulas helping me take care of him right now until youre ready to play your part in raising him with me or without me however it works out she shook her head i dont know mario i dont know no well i know this if you stay huddled up in that bed then your old mans done for you right enough because youll have let him take away your strength your selfbelief and your pride if you do that youll no longer be the woman i love the woman i married he looked at her and suddenly he knew once more where he had always belonged and he knew the one last thing he had to do to bury jorge xavier rose god damn it he exclaimed im not going to let the bastard have that satisfaction im overruling omalley right now so do what youre told detective superintendent get your shapely arse out of that bed and come home with rufus and me for a long time maggie looked at him and at her brother then at last she sighed and with an act of will greater than ever before in her life she threw back the covers the confirmation hearing had been postponed the senator and heri husband were there after all skinner and sarah stood by the graveside as ian walker recited the words of committal they had gone on the ministers house after leaving brand at the church nothing had been said about bobs angry departure and in the presence of her childhoo friend babs had become the perfect hostess now it was almost over the journey which had brought him from th far east to stand beside the coffins of his parentsinlaw along the way he had seen more than any of them knew and had lost more too he let his gaze pass over the congregation in the cemetery unable to guess their numbers noting the irony of the secret service presence he swept around the gathering coming at last to sarah and as he did his head began to swim and he was back in that grey place the one filled with faceless hurrying people as she looked at him she saw his eyes glaze over as he looked down at her blankly he was swept by that strange feeling ofdeja vu an instant certainty that he had played the scene before and then in slow motion it seemed to sarah as she watched bob skinner pitched forward falling face down stretching out fulllength on the green carpeting of the graveside dead to his world
