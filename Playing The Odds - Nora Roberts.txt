chapter one there was always a great deal of confusion more noise and a touch of panic to flavour the arrival of embarking passengers some were already a bit travel weary from their flight into miami others were running on the adrenaline of anticipation the huge white ocean liner the celebration waited in port their ticket to fun relaxation romance when they crossed the gangway they would no longer be accountants assistant managers or teachers but pampered passengers assured of being fed spoiled and entertained for the next ten days the brochures guaranteed it from the rail of the observation deck serena watched the flow of humanity at that distance she could enjoy the colour and noise which never lost its appeal for her without being caught in the inevitable tangle of fifteen hundred people trying to get to the same place at the same time the cooks the bartenders the cabin stewards had already begun the orgy of work that would continue virtually uninterrupted for the next ten days but she had time serena relished it these were her idle moments before the ship pulled out of port she could remember her first experience with a cruise liner shed been eight the youngest of the three children of financial wizard daniel macgregor and dr anna whitefield macgregor there had been firstclass cabins where the steward had served her hot buns and juice in bed serena had enjoyed it the same way she enjoyed her tiny cabin in the crews quarters now they were both an adventure serena remembered too the day she had told her parents of her plans to apply for a job with the celebration her father had huffed and puffed about her throwing away her education the more he had huffed the more pronounced his soft scottish burr had become a woman who had graduated from smith at the tender age of twenty who had then gone on to earn degrees in english history and sociology didnt swab decks and even as serena had assured him that wasnt her intention her mother had laughed telling daniel to let the child be because at six foot three and two hundred and twenty pounds daniel macgregor was helpless against what he called his females he did just that so serena had gotten her job and had escaped from what had become endless years of study shed traded her threeroom suite in the family mansion in hyannis port for a oneroom broom closet with a bunk on a floating hotel none of her coworkers cared what her iq was or how many degrees shed earned they didnt know her father could have bought the cruise line lock stock and barrel if hed had the whim or that her mother was an authority on thoracic surgery they didnt know her oldest brother was a senator and the younger a states attorney when they looked at her they saw serena that was all she wanted lifting her head she let the wind take her hair it danced on the breeze a mass of blond the rich shade of gold one found in old paintings she had high slanting cheekbones and a sharp stubborn jaw her skin refused to tan remaining a delicate peach to contrast with the violetblue of her eyes her father called them purple a few romantics had called them violet serena stubbornly termed them blue and left it at that men were drawn to them because of their uniqueness then to her because of the elegant sexuality she exuded without thought but she wasnt very interested intellectually serena thought a man was a fool if he fell for a shade of irises it was a matter of genetics after all and had little to do with her personally shed listened to accolades on her eyes for twentysix years with a kind of detached wonder there was a miniature in her fathers library of his greatgrandmother another serena if anyone had asked she could have explained the process of genetics that resulted in the resemblance down to the bone structure and eye shade and the reputed temper but the men she met were generally not interested in scientific explanation and serena was generally not interested in them below her the crowd flowing up the gangway was thinning shortly the calypso band would be playing on the lido deck to entertain the passengers while the ship prepared to sail serena would enjoy staying outside listening to the tinny rhythmic music and laughter there would be a buffet laden with more food than the well over one thousand people could possibly eat exotic drinks and excitement soon the rails would be packed with people wanting that last glimpse of shore before all there would be was open sea wistfully she watched the last stragglers come on board it was the final cruise of the season when they returned to miami the celebration would go into dry dock for two months when it sailed again serena wouldnt be on it shed already made up her mind that it was time to move on when shed taken the job on the ship she had been looking for one thing freedom from years of study from family expectations from her own restlessness she knew she had accomplished something in the year on her own serena had found the independence she had always struggled for and she had escaped the niche so many of her college friends had been determinedly heading for a good marriage and yet though shed found the freedom and independence she hadnt found the most important ingredient the goal what did serena macgregor want to do with the rest of her life she didnt want the political career both her brothers had chosen she didnt want to teach or lecture she wanted excitement and challenges and no longer wanted to look for them in a classroom they were all negative answers but she knew whatever it was that would fill the rest of her life wouldnt be found by floating endlessly in the bahamas time to get off the boat rena she told herself with a sudden smile the next adventures always just around the corner not knowing what it would be only made the search more intriguing the first long loud blast of the horn was her signal drawing back from the rail serena went to her cabin to change within thirty minutes she entered the ships casino dressed in the modified tux that was her uniform she had pulled her hair back in a loose bun at the nape of her neck so that it wouldnt tend to fall all over her face her hands would soon be too busy to fool with it the chandeliers were lit spilling light onto the red and gold art deco carpet long curved windows allowed a view of the glassedin promenade deck then the bluegreen stretch of sea the remaining walls were lined with slot machines as silent as soldiers waiting for an attack fussing with the bow tie she could never seem to get quite right serena crossed to her supervisor as with any sailor the shifting of the ship under her feet went unnoticed serena macgregor reporting for duty sir she said crisply turning a clipboard in one hand he looked her up and down dale zimmermans lightweight boxers build skimmed just under six feet he had a smooth handsome face he dedicatedly tanned winning crinkles at the corners of his light blue eyes and sunbleached hair that curled riotously he had a reputation which he assiduously promoted of being a marvellous lover after his brief study of serena his grin broke out rena cant you ever get this thing right tucking the clipboard under his arm dale straightened her tie i like to give you something to do you know lover if youre serious about quitting after this run this is going to be your last chance for paradise tugging on her tie he lifted his eyes to grin into hers serena cocked a brow what had begun a year ago as an ardent pursual on dales part had been tempered into a goodhumoured joke about serenas refusal to go to bed with him they had become more to his surprise than hers friends im going to hate to miss it serena told him with a sigh did the little redhead from south dakota go home happy she asked with a guileless smile dales eyes narrowed anybody ever tell you that you see too much all the time whats my table youre on two taking out a cigarette dale lit it as she walked away if anyone had told him a year before that a classy number like serena macgregor would not only hold him off but make him feel fraternal hed have recommended a good psychiatrist with a shrug he went back to his clipboard he was going to regret losing her dale reflected and not only because of his personal feelings she was the best damn blackjack dealer he had there were eight blackjack tables scattered throughout the casino serena and the seven other dealers would rotate from position to position through the rest of the afternoon and evening with only a brief staggered dinner break unless the playing was light the casino would stay open until two if it was heavy a few tables might stay open until three the first rule was to give the passengers what they wanted other men and women clad in tuxedos went to their stations beside serena the young italian who had just been promoted to croupier stood at table two serena gave him a smile remembering that dale had asked her to keep an eye on him enjoy yourself tony she suggested eyeing the crowd that already waited outside the glass doors its going to be a long night and all on our feet she added silently as dale gave the signal to open the door passengers poured in not in a trickle they rarely trickled in the first day of a cruise the crowd would be thin during the dinner hours then swell again until past midnight dress was casual shorts jeans bare feet the uniform for afternoon gambling with the opening of the door serena heard the musical sound effects of arcade games already being fed on the promenade deck within minutes the sound was drowned out by the steady clatter of slots serena could separate the gamblers from the players and the players from the lookers there was always some of each group in any batch of passengers there would be a percentage who had never been to a casino before they would simply wander around attracted by the noise and the colourful equipment before they exchanged their bills for change for the slots there were some who came for fun not really caring if they won or lost these were the players they came for the game it usually took little time for the looker to become the player they would shout when they won and moan when they lost in much the same way the arcade addicts reacted but always there were the gamblers they would haunt the casino during the trip turning the game of win and lose into an art or an obsession they had no specific features no particular mode of dress the mystique of the riverboat gambler could be found in the neat little grandmother from peoria just as it could be found in the madison avenue executive as the tables began to fill serena categorized them she smiled at the five people who had chosen her table then broke the seal on four decks of cards welcome aboard she said and began to shuffle it took only an hour for the scent of gambling to rise it permeated the smoke and light sweat that drifted through the casino it was a heady scent tempting serena had always wondered if it was what drew people more man the lights and green baize the scent and the noise of silver clattering in the bowls of the slot machines serena never played them perhaps because she recognized the gambler in herself shed decided long ago not to risk anything unless the odds were on her side during her first shift she changed tables every thirty minutes making her way slowly around the room after her dinner break it began again the casino grew more crowded after the sun set tables were full and the roulette wheel spun continuously dress became more elegant as if to gamble in the evening required glamour because the cards and people always changed serena was never bored she had chosen the job to meet people not the cutoutofthesameaffluentcloth people shed met in college but a variety in that shed accomplished her goal at the moment she had a texan two new yorkers a korean and a georgian at her table all of whom shed identified by their accents this was as much a pan of the game for her as the cards she slid onto the baize one she never tired of serena dealt the second card around peeked at her hole card and was satisfied with an eighteen the first new yorker took a hit counted his cards and gave a disgusted grunt with a shake of the head he indicated that hed stand the korean busted on twentytwo then rose from the table with a mutter the second new yorker a sleek blonde in a narrow black dinner dress held with a nine and a queen ill take one the man from georgia drawled he counted eighteen gave serena a thoughtful look and held the man from texas took his time he had fourteen and didnt like the eight serena had showing considering the possibilities he stroked his chin swilled some bourbon then motioned serena to hit him she did a tad too hard with a nine sweetheart he said as he leaned on the table youre just too pretty to take a mans money that way sorry with a smile she turned over her hole card eighteen she announced before she settled the betting serena saw the hundreddollar bill on the table before she realized someone had taken the koreans vacant stool glancing up she met a pair of green eyes cool depthless direct she stared trapped in that instant of contact into seeing nothing else cool green with amber rimming the iris something like ice skidded down her spine forcing herself to blink serena looked at the man he had the lean face of an aristocrat but this was no prince serena sensed it instantly perhaps it was the long unsmiling mouth or the rough sweep of black brows or perhaps it was simply the inner warning that went off in her brain a ruler yes but not royalty this was the type of man who planned ruthless coups and succeeded his hair flowed over his ears thick and black and down to the collar of a white silk shirt the skin stretched taut over the long bones of his face was as tanned as dales but serena didnt think he worked on the tone like her supervisor this man faced the elements without a thought for fashion he didnt slouch like the texan or lounge indolently like the man from georgia but rather sat like a sleek patient cat always coiled to spring it wasnt until one rough brow rose slightly in question that serena realized shed been staring change a hundred she said briskly annoyed with herself with deft movements she slipped the bill into the slot of the table then counted out chips when the bets were placed she dealt the cards the man from new york glanced at the ten serena had showing and hit on fourteen he broke the new player held on fifteen with a wordless gesture of his hand she broke the other new yorker and the georgian before the texan held on nineteen serena turned over a three to go with her ten dealt herself a deuce then broke with twentythree the man with the dangerous face drew out a thin cigar and continued to play silently serena already knew he was a gambler his name was justin blade his ancestors had ridden swift ponies and hunted with bow and arrow serena had been right about the aristocracy though his bloodline wasnt royal part of his heritage came from simple french immigrants and a dash from welsh miners the rest was comanche he hadnt known a reservation and though he had brushed with poverty in his youth he was well accustomed to the feel of silk against his skin accustomed enough so that like the very wealthy he rarely noticed it his first stake had been won in the backroom of a pool hall when hed been fifteen in the twenty years since hed played more elegant games he was as serena had sensed a gambler and he was already figuring the odds justin had entered the casino with the notion of passing a few hours with a mild game a man could relax with small stakes when he could afford to lose then hed seen her his eyes had passed over other women in sleek dinner dress the gleam of gold and sparkle of jewels and came to rest on the blonde in the mannish tuxedo she had a slender neck which her hairstyle and the ruffled shirtfront accentuated and a carriage that shouted breeding but what was more what he had sensed in the loins was a blatant sexuality that required no movement no words on her part she was a woman a man would beg for justin watched her hands as she dealt they were exquisite narrow longfingered with delicate blue veins just under the surface of creamy skin her nails were oval and perfect with the gleam of clear polish they were hands suited to fragile teacups and french pastries the kind of hands a man burned to have on his skin lifting his eyes from them justin looked directly into hers with the faintest of frowns serena stared back why was it she wondered that this dark silent man brought her both discomfort and curiosity he hadnt spoken a word since hed sat down not to her nor to any of the others at her table though hed been winning with professional consistency he didnt appear to gain any pleasure from it he didnt appear to be paying any attention to the game if it came to that she told herself all he did was stare at her with that same calm watchful expression fifteen serena said coolly indicating the cards in front of him justin nodded for the hit and took a six without the slightest change of expression damn if you dont have the luck son the texan stated jovially glancing at his own meager pile of chips he gave a quick grimace glad somebody does he wheezed as serena dealt him the card that eased him out at twentytwo turning over twenty for the house she collected chips then slid two twentyfive dollar markers to justin his fingertips covered hers over them the touch was light but potent enough to have her eyes flashing up to his watching her steadily he made no move to take his hand from hers there was no pressure no flirtatious squeeze but serena felt the response shoot through her as though their bodies rather than their fingers had pressed together calling on all her control she slowly brought her hand back to her side new dealer she said calmly noting with relief that her shift at that station was finished have a nice evening she moved to the next station swearing to herself she wouldnt look back of course she did and found her eyes pinned to his infuriated she allowed herself a slight toss of her head her expression became challenging for the first time that evening she saw the long mouth curve in a slow smile a smile that barely shifted the angles and planes on his face justin inclined his head as if accepting the challenge serena turned her back on him good evening she said in a clear voice to the new set of players the moon was still high cutting a swath of light across the black water from the rail serena could see the white tips of waves as the ship moved in a fast sea it was after two am and the deck was deserted she liked this time of the morning while the passengers slept before the crew began its early shift she was alone with the sea and the wind and could imagine herself in any era she chose she breathed deeply inhaling the scent of salt spray and night theyd be in nassau just past dawn and while in port the casino would be closed she would have the morning free to do as she chose she preferred the night her mind drifted back to her working hours to the silent gambler whod sat at her table winning and watching she thought he was a man women would be drawn to but wasnt surprised that hed been alone a solitary man serena mused and strangely compelling attractive she admitted as she leaned farther out to let the wind whip at her face attractive in a dangerous sort of way but then it was in her blood to look on danger as a challenge risks could be calculated percentages measured and yet and yet serena didnt think the man would follow the neat path of theory night suits you serenas hands tightened on the rail though shed never heard him speak though she hadnt even heard his approach she knew who stood behind her it took all her effort not to gasp and whirl while her heart hammered she turned to watch him come out of the shadows wanting her voice to be steady she gave herself a moment while he stopped to stand beside her at the rail did your luck hold she asked justin kept his eyes on her face apparently she tried and failed to place his origin through his accent his voice was deep and smooth and without inflection youre very good she stated we dont often get a professional in the casino there seemed to be a quick flash of humour in his eyes before he drew out a slim cigar and lit it smoke stung the air then vanished in the wind serena relaxed her fingers on the rail one at a time are you enjoying your trip more than i anticipated he took a slow thoughtful drag on the cigar are you serena smiled its my job justin leaned back against the rail resting his hand beside hers thats not an answer serena he pointed out since there was a name tag on her lapel she only lifted a brow at his use of her name i enjoy it mr blade he said softly as he ran a fingertip down her jawline justin blade remember it serena refused to back up though the lightning response of her body to his touch surprised her instead she regarded him steadily ive a good memory with a trace of a smile he nodded yes thats why youre a good dealer how long have you been doing it a year though he removed his fingertip her blood didnt cool surprised justin took a last drag on his cigar then crushed it under his foot i would have thought longer from the way you handle the cards taking her hand from the rail he studied the back then turned it over to look at the palm soft he thought and steady an interesting combination what did you do before even as her brain told her retreat would be wise serena allowed her hand to remain in his she sensed strength and skill in the touch though she wasnt certain of the aspect of either i studied what whatever interested me what do you do whatever interests me she laughed a low sultry sound that whispered along his skin somehow i think you mean that quite literally mr blade she started to remove her hand but his fingers closed over it i do he murmured its justin serena his eyes skimmed the deserted deck then the dark endless sea this isnt the place for formality common sense told her to tread carefully instinct drove her to provoke there are rules for the crew when dealing with passengers mr blade she said coolly i need my hand when he smiled the moonlight glittered in his eyes like a cats so do i lifting it he pressed his lips deep in the centre of her palm serena felt the aftershock of the kiss in every pore i take what i need he murmured against her flesh her breathing had quickened without her being aware of it on the dark empty deck he was barely more than a shadow with a voice that might have been pressed through honey and dangerous eyes feeling her body yearning toward him serena restrained it with a quick flash of temper not this time im going in its late keeping her hand firmly in his justin reached up to pull the pins from her hair as it tumbled over her shoulders he tossed them into the sea stunned by his audacity serena glared at him late he agreed combing his fingers from the crown to the tips of the thick blond mane but youre a woman for the dark hours i thought so the moment i saw you with a movement that was too quick and too smooth to be measured he had serena trapped between his body and the rail her hair flew toward the sea pulled by the wind her skin pure as marble in the moonlight justin discovered the need was stronger that he had realized do you know what i thought serena demanded struggling to keep her words from jerking i thought you were rude and annoying he laughed a rich quick sound of amusement it seems we were both right should i tell you it very nearly distracted me from my game wondering how you tasted serena became very still the only movement came from the rich strands of gold that danced around her face then her chin rose her eyes darkened with challenge a pity she said quietly as she curled her hand into a fist passenger or no passenger she determined she was going to give him a good swift punch just the way her brothers had taught her its rare for anything or anyone to interfere with my concentration as he spoke he leaned closer serena tensed her muscles you have the eyes of a witch im a superstitious man arrogant serena corrected steadily but i doubt superstitious she saw the smile in his eyes only as his face dominated her vision dont you believe in luck serena yes and a good right jab she added silently she felt his fingers slide beneath her blowing hair to cup the base of her neck his mouth lowered toward hers somehow the warm flutter of his breath caused her lips to part and her concentration to waver one hand still held hers and he circled the palm with a finger as if to remind her of the feel of his lips on her flesh fighting the growing weakness serena drew back aiming for his vulnerable unsuspecting stomach less than an inch away from her target her fist was captured in a hard grip frustrated she struggled only to hear his quiet laugh again your eyes give you away he told her holding her still youll have to work on it if you dont let me go ill the threat trailed off as his lips brushed hers it wasnt a kiss but a temptation her tongue came out to moisten her lips as if in anticipation of something darkly sweet and strictly forbidden what he whispered touching his mouth to hers again with a lightness that had the blood pounding in his head he wanted to crush and devour almost as much as he wanted to savour her lips were damp and she smelled faintly of the sea and summer when she didnt answer justin traced the shape of her mouth with his tongue committing it to memory while he absorbed the flavour and waited serena felt the thick liquefying pleasure seep into her her lids were too heavy and fluttered closed her muscles relaxed the fist still curled in his hand went limp for the first time in her memory her mind went blank a clean slate on which he could have written anything he desired she felt the tiny arousing pain as he nipped into her full bottom lip and her mind filled again but not with thoughts his body was against hers hard and lean his mouth was so soft softer than she thought any mans could be like the brush of fine silk against naked flesh there was the faint scent of tobacco something rich and foreign and the smell of him without the interference of cologne he whispered her name as she had never heard it spoken before the boat listed but he swayed with it as easily as she as he gathered her closer with no more thoughts of resisting serena let her arms curve around his neck her head dropping back in invitation justin felt an almost savage need to plunder as he gripped her hair in his hand open your eyes he demanded while he watched the heavy lids opened to reveal eyes misted with pleasure look at me when i kiss you he murmured then his mouth crushed hers ruthless ravaging he could hear his own heartbeat raging in his chest as he plunged deeper he discovered tastes endless flavours in the recesses he explored as her tongue answered with equal urgency his eyes were only slits while he watched the misty pleasure in hers smoulder into passion then become opaque on a moan they closed and his own vision blurred serena felt desire grip her as if it had claws wants needs secrets were exposed in one tumultuous explosion even as she hungered to fulfil them she realized he was a man who could strip her to the soul and she knew nothing of him frightened she struggled to free herself but he held her close his lips clinging until he was done in some sane portion of her brain she realized he would always take without regard for willingness when she was free serena took time to catch her breath justin watched her again with that strange ability he had for absolute stillness and absolute silence there would be no reading his eyes in a habitual defence serena turned her fear into anger if you read your brochure youll see that your passage fee doesnt include your pick of the crew certain things have no price serena something in his tone made her tremble it was as if hed already put his mark on her a mark she wouldnt easily erase she backed into the shadows stay away from me she warned him justin leaned back on the rail keeping his gaze on her silhouette no he said mildly ive already dealt the cards and the odds always favour the house well im not interested she hissed so deal me out turning she clattered down the stairs that led to the next deck slipping his hands into his pockets justin jingled change and smiled not a chance chapter two serena slipped into a pair of khaki shorts then crawled under her bunk to find her sandals according to her calculations most of the passengers who would disembark for the day on nassau would have already done so there was little chance of being caught in the crush or of having to weave her way through the waiting cab drivers and tour guides on the docks since it would be her last trip there serena wanted to play tourist herself and pick up a few souvenirs to take home to her family cursing the sandal which had somehow tucked itself into a far corner she squiggled farther under the bunk youd think id learn to be neat after living in a closet for a year she muttered wiggling back out again she lay full length she could touch each side wall of the cabin in the other direction she had about two feet to spare beside the bunk there was a tiny mirrored dresser bolted to the floor and a cubbyhole that passed for closet space shed often thought it was a lucky thing she didnt suffer from claustrophobia still on the floor she pushed the sandals on her feet then began to check the contents of the tote bag she would carry a wallet and sunglasses well she couldnt think of anything else that was necessary serena reflected as she jumped lightly to her feet briefly she considered asking one of the other dealers if they wanted to join her then rejected the idea she wasnt in the best of moods and it wouldnt take anyone whod worked closely with her long to notice it and perhaps ferret out the reason the last thing serena wanted to discuss was justin blade in fact she added smartly as she pulled a khaki tennis cap over her hair the last thing she wanted to even think about was justin blade with his cool green eyes long unsmiling mouth and ruthless good looks when serena realized she was thinking about him she left her cabin in an even poorer mood only nine more days she reminded herself as she ignored the elevator and marched up the steps she could put up with anything for nine days with a smirk serena remembered the salesman from detroit who had haunted her table throughout a cruise the previous spring hed gone so far as to follow her down to the crews quarters and try to talk his way into her cabin shed dispatched him by claiming her lover was the chief engineer a swarthy italian with biceps like cinder blocks serenas smirk faded somehow she didnt think that tactic would work with a man like justin blade as she climbed upward the threadbare carpet of the crews decks was replaced by the bold red and gold pattern that graced the rest of the ship ornate light fixtures lit the landings rather than the plain glass shields of belowdecks coming out on the main level she exchanged a quick word of greeting with other members of the crew still on board two men lounged on either side of the gangway one in the crisp white uniform of the first mate the other in casual cruise wear as usual they were arguing intensely but without heat serena caught the eye of the cruise director first a small englishman with sandy hair and boundless energy she winked at him then planted herself in between the two men what diplomat put the two of you on gangway duty together she asked with a mock sigh i suppose ill have to play referee again what is it this time rob claims that mrs dewalter is a rich widow jack the englishman began in his rounded tones i say shes divorced a widow the first mate started again folding his arms a beautiful rich widow mrs dewalter serena mused tall jack began short sculptured red hair built rob added philistine jack put in mildly then addressed himself to serena a rather gamine face okay serena said slowly getting the picture of a woman shed seen briefly in the casino the night before widowed or divorced she inquired well used to the picky arguments between the two men what about rings exactly rob pounced on the question with a smirk for his associate she wore rings widows wear rings so do bubblebrained first mates jack pointed out with a glance at the signet ring on robs hand the point is serena interrupted before rob could retort what sort of rings a gold band a jewelled circle a chunk of ice as big as a hens egg rob told her giving jack another satisfied sneer rich widow divorced serena disagreed bursting his bubble sorry if we go with the percentages rob thats the most likely answer hens eggs are rarely worn for sentimental value after patting his cheek in consolation she gave him a snappy salute permission to go ashore sir get out of here he gave her a quick nudge go buy a straw mat my plans exactly with a laugh she jogged down the narrow iron steps to the dock the sun was brilliant the air moist and balmy serena bargained with a few boys who loitered on the docks hawking shell necklaces and decided it wouldnt be such a bad day after all she had hours before her to do as she chose in one of the prettiest tourist spots in the bahamas three dollars the leanlimbed black boy told her holding out handfuls of darkshelled necklaces he wore only a pair of shorts and a medallion that was slowly oxidizing his partner held a small portable radio to his ear moving lithely to the scratchy reggae beat you pirate serena said goodnaturedly one dollar the boy grinned sensing a true haggler oh pretty lady he began in his high singsong voice if i could i would give you the necklace for only your smile but then my father would beat me serena lifted a brow yes i can see how abused you are one dollar and a quarter twofifty i gathered the shells myself and strung them by the light of a candle with a laugh serena shook her head the next thing youll tell me is you fought off a school of sharks no sharks near our island my lady he said proudly two american dollars one and a half american dollars because i admire your imagination digging into her tote she drew out her wallet the money was out of her hands and into the pocket of his shorts in the blink of an eye for you pretty lady i will risk a beating serena chose her necklace then found herself giving him another quarter pirate she murmured as he grinned at her slinging her tote over her shoulder she started to walk away it was then that she saw him standing alone on the dock behind her serena wasnt as surprised as she thought she shouldve been but then somehow shed known shed see him he wore a plain beige tshirt that made his skin seem nearly copper and a faded pair of cutoffs that accentuated his lean muscular thighs and rangy build though the sun was glaring fiercely he wore no tinted glasses or other protection he didnt seem to need it just as she was debating whether she should simply walk by him he came toward her he moved lightly with the grace of a hunter a man she thought for no specific reason who was more accustomed to sand or grass than asphalt good morning justin took her hand as though the meeting had been arranged good morning she returned frostily refusing to give him any satisfaction by tugging on her hand didnt you sign up for any of the tours no i dont care to be directed he began to walk toward town with serena in tow biting back words of fury she spoke in a calculatedly pleasant voice several of the tours are very worthwhile theyre really the best way to see the island in the limited amount of time were in port youve been here before he said easily why dont you show me im off duty serena stated crisply and im going shopping fine since youve already begun he said glancing down at the necklace she still held in her hand where do you want to go next she decided to give up diplomacy altogether will you please go away i plan to enjoy myself today so do i alone she said pointedly stopping he turned to her ever hear about americans sticking together on foreign soil he asked as he took the necklace from her fingers and slipped it over her head no she returned wishing she didnt want so badly to smile ill explain it to you while we take a carriage ride im going shopping she reminded him as he led her toward town youll have a better idea where to buy what after a ride justin serena matched his stride because it was better than being hauled do you ever take no for an answer he appeared to think this over before he shook his head not that i remember i didnt think so she muttered then stood eyeing him stonily all right lets try it this way heads we go for a ride tails you go shopping reaching into his pocket he drew out a coin probably has two heads serena frowned suspiciously at the quarter i never cheat justin said solemnly as he held the coin between his forefinger and thumb for her inspection she could refuse and simply walk away serena considered but she found herself nodding the odds were even with a practiced flick of the wrist justin sent the coin spinning in the air nabbed it then flipped it over on the back of his hand heads somehow shed known it would be never bet against the house serena mumbled as she climbed into a carriage as the horse began its meandering clipclop down the street serena thought about maintaining a dignified silence for about thirty seconds knowing herself well she was forced to admit that if she hadnt wanted to get into the carriage she wouldnt have gotten into it not without a fuss so instead of a dignified silence serena dropped her tote bag on the floor of the carriage ignoring the charm of the narrow little street and stared at her companion what are you doing here he tossed an arm over the seat his fingers skimming over her hair enjoying the ride no smart answers justin you wanted my company and youve got it unless i decide to scream assault and jump out of the carriage he eyed her for a moment first in curiosity then in admiration shed do just that he dropped his fingers to the nape of her neck what do you want to know what are you doing on the celebration serena demanded shifting away from the pleasure his fingers brought her you dont strike me as the type of man whod go on a relaxing tropical cruise a friend recommended it i was restless he was persuasive his fingers brushed her neck again what are you doing on the celebration dealing blackjack his brow rose at her answer why i was restless in spite of herself serena smiled the driver started his monologue on the highlights of the island but noted that the couple wasnt interested in anything but each other he clicked his tongue at the horse then remained silent all right where are you from serena asked looking for a starting point i have a habit of placing people in regions and i cant place you justin smiled enigmatically i travel originally she persisted narrowing her eyes at the evasion nevada vegas serena nodded youve spent some time there i imagine its a good town for people with the right skills when he only shrugged serena studied his profile and thats how you make your living gambling justin turned his head until his eyes met hers yes why there were only two gamblers at that table last night serena mused you and the man from georgia though he was a milder sort and the others justin asked curiosity piqued oh the texan just likes the game he doesnt put that much thought into it the blonde from new york thinks shes a gambler because the gentle swaying of the carriage was soothing serena smiled a little and relaxed but she cant keep up with the cards or the odds shell end up dropping a bundle or winning on sheer luck the other man from new york watches the cards but doesnt know how to bet you have the concentration that separates a gambler from a player a very interesting theory justin reflected with a fingertip he slid serenas sunglasses down the bridge of her nose so he could see her eyes without interference do you play serena depends on the game and the odds she told him pushing the glasses back up i dont like to lose from the look in his eyes she realized they hadnt been speaking of cards but a more dangerous game smiling he leaned back again gesturing toward the right with his hand they have beautiful beaches here hmm as if on cue the driver began his spiel again giving a running commentary on the island until he brought them back to their starting point the streets were filled with people now the majority of them tourists with bulging shopping bags and cameras both sides of the road were lined with little shops some with their doors open all with their windows crowded with displays well thanks for the ride serena started to climb down but justin circled her waist with his hands and lifted her lightly he held her an inch above the ground for a moment while she gripped his shoulders for balance her lightness surprised him making him realize that her sexuality and style had blinded him to how small she was his fingers became abruptly gentle as he set her on the ground thanks serena managed after shed cleared her throat enjoy your day i intend to he told her as he took her hand again justin serena took a deep breath the time had come she decided to take a firm stand that brief instant when he had held her had reminded her how foolish she had been to relax even for a moment i took your carriage ride now im going shopping fine ill go with you im looking for souvenirs justin she said discouragingly you know tshirts straw boxes youll be bored im never bored you will be this time she told him as he began to meander down the street his fingers laced with hers i promise how about an ashtray that says welcome to nassau justin suggested blandly valiantly she swallowed a chuckled im going in here serena stated stopping on impulse at the first shop they came to and she determined she would stop at every shop on bay street until she successfully drove him crazy by the time her tote bag contained musical key chains assorted tshirts and shell boxes serena had forgotten she had wanted to be rid of him he made her laugh the gentlest seduction for a man she had instinctively termed a loner justin was easy company before long serena had not only stopped being resentful shed stopped being wary oh look she grabbed a coconut shell that had been fashioned into a grinning head elegant justin stated turning it over in his hands its ridiculous you fool laughing serena fished out her wallet and perfect for my brother caines ridiculous too well not all the time she added scrupulously the aisles of the straw market were crammed with people and merchandise but not so crowded that serena couldnt worm her way through in search of treasures spotting a large woven bag overhead she pointed justin obligingly lifted it down to her its nearly as big as you are he decided as she took it from him its not for me serena murmured studying it minutely my mother does a lot of needlework this should be handy for carting it around with her handmade serena glanced down at the large darkskinned woman in a rocking chair smoking a little brown pipe myself she added patting her generous bosom nothing made in hong kong at my stall you do beautiful work serena told her though the woman already interested her more than the bag lifting a large palm fan the islander nodded majestically and began to stir the sultry air serena was fascinated to see a ring on every thick finger you buy something pretty for your lady today she asked justin with a flash of white teeth no not yet justin said before serena could speak what do you suggest justin here the old woman cut serena off turning to push back some cloth at her right with a few wheezes and grunts she pulled out a creamcoloured dashikistyle tunic with a border of bold rainbow stitches special the woman told justin pushing it into his hands lots of purple here like your ladys eyes blue serena began and im not lets see justin held it up in front of her surveying the effect through narrowed eyes yes it suits you he decided you wear it for your man tonight the woman advised already folding it into a bag very sexy an excellent idea justin agreed as he started to count out bills wait a minute serena pointed at him with the hand that still held the straw bag he is not my man not your man the woman went into peals of laughter rocking back and forth in the chair until it screeched in protest honey this is your man for sure you cant trick a seventh daughter of a seventh daughter no indeed you want the bag too well i serena stared down at the straw bag as if she hadnt a clue how it had gotten into her hand the bag too justin peeled off more bills thank you the money disappeared into her huge hand as she continued to rock you enjoy our island now wait but justin was already pulling her along you cant argue with a seventh daughter of a seventh daughter serena you never know what curse shell toss at you nonsense she stated but glanced cautiously over her shoulder to where the big woman sat rocking and you cant buy me clothes justin i dont even know you i already did well you shouldnt have and you paid for my mothers bag my compliments to your mother she sighed squinting as they emerged into daylight youre a very difficult man there you see you do know me taking her sunglasses from the top of her hat he slid them back in front of her eyes hungry yes the comers of her mouth twitched so serena gave up and smiled yes i am with his eyes on hers he slowly circled her palm with a fingertip how about a picnic on the beach it wasnt a simple matter to ignore the tingling that was now racing up her arm but she managed a casual shrug if you had food and if you had transportation and if you had some cold island concoction to drink i might be interested anything else justin asked as he stopped to lean on the hood of a mercedes not that i can think of okay lets go then pulling keys out of his pocket justin walked around to unlock the passenger door of the car with her tote bag dangling from her fingers serena stared do you mean this is your car no this is the car i rented theres a cooler in the trunk do you like cold chicken when he tossed the bags into the backseat serena put her hands on her hips you were awfully damn sure of yourself werent you just playing the odds he claimed then cupped her chin in his hands and brushed her lips with his just playing the odds serena dropped into the passenger seat not certain if she admired or detested his sheer nerve id like to know what cards he has up his sleeve she muttered as he rounded the hood to join her she noticed justin drove as he did everything else with the arrogant ease of control he seemed acclimated to driving on the left side of the road as if he did so daily they passed under the fat leaves of almond trees beside thick green grapes which would be purple in another month branches laden with the bright orange blossoms typical of the island danced in the breeze as they drew nearer to the sea he didnt speak and again she noticed he had that oddly admirable capacity for silence yet it wasnt soothing but exciting it occurred to her as they drove by the graceful colonial homes of the wealthy toward the public beaches that true relaxation was something not often experienced around a man like justin blade then the thought came quickly too quickly that relaxation was something she rarely looked for turning in her seat serena exchanged the tropical beauty of nassau for justins handsome almost hawkish features a gambler she mused a shipboard acquaintance serena had too much experience with the two to trust in any deep lasting relationship still she thought that if she were careful she might enjoy his companionship for a few days what harm could there be in getting to know him a bit better in spending some of her free time with him she wasnt like some of her coworkers in the casino who fell in and out of love with each other or lost their hearts to a passenger only to be miserable and desolated at the end of a cruise when a woman had managed to keep her heart in one piece for twentysix years she wasnt about to lose it in ten days was she justin turned to give her one of his cool unsmiling looks butterflies fluttered in her throat shed be very careful serena decided as if she were walking through a minefield what are you thinking about bombs she answered blandly deadly camouflaged bombs she gave him a quick innocent grin are we going to eat soon im starving with a last brief look justin pulled off to the side of the road hows this serena gazed out over the white sand to the intense blue of the ocean perfect stepping from the car she took a deep breath of blossoms and sea and hot sand i dont do this often when the ships in port i usually catch up on my sleep or my reading or give another shot at getting a tan on deck ive lost count of the number of times ive been docked at this island didnt you take the job on the ship to travel he took a small cooler and a folded blanket from the trunk no it was the people really i wanted to find out just how many kinds of people there were in the world serena slipped off her sandals to feel the warm sand on her feet we have more than five hundred in the crew and only ten americans youd be amazed at the variety of people you meet its like a floating un taking the blanket from under his arm serena snapped it open then let it billow onto the sand ive dealt cards to people from every continent she seated herself indian fashion on the edge of the blanket ill miss that miss it justin dropped down beside her are you quitting tossing her hat aside serena shook back her hair its time i want to catch up with my family for a while before i do anything else anything else in mind ive been thinking about a hotelcasino she pursed her lips in thought it was a project she intended to discuss with her father soon hed know the best way to go about financing property and a building youve had the experience justin mused believing she was considering applying for a job as a dealer the only difference would be youd be on dry land an idea germinated in his mind but he decided to wait before approaching her with it wheres your family hmm oh massachusetts her gaze fell on the cooler feed me when he opened the lid she noticed the napkins and cutlery came from the ship howd you manage that serena demanded the kitchen has a policy against making up picnic lunches i bribed them he said simply and handed her a drumstick oh she took a healthy bite good thinking whatd you get to drink for an answer justin drew out a thermos and two plastic glasses with the ships logo hows the chicken terrific eat she accepted the cup of dark pink liquid he handed her and sipped cautiously it was richly fruity smoothed with island rum ohoh the celebrations specialty she gave the drink a dubious look i usually make it a policy not to get within a yard of one of these youre on shore leave justin reminded her plucking a piece of chicken from the cooler and i want to live to tell about it she murmured for the moment she concentrated on the chicken and the pleasure of having no more to do than enjoy the breeze off the ocean i wouldve thought the beaches would be more crowded justin commented mmm serena nodded as she drank again most of the tourists who arent shopping are on guided tours or scubaing on the other side of the island its off season too she gestured with the drumstick before she dropped it onto a napkin the beaches arent so quiet during the rush but theres really a lot to see and do in nassau besides swimming and sunbathing mmm he watched her brush some sand from her thigh so our carriage driver said im surprised you didnt ferry over to paradise island to the casinos for the day are you leaning over he took her hair in his hand it isnt the only game in town justin touched his lips to hers intending to give her a light teasing kiss but the intention evaporated at the warm ripe taste how could i have forgotten how badly i want you he murmured then drowned her muffled response with hard unyielding pressure his tongue eased between lips he parted expertly as he pressed her back against the blanket feeling the muscled ridges of his body against hers serena started to object but her arms were already around him pulling him closer her mouth was already searching moving avidly under his the sun filtered through the leaves of the palm they lay under flickering light over her closed lids until it was only a red mist dancing in front of her eyes he kissed her as shed never been kissed before with lips and teeth and tongue nibbling then devouring seducing then possessing mouth clung to mouth in a taste more potent than the rum theyd sampled a gull soared toward the sea with a long wailing cry neither of them heard then with a flick of a wing he was gone as if hed never been when justin ran his hands down her arms serena felt his touch over every inch of her body her breasts ached from it her thighs trembled longing for the imaginary to be real she moaned and moved under him in invitation ripping his mouth from hers justin pressed it against her throat as he struggled to cling to the fine edge of reason he wanted her wanted to feel her soft skin grow hot and moist under his hands he wanted to touch every subtle curve and dip feel every pulse hum and taste and taste until they were both raging desire clawed at him with a sharpness hed never experienced before as her hands moved over his back pressing and kneading while he fought to remember they were not alone in a dark quiet room had a woman ever taken him so far with only a kiss he could only think of how much further she would take him when he was free to have all of her nibbling and sucking he ran his mouth up to her ear come back with me now serena he licked the lobe before he caught it between his teeth come back to my cabin with me i want you his words seemed to float into her consciousness almost drifting away before their meaning penetrated her passion no hearing her own weak protest serena fought to strengthen it no she repeated struggling away from him sitting up she hugged her knees until her breathing levelled no she said for a third time you have no right to to to what justin demanded grabbing her face in his hands and jerking it back to him to want you or to show you that you want me his eyes werent cool now but light and angry serena remembered her own first impression of ruthlessness and forced back a shudder before she pushed his hands away dont tell me what i want she tossed back if youre interested in a little shipboard fling go find somebody else you shouldnt have any trouble springing up she strode furiously toward the sea justin caught her arm and spun her around and dont tell me what im interested in he ordered curtly you didnt even know where we were i could have taken you on a public beach in broad daylight really she threw her head back infuriated that he spoke no less than the truth well if youre so sure of that why didnt you normally i like my privacy but keep pushing and ill make an exception and pigs fly she said evenly as she turned toward the surf a second time shed no more than gotten her toes wet when he grabbed her again for a moment serena thought she had miscalculated the rage in his eyes was nothing to tamper with but shed never had much luck controlling her temper once it had gotten beyond a certain point when justin dragged her against him she cursed him he wanted to crush that hot furious mouth again desire was raging through him as quickly as his temper and one fed the other knowing what the outcome would be if he gave in to the first justin gave in to the second serena landed on her bottom in the shallows shock covered her face first then utter fury you you animal scrambling up she launched herself at him intent only on revenge but when he grabbed her arms to ward her off he was grinning would you believe you look beautiful when youre angry the dip in the water hadnt cooled her temper youre going to pay for that one justin blade with her arms hampered she compensated with a kick but only ended up back in the water tangled with him get your hands off me you jerk she shoved submerged and came up sputtering nobody pushes a macgregor around and gets away with it in his attempt to prevent her from drowning both of them his hand connected with her breast the next moment he found that his mouth had covered hers again while his hand caressed through her wet clinging shirt though he felt her moan of response she continued to straggle taking them both under again he tasted salt and her lips he felt the slender thighs pressed against his as he rolled her over with the next wave with a muffled laugh he heard her swear at him again as she gulped in air then the water tossed their bodies together the surf sprayed and ebbed shifting the sand and shells beneath them they lay half covered with water breathing hard macgregor he repeated suddenly shaking his head to clear it drops of water from his hair splattered on her face serena macgregor she pushed her own dripping hair out of her eyes and tried to think her body was throbbing with the potent combination of anger and desire yes and the moment i remember some of those wonderful scottish curses im going to dump them all on you for the first time she saw pure surprise on his face it had the effect of draining her anger and replacing it with bewilderment then his eyes narrowed on an intense study of her features still panting serena stared back only to become more confused when the smile spread slowly over his face dropping his forehead on hers justin chuckled then roared with laughter the sound was appealing but as she started to respond to it serena concentrated on the uncomfortable lump of sand and shell digging into her back whats so funny she demanded im soaking wet and full of gritty sand ive little doubt that my skins been slashed by shells and i never even finished my lunch still laughing he lifted his head then gave her a brotherly kiss on the nose ask me again sometime come on lets rinse off and eat chapter three serena macgregor justin shook his head as he reached into the narrow closet for a shirt it was he decided the first time hed been completely confounded in years when a man made his living by his wits he couldnt afford to be taken by surprise often strange that he hadnt noticed the family resemblance but then she had little in common physically with her large broadfeatured redhaired father she was more a modern version of the little painted miniature daniel kept in his library how many times had he been to that fortress in hyannis port over the years justin wondered rena as the family called her had always been away at school for some reason he had developed a picture of a scrawny bespectacled scholar with daniels flaming hair and annas eccentric dignity yes serena macgregor was quite a surprise odd he thought that she would take a job that would do little more than pay her room and board when she was reputed to have an iq that rivalled her fathers weight and enough capital to buy an ocean liner for her personal pleasure yacht then again the macgregors were a strange stubborn lot prone to the unexpected for a moment justin stood naked from the waist his shirt hanging forgotten from his fingertips his torso was dark and lean the skin stretched taut over his rib cage where on the left it was marred by a sixinch scar he was remembering the first time he had met daniel macgregor justin had been twentyfive a run of luck had given him enough money to buy out his partner in their small hotel on the strip in las vegas justin wanted to expand and remodel for that he needed financing banks were usually dubious about lending large sums of money to men who made their living with a deck of cards in any case justin didnt care for bankers with their smooth hands and dry voices and the indian in him had little faith in a promise made on paper then he heard of daniel macgregor in his own fashion justin checked out the stock wizard and financier he gained a picture of a tough eccentric scotsman who made his own rules and won justin contacted him diddled around by phone and letter for over a month then made his first trip to the fortress at hyannis port daniel worked out of his home he didnt care for office buildings where one had to depend on elevators and secretaries hed purchased his plot of land near the sea with the wealth he had earned first with his back and then with his mind daniel had realized early that he could earn more very satisfactorily with his mind then he had built his home and his empire to his own liking it was a huge barn of a house with massive corridors and enormous rooms daniel didnt like to be crowded justins first impression of him as he was led into the tower room that served as his office was of bulk and wit so youre blade daniel drummed his fingers on the surface of a desk that had been carved from a giant california redwood yes and youre macgregor a grin creased the broad face that i am sit down boy daniel noticed no change of expression at his use of the term and folded his hands over his chest as justin sat he liked the way justin moved hed judged men on less so you want a loan im offering an investment mr macgregor justin corrected him coolly the chair was designed to swallow a man justin sat in it with an ease that only accentuated the readiness to spring with my property as collateral of course ummhmm daniel steepled his hands as he continued to study the man across from him not a simple man he concluded observing the aristocratic features cool controlled and potentially violent comanche blood warriors blood but not a brawler daniel came from good warrior stock himself ummhmm he said again what are you worth boy an angry retort sprang to justins mind and was left to smoulder reaching down he brought up a briefcase i have the financial papers the appraisals and so forth daniel gave a gusty laugh and waved them away you think youd have gotten this far if i didnt know all the figures you have in there what about you he demanded why should i lend my money to you justin set the briefcase back on the floor i pay my debts wouldnt last long in the business if you didnt and ill make you a great deal of money daniel laughed again until his blue eyes watered ive got money boy only a fool doesnt want more justin said quietly and daniel stopped laughing leaning back in his chair he nodded youre damn right then he grinned slapping his wide palm on the desk youre damn right how much to fix up that little hole in the wall of yours three hundred and fifty thousand justin answered without blinking daniel reached into his desk and drew out a bottle of scotch and a deck of cards stud poker they played for an hour speaking only to bet justin heard the reverberating gong of a grandfathers clock from somewhere deep in the house once someone knocked on the door daniel bellowed at them and they werent disturbed again the scent of justins cigar mixed with the aroma of whiskey and the ripe fragrance of the overblown roses on the windowsill after dropping fifteen hundred dollars daniel leaned back in his chair again youll need stockholders ive just gotten rid of a partner justin crushed out the butt of his cigar i dont want another stockholders boy daniel pushed the cards aside you want to make money youve got to spread it around first a man who plays like you do already knows that with his pale blue eyes on justins he considered a moment ill lend you the money and buy in for ten percent youre smart you keep sixty and spread the rest around after swirling the scotch he drained his glass and grinned youre going to be rich i know daniels gusty laugh shook the windowpane stay for dinner he said heaving himself out of his chair justin stayed for dinner and became rich he renamed his hotel comanche then made it into one of the finest hotelcasinos in vegas he bought a dying property in tahoe and repeated his success within a decade he had five thriving gambling hotels and interests in a variety of enterprises throughout the country and europe in the ten years since their meeting in the tower room justin had been to the macgregor home dozens of times entertained daniel and anna in his own hotels and fished with their sons but hed never met the daughter bright girl daniel would say of her from time to time but wont settle down needs a good man you should meet her and justin had steered clear of the not so subtle matchmaking attempts or so hed thought the old devil he murmured shrugging into the shirt it had been daniel who had pushed him into the cruise get away from the pressure hed insisted nothing like good sea air and halfnaked women to relax a man because hed been restless justin had considered it then had been trapped when daniel had mailed him the tickets with a request for a case of dutyfree scotch so the old pirate was still wheeling and dealing justin thought amused daniel would have known that justin would spend time in the casino on board and left the rest to chance with a quick laugh justin began doing up the buttons of his shirt chance he reflected with a stacked deck what would the old man have to say if he knew his friend and business associate had been wrestling with his daughter that afternoon with the predominant notion of getting her into his bed exasperated justin ran a hand through his hair daniel macgregors daughter good god justin grabbed his jacket from the closet then closed it with a bang it would serve the cagey devil right if he had seduced his daughter it would serve him right if he avoided her for the rest of the trip and never uttered a word about meeting her in the first place that would drive the scotsman up the wall justin caught his own reflection in the mirror a dark lean man in black and white and if you think you can stay away from her youre out of your mind he muttered when he walked into the casino serena was standing near the small black and white monitor talking to the blond man justin recognized as her supervisor she laughed at something he said then shook her head justins eyes narrowed fractionally as dale ran a finger down her cheek he knew what it would feel like soft and cool to the touch dale grinned then straightened her bow tie as he spoke to her in undertones even recognizing the emotion as petty jealousy justin had trouble controlling it in a matter of days serena had made him feel desire fury and jealousy emotions he normally kept in perfect balance cursing her father he walked over to her serena he caught the quick stiffening of her shoulders before she turned not dealing tonight ive just come on from my break she should have known the twentyfour hour respite wouldnt last i didnt see you in here last night i thought perhaps youd fallen overboard hearing dales sharp indrawn breath serena turned back to him dale this is justin blade when i didnt fall for his charm at the beach in nassau he tossed me into the water i see dale extended his hand ive never tried that one did it work shut up dale serena said sweetly youll have to excuse her dale told justin sea life makes some of us surly are you enjoying your trip mr blade yes justin glanced at serena its been quite an experience so far you will pardon me she said with exaggerated politeness i have to relieve tony turning she stalked over to table five because gritting her teeth hurt her jaw serena forced the muscles to relax she gave the three players at the table a professional smile which iced over as justin took a vacant stool good evening new deck breaking the seals serena shuffled the cards together doing her best to ignore justins calm steady stare he stacked what she estimated to be two hundred dollars worth of chips in the slot in front of him then lit a cigar after giving the cards a final snap she determined to see if she could clean him out cut justin took the thin sheet of plastic she offered as serena slipped the cards into their clear holder he pushed a twentyfivedollar marker forward she checked the table to see if all bets were placed then began at one point serena had him down to three chips and was feeling a grim satisfaction then she dealt him double sevens which he split counting twenty on one hand and twentyone on the other steadily he built the five chips to ten when it came time to rotate her table he infuriated her by moving with her serena renewed her vow to clean him out for the next twenty minutes she hardly noticed the other players she could see only justins unfathomable green eyes or his hand as he stood pat or took a hit though she was determined to beat him his chips gradually multiplied i got blackjack the shout from the college student at the end of the table broke her concentration serena glanced over to see him grinning i won three dollars he told the casino at large holding up the three light blue chips like a trophy he was serena concluded pleasantly drunk now he slapped the three chips back on the table then rubbed his palms together im ready to gamble laughing she reached for the cards again but her eyes met justins she saw humour the first expression shed seen in them for hours and warmed to it for a moment she wanted to reach across the table and touch him run her fingers through the thick soft hair that surrounded his lean face how could the simple light of laughter in his eyes make him seem so important hey the college student lifted his beer in a toast im on a streak yeah of one his girlfriend said dryly the interruption cleared serenas head lifting her chin she reached for the cards one smile wasnt going to make her forget she was here to beat him possible blackjack she said as she flipped over an ace for herself insurance the college students girlfriend plunked down a chip justin didnt move turning up the tip of her hole card serena was satisfied with a three it would give her plenty of room no blackjack she glanced at justins cards pleased to have dealt him a poor count sixteen hit or stand he merely motioned with his forefinger for a card serena had to bit back an oath as she turned over a four twenty he passed a hand over the cards to indicate he was satisfied and so you should be she thought resentfully turning up a jack to break the next player just freak luck she told herself bumping the college student up to eighteen four or fourteen she announced as she turned over her card with her eyes on justins she pulled another six or sixteen she said as if to him alone she bit back another oath as she drew the three of clubs dealer stands on nineteen she stated knowing dale would throw her overboard if she took another hit pays twenty raking in all the chips but justins she then slid another twentyfivedollar marker over the baize she thought she caught another glimpse of laughter in his eyes as he dropped it into his slot but this time it didnt warm her smoke hung in the air too thick to be completely banished by the cooling system serena didnt need to glance at her watch to know shed been standing on her feet for nearly ten consecutive hours gradually the clatter from the slots began to lessen the first indication that the late shift was almost over the couple at the end of the table looking heavyeyed began discussing the stopover in puerto rico the next day between them they cashed in five dollars worth of chips before they left a quick glance around showed serena that all but three of the tables were empty there were only two players left at hers justin and a woman she identified as the mrs dewalter who had captured jacks and robs attention the redhead was paying a great deal more attention to justin than to her cards feeling spiteful serena decided the diamond on her hand was vulgar and nearly grinned when she broke her at twentythree i guess this isnt my game the redhead said with a sulky pout she shifted toward justin so that her considerable cleavage was in full view you seem to be tremendously lucky do you have a system running a finger down his sleeve she smiled serena wondered how she would like her nose pressed into the green baize amused at the obvious tactic justin allowed his eyes to roam up from the deep plunge of her bodice to her face no you must have some secret she murmured id love to hear it over a drink i never drink when i play he blew a stream of smoke past her shoulder one interferes with the other bets serena said just a tad too sharply i believe ive had enough cards this evening letting her thighs brush justins she rose then dropped a hundred dollars worth of chips into her purse serena had the small satisfaction of knowing shed started with four ill be in the lounge she told justin with a last lingering smile before she turned away better luck next time serena said before she could stop herself she turned back to find justin grinning at her cash me in certainly then hell go chasing after that redhead with the size c personality she thought furiously quickly she stacked and counted his chips seven hundred and fifty dollars she calculated and only became more angry dales busy ill take care of this myself watching her stride away justin tried to remember her father it wasnt easy serena came back with a stack of crisp bills and a white slip attached to a clipboard swiftly she counted the money out then passed it across the table you had a profitable evening after slipping the paper into the compartment under the table she reached for the cards justin took her wrist another hand he asked enjoying the quick jump of her pulse beneath his fingers youve already cashed in she pointed out and tried to tug away he tightened his grip a different bet between you and me im sorry its against the rules to have side games with the passengers now if youll excuse me i have to close up the table no money he watched her eyes narrow in fury and smiled a walk on the deck if i win he said smoothly not interested not afraid to go one on one are you serena the hand that attempted to remove his from her wrist paused you still have house advantage he said quietly if i win she began then carefully removed his hand youll keep away from me for the rest of the cruise he considered the question it was after all a much wiser course than the one he was pursuing taking a last puff on his cigar he crushed it out it wouldnt be the first time he left his fate to the cards deal he glanced at the two and five in front of him then at the ten serena had showing nodding for a hit he drew a queen his first thought was to stand but another glance at serena showed him she looked entirely too pleased with herself hed have bet every dollar in his pocket she had an eight or better in the hole keeping his eyes on hers he gestured for another card damn she tossed down the four of diamonds and glared at him i swear justin one day im going to beat you disgusted she turned over the jack she had in the hole no he rose slipping his hands into his pockets because youre trying to beat me not the cards ill wait for you outside dale glanced over to see his best blackjack dealer sticking her tongue out at the back of a passenger leaning back against the wall justin watched serena through the glass doors of the casino he thought he could almost see the combination of annoyance and frustration simmering around her he felt much the same way himself with a shrug he reminded himself that he had left it up to chance the bet could have been as easily lost as won idly he fingered a twentyfivedollar chip still in his pocket some might say hed had an unusual ran of luck then again he mused it might have been luckier to have lost that final bet if he continued to see serena his life wasnt going to be uncomplicated he might have been able to ignore the feeling of having daniel macgregor looking over his shoulder if he could have convinced himself that taking her to bed would get her out of his system but those were very long odds she was the first woman justin had ever known who had threatened to become a permanent part of his thoughts and what would she say he wondered if i told her her father had arranged the entire scenario from his fortress in hyannis port a smile curved the corners of his mouth shed skin the old man and hang him up to dry he concluded watching serena walk toward the doors justin decided to save that little bombshell for another day i suppose you have a right to smile serena said coolly as she let the door close behind her youre on quite a winning streak justin took her hand and in an unexpectedly courtly gesture kissed her fingers i intend for it to go on a lot longer before its broken youre really quite beautiful serena disconcerted she stared at him when im angry she finished struggling not to be charmed he turned her hand over and kissed her palm watching her really quite beautiful dont try to throw me off by being nice unconsciously she laced her fingers with his theres nothing nice about you no he agreed lets go out i imagine you could use some fresh air i agreed to take a walk together they began to climb the stairs thats all i agreed to ummhmm and the moons nearly full howd you do tonight the casino when he opened the door the wind rushed in delightfully warm and clean better than usual weve been operating at a loss since spring too many nickel slots cuts your profit margin he slipped an arm around her waist as serena looked up at him youd make more at the tables if some of your dealers were sharper its hard to stay sharp when you work up to sixty hours a week for peanuts she said ruefully anyway the turnovers constant most of them have six weeks training tops working up from cashier to croupier and a large percentage of them dont stay more than a couple of runs because they find out its not the floating vacation they thought it was without realizing she hooked her arm around his waist as he matched his stride to hers this is my favourite part what late at night when the ships quiet you cant hear anything but the sea if i had a porthole in my cabin id leave it open all night no porthole his hand began to move rhythmically up and down her back only passengers and officers have outside cabins she arched against his hand sighing as it soothed her tired muscles still i wouldnt trade this past year for anything its been like finding a second family your familys important to you he asked thinking of daniel of course because she found it an odd question serena tilted her head back to look at him as he angled his to meet her eyes her lips nearly skimmed his jaw dont do that she murmured what and the word soft and quiet whispered over her parted lips you know very well what dropping her arm she moved away from him toward the rail my family she said more steadily as she turned resting her arms across the wood has always been the most important part of my life the loyalty is sometimes uncomfortably fierce but necessary to all of us what about you she looked totally and unconsciously intriguing her soft curves hidden yet enhanced by the mannish tux her once tidy hairstyle being whipped apart by the wind her face was tilted back so that a splash of moonlight marbleized her skin my family struggling to pick up the thread of the conversation he moved to stand in front of her i have a sister diana shes ten years younger weve never been close your parents they died when i was sixteen diana went to live with an aunt i dont think ive seen her in practically twenty years serenas automatic wave of sympathy was immediately quelled thats disgraceful my aunts never approved of my profession he said dryly though she never questions the money for dianas support he mused moving his hands to the buttons of serenas jacket it was easier for diana if i didnt interfere what right does your aunt have to approve or disapprove serena demanded too inflamed to notice how deftly he was unbuttoning her jacket shes your sister my aunts a firm believer that gambling is the devils work shes a grandeau from the french part of the family serena shook her head at his logic so what are you blade his eyes locked on hers comanche his face was very close closer than she had realized though she felt the wind flutter through the thin fabric of her shirt she didnt yet understand what he had done serena found herself swallowing as his eyes held hers had there been a threat in those two words or had it been her imagination i should have known she managed i suppose i let your eyes throw me off from the drops of french and welsh blood that slipped through my father was almost pure and my mother descended from the line of a comanche brave and a french settler slowly his eyes never leaving hers he pulled loose the tie at her throat serena swallowed again but didnt move the story goes that one of my ancestors saw a woman with golden hair alone near a creek bed she had a basket of laundry and was singing as she washed he was a fierce warrior who had killed many of her people to protect his land when he saw her he wanted her justin released the buttons of her blouse one by one so he took her thats barbaric she managed over a suddenly dry throat he kidnapped her stole her away from her family a few days later she sunk a knife into his shoulder trying to escape justin continued quietly but when she saw his blood on her hands she didnt run she stayed and nursed him and gave him greeneyed sons and daughters perhaps it took more courage to stay than to use the knife justin smiled noting the tremor in her voice and the steadiness of her eyes he gave her a name that translates to prize of gold and never took another woman so its a tradition when one of my people sees a woman with golden hair who he wants he takes his mouth crushed down on hers whirling her quickly into passion with his hands he dove into her hair dislodging pins that danced in the wind before they fell into the waves below serena grabbed his shoulders almost afraid she would follow them plunging down into the dark fast water for surely this was how it felt to spiral down helpless from a high point toward the unknown her heart was racing even before his palm covered it a contact of hard flesh against soft man against woman on a moan she tightened her grip as if he were a life line in the sea that had gone suddenly from calm to tumultuous forgetting her smallness he took her into his hand abandoning both gentleness and reason no man had ever dared touch her that way perhaps that was why she allowed it he dared without request without practiced words of seduction it was a force consuming them both an impulse too old and too basic to be denied her body throbbed to be touched while her thoughts tangled it took over showing them both what she needed the wild ruthless kisses that raced down her throat only made her crave more the warm smoothing breeze from the sea became like small flames to heighten her fever she drew the moist air into her lungs and felt it turn to fire the hand at her breast kneaded tormented while the other slipped up her naked back to find some tiny point near her spine a press of his finger turned her legs to jelly she gasped as she arched against him while waves of unbelievable pleasure ran through her no serenas voice sounded thin and far off no dont but he pressed his lips to hers to devour her trembling protests her mouth was too hungry to heed the warning that had sounded in her brain it clung to his relishing the light flavour of salt spray whatever magic his fingers held it dominated her now she would give anything he asked so long as he never stopped touching her digging her hands into his hair she dragged him closer without noticing the fine mist of dampness that lay on it when her lips were free with his buried at her throat she could do no more than breathe his name the moistness on her face went unfelt all her senses were bound up in what his hands and lips could bring her then he was moving and she swayed as he took her away from the rail weak with desire serena leaned against him while he stroked her hair youre getting drenched justin murmured but couldnt prevent his lips from brushing over the damp crown of her head couldnt prevent himself from breathing in its fragrance lets go in what dazed serena opened her eyes and saw the fine curtain of rain its raining as the cool water revived her she shook her head she felt she had been in a dream to be wakened by a brisk slap in the face i pushing away from him she ran a hand through her hair i have to get some sleep he finished he had come too close justin discovered to taking her like a maniac where they had stood yes feeling raindrops on her bare flesh serena clutched her jacket together yes its late her eyes were still clouded and confused as she glanced around the deck its raining she repeated there was something about her abrupt vulnerability that made justin want her more than he had moments before and made it impossible to take her sticking his hands into his pockets he balled them briefly into fists damn daniel macgregor he thought fiercely the scotsman set a fine trap with prime bait if he took her now it would almost certainly destroy his relationship with a man hed come close to loving if he didnt he would only go on wanting her if he waited well that was a gamble good night serena she stood irresolute a moment wanting to race inside to sanity wanting to fall into his arms and madness taking a deep breath she clutched her jacket tighter good night serena went quickly knowing it took only a moment to change a mind chapter four because she thought it would be deserted serena chose the veranda deck aft anyone still on board would more likely opt for the larger pool area with its proximity to the lido bar and grill for sunning most of the passengers would be seeing the sights in san juan walking the brick streets in the historical section exploring forts snapping pictures of the surrounding mountains anyone who dribbled back during the day wasnt likely to disturb her on the quiet rear deck shed nearly overslept forgetting she was slated to help dale figure last nights take because it had been dawn before serena had finally drifted off shed managed only four hours sleep before the alarm had shocked her awake with her work finished for the morning shed come to lie in the midday sun and bake the tiredness from her body serena didnt want to think as she had during those long quiet hours between three am and dawn she knew she was too weary to dwell on what had happened the previous evening but even as she stretched out on a deck chair everything came back to play in her head what was it that happened to her every time justins lips touched hers whatever it was serena had sworn she wouldnt let it happen again then had been helpless to prevent it what was it about him that kept pulling her along dragging her closer to the edge of something fatal each time it became more difficult to remember to back away serena released the halter strings to the top of her bikini and settled back it might be smarter all in all she decided to give the whole business some serious thought rather than to dance around it if there was one common thread running through the macgregor clan it was that they were realists face a problem headon and mow it down that serena thought with a quick grin should have been their clan motto so for the problem of justin blade he was dangerously attractive dangerous serena concluded because the attraction had hit her in the first instant and hadnt abated in the least and it wasnt merely his looks she mused adjusting her sunglasses looks could easily be discounted it was that strength and the sex and the quietly domineering style all three challenged her to match him point for point it was very simply an irresistible combination to a woman who rarely chose the easy path did she like him serena gave an automatic snort then became thoughtful well she asked herself again did she the answer came with the memories of an easy afternoon in nassau that quick shared joke in the casino the natural way her hand fit with his perhaps she did like him serena admitted uncomfortably a little but she pushed her sunglasses more firmly on her nose and shut her eyes that wasnt the point the point was what was she going to do about him for the next five days she couldnt hide even if it had been physically possible while they were both on the same ship serenas pride would never have allowed it no she would have to deal with him and with herself the idea that she could spend some time with him learn to know him a bit better could no longer be classified as harmless if she were honest serena would have to admit that she had known from the outset that there was nothing harmless about justin blade that took her full circle back to the basic attraction and this she decided as she rolled over onto her stomach wasnt solving anything she had only a few more days aboard the celebration before she headed home for an extended visit unemployed wrinkling her nose she shifted until she was comfortable with the thick plastic strips of the lounge with the rest of her life to decide upon what to do about an encounter with an itinerant gambler should hardly take precedence in her thoughts it was only serena concluded because she was allowing it to now that she had admitted that she found justin both attractive and interesting that should be the end of it her course was really quite simple treat him as she would treat any other passenger polite and friendly well she amended dropping her sunglasses on the deck not too friendly and no more side bets serena added firmly before she shut her eyes the mans luck was phenomenal and the sun was much too warm the deck much too quiet to think about complications sighing she pillowed her head on her hands and slept warm and soothing these sensations drifted through her causing serena to sigh again hazy thoughts of floating naked on a raft while the sun stroked her skin brought a small sound of pleasure to her lips she could have floated endlessly without destination she felt a freedom no an abandonment she was alone in a blue sea or perhaps in a dense green jungle a secret solitary place where there were no restrictions there the sun caressed her body like lovers hands she could feel its stroking bringing hot sleepy pleasure languid fingers of sunlight lazily arousing delicately seducing the brush of a butterfly against her ear made her smile serena lay still not wanting to disturb it soft as dew it fluttered to her cheek resting a moment as though it had found a pungent blossom with a final sweep of wings it whispered her name at the corner of her mouth how strange she thought with a tiny moan of pleasure for a butterfly to know her name shifting her shoulders toward the gentle caress on her back serena commanded her eyes to open wanting to see the colours of those soft wings she saw only the cool depthless green of justins eyes for a moment serena stared into them too content to be confused i thought you were a butterfly she murmured as she closed her eyes again did you smiling justin touched his lips to the corner of hers a second time mmmhmm it came out as a long lazy sigh how did you get here where enjoying her gentle stretching beneath his palm he continued to stroke her back wherever we are serena murmured did you float on a raft no he knew from the rhythm of her breathing by that brief look into her dark misty eyes that she was already aroused disoriented enough to be completely pliant her absolute vulnerability touched off twin urges to take and to protect as each one fought for supremacy justin brushed a kiss over her bare shoulder youve been dreaming oh serena didnt see why it mattered as long as those wonderful warm caresses continued it feels good yes justin traced a fingertip down her spine it does the touch brought a quick shudder a more concentrated arousal serenas eyes flew open justin yes abruptly awake and throbbing serena lifted herself up on her elbows what are you doing here briefly his eyes passed over the small swatch of material that tenuously clung to her breasts you already asked me that with your skin you shouldnt lie in the sun unprotected he slid his hand down her back spreading the cream hed applied when his fingers pressed near the base of her spine she caught her breath stop it she demanded furious that her voice was shaky youre very sensitive he murmured the desire in her eyes had flared quickly darkening and widening even as she struggled against it it seems a pity were never at the appropriate spot at the appropriate time justin serena shifted away from his hand barely remembering to hold the top of her bikini in place i really wish youd let me get some rest as she sat up she meticulously tied her halter strings behind her neck i had to get up early this morning and the casino opens as soon as we leave port tonight stretching out again she dismissed him i want a nap i want to talk to you he shifted lightly on the balls of his feet where he had crouched beside her then rose well i dont she broke off as her gaze travelled up long muscular legs to narrow hips encased in brief black trunks to a hard lean torso it was a body that hinted at strength and sinew and speed quickly serena averted her gaze reaching behind her to adjust the back of the deck chair i dont want to talk to you she finished popping her sunglasses back on her nose why dont you go visit san juan like everyone else i have a proposition i bet you do without waiting for an invitation justin nudged her legs over and sat on the end of the chair business serena slid her legs farther away so that her skin wouldnt rub against his and distract her im not interested in your business go get your own chair isnt there a rule about crew being rude to passengers report me she invited him its my last week on the job thats what i want to talk to you about justin ran a lotionslick palm along her thigh justin good he smiled at her furious face i have your attention youre going to have a fractured nose if you dont leave me alone she told him exasperated do you always have such a difficult time concentrating on a business discussion justin asked mildly not a legitimate one then we shouldnt have any problem flopping back on the chair serena eyed him from behind the tinted glasses she spotted the jagged white scar along his ribs that looks as if it was nasty she said with a cool smile a present from a jealous husband a bigot with a knife his answer was as cool as her question devoid of emotion a pain shot into her sharp and unexpected it caught with a gasp in her throat as she could almost see the blade slicing into flesh that was a stupid thing to say im sorry she glanced at the scar again nearly sick from her own careless words it mustve been serious justin thought of the drugged two weeks in the hospital ward then shrugged it was a long time ago what happened she couldnt prevent herself from asking perhaps because some intimate part of her shared the pain without knowing the cause justin studied her for a moment he didnt think about the incident anymore perhaps he hadnt given it more than a cursory thought in fifteen years still it was like the scar a part of him it might be better if she knew taking a towel from the deck he wiped his hands i was in a bar in eastern nevada one of the regulars didnt care to breathe the same air as an indian i had a beer to finish so i suggested he breathe somewhere else a very cold mirthless smile touched his mouth i was young enough to find some enjoyment in the prospect of a brawl at eighteen a fistfight relieves a lot of frustrations but you didnt get that scar from a fistfight she murmured justin lifted a brow in acknowledgement most things tend to get out of hand when liquors involved he was drunk and feeling mean almost absently he ran a finger down the line of the scar in a habitual gesture he thought hed conquered years before it started predictably enough words shoves fists then he had a knife he was probably too drunk to realize what he was doing but he had it into me oh god automatically serena reached out to take his hand thats horrible why didnt someone call the police it flashed through his mind that despite the wealth the extensive education and travelling shed lived a sheltered life perhaps because of it things arent always done that way he said simply but he stabbed you she said with a mixture of logic and revulsion he must have been arrested no justins gaze remained as calm and steady as his voice i killed him at the fiat statement serenas hand went limp in his justin could see her eyes grow wide and shocked behind the tinted glasses he felt her instant automatic withdrawal then just as quickly her fingers tightened on his again selfdefence she said with only a trace of a tremor in her voice he said nothing all those years ago he had needed that kind of simple unquestioning faith during the pain of his hospital days the cold solitary fear in his cell awaiting trial thered been no one then to believe in him no one to give him back any portion of the hope and trust he had lost during those endless empty days as she cupped his hand between both of hers something moved inside him and crept out of a longclosed lock i grabbed for the knife justin said at length we fell the next thing i knew i was waking up in the hospital charged with seconddegree murder but it was his knife there was quick outrage in her voice and no question he attacked you it took a while for that to come out justin could remember every hour every minute of the waiting the smell of the cell the faces in the courtroom the fear and fury when it did i was acquitted with how many other scars serena wondered no one wanted to testify for you she said instinctively the others in the bar that night i wasnt one of them he said flatly but they stuck to the truth when they were under oath it must have been a frightening experience for a boy to go through when justin only lifted a brow serena tried to find a smile my father would say that a mans not a man until hes thirty or maybe its forty he isnt always consistent how well he knew justin thought he was tempted to tell her then and there about his relationship with daniel but made himself stick with his original plan justin blade was consistent i told you about this because if you accept my offer youd probably hear snatches of it anyway and id rather you had it from me all at once he saw that he had her curiosity now which was better than her attention what kind of offer she asked warily a job a job serena repeated then laughed what do you want to do set up a floating blackjack game with me as dealer i had something a bit more stationary in mind justin murmured as his eyes drifted down just how secure are those skinny little strings secure enough she barely resisted the urge to tug at them why dont you tell me exactly what you have in mind justin straight all right abruptly the humour left his eyes they were cool again and level on hers ive watched you work youre very good not just with the cards but with people youre a quick judge of the players and your table is nearly always full while some of the others thin out regularly in addition to that you know how to handle a player when hes annoyed with the cards or had a bit too much to drink all in all he added in the same impersonal tone youve got a lot of style not certain what he was leading up to and not wanting to be too pleased by his words serena moved her shoulders carelessly so so ive a use for someone with your talents his expression didnt change when her eyes narrowed justin merely folded his legs under him and watched her looking serena thought a bit too much like his infamous kidnapping ancestor must have looked pushing her glasses on top of her head serena stared straight back at him what sort of use she asked coolly managing my casino in atlantic city he had the satisfaction of seeing incredulity cover her face you own a casino in atlantic city without seeming to move at all justin rested his hands lightly on his knees yes serena frowned at him through narrowed eyes he thought amused that her trust didnt come as easily this time then slowly she let out a breath comanche serena murmured theres one in vegas too and in tahoe i think leaning back she closed her eyes so the itinerant gambler turned out to be a very wealthy very successful businessman i should have known even more amused by her reaction justin relaxed hed first thought of offering her a job during the morning in nassau then it had been part whim part business studying her strong elegant face he knew it was already more than that more than it should be that was something he would deal with after hed arranged things i fired my manager just before i left justin went on not waiting for serena to open her eyes again a bit of trouble with the take she opened them now her brows arching he cheated you tried justin corrected her mildly no one cheats me no serena agreed im sure they dont she drew her knees up so that they would no longer be touching then wrapped her arms around them why do you want me to work for you justin had the uncomfortable feeling she knew it was more than hed said even though he himself wasnt certain of all the reasons he was only sure that he wanted her in his world where he could see and touch her ive told you he said simply too cautious to stroke her skin again if you have three successful hotels five he corrected her five she gave him a slight nod then i cant imagine you as a man who runs his business on impulse or anything else on impulse she added silently you must know that managing a casino like yours is a long way from dealing cards on a cruise liner you probably have twice the tables we do and a take that would make our little profit look like bubblegum money justin allowed himself a smile it was true enough of course if you dont think you can handle it i didnt say i couldnt handle it she retorted then scowled at him youre very clever arent you think about it he suggested hooking his finger around one of hers you said yourself you have no definite plans after this cruise no definite plans she mused just a vague notion about opening her own place she still wanted her own place but wouldnt it be logical to manage someone elses until she learned a bit more ill think about it serena said slowly hardly noticing that justins thumb was moving lightly up and down the length of her finger good with his free hand he reached up idly plucking a pin from her hair we can have dinner in san juan and discuss the practicalities letting the first pin drop justin drew out another will you stop that annoyed serena grabbed his wrist every time i see you youre tossing my pins away i wont have one left by the end of the cruise i like it down he ran his fingers through the loosely secured bun and scattered the rest of the pins i like to see it fall down shoving his hand away serena scrambled up when he used that tone a smart woman kept her distance im not having dinner with you in san juan or anywhere else she snatched up the dashiki shed worn over her suit and i believe ive thought long enough about your proposition afraid unfolding his legs justin rose in a smooth catlike movement no she met his eyes calmly so that he would understand she spoke the truth good pleased with the strong stubborn look he cupped his hands around the base of her neck fear was too ordinary and too easily defeated but take a few days to think this over the business offer is exactly that it has nothing to do with you and me being lovers the firm kneading of his fingers at the back of her neck had nearly seduced her into relaxing his words had her eyes flashing were not lovers we will be he said holding her still with one hand as he stepped closer soon were both people who take what we want serena we want each other why dont you put your ego down for a while justin it must be getting heavy when his hand went to her lotioned back to press her closer she remained stiff unwilling to struggle unwilling to lose gamblers believe in fate though her back was straight and unyielding he felt the soft give of breasts against his chest only a narrow band of material separated flesh from flesh youre as much a gambler as i am serena macgregor lowering his head he nibbled along her jawline weve both got to play with the hand we were dealt how long could she resist that honeyed tone and clever mouth already serena could feel the hammer of her heart against her ribs and the heavy fluid weakness in her limbs if she resisted she would lose perhaps her brain began to cloud and frantically she forced the silken mists away perhaps this time she would play the game his way and earn a draw fighting her own need to surrender she took a dangerous gamble slowly softly she ran her hands up his naked back letting her fingernails lightly rake his skin when his mouth pressed against her throat her knees nearly buckled but she bit down hard on the inside of her lip pain would help her keep control she rubbed against him sinuously while her fingers crept up to trace patterns on the base of his neck his heartbeat began to thud racing with hers his mouth grew hungry but she turned so that his lips fell anywhere but on hers if he kissed her locked her in one of those deep mindless feasts of mouth on mouth shed be lost his breath raged unsteadily over her ear wrenching a moan from her serena squeezed her eyes tightly straggling not to feel all the things he could so effortlessly make her feel she pressed her lips to his throat telling herself that it wasnt for the taste of him but only the next step in the game she wouldnt be weakened by the dark male flavour by the feel of muscle taut and strong under her hands this time this time she promised herself shed bring him to his knees she heard him groan felt the light quiver run through him as he crushed her against him too astonished by the newly discovered power to be pleased with it serena merely clung he whispered something low in a primitive tongue she didnt understand before he buried his face in her hair her heart urged her to stay as she was warmed flesh to warmed flesh could it feel so right if she didnt belong there if her body had not been fashioned for this could they fit together so unerringly if her mouth had not been made for his would it heat at even the thought of a kiss no serena caught herself before the weakness could spread too far she wouldnt let herself be ruled by a need or by a man she pushed firmly away knowing she was free only because shed caught him off guard slowly praying her legs would hold her she bent down to retrieve the dashiki which had fallen to the deck without a word serena slipped it over her head it gave her a moment just a moment to brace herself before she looked at him she saw desire a reckless desire that had her heart thudding painfully in his eyes and she saw the wariness it strengthened her to know hed been no more prepared for the attack on the senses than she had been because of it she had the edge if and when i decide i want to make love with you youll know she said it calmly then turned and walked away without a backward glance her knees were shaking justin watched her oh he could drag her back he thought as his hand curled into a fist he could drag her to his cabin and have her within a matter of moments he could say the hell with the game plan and assuage this gnawing hunger that seemed to be eating him from the inside out if once just once he was truly alone with her with care justin unclenched his hand it never paid to let emotions rule your moves that was something hed learned too many years ago to forget now bending he picked up the bottle of lotion serena had left beside her chair shed been intrigued with his offer he mused absently tightening the cap and while she might try to shrug it off the idea had been planted after a year of following orders the notion of giving them would appeal to her having come fresh from a victory she would consider herself well able to handle him on the personal front he counted on there being enough macgregor in her to make a challenge irresistible a slow cool smile touched his mouth justin was just as susceptible to a challenge as serena hed made his bid he decided for the moment hed let it stand serenas room was completely dark when the phone beside her bunk shrilled blindly she groped about fumbling for the button of the alarm when this did nothing to stop the ringing she pushed at it in annoyance then knocked the receiver from the phone it conked her smartly against the temple ouch damn it good morning little girl hazy with sleep and rubbing her head she cradled the receiver against her ear dad hows life on the high seas he asked in a booming cheerful voice that made her wince i um running her tongue over her teeth serena struggled to wake up come on girl speak up dad its she pushed at her alarm again until she could read the luminous dial its barely six am a good sailors up with the dawn he told her uhhuh good night dad your mother wants to know when youll be home even half asleep serena grinned anna macgregor had never been a mother hen but daniel well be in miami saturday afternoon i should be home by sunday are you going to have a brass band hah one highland chief with a bagpipe you were always the sassy one rena he tried to sound stern and ended up sounding proud your mother wants to know if theyre feeding you proper she swallowed a giggle we get a whole loaf of barley bread a week and salt pork on sundays how is mom fine shes already gone to the hospital to cut somebody open alan and caine daniel gave a snort who sees them he demanded it breaks your mothers heart that her childrenve forgotten their parents not one grandchild to bounce on her knee inconsiderate of us serena agreed dryly now if alan had married that pretty judson girl she walked like a duck serena reminded him bluntly alanll pick his own wife when hes ready hah daniel said again got his nose buried down in dc caines still sowing oats he shouldve been done with and you float around on some boat ship your poor mother will never live to hold her first grandchild with a heavy sigh he lit one of the fat cigars anna hadnt managed to confiscate did you wake me up at six am to lecture me about the procreation of the macgregor line thats nothing to curl your lip at little girl the clan im not curling my lip sheassured him wanting to avoid a long passionate diatribe and i plan to stay home awhile so you can start bullying me after sunday now is that any way to talk he demanded offended why ive never so much as raised my hand to you youre the best father ive ever had she said soothingly ill buy you a case of scotch in st thomas well now pleased with the idea he softened then remembered another promised case of scotch and his main purpose for the predawn call met any interesting people on the cruise rena mmm i could write a book im really going to miss the rest of the crew what about passengers he persisted daniel puffed on his cigar and tried his hand at smoke rings get any real gamblers now and again her thoughts drifted to justin just as daniels did i suppose youve had your hands full with the men she gave a noncommittal grunt and shifted to her back one man anyway she mused course theres nothing wrong with a bit of romance now and then he added in a jovial voice providing the mans got good blood and some starch a true gambler has to have a sharp brain would you feel better if i told you i was planning to run off with one which one he demanded narrowing his eyes no one serena returned firmly now im going back to sleep be sure to get rid of all that cigar ash before mom gets home daniel scowled at the phone then at the butt in his hands ill see you and mom sunday and by the way i love you you old pirate eat a decent breakfast he ordered before he hung up thoughtfully daniel leaned back in his massive chair rena had always been a tough egg to crack he mused as for justin well if justin blade hadnt made it his business to spend a tropical evening or two in her company then he wasnt the man daniel thought he was he tapped out his cigar reminding himself to dispose of the evidence before anna came home damned if he was wrong about justin blade daniel macgregor knew the make of a man he gave himself a moments pleasure speculating about a blackhaired violeteyed grandchild a boy first he decided though he wouldnt carry the macgregor name and that was a pity hed carry macgregor blood theyd name him after his grandfather in a fine mood daniel picked up the phone thinking he might as well badger his other children while he was at it chapter five as much as she told herself it wasnt any of her business serena couldnt help wondering what justin was up to for two days she hadnt had a glimpse of him during that time he hadnt set foot inside the casino nor had he been on the port side of the promenade deck indulging in one of the private games at least not when she just happened to stroll out there during her break what serena demanded of herself as she prepared for her last free day of the cruise was he doing a gambler was supposed to gamble wasnt he he wasnt the kind to settle for a bingo game in the lounge hes doing it on purpose she decided as she buttoned up her scarlet romper hes trying to get to me she wouldnt have been the least surprised if while she had been working and wondering he had spent his time lazing in the sun somewhere knowing it infuriating hed probably had that cozy little drink with mrs dewalter too she concluded and grabbed her brush taking it through her hair in hard quick strokes serena scowled at herself in the small mirror so what she said aloud if hes nipping around her ankles hes not nipping around mine the last thing shed wanted on her final days on the ship was a constant battle verbal or otherwise so it was just as well that hed found something else to keep him occupied that saved her the trouble of ignoring him he stirred her up when he was around he stirred her up when he wasnt around too she thought and tossed the brush back on the dresser where was the justice i wont think about it serena decided flopping down on the floor to slip on her sandals im going to do some snorkelling buy some trinkets a case of scotch and she added grimly im going to enjoy myself i wont give him another thought its deliberate she thought slapping a sandal against her palm he dangled that business about managing his casino in front of my nose then disappeared he knew it would drive me crazy she decided with fresh frustration well two can play serena reminded herself as she wiggled her foot into the sandal ill stay out of his way for the next couple of days if i have to claim seasickness and lock myself in my cabin and that she determined would be a lesson to him serena continued to frown when the knock sounded on her door its open she called shortly the last person shed expected to see in her doorway was justin the last thing shed expected to feel was pleasure oh my god she realized ive missed him he saw the quick smile light in her eyes before she successfully turned it into a glare morning passengers arent permitted on this deck she told him in a tone that was both cool and prim oh he stepped inside shutting the door behind him ignoring her hiss of annoyance justin glanced around the tiny cabin it should have been drab and colourless with its plain bunk and white walls but shed given it an odd sort of style with only a few touches a flashy painting of sailboats a bottlegreen freeform bowl filled with crushed shells a boldly striped needlepoint pillow that reminded him of anna the pantry in hyannis port he mused was larger no wasted space he ventured letting his eyes roam back to her its my space serena reminded him and its strictly against the rules for you to be in here would you go away before you get me fired youve already quit easing between her and the bunk justin took a closer look at the painting this is very good the harbor here in st thomas yes serena stayed seated deliberately knowing it was next to impossible for two people to stand in the cabin without touching im sorry i cant entertain you justin but im just on my way out with an absent sound of agreement he sat on the bunk sturdy he commented nudging a reluctant smile from her it was hard as a rock its great for the back they sat eyeing each other for a moment as she fought off the simple pleasure of having him with her i thought i was rid of you did you lifting the flimsy teddy shed slept in justin ran the lace through his fingers without any effort he could picture her in it picture the thin creamy material sliding over her skin as he slipped it off of her put that down she leaned over to snatch it out of his hands going across his body to do so so you have a taste for silk and lace he stated letting the lingerie slip back to the bed before serena could grab it ive always admired women who wear things like this then sleep alone justin looked down at her as serena knelt on the floor frustrated it shows a certain independence of spirit her brows furrowed is that a compliment i thought so with a smile he leaned forward to wrap the ends of her hair around his fingers why did you think you were rid of me i wish you wouldnt be nice justin it throws me off sitting back on her haunches serena sighed you havent been in the casino there are other entertainments on board im sure her voice chilled like explaining your system to mrs dewalter mrs who her feathers ruffled serena got up and began to search for her tote bag the divorced redhead with the hens egg oh amused and baffled justin watched her rummage under the bunk looking for something yes as he watched serena squirmed under the bunk on her stomach would you like some help no damn it she swore as she rapped the back of her head on the bottom of the bunk when she wiggled back out justin was sitting on the floor beside her without speaking he smiled and brushed her mussed hair away from her face justin serena turned away and dumped the contents of the bag on the bunk i really hate to say this accustomed to her sharp tongue he shrugged go ahead say it anyway i missed you looking back serena saw surprise on his face for the second time i told you i hated to say it when she started to rise he took her arm and held her still three words three words that brought on a torrent of conflicting emotions that hed never experienced hed been prepared for her annoyance her coolness her fury but not for those three simple words serena he laid his hand on her cheek in a rare gesture of complete gentleness thats a dangerous thing to tell me when were alone she touched her hand to his briefly then carefully drew it away from her skin i didnt intend to tell you at all i dont think i realized it myself until you walked in here her sigh was both puzzled and wistful i just dont understand it i wonder why it is we both feel we need to he said half to himself abruptly she jumped up and began dropping what she thought shed need into the tote bag im going to the beach for snorkelling and sightseeing serena told him would you like to come with me she didnt hear him move he didnt make a sound but she knew hed risen to stand behind her for the first time in a year serena felt the light panic of claustrophobia justin placed his hands on her shoulders and turned her to face him those eyes he thought that impossibly rich colour it seemed he had only to look into them for the need to spread to his a truce he asked she saw with relief that he wasnt going to press the advantage shed given him what fun would that be serena retorted you can come with me if you want but no truce those seem like reasonable terms he mused when he slipped his hands around her waist serena stuck the tote bag between them justin glanced at it then at her thats hardly an obstacle the offer was for sightseeing she reminded him take it or leave it well go with that with a hesitation so slight it went unnoticed justin dropped his hands for now accepting this serena turned and opened the door ever been on a glassbottom boat no youre going to love it she promised and reached for his hand her skin was wet and warm and glistening in the sunlight two tiny scraps of material clung to the curves of her breasts and hips as she stretched out her legs on the blanket serena gave a contented sigh i like to think of the pirates she looked out over the magnificent blue water and could almost see the jolly roger fluttering in the breeze high green mountains rose around them as if floating on the sea itself three hundred years ago shaking back her wet hair she smiled over at justin hardly any time at all really when you think of how long these islands have been here a few droplets of water glistened on his dark skin dont you think blackboard might be a bit upset if he saw all this he gestured to indicate the people dotting the white sand beach and splashing in the turquoise water laughter rose with the scent of suntan lotion unlike the rest of us i dont think hed consider these beaches unspoiled she laughed both refreshed and exhilarated from their hour of snorkelling hed find another place pirates have a knack for it you sound as though you admire them its easy to romanticize after a couple of centuries serena leaned back on her elbows enjoying the sensation of drying in the sun and i suppose ive always admired people who lived by their own rules at any price oh youre going to be practical serena tilted her face toward the sun the sky was as blue as the water and cloudless its too beautiful here to be practical theres as much barbarism and cruelty today as there was three hundred years ago and not nearly as much adventure id love a ride in h g wellss time machine intrigued justin picked up the comb she had discarded and began to run it through her hair where would you go arthurs britain platos greece caesars rome she sighed finding the sensation of justin drawing the comb through her hair both sensual and soothing hundreds of other places id have to meet rob roy in scotland or my father would never forgive me id like to have seen the west before the settlers discovered it but then i suppose idve been on the first wagon to oregon laughing she tilted her head back farther so that she had upsidedown view of his face it wouldve been worth the risk of being scalped by your ancestors justin weighed her hair in one hand it would have been quite a prize id just as soon have kept it serena admitted wryly what about you she asked wouldnt you like to go back a couple of centuries and play red dog in a tombstone saloon they didnt welcome comanches reaching back she brushed damp hair from his forehead youre being practical again his eyes held hers a moment i would have been in the war party attacking your wagon train yes she looked out to sea again it was foolish to forget who and what he was even for a moment he was different it only added to the attraction i suppose you would have we would have been forging new frontiers you would have been defending what was already yours the lines get misted and you wonder if either side was wrong in the beginning do you ever feel cheated she wondered aloud your birthright justin drew the comb slowly through her hair as it dried he could see all the subtle shade variations that merged together for the rich gold i prefer making what i own rather than thinking of inheritances she nodded because the words so exactly expressed her own feelings the macgregors were persecuted in scotland forced to give up their name their plaid and their land if id been there i would have fought now its just a fascinating story she gave a low laugh as her mood shifted one my father will tell again and again at the least provocation a toddler racing across the sand to escape her mother landed like a plump ball in serenas lap giggling she tossed her arms around serenas neck and clung as if they were in the conspiracy together well hello with a laugh serena returned the hug then she tilted the childs head back enough to see funfilled brown eyes making a break for it are you the girl grabbed a handful of serenas hair pretty what a bright child she commented looking over her shoulder at justin to her surprise he hoisted the child onto his own lap and touched a finger to her button nose youre pretty too with another peal of giggles she pressed a wet kiss to his cheek before serena had gotten over her surprise at the ease with which he accepted the damp greeting a woman in a trim black maillot rushed to the trio breathlessly rosie the frazzled mother held a plastic pail and shovel while her cheeks grew pink oh im so sorry pretty rosie claimed again giving justin another kiss this time serena burst into giggles rosie exasperated the mother ran a hand through her hair i really am sorry she repeated she heads everywhere at a dead ran no one safe when you run theres more time to play once youre there isnt there rosie serena stroked the warm brown hair as she smiled her reassurance at the mother she must keep you busy exhausted the woman admitted but really i dont apologize gently justin brushed the sand from the childs hand shes beautiful obviously pleased the mother relaxed then held out her hand to her daughter thank you do you have children it took serena a moment to realize they were being addressed as a couple before she could recover justin was already answering not yet i dont suppose this ones for sale hefting rosie on her hip the young woman beamed down at him no though there are times im tempted to rent her out shes a handful thanks again not everyone appreciates being attacked by a twoyearold tornado say goodbye rosie bye rosie waved a chubby hand over her mothers shoulder before she made a valiant effort to scramble down again serena could hear high delighted giggles as the mother and daughter moved across the beach really justin serena brushed away the sand rosie had brought with her why did you tell that woman we didnt have any children yet we dont you know very well what i mean she began now whos being practical before serena could retort he wrapped his arms around her waist and pressed his lips to her shoulder instead of resisting she leaned back against him a moment enjoying the closeness she was sweet most children are he pressed a kiss to her other shoulder theyve no pretensions no prejudices and very little fear soon her mother will teach her not to talk to strangers necessary but rather sad serena drew away so that she could turn around and look at him fully i wouldnt have believed youd give children a moments thought justin started to tell her that the moment with the child that they had shared had awakened urges in him a need for family hed almost forgotten he had a woman beside him a child reaching up for a kiss then he brushed the thought away even as serena brushed away sand it was best to tread lightly on ground you didnt know he thought i started out that way myself he said at length she noticed his hesitation but found her own emotions strangely muddled are you sure smiling she rested her hands on his shoulders reasonably im going to tell you something serena said solemnly leaning a bit closer yes i dont think youre pretty children have a clearer outlook than adults you dont even have a pretty nature she insisted but found the urge to press her lips to his too difficult to resist neither do you running his hands up her back justin deepened the kiss his lids had lowered as hers had but neither closed she felt something creep out of her while her bones were softening something small and vital that was hers one moment and his the next serena yielded to him in a kiss that held more promise than passion i never intend to have one she murmured thank god his hand tightened in her hair suddenly briefly though his mouth remained gentle on hers serena drew away something had changed there was no clear explanation why no idea what but something had changed there was a need to put things back on a solid footing until she had the time to decipher it her body felt soft and weak and alien wed better go she managed i have some things to pick up in town before im due back at the ship time and tide wait for no man he mused thats about it rising she shook loose sand from her romper before she slipped it over her suit you wont always have that excuse justin stood beside her halting the hands that worked the buttons no serena agreed then began to fasten the romper again but i have it now it took some artful driving through the traffic of charlotte amalie then a dash of luck to find an empty parking place the streets were jammed with cabs people and small openair busses with gaily patterned roofs during this time both justin and serena were silent occupied with their separate thoughts what had happened she wondered during that brief almost friendly kiss on the beach why had it left her feeling like jelly inside apprehensive and somehow delighted perhaps it had something to do with how touched shed been to see justin with the little girl it was difficult to imagine a man like him a gambler with those parallel streaks of coolness and ruthlessness being a sucker for a twentypound brunette with sticky salty hands she simply hadnt given him credit for that quality of sweetness it could also be the fact that where shed once thought she might like him serena now knew she did but cautiously she added as if to reassure herself it would never be wise to completely drop caution in dealings with justin and now that she could admit she liked him and enjoyed his company the cruise was almost over during what was left of it serena would be kept so busy by her shifts and duties in the casino that she wouldnt have a leisurely hour to spend with him much less a leisurely day for the rest of the trip they would be at sea with the casino open sixteen hours a day of course there was still the option of accepting his job offer frowning slightly serena glanced out the window to see a table on the sidewalk near gucci covered with hats made from palm leaves for the past two days she had deliberately blocked the proposition out of her head first from temper then from the sensible notion that it would be better to consider it after there was some distance between them atlantic city would be an adventure working with justin would be a risk perhaps one was the same as the other why did the sudden softening of her attitude worry him justin wondered that had after all been one of his goals he wanted her just as he had wanted her the first moment he had seen her yet the days of contact of arguments laughter and passion had added some new aspect to what should have remained a basic need it wasnt as simple as it had once been to attribute his conflicting emotions to the machinations of her father in truth he hadnt thought of her as daniel macgregors daughter in days as he pulled into an empty space justin decided it might be wise to think of her that way again at least for the moment more key chains that play fur elise he asked as he switched off the ignition despite what he had just told himself justin drew her closer to taste her lips again i never repeat myself she retorted but she didnt move away just this once he murmured make an exception on a low laugh she increased the pressure until they both forgot they were in a parked car in the middle of a crowded city tonight she thought as her fingers ran up his cheek on their journey to his hair the time had come to stop pretending and take what she wanted serena it was half sigh half moan as he drew her away i know for a moment she rested her head against his shoulder we seem destined to find ourselves in public places she took a quick audible breath and scooted out of the car since we spent so long at the beach i wont have time for anything but the most disciplined shopping justin walked around to her to take her hand serena smiled then with a quick glance up and down the narrow crowded street she pointed i should be able to pick up a few souvenirs and the liquor i need in there before she could reach her destination the window display at cartiers stopped her her long sigh was part appreciation and part desire why is it an intelligent woman can find herself coveting a bunch of shiny rocks she wondered aloud its natural isnt it justin moved to stand beside her letting his gaze roam over the sparkle of diamonds the gleam of emeralds most women are attracted to diamonds most men too pressurized carbon she mused then sighed again hunks of rock dug out of caves centuries ago we used them as amulets to ward off evil spirits or bring good luck the phoenicians travelled to the baltic countries of europe for amber wars have been fought over them countries exploited and somehow that makes them more attractive dont you ever indulge yourself serena turned away from the window and smiled at him no it gives me something to look forward to ive promised myself that the next time i travel itll be strictly for relaxation then im going on a binge that may put a serious hole in my bank account for now she gestured toward the next shop i need to pick up some more traditional sort of souvenirs for a few cousins and a case of chivas regal justin walked into the store with her where serena immediately became caught up in a flurry of picking choosing and buying she generally disliked shopping but once committed did so with a vengeance when justin wandered off she paid little attention engrossed as she was in a selection of embroidered table linen with the souvenirs purchased and wrapped serena went to the counter where bottles of liquor liqueurs and wines were displayed in profusion a quick glance at her watch showed her she had nearly two hours before she was due on board a case of chivas twelve year two at justins voice serena turned her head oh i thought id lost you did you find what you wanted and more she admitted with a grimace im going to hate myself when it comes time to pack the clerk slid the two boxes of scotch onto the counter id like mine delivered to the celebration drawing out her credit card she waited for the clerk to fill out the form and mine justin added counting out bills serena pondered his case of scotch while he relayed the necessary information strange she mused she hadnt thought him the kind of drinker to buy scotch by the case he never drank when he gambled it had been one of the first things shed noticed throughout the cruise shed seen him with a drink in his hand only once during the picnic at nassau she decided perhaps he bought it in lieu of souvenirs but it seemed odd hed buy so much of one brand after signing her name to the credit slip serena stuffed the receipt into her bag i suppose thats it slipping her hand into his she walked toward the exit odd that we both bought the same brand of scotch not when you consider we bought it for the same person he returned mildly with a puzzled smile serena looked up at him the same person your father doesnt drink any other brand how do you confused she shook her head why would you buy my father a case of scotch he asked me to he guided her by a clutch of teenagers asked you to hampered by another crowd of shoppers serena had to wait until shed ploughed her way through what do you mean he asked you to ive never known daniel to do anything without a catch justin took her arm to guide her across the street as she was looking at him and not the cars a case of scotch seemed reasonable at the time daniel serena thought noting the easy use of her fathers name for a moment her mind concentrated on that small point until unanswered and uncomfortable questions began to leak through disregarding the flow of pedestrian traffic she stopped dead in the centre of the sidewalk justin youd better tell me exactly what youre talking about im talking about buying your father a case of scotch for his thoughtfulness in booking my passage on the celebration youve got something mixed up my father isnt a travel agent he laughed just as uproariously as he had the day hed learned her last name no daniels many things but hes not a travel agent why dont we go down here and sit i dont want to sit she gave her arm a jerk as he led her to one of the cool courtyards i want to know why the hell my father would have anything to do with arranging your vacation i think he had my life in mind actually finding an empty table justin gave her a nudge into a chair and yours he added as he sat she could smell the freshly made delicacies from the bakery across from them hear the chatter from the little bookstore next door because she suddenly wanted to punch something serena folded her hands on the table what the hell are you talking about i met your father about ten years ago calmly justin drew out a cigar and lit it serena was reacting precisely the way he had expected the predictability eased the tension hed been fighting since that moment on the beach when hed felt something slipping away from him i came to hyannis port with a business proposition justin began we played some poker and have been doing business off and on ever since youve quite an interesting family serena made no comment but her fingers clenched tighter ive grown quite fond of them over the years he continued blandly you always seemed to be in school when i visited but i heard quite a bit about rena alan admires your mind caine your right cross though her eyes smouldered justin couldnt prevent a small smile from curving his lips your father nearly erected a monument when you graduated from smith two years ahead of schedule serena repressed the urge to swear repressed the urge to scream the man had been privy to her life for a decade without her knowledge or consent youve known she began in a low furious voice youve known who i am all this time and youve said nothing playing games when you only had to explain wait a minute as she started to rise he took her arm in a forceful grip i didnt know the blackjack dealer named serena was daniels rena macgregor the paragon ive heard about for the last ten years she flushed both in fury and embarrassment most of her life she had found her fathers bragging as amusing as it was endearing now it served as a cold hard slap in the face i dont know what your game is daniels game justin interrupted again it wasnt until that day on the beach when you were shouting at me about macgregors not being pushed around that i realized who you were and why daniel had been so persuasive about my taking this trip because she could remember the expression of utter shock on his face serena relaxed fractionally he sent you the tickets and didnt mention the fact that i worked on the celebration what do you think justin countered tapping his cigar in a plastic ashtray as he watched her when i found out your full name i realized id been manoeuvred by an expert he grinned amused all over again ill admit it gave me a moment or two of discomfort discomfort serena repeated unamused her brief telephone conversation with her father played back in her head hed been pumping her she realized wondering if his little scheme had borne fruit im going to murder him she said quietly her eyes dark with barely controlled fury came back to justins as soon as im done with you she gave herself a moment because the need to scream was building again you couldve told me days ago could have justin agreed but as i figured your reaction would be essentially what it is i chose not to you chose she said between her teeth my father chose oh what marvelous egomaniacs you men are perhaps it didnt occur to you that i was on the chess board too anger flooded her face did you think youd get me into bed to pay him back for those moments of discomfort you know better than that justin spoke so mildly serena had to bite back a new retort for some reason i had a difficult time remembering whose daughter you were every time i put my hands on you ill tell you what i know she said in the same dangerously low voice the two of you deserve each other youre both arrogant pompous overbearing fools what right do you have to intrude on my life this way your father instigated the intrusion justin told her evenly the rest was strictly personal if you want to murder the old devil its your business but dont stick your claws into me i dont need your permission to murder him she tossed back her voice rising enough to cause a few heads to turn i think i just said that she sprang up casting about futilely for something to throw at him since it was physically impossible for her to lift him and heave him bodily through the plate glass window of the bookstore she only smouldered im afraid i lack your sense of humour she managed after a moment i happen to think what my father did was insulting and demeaning with as much dignity as she had left serena reached for her bags id appreciate it if youd stay out of my way during the rest of the trip im afraid id find it extremely difficult to restrain myself from throwing you overboard all right if justin added before she could speak again you promise to let me know in two weeks about the position in atlantic city even as her eyes widened and her mouth flew open to pour out abuse he held up a hand oh no deals off if you give me your answer now two weeks stiffly she nodded youll get the same answer then but i can postpone it goodbye justin serena smouldering she turned back to glare at him give daniel my best before you murder him chapter six the first thing serena noticed during the drive from the airport were the trees it had been some time since shed seen oak and maple and pine touched with fall it was barely september but the feel of autumn was in the air with all its strength and colour even while she appreciated it she seethed if it hadnt been indoctrinated into her to finish a job once it was started she would have caught the first plane out of st thomas after justins revelation instead shed gone about her duties with an outward smile and inward rage rather than cooling off during the interim serena had grown more angry and frustrated and felt more misused perhaps because justin had kept his part of the bargain and steered clear of her for the remainder of the cruise all of serenas temper was fully focused on one man daniel macgregor oh youre going to be sorry she muttered causing the cabbie to glance quickly in his rearview mirror nicelooking lady he mused mad as a hornet he began the gentle ride along nantucket sound in discreet silence the first view of the house had the effect of distracting serena from plans of revenge the grey stone glistened with minute pieces of mica in the late afternoon sun it had been built to daniels fancy and with its twin towers as nearly resembled a castle as he could manage there were large stone balconies roughly carved and tall mullioned windows a lush bed of flowers flowed in a semicircle around the front in place serena had always thought of the moat he would have preferred from the main structure two lower stone buildings spread out one was a tencar garage which with alan and caine away would be only half full the other held a heated pool daniel might prefer a primitive style of architecture but he appreciated comfort the cab pulled up in front of the granite steps interrupting serenas survey of the home shed grown up in leaving the two suitcases and scotch to the cab driver she gathered together the sundry packages from her shopping sprees and started up the steps following an old habit she looked at the massive oak door where the macgregor crest was carved into a brass knocker under the crowned lions head was the gaelic motto which translated to royal is my race as always when reading it she smiled her father had insisted they learn to say it in gaelic if they learned nothing else just set them there thank you still smiling serena paid off the driver then turned to thud her family crest against the door it would reverberate through the house she thought like the sound of approaching cannon the door was swung open on its welloiled hinges by a tiny scrap of a woman with irongrey hair and pointed features her mouth fell open accentuating the sharp chin miss rena lily serena embraced the small bony woman with all the exuberance of youth in addition to her duties as housekeeper lily had been surrogate mother whenever anna had been busy at the hospital she had handled the three unruly children expertly patching wounds and allowing squabbles to run their course did you miss me serena demanded giving lily a final squeeze before she drew the older woman away hardly noticed you were gone lily gave her a welcoming smile wheres your tan in my imagination lily wasnt that the door holding a piece of needlepoint in one hand anna macgregor poked her head out of a doorway down the long hall rena she came forward her arms outstretched serena raced into them anna was soft and strong both qualities flowed through serena along with a hundred memories she took a deep breath inhaling the scent of apple blossoms her mother had worn as long as she could remember welcome home darling we werent expecting you until tomorrow i caught an earlier plane serena pulled back tilting her head so that she could study her mothers face the skin was still creamy with only a few fine lines betraying her age there was a youthful softness about annas face that serena thought she would never lose her eyes were calm reflecting the nature that had refused to change through years of operating rooms and death her hair waved gently a rich brown dashed with grey mom serena pressed her cheek against her mothers again how do you stay so beautiful your father insists on it laughing serena pulled away grasping one of her mothers strong skilled hands its good to be home you look wonderful rena anna studied her with an easy mixture of maternal pride and professionalism nothing better than moist sea air for the complexion lily please tell cook that miss renas home well have our welcomehome dinner a day early i want you to tell me all about your travels she continued turning back to her daughter but if you dont go up to see your father first ill never hear the end of it abruptly serena remembered her mission anna watched her eyes narrow and recognizing the sign lifted her brows oh i intend to go up and see him all right anything youd like to tell me about afterward serena drew a deep breath hes going to require medical attention when im through with him i see knowing better than to question her daughter anna smiled quietly ill be in the parlor then well have a nice long talk when youre finished yelling at your father it wont take long serena muttered and started up the wide curved staircase at the first landing she glanced down the corridor to her left this was where the family slept with serenas childhood room three doors down on the left the wing was a maze of twists and turns and shadowy comers she could remember her brother caine hiding behind a threefoothigh urn then jumping out and scaring her nearly to death serena had chased him for nearly thirty minutes until her temper had been defeated by the sheer joy of the chase hed let her catch him eventually on the east lawn where he had tossed her to the ground to wrestle until she was weak with laughter how old had she been serena wondered eight nine caine would have been eleven or twelve suddenly she missed him with a purely physical ache of kinship and alan she mused continuing her climb hed always protected her in an offhanded way perhaps because he was six years her senior they had never indulged in the handtohand combat she and caine had been prone to as a boy alan had been scrupulously honest where caine had used the truth to suit himself never lying serena remembered with a faint smile just evading masterfully yet in his own way alan had always worked circumstances to his own favour she decided it was a basic macgregor trait glancing at the narrow stairway that led to the tower room serena vowed that there was one macgregor whod be sorry for it daniel leaned back in his chair and listened to the precise boring voice on the phone bankers he thought maliciously it was a curse to deal with them even owning controlling interest in the bank didnt protect him from them give them a thirtyday extension on the loan he ordered finally yes im aware of the figures you just gave me the figures dunderhead he added to himself impatiently he drummed his fingers on his desk why was it bankers couldnt see beyond two plus two thirty days he repeated with the standard penalty rate of interest he heard the loud thump at his door and was about to bellow at the intruder when it swung open annoyance was immediately flooded by pleasure do it he barked into the phone before he slammed it down rena before he could heave himself from his chair she had advanced on him planting herself in front of the desk she slapped her palms down on it and leaned over you old goat settling his bulk back in the chair daniel cleared his throat the fat he concluded was in the fire you look well too how dare you she spaced the words slowly and evenly the next danger signal how dare you dangle me in front of justin blade like a piece of prime beef beef daniel gave her an incredulous look pretty girl he thought proudly a true macgregor i dont know what youre talking about he went on so you met justin blade fine boy she made a sound deep in her throat you set me up hatching your little plot right here in this room like some mad king with a surplus daughter on his hands why didnt you just draw up a contract serena demanded as her voice rose its no less than i expect from you daniel duncan macgregor hereby trades his only daughter to justin blade for a case of twelveyearold scotch she smacked her hand on the redwood you could even have put in provisions about the number of progeny you expected me to provide to carry on the family name im surprised you didnt offer him a dowry now listen here little girl dont you littlegirl me she stalked around his desk and swung his chair around to face her it was despicable ive never been so humiliated in all my life i dont know what youre talking about i persuaded a friend to take a relaxing cruise dont you try to weasel out of it she poked a slim finger into his massive chest you sent him on my ship hoping wed trip over each other enough times so your investment would pay off you might never have met him at all he thundered its a big boat ship she thundered back its a big ship and a small casino you knew damn well the odds were in your favour well whats the harm in that he wanted to know at the top of his lungs you met a young friend of mine youve met hundreds of friends of mine the sound came from her throat again this time serena whirled away there was a huge bookshelf along the east wall stomping to it serena pulled out a volume entitled constitutional convention she flipped it open revealing the hollow where six cigars were secreted watching her father she scooped them out and then broke them in half rena he said in quiet horror its the next best thing to poisoning you she told him dusting off her fingers holding a hand to his heart daniel rose his broadfeatured face was wreathed in gloom its a dark day when a daughter betrays her own father betrays she shouted advancing on him again you have the nerve the utter gall to talk to me of betrayal sticking her hands on her hips she glared up at him i dont know how justin feels about it but i can tell you im insulted by your little scheme he bristled but noted her use of justins first name perhaps things were not as bad as they seemed thats the thanks i get for caring for my daughters happiness theres nothing sharper than the tongue of an ungrateful child the butcher knife i was considering is you said poison he reminded her im flexible then she smiled slowly well just so you wont think your money went for nothing i suppose i should tell you what ive decided about justin well then daniel went back to his desk thinking she would be more reasonable now that shed shouted and raged a bit a pity about the cigars though hes a fine boy good brains integrity pride he folded his hands over his stomach prepared to be magnanimous and forgiving oh yes i quite agree she said in dulcet tones hes also very very attractive daniel smiled pleased i knew you were a sensible girl rena ive had a strong feeling about you and justin for some time then youll be happy to know ive decided to become his mistress i cant daniel broke off confused then stunned then outraged the hell you are the day my daughter takes herself off to be to be kept is the day i take a strap to her for the first time in her life aye a strap serena macgregor grown woman or no ah so im a grown woman now am i while he blustered she gave him a long hard look remember this a grown woman decides whom shell marry when shell marry and if shell marry a grown woman doesnt need her father arranging outrageously complicated blind dates just think about how this whole business could have blown up in your face before you stick your nose in next time frowning he studied her face youre not thinking of becoming his mistress then serena gave him a haughty look if i choose a lover ill choose one but i wont be any mans mistress he felt a flash of pride along with a twinge of discomfort it only took an instant for him to concentrate on the pride daniel pushed at a gold pen and pencil set on his desk did you remember my scotch she tried to glare again but the twinkle in his eyes undermined her what scotch aw rena walking to him serena curled her arms around his neck im not forgiving you she murmured im only pretending to forgive you and i want you to know i never missed you at all she pressed her lips to his cheek always were a disrespectful brat he stated hugging her fiercely when serena went down to the parlour she found her mother sitting in her favourite rosepatterned armchair working on her latest needlepoint project on the rosewood tea tray beside her sat a dainty porcelain tea service dotted with tiny violets glancing at the scene serena marvelled again that a woman who could be so happily domesticated on one level could be such a dedicated and brilliant surgeon the hands that created the fragile pattern with needle and yarn would wield a scalpel on monday oh good anna glanced up as serena entered i thought i had it timed well when i ordered the tea toss another log on the fire dear then come tell me about it as serena moved to obey anna set her needlework on the piecrust table beside her the fire was already crackling in the stone fireplace but roared at the addition of fresh wood serena watched the oak catch then breathed deeply until that moment she hadnt realized how much she had missed the scent of burning wood and a tub bath she said aloud smiling she turned to her mother isnt it strange that just now i realize what an utter luxury it would be to soak in a bath for as long as i wanted after twelve months of standing in a bucket that passed for a shower stall and you loved every minute of it laughing serena sat on the hassock at annas feet you know me so well it was hard work and great fun but im glad to be home she accepted the cup and saucer anna passed to her mom i know id never have met so many people so many different kinds of people in my life if i hadnt done it your letters were always full of them you should read them over yourself one day to bring it all back anna curled her legs under her and chuckled youll never know how hard it was to talk your father out of taking an ocean cruise when will he stop worrying serena demanded never its part of the way he shows his love i know with a sigh serena sipped her tea if hed just relax and let me take care of my life my own way why dont you tell me what you thought of justin when serena glanced up sharply anna only smiled no i hadnt the faintest idea what your father was up to he knew better than to tell me your ah discussion with him was quite penetrating can you believe it incensed all over again serena rose with the cup in her hand he actually duped justin into that trip hoping that id come home with stars in my eyes and orange blossoms in my brain ive never been so furious so embarrassed how did justin take it serena gave her mother a disdainful look i think he found the whole thing very amusing after his initial shock he had no idea who i was until we were arguing on the beach one day and i said my full name arguing on the beach anna mused to conceal a smile she sipped her tea i see your father thinks very highly of him rena so do i i suppose daniel just couldnt resist the temptation hes infuriating who justin both of them she amended setting down her cup with a snap he didnt tell me until the cruise was nearly over and then in the most careless of ways why i was actually beginning to trailing off she turned away to stare at the fire beginning to anna prompted gently hes very attractive serena muttered i suppose it has something to do with his unapologetic ruthlessness and that damned charm that sneaks up on you wisely anna remained silent speculating even when he made me furious he stirred things up inside me that would have been more comfortable left alone ive never felt that kind of passion before im not certain i ever wanted to turning back she found her mother watching her calmly we spent the last day together in st thomas i would have gone to bed with him that night until he told me about dads little scheme how do you feel now serena looked down at her hands then let out a long breath i still want him i dont know if its any more than that how could it be when we knew each other less than two weeks rena do you really trust your instincts so little her brow creased serena looked back up at her mother why should emotions require a certain time pattern theyre as individual as the people they belong to when i met your father i thought he was a conceited loudmouthed ox at serenas appreciative chuckle anna grinned girlishly of course he was i fell for him anyway two months later we were living together and within a year we were married she made a wry smile at the obvious shock on her daughters face passion and premarital sex arent the exclusive property of your generation my love daniel wanted to get married i was determined to finish medical school first the only thing we both agreed on was that we couldnt and wouldnt live without each other serena considered her mothers words while the fire snapped violently behind her how did you know it was love and not just desire of all my children youve always asked the most difficult questions leaning forward anna took her daughters hands im not certain you can separate the two when it concerns a man and a woman you can feel one without the other but not when its real love not when its real desire passion that comes quickly and then fades with time is only an echo no substance simply a result do you think youve fallen in love with justin or are you afraid you have serena opened her mouth closed it then tried again both anna gave serenas hands a squeeze dont tell your father hed be entirely too pleased with himself this drew another reluctant laugh from serena before anna sat back again what do you intend to do about it i havent thought about it rather ive refused to think about it she brought up her knees to rest her chin on them i suppose ive known all along that id have to see him again he offered me a job oh serena moved her shoulders restlessly as ideas began to shift and sort in her mind managing a casino in atlantic city its a coincidence because id decided to consult dad about the possibility of opening my own gambling hotel if justin offered you a position like that he must have a great deal of faith in your skill i developed a knack for handling people serena mused as a thought focused you developed it when you were two her mother informed her ive got a feel for the business she went on with a hint of a smile on her lips i learned more than dealing cards this past year in essence the celebration is one of the best run hotels ive ever seen and though the casinos smallscale all the basics are there there wasnt any part of it i didnt learn from the inside out she grew silent again as her smile widened anna recognized the look what are you hatching rena im thinking of raising the bet she answered win lose or draw after tipping the bellboy justin stripped and headed for the shower the maid could deal with the unpacking in the morning and the casino could run another night without his attention for now he would have dinner in his suite while he made all the necessary phone calls to his other properties with luck there would be no problems that couldnt be handled long distance he had other things on his mind he adjusted the shower dial so that the water came out in pulsing jets serena would be home by this time he reflected and if he knew her daniel would already be paying the price justins grin came quickly naturally hed have given a lot to have been within earshot during the reunion it would almost make up for those last two long boring frustrating days aboard the celebration keeping his end of the bargain had been more difficult than justin had imagined to know she was within reach dealing cards in the sophisticated tux sleeping in that narrow bunk wearing only a flimsy handful of silk had nearly driven him mad but hed stayed away because a deal was a deal and because he had recognized that beneath her anger was a keen embarrassment that only time would lessen the two weeks hed given her should make her easier to negotiate with even if she refused his offer as he expected her to do initially justin didnt plan to leave it at that he calculated he could taunt her to atlantic city if necessary and after she was there hed have house advantage flipping off the shower he reached for a towel he needed a sharp manager downstairs he needed a woman on the top floor serena was the only one who could fill both requirements with the towel hooked around his waist justin walked into the bedroom like the rest of the owners suite the room was spacious and sophisticated the carpet beneath his bare feet was a thick soft pewter long vertical blinds covered the glass doors to the balcony and the touch of a button would swing them open revealing a view of the atlantic he glanced at the wide bed covered in deep blue silk how many women had slept in it justin neither knew nor cared a nights mutual pleasure theyd meant nothing more nothing less from the closet he drew out a robe letting the towel fall as he slipped into it there had been years when he had lived in places smaller than this one single bedroom hed still had women if he wanted one tonight he had only to choose a number from his book and dial the phone his body ached for one yet he knew that for the first time in his life just any woman wouldnt do prostrated and restless he roamed through the suite hed had good reason to base himself in the east the atlantic city operation was his newest and the newest always required the most attention it had never mattered to justin where he lived over the years hed grown used to the convenience of a hotel where his slightest wish would be seen to by the push of the right button now he found himself thinking about a home something permanent with grass to be tended and air that wasnt being shared with hundreds of other people running a hand through his hair justin wondered why he should feel this vague dissatisfaction when he had everything hed ever wanted but his plans had never included wanting one woman was it because of her that hed felt the lack of warmth when hed entered his rooms again if she were here the echoing emptiness wouldnt be she would fill it with temper and laughter with passion why had he given her two weeks justin asked himself angrily stuffing his hands into the pockets of his robe why hadnt he badgered her into coming back with him dragged her back so that he wouldnt be alone now aching for her he needed some contact with her her voice over the phone no justin thought more calmly not her voice that would only make matters more complicated going to the phone he dialled daniel macgregors private number macgregor you old bastard justin said mildly ah justin daniel cast his eyes up at the ceiling knowing he was in for his second tonguelashing of the day how was your trip educational i take it serenas already spoken to you thrilled to be home daniel stated glancing wistfully at the broken cigars on his desk speaks very highly of you ill bet she does with a grim smile justin sat on the plump sofa wouldnt it have been simpler to have told me serena worked on the ship would you have taken the trip no there then daniel stated reasonably and im sure it did you a world of good youve been tense boy restless he contemplated trying to light one of the mutilated cigars and dont worry ill talk to rena for you calm her down a bit no you wont im holding a case of scotch hostage daniel until im certain youll stay out of it now now theres no need to do that its just parental concern for both of you these two certainly knew where to stick the needle he mused glumly why dont you extend your vacation a few more days justin pay us a visit here serenas going to come to me he answered flatly come to you the wide forehead creased what do you mean by that what i said all right boy his chest expanded youd better tell me what your intentions are no some of the tension eased from justins muscles enjoying himself he leaned back what do you mean no daniel roared im her father youre not mine you dealt me this hand daniel im playing it out now listen here no justin said again just as calmly im telling you to fold daniel serena and i are going double or nothing you hurt that girl and ill skin you alive justin laughed if ever there was a woman who could take care of herself its serena macgregor aye pride swelled his heart and distracted him the girls a pistol of course if you think shes going to make a fool out of herself no child of mine makes a fool of herself daniel snapped making justin grin fine then youll keep out of it daniel ground his teeth and scowled at the receiver your word daniel all right all right i wash my hands of it but the minute i hear that youve goodbye daniel justin hung up satisfied that he had paid back his benefactor in spades chapter seven justin kept his office suite on the ground floor of the comanche connected by a private elevator to his penthouse rooms he found the arrangement convenient his working hours were sporadic and there were times when he had no desire to pass through the public rooms of the hotel the elevator was a practicality as were the small television monitors in the far corners and the twoway glass concealed behind the mahogany panelling on the side wall because he demanded complete privacy in his own offices justin worked in a large room without windows and with only one entrance his experience in a cell had given him a longstanding aversion to closedin places so to compensate hed decorated his working area carefully the furniture was lightcoloured maize oatmeal biscuit to give the appearance of airiness the paintings were large and full of colour a desert scene caught in the last dying streaks of sun the stark unforgiving peaks of the rockies a comanche brave in full gallop on a war pony the colour and the lack of it gave justin an illusion of freedom that counteracted the restlessness he sometimes felt when he found himself trapped behind a desk at the moment he was reviewing a stockholders report that would please anyone holding shares in blade enterprises twice justin caught himself reading and retaining nothing and forced himself to begin again serenas two weeks were up and so he discovered was his patience if she didnt phone within the next twentyfour hours hed be on his way to hyannis port to hold her to her end of the bargain damn he didnt want to go chasing after her justin thought as he tossed the report back onto the desk hed never chased after a woman in his life and hed already come uncomfortably close to doing so with serena since the beginning he played his best game when his opponent made the offensive moves opponent justin mused hed rather think of her that way it was safer but no matter how he thought of her he went on thinking of her no matter what he struggled to concentrate on she was always there just at the back of his mind waiting to slip through the guards every time he thought of having a woman serena was on his mind almost close enough to touch to smell desire for her completely obliterated desire for anyone else frustrated hungry justin had told himself to wait it out now he decided hed waited long enough before the night was over he would have her as justin reached for the phone to arrange for transportation north a knock sounded at his door yes warned by the tone in the one syllable his secretary poked only her head through the doorway sorry justin with an effort he directed his temper away from her what is it kate telegram she entered a sleek willowy brunette with a lowtoned voice and sculptured features and mr streeves been hanging around outside he wants you to extend his credit justin took the telegram with a grunt whats he in for five she said meaning five thousand as he tore open the envelope justin swore softly jackass doesnt know when to quit whos on the floor nero tell nero streeves good for one more then hes cut off with luck hell recoup a couple of thousand and be content with it with his luck hell be trying to trade his shares of at t for chips kate retorted nothing worse than the spoiled rich whore temporarily short of fluid cash were not here to moralize justin reminded her tell nero to keep an eye on him okay with a shrug kate shut the door behind her absently justin reached for the button that would slide the panelling clear of the twoway mirror it would be wise if he kept his eye on streeve as well before he could press it again justins gaze fixed on the message line of the telegram have considered your offer will arrive thursday afternoon to discuss terms please arrange for suitable accommodations s macgregor justin read the brief message twice before a smile tugged at his mouth how like her he thought short to the point and beautifully vague and well timed he added leaning back it was already past noon on thursday so she was coming to discuss terms he considered some small knot of tension unwound at the base of his neck drawing out a cigar justin lit it thoughtfully terms he reflected yes theyd discuss terms keeping that area coolly businesslike hed meant everything he had said to her when hed offered her the position in his opinion serena was well qualified to handle his staff and customers he needed someone on the floor who could make independent decisions leaving him free to travel to his other operations when it became necessary with the rest of the hotels to oversee he couldnt afford to spend all of his time supervising the casino blowing out a thin stream of smoke justin decided to make the job worth serenas while and once that was settled once that was settled he thought again shed have to deal with him on a personal level his eyes became opaque his long thin mouth set this time thered be no daniel macgregor playing the benevolent third party with an ace up his sleeve tonight he and serena would begin a very private twohanded game justins eyes cleared with a quick laugh winning was his business picking up the phone he punched the button for the front desk front desk steve speaking may i help you this is blade the clerk automatically came to attention yes sir a miss macgregor will be checking in this afternoon serena macgregor see that her bags are taken to the guest suite on my floor shes to be brought directly to me yes sir have the florist send some violets to her room yes sir a card no ill take care of it personally good satisfied justin hung up now all he had to do was wait picking up the stockholders report again he gave it his complete attention serena handed the doorman her car keys and took her first long look at the comanche justin hadnt gone for flashy or opulent but had managed an excellent happy medium the hotel was an open vshaped tower done in a drab adobe shade that brought a touch of the west to the east coast serena approved the architecture noting that nearly all the rooms had a view of the ocean the drive circled around a twolevel grottolike pool with its own miniature waterfall coins glistened in the bottom obviously there were plenty who were willing to risk some loose change for good luck beside the main door was a lifesize comanche chieftain in full headdress no dimestore indian serena mused but an exquisite sculpture in blackveined white marble giving in to the urge to touch it she ran a fingertip down the smooth stone chest how like justin not to choose the ordinary she thought as she let her eyes drift up to the marble face was it her imagination or was there some resemblance there if the eyes were green shaking her head serena turned away while her bags were being unloaded she used the time to take a look at the boardwalk famous names in huge letters on white billboards bold neon signs quiet in the late afternoon light huge hotel after huge hotel fountains traffic noise but it wasnt the same as vegas she decided and it was more than just the absence of mountains and the sound of the sea in her ears there seemed to be more of a carnival flavour here this was still a resort she concluded with a beach at the back door one could smell the gambling but it carried the moist salt spray of the atlantic with it and the laughter of children building sand castles adjusting the strap of her shoulder bag serena followed her luggage inside there was no red carpet or glistening chandeliers but rather subtle mosaic tile and indirect lighting both surprised and pleased serena noticed huge leafy plants in pottery jugs and wall hangings that clearly depicted the life and culture of the plains indian justins heritage was more a part of him than he realized she thought as she wandered toward the registration desk she could hear the familiar sound of slot machines muted by distance and the click of her own heels on the tile floor passing a bill to the doorman she turned to the desk clerk serena macgregor yes miss macgregor he gave her a quick welcoming smile mr blade is expecting you take miss macgregors bags to the guest suite in the penthouse he told the bellhop who was already hovering at her side mr blade would like you to come right to his office miss macgregor ill show you the way thank you nerves began to jump in her stomach but serena ignored them she knew what she was going to do and how she was going to do it shed had two weeks to work out her strategy during the long drive from massachusetts to new jersey she had gone over everything again and again once or twice shed nearly given in to the urge to turn the car around and drive back north she was taking an enormous risk with her future and with her heart sooner or later she was going to be hurt that was inevitable but there was something she wanted in atlantic city and his name was justin blade she pressed her hand to her stomach once quickly as if to push the nerves away as the desk clerk opened one of a pair of thick wooden doors marked private the brunette at an ebony desk glanced up in inquiry before her eyes rested on serena miss macgregor the clerk announced yes of course kate rose with a nod thank you steve mr blades expecting you miss macgregor just let me tell him youre here so this was why the boss had been on a short fuse kate concluded giving serena a cool appraising look as she lifted the interoffice phone she took in the long golden hair swept back at the temples with two ivory combs the strong elegant features accented by large violet eyes the slim figure in a raw silk suit a few shades darker than irises very classy kate decided and as serena met her stare without flinching added and no pushover miss macgregors here justin of course she cradled the receiver giving serena a smile that stopped just short of friendly right this way miss macgregor leading the way kate opened another door serena paused beside her thank you miss wallace kate responded automatically thank you miss wallace serena took the door handle herself and gently closed it behind her kate stared at the knob a moment realizing she had been expertly dismissed more intrigued than annoyed she went back to her desk serena justin leaned back in his chair why had he expected something to change he wondered quickly somehow he had thought hed be prepared for the onslaught of feeling simply seeing her brought to him every hour of the past two weeks vanished in one instant hello justin she prayed he wouldnt offer his hand as her own palms were damp you have quite a place here sit down he gestured to the chair in front of his desk would you like something coffee no with a polite smile she crossed the room to sit in a chair of buttery buckskin leather i appreciate your taking the time to see me right away he only lifted a brow at this theyd circled each other for a while he mused like a pair of boxers studying defences in the early rounds how was your flight i drove she answered it was something i missed doing this past year the weather was lovely she added determined to keep the trite conversation going until her nerves settled and your family my parents are fine i wasnt able to see alan or caine serena gave her first hint of a genuine smile my father sends his best hes still among the living then i found more subtle ways of revenge with grim pleasure serena thought of the broken cigars youre adjusting to land life unable to resist the urge justin dropped his gaze to her mouth for a moment it was untouched by lipstick and faintly moist yes but not to unemployment she could feel the brush of heat across her lips and the answering warmth that kindled in the pit of her stomach she found herself wanting to go to him to take whatever he would give on whatever terms he offered just to be held again to have those lean clever hands touch her carefully she folded her own in her lap thats what i want to talk to you about the position of casino managers still open he said easily though he took his time bringing his eyes back to hers the hours are long though i dont think youll find them as allconsuming as on the ship generally theres no need for you to be on the floor before five though naturally you can adjust that from time to time if you need an evening off theres a certain amount of paperwork of course but for the most part youd be directing the staff and handling the customers youd have your own office on the other side of the reception area when youre not needed on the floor you can supervise from there there are monitors he continued gesturing and a more direct view justin pressed a button releasing the panelling serena glanced through the glass to watch the crowd in the casino gambling talking wandering in silent movie effect youll have an assistant justin went on hes competent but not authorized to make independent decisions a suite of rooms is included in your salary when im away from the hotel youll have complete authority over the casino within my framework of rules that seems clear enough unclenching her hands serena made herself relax she gave justin a mild friendly smile id consider taking over the managerial duties of the casino justin as your partner she saw a flicker but only a flicker of surprise in his eyes before he leaned back with anyone else it would have been a gesture of relaxation with justin it seemed a preparation for action my partner in the atlantic city comanche she returned calmly i need a manager for the casino serena i dont need a partner and i dont need a job or a salary for that matter she countered im fortunate enough to have financial independence but im not of a nature to stay idle i took the job on the celebration as an experiment i dont need to take another job for the same reasons im looking for something i have a bit more of a stake in you said once you were considering looking for work in a casino when you left the ship no she smiled again and shook her head you misunderstood me i was thinking of opening my own place your own place with a quick laugh he relaxed again do you have any idea just what that involves her chin came up i think i do ive just spent a year of my life working and living on what was essentially a floating gambling resort i know how a kitchens run to accommodate over fifteen hundred people how housekeeping keeps ahead of the linen supply and how to stock a wine cellar i know when a dealers feeling under par and needs to be relieved and how to convince a customer to find another game before he gets nasty there was little more for me to do on that ship than learn and i learn very quickly justin considered the coldly furious tone of her voice the hard determined light in her eyes she could probably do it successfully enough he decided after a moment she had the guts the drive and the bankroll taking all of that into consideration he began slowly why should i take you on as a partner rising serena walked over to the glass do you see the dealer on table five she asked tapping a finger against the window curious justin rose and joined her yes why she has excellent hands fast steady it looks to me as though shes worked out a very comfortable rhythm without appearing to rush the players along she doesnt belong working midweek afternoons you need dealers like that during the heavy traffic the croupier at the crap table looks bored to death he needs to be fired or given a raise clarify that one for me because there was a touch of humour in his voice serena grinned up at him given a raise if he takes the hint to be a bit more personable fired if he doesnt your casino staff should reflect the same attitude as the rest of the hotel staff a good point he admitted and a good reason for wanting you as my casino manager it doesnt cover your partnership serena turned her back on the silent world behind the glass a few more reasons then when youre needed out west or in europe youll know youre leaving someone in charge who has a vested interest not only in the casino but in the whole operation i did a bit of research she added if blade enterprises continues to grow at its current rate youll have to have someone help shoulder some of the responsibility unless of course you chose to work twentyfour hours a day making money without any time to enjoy your success the money im willing to invest would give you enough fluid cash to sweeten your bid on that casino in malta justins brow rose you have done your research he commented dryly we scots never do business blindfolded she gave him a satisfied smile the point is i have no intention of working for you or anyone else for half interest ill run the casino and pick up the slack in other areas when necessary half he murmured narrowing his eyes equal partners justin she met his eyes on level thats the only way youll get me silence came quickly and completely and serena forced herself to control her breathing to a slow even rate she wouldnt let him know how nervous she was or let herself think how easy it would be to forget pride and run into his arms what had begun the last time they had been together had been quietly accomplished during their separation shed fallen in love with him when he hadnt even been around to tempt her but he wouldnt know she wouldnt allow him to know until she was ready suppose you take some time to think it over she said at length my plans are flexible serena went on as she walked to retrieve her purse from the chair id intended to look into some property here while im in town when justins fingers curled around her arm serena made herself turn slowly he was going to call her bluff she was certain of it and when he did shed have the choice of folding or riding it out anytime during the first year that i decide it isnt working i can buy you out she struggled against a shout of laughter agreed she told him quietly ill have my lawyer draw up a draft of an agreement in the meantime you can get your feet wet in there he jerked his head toward the casino you should have a week or so to change your mind i have no intention of changing my mind justin when i make a decision i stick to it their eyes met again in a long cautious stare serena held out her hand a deal then justin glanced at her hand then slowly closed his over it he held it as though making a pact then brought it to his lips a deal serena he said though we might both be sorry for it ill go up and change she drew her hand away from his ill work the casino tonight tomorrows soon enough justin moved ahead of her to the door closing his fingers over hers on the knob id rather not waste time she said simply if you could introduce me to my assistant and a few of the croupiers i should manage from there whatever you want give me an hour to change and unpack then wanting to break contact serena twisted the knob we have other things to talk about serena the words seemed to flutter along her skin aching with need she turned back to him yes she said quietly but id rather we cleared up the business preliminaries first so its clear one thing has nothing to do with the other watching her justin caught the collar of her suit between his thumb and forefinger im not sure that one hasnt very much to do with the other he murmured and that both of us arent fools for pretending otherwise the pulse at the base of her throat began to hammer visibly but even as he noted it her voice became strong and clear well both find out soon enough wont we with a slow smile justin dropped his hand yes we will ill see you in an hour it was going to be hard work serena discovered quickly every bit as hard as her work on the celebration but this time she mused as she glanced around the crowded noisy casino she had her own stake she signed her name to a cash receipt one of the croupiers brought her and felt a small glow of pleasure part of the life pulsing around her at that moment belonged to her adjustments would take time she reminded herself as she noted a few speculative glances aimed her way when justin had introduced her as his partner serena had almost heard the wheels turning inside each brain she would simply have to prove herself qualified for the position no matter what happened between her and justin personally rule number one was confidence rule number two was tenacity when applied together serena considered them an unbeatable combination not unlike the formula she used to handle her father her assistant nero was a big quiet black man who had taken the news of serenas interest in the hotel with a silent shrug she learned that he had worked in justins first casino as a bouncer and in one capacity or another had worked in all of justins properties with as few words as possible he took serena through the casino gave her the basic routine then left her alone he was one man she concluded who wouldnt be won over easily catching a signal from one of the dealers serena crossed the room before she was halfway to the table she heard the angry raised voice it took only a glance to determine the man in question was very unlucky and more than a little unhappy about it excuse me giving the players at the table a general smile serena moved to stand beside the croupier is there a problem you bet there is sweetheart the man on the end leaned over and took her wrist who are you serena allowed her eyes to lower to his hand then brought them slowly back to his face im the owner he gave a quick laugh before he drained his glass ive seen the owner lady he doesnt look anything like you my partner serena informed him with an icy smile out of the corner of her eye she caught neros movement toward her and imperceptibly shook her head is there something i can help you with ive dropped a bundle at this table tonight he told her my friends herell vouch for that the other players ran the gamut between looking bored or annoyed all of them ignored him would you care to cash in the rest of your chips she asked politely i want a chance to make some back he countered setting down his empty glass this joker wont raise the limit serena glanced at the pokerfaced croupier and saw the dregs of fury in his eyes our dealers arent authorized to raise the table limit mr carson mick carson and id like to know what kind of operation this is where a man cant have a chance of getting even as i said serena returned calmly the dealers arent authorized to up the limit but i am how much did you have in mind mr carson thats more like it he said and signalled for another drink serena gave a small shake of her head to the roaming cocktail waitress five thousand on the hand he sent serena a hard grin that should balance things out ill sign for it all right bring mr carson his tab nero she ordered sensing he stood within earshot you can play the single hand for five thousand mr carson serena shot him a level look and if you lose you call it a night all right honey he took her wrist again letting his eyes travel down the length of the sleek ruby dress and if i win why dont you and i go and have a quiet drink somewhere dont press your luck mr carson serena warned him with a smile on her face chuckling he took the clipboard nero brought to him then scrawled his name never any harm in trying honey oh no he added when serena stepped aside you deal without a word serena took the croupiers place it was then she caught sight of justin standing to the side watching her damn she met his eyes briefly wondering if she had let her annoyance get in the way of judgment with another glance at carson she told herself it would be worth the five thousand to get rid of him peacefully bets she asked letting her eyes skim the other players as she counted out carsons chips by unanimous consent the others at the table abstained just you and me carson said sliding his chips forward deal silently serena dealt him a seven and a two a glance at her hole card revealed twelve with nine showing hit carson ordered reaching absently for his empty glass she turned up a queen stand he said and sent her a wide mirthless smile stand on nineteen serena turned up her hole card twelvefifteen she continued as she turned up a three without pausing she drew out a five twenty carson let out his breath in an oath come back again mr carson she said coolly and waited for him to stand he eyed her a moment as she calmly raked in his chips then rising walked out of the casino without a word i apologize for the inconvenience serena smiled at the other players before she nodded to the dealer you did that real smooth miss macgregor nero mumbled as she walked past him stopping serena turned back thank you nero and its rena she had the pleasure of seeing him flash her a smile before she walked to justin were you ready to have me committed she asked him quietly justin looked down at her then idly twirled the end of a lock of hair around his finger you know i wanted you here for a variety of reasons that was one of them pleased she laughed what if id lost justin shrugged then youdve lost youd still have handled a potentially uncomfortable situation with the minimal of fuss and with style he murmured scanning her face i do admire your style serena macgregor strange she could feel the change inside her even as it happened the softening the heating the wanting ive always admired yours youre tired justin ran a thumb lightly under her eyes where the faintest of shadows was forming a little she admitted what time is it around four no wonder the trouble with these places is that you lose track of day and night youve already put in more than your share he told her as he began to lead her through the casino what you need is some breakfast mmm i take it that means youre hungry i hadnt noticed but since you mention it i think im starving serena looked back over her shoulder as he nudged her through the doors of his outer office but isnt the restaurant the other way well have breakfast up in my suite oh wait a minute with another laugh she pulled up short i think the restaurantll be a lot smarter justin studied her a moment then reached into his pocket oh justin heads my suite tails the restaurant with lowered brows she held out her hand let me see that coin taking it from him serena examined both sides all right im too hungry to argue flip it with a deft movement of his thumb he did serena waited until it lay on the back of his hand then let out a sigh well take the elevator up justin said blandly chapter eight im still going to beat you one of these days serena said with a yawn as justin pressed the button for the penthouse and when i do its going to be worth more than breakfast she glanced around at the smoky mirrored walls you know i hardly noticed the elevator when i was in your office its an escape route he said then gave her a small smile when she looked at him we all need one occasionally i dont suppose i thought you would she remembered the twoway glass in his office and sighed do they crowd you at times justin all those people only a thin wall away more lately than they used to he admitted i suppose you felt the same way on the boat occasionally isnt that why you went out on deck when everyone else was asleep she answered by lifting her shoulders well ill have to get used to it if im going to be living here in any case ive always seemed to live in a crowd when the doors slid open serena stepped through justin this is really lovely he used bolder colours in his personal rooms slashes of indigo in the cushions of a low spreading sofa the flash of chartreuse in the shade of a glass lamp for balance there were sketches in pastel chalks and a bevelled mirror in a gilt frame you can relax here serena decided picking up a carved figure of a hawk in middive it hardly seems like a hotel at all with your personal things around oddly when he saw her with her hands on what was his justin felt his first intimacy with the room to him it had always been a living arrangement nothing more nothing less a place to go when he wasnt working he had similar rooms in other hotels they were comfortable private and he realized suddenly empty until now of course my suite is very nice serena went on roaming at will to touch or examine whatever came to hand but ill feel more settled in once i spread some of my own things around i think ill have my mother ship me my writing desk and a few other pieces turning she found him watching her in the still silent manner he could so easily slip into suddenly nervous serena set down a small glass bowl of cobalt blue what sort of view do you have serena moved toward the window and had taken the first step up onto the small raised platform in front of it before she noticed that the glass table was already set lifting the cover from one of the plates serena saw a hearty mexican omelettete a rasher of bacon and a corn muffin with a tilt of the lid on a silver serving pot the aroma of fresh coffee filled the room beside the table was an ice bucket of champagne well imagine that serena murmured as she slipped the single rosebud from its crystal vase look what the good fairy left justin amazing and they say miracles are a thing of the past you want to hear a miracle serena asked him passing the bud under her nose its a miracle i dont dump this coffee over your head i prefer to take it internally he murmured as he crossed the room to join her do you like your rose this is the second time youve made my eating arrangements before consulting me she began you were hungry last time too he reminded her thats not the point what is serena took a deep frustrated breath and was assaulted by the aroma of hot food i knew what it was a minute ago she muttered how did you manage to have it here all hot and ready i called room service before i came out to the casino to see if you needed rescuing draping a cloth over the bottle he deftly removed the champagne cork very clever surrendering to hunger serena sat propping her elbows on the table she set her chin on her folded hands champagne for breakfast its the best time for it justin filled two glasses before he joined her if i decide to overlook your arrogance serena considered as she cut into the omelette this is really very nice of you in an underhanded fashion youre welcome he murmured lifting his glass after the first bite serena closed her eyes in silent appreciation and its easy to overlook arrogance on an empty stomach either im starving justin or this is the best omelette every made ill give the chef your approval mmm ill have to take a look at the kitchen tomorrow and the nightclub she added over another mouthful i noticed you have chuck rosen for a week run there shouldnt be an empty seat i have him signed for an exclusive twoyear contract justin broke a muffin in half hes a guaranteed sellout in all the hotels that was a wise investment serena mused you know lifting her wine she studied him over the rim youre exactly what i thought you were when you sat down at my table the first time and yet youre nothing like i thought you were sipping justin returned her gaze what did you think i was a professional gambler which of course was accurate but serena trailed off and drank again justin was right she mused champagne had never tasted better i didnt see you as a man who could build up and run a chain of places like this no amused he toyed with his meal as he watched her what then i think i saw you as sort of a nomad which again is partially accurate because of your heritage but i didnt consider you as a man whod want the sort of responsibility hotels like these require youre an interesting mix justin of the ruthless and the responsible the hard and she picked up the rosebud again the sweet no ones ever accused me of being that before justin murmured as he filled her glass again of what of being sweet well its not one of your dominating virtues she mumbled into her wine i suppose thats why it throws me off when it comes through it gives me great pleasure to throw you off his finger trailed down the back of her hand to her wrist ive found a certain weakness for vulnerability determinedly she took another swallow of wine im not vulnerable as a rule no he agreed perhaps thats why its all the more rewarding that i can cause you to be your pulse jumps when i touch you here he whispered grazing a finger over the inside of her wrist a bit unsteadily serena set down her glass i should go but he rose with her and now his fingers were laced with hers his eyes when hers met them were very calm and very confident i made myself a promise this afternoon serena he told her quietly that id make love with you before the night was over taking a step closer justin captured her other hand we still have an hour before sunrise it was what she wanted every pore of her body seemed to be crying out with need yet if his hands hadnt held hers so firmly she would have backed away justin i wont deny that i want you but i think it would be best if we gave it some more time reasonable he agreed as he drew her into his arms times up he stopped her protesting laugh with his lips there was no food to stop this hunger his mouth was hard devouring before serena could respond or struggle away yet she knew as he crashed her body to his that this time he would permit no struggle she tasted his lips and tasted urgency she felt the firm long lines of his body and felt need when his tongue sought hers there was no easy teasing no gentle testing but a desperate demand for intimacy now he seemed to say to her theres no turning back what had begun weeks before with a long cool meeting of eyes would reach its culmination it would happen serena thought dizzily because neither of them wanted any other answer through those first urgent stirrings of passion she felt a quiet joy she loved and love she realized was the ultimate adventure placing her hands on either side of his face she carefully drew her lips away from his then looked into his eyes warmer now with need for her she wanted a moment only a moment to clear her head to say what she wanted to say without the heat of passion racing through her gently she traced her fingers over the long strong bones of his face his heart thudded against her breast as hers began to calm a smile touched the lips that were warm and aching from his this she told him quietly is what i want what i choose justin said nothing as he stared down at her the simple words were more seducing than her soft summer scent than the hot pulsing taste they weakened him exposing vulnerabilities hed never considered suddenly there was more than passion raging through him bringing his hand to hers he slid it to his mouth pressing his lips against the palm ive thought of nothing but you for weeks he said wanted no one but you he ran a hand down the length of her hair before his fingers closed over it in a fist need good god when had he ever felt such need come to bed serena i cant do without you any longer her eyes were calm as she offered him her hand without words they walked to the bedroom the room was in shadows accented by the faint light that signals the end of night and it was silent so silent that serena could hear her own breath as it began to quicken when she felt justin move away from her she stood resolute suddenly tingling with nerves he wouldnt be gentle she thought as she remembered the feel of his mouth and hands on her as a lover he would be equally thrilling and terrifying she heard a sharp scrape then saw the flare of a match as he held it to the wick of a candle the shadows danced her eyes were drawn to him in the flickering yellow light his face held a dangerous beauty he seemed to belong more to his indian ancestors now than to the world she understood and she knew at that instant why the captive woman had fought against then remained willingly with her captor i want to see you justin murmured reaching out to bring her into the candlelight with surprise he felt the quiver run through her only moments before she had seemed so strong so sure youre trembling i know she took a deep breath and exhaled quickly its silly no he felt a streak of power sharp and clean serena macgregor wasnt a woman to tremble for any man but for him even as the fire lit in her eyes her body shuddered taking her hair in his hand justin drew her head back in the shifting light his eyes glistened with fierce almost savage desire no he said again then crushed her mouth to his she seemed to melt into him justin thought he could feel her bones soften liquefy until she was totally pliant in his arms for the moment he would accept surrender but soon he would have more much more with his mouth still avid on hers he began to undress her forgetting the fragile material he tugged pausing only to mould inch by inch the flesh he uncovered she was shuddering now pulling at the buttons of his shirt as her dress slid down to pool at her feet hed known she would wear something soft and filmy with a fingertip justin nudged the thin straps of her camisole off her shoulders but he didnt remove it not yet he wanted the pleasure of feeling silk between them he tormented her running hot nibbling kisses over her face as she struggled to undress him her fingers touching his flesh wrenched a groan from him that he muffled against her throat then she was beneath him on the bed with only a fragile wisp of material separating them he felt a madness a driving need to take her swiftly that he had to fight back her breasts were small and firm in his hand straining against the silk as he rained kiss after savage kiss on her lips consumed by her justin drove her mercilessly to the first peak with only his hands and mouth swallowing her gasps he pressed his body down on hers so that her frantic movements blended into him then ruthlessly he slid down to capture her silkclad breast in his mouth straggling for air serena arched against him her body shuddered from a hundred unexpected sensations she was trapped in a world of silk and fire at her every movement the bedspread caressed her naked back and legs whispering of dark promises her flesh was seared wherever he had touched as though hed carried the tiny gold flame of the candle in his fingers as he wet the silk above her straining nipple with his tongue she felt the fire leap into her like a voice from a distance she heard him murmuring her name and more she couldnt understand as if hed lost patience with any barrier justin drew the chemise down to her waist so that he could feast on her naked skin serena pressed him closer her hands now as demanding as his though her mouth ached for the taste of him her body thrilled to the desperate race of his lips over her skin she knew only pleasure now the steamy pleasure of unrelenting passion gone were restrictions and rules here was the abandonment she had glimpsed briefly in a dream it was only now that she realized there was so much she didnt know so much shed never felt second by second there were new discoveries as his mouth tarried just above the line of silk she felt a hunger deeper than any shed ever experienced her imagination ran wild thoughts of him inside her filling her dreams of a pleasure so acute they brought a tug of pain between her thighs delirious she clutched at his shoulders take me she demanded on a ragged breath justin take me now but he continued driving her higher as if he hadnt heard her plea he drew the silk down caressing the newly exposed flesh with his lips over the flat quivering stomach over the smooth curve of hip to the taut arching muscles of her inner thigh she arched crying out thrown swiftly into the river of passion he was relentless as terrifying a lover as she had feared as thrilling as shed dreamed she was all that he wanted soft and moist and out of control desperate demanding she clutched at him scraping his flesh with those sleek elegant nails he could hear her moans her incoherent words rasping out of her throat as he drove her further and further toward madness her skin was damp beaded with passion while her hips thrust her need toward him again and again now she was his mindlessly his and he knew somehow that no one had ever taken her more completely fighting to hold the power a moment longer he ranged himself above her serena gripped his hips urging him on in the first touch of daylight her face was like porcelain her eyes were closed her lips parted as each breath trembled through them half crazed with need he vowed no man would ever see her as he saw her at that moment look at me justin demanded in a voice harsh with passion look at me serena she opened her eyes and they were glazed with pleasure dark with need youre my woman he slipped inside her and nearly lost control therell be no going back for you now or for you her eyes lost focus as the two of them began to move together justin straggled to comprehend what she had said but she was moving faster burying his face in her hair he swirled toward the madness dawn streamed through the wide window in a flood of rosegold light with justins head still nestled at her throat serena watched it play over the length of his back it looked like what she felt like she discovered bright and rich and new was there a better way to watch the sunrise than with your lovers body warm on yours sleep she felt no need for it she knew she could lie like this for hours with the sun growing brighter and the sound of his breathing gentle in her ear with a sigh sweetened by contentment she ran her hands up his back at her touch justin lifted his head with their faces close he looked at her letting his eyes roam feature by feature until there was nothing in his mind but her face flushed and soft from loving without a word he lowered his mouth to hers in the butterfly touch he used so rarely gently almost reverently he brushed kisses over her eyelids her temples her cheeks until serena felt unexpected tears rise in her throat beneath his her body felt fluid and free i thought i knew what it would be like he whispered touching his lips to hers again i should have realized with you nothings as i expect it raising his head again he traced a fingertip under her eye you should sleep she smiled and brushed at the hair on his forehead i dont think ill ever sleep again i know i never want to miss another sunrise he kissed her lightly then rolling from her brought her close to his side i want you with me serena content she snuggled closer i am with you i want you to live with me he corrected her tilting her chin up so that he could see her eyes here its not enough to know youre in a room down the hall then he paused running his thumb over her lips therell be talk downstairs speculation resting her head on his shoulder again serena began to trace a finger across his chest talk wont stop downstairs once your names linked with daniel macgregors daughter she told him no she heard the change in tone and knew that if she looked his eyes would be unfathomable the press would find the relationship interesting considering my background and reputation as opposed to yours justin she trailed a finger down the centre of his torso then back up again are you asking me to live with you or warning me not to for a long moment he was silent while serena continued to trace lazy patterns over his chest both he answered at length i see well she turned her head so that she was free to nibble on his neck i suppose i should think about it she felt a quiver of response as her hand ran low over his stomach weigh the pros and cons she continued working kisses up his jawline shifting she lay across him her face just above his i dont suppose you could run through the pros and cons for me with a smile she pressed her lips to his just to refresh my memory in the interest of helping you make an intelligent decision he began sliding a hand down to her hip mmmhmm but even as he sought to deepen the kiss she moved finding the vulnerable spot below his ear did you know i was captain of the debate team my senior year at smith no his eyes shut as the heady sensation of being seduced took over give me a subject she said sliding her fingertips down his ribs and the time for research she added as she nipped gently at his throat and i can argue either side of the issue now as i see it she gave a sigh of pleasure as she pressed her lips to the fast jerky pulse at the base of his throat living with you entails a great many inconveniences his hand roamed over her hip slipping between her thighs serena slid farther down his body frustrating him serena no i have the floor she reminded him then flicked her tongue over his chest id lose my privacy and a great deal of sleep she said revelling in the quickening of his breath as she boldly explored his body id risk the inevitable gossip and speculation of my new employees as well as the press as muscles bunched and flowed under her hands beneath her seeking lips she lost her train of thought like the marble sculpture of the chieftain she thought hazily as her blood began to pound youd be impossible to live with she concluded lost somewhere between her own initiative and the savage beauty of his naked body demanding infuriating and because i find you so incredibly attractive id never have a moments peace of mind she moved back up him letting her body please itself by rubbing sinuously against his on the journey her smile was slow and seductive as she saw his eyes were fixed on her face give me one good reason why i should after considering all that live with you his breathing wasnt steady but he couldnt control it the hand that grabbed her hair wasnt gentle but he couldnt stop it either i want you serena lowered her lips until they were an inch from his show me she demanded even as her mouth came down to his justin was rolling her over roughly beyond reason he thrust into her quickly wrenching a cry from her that turned to gasping moans as he drove her harder and faster with mindless grasping greed he took and took but the hunger only seemed to feed upon itself growing and swelling as her legs and arms tangled around him he was drenched with sweat trapped in those soft white limbs unable to breathe unable to break free and it was her name that shouted over and over in his mind his body seemed to shake with the sound threatening to explode with the desperate repetition of her name then the word shattered into tiny fragments he knew he would never be rid of them then he knew nothing but the shuddering relief of fulfilment dazed he slept with his body and mind tangled with her the phone woke him barely four hours later beside him serena stirred sighed and mumbled an oath keeping one arm around her justin stretched out the other and plucked up the receiver yes glancing down he saw that serena had opened heavy eyes to stare at him he brushed the top of her head with his lips when seeing him tense she pushed up on her elbow have they evacuated no ill handle it ill be down in a few minutes what is it justin was already out of bed and heading for the closet bomb threat in vegas he grabbed the first thing that came to hand jeans and a cashmere sweater oh god serena was scrambling up searching for her lingerie when the phone call said it would detonate at three thirtyfive vegas time unless we deliver a quarter of a million in cash that doesnt give us a hell of a lot of time he muttered snapping his jeans theyre still evacuating youre not going to pay fury in her eyes serena pulled the chemise over her head justin watched her in silence for a moment then smiled as cold and sharp as a knife im not going to pay as he strode into the next room serena dashed after him ill be down as soon as i change theres nothing for you to do the elevator doors were already opening as she grabbed his arm ill be with you for an instant his features softened hurry then he told her giving her a quick hard kiss before he stepped into the car in less than ten minutes serena was rushing through the reception area into justins office he glanced up as she entered but gave her no more than a nod as he continued talking in quiet tones into the phone kate stood beside the desk her hands clenched her usually composed face strained miss macgregor she said curtly without taking her eyes from justin could you fill me in please some nut claims he has a bomb rigged somewhere in the vegas hotel hes supposed to have a remote device that will set it off in she glanced at her watch an hour and fifteen minutes theyre evacuating and the bomb squads sweeping the place but but serena prompted do you have any idea how big that hotel is kate demanded in a shaking voice how small and deadly a bomb can be saying nothing serena walked to the bar at the far end of the room and poured a snifter of brandy she brought it back to kate pushing it into her hands drink this she ordered with a shudder kate tilted the snifter back until it was empty thank you she pressed her lips together a moment then looked back at serena im sorry my husband lost an arm in vietnam a booby trap this she let out a long breath this brings it all back come on sit down serena said more gently as she urged her onto the sofa theres nothing to do now but wait justins not going to pay kate murmured no serena shot her a surprised look do you think he should kate dragged a hand through her hair im not objective about things like this but she brought her eyes to serenas again he has so much to lose hed lose more than money if he paid turning serena ranged herself behind justin she touched him only once briefly a hand on his shoulder as kate looked on he reached up and caught serenas fingers in his the gesture told her more than a thousand words why he loves her kate thought stunned it had never occurred to her that justin blade would be vulnerable to any woman even as kate studied his face she wondered if he knew he was he set off a charge in one of the basement storage rooms justin let the phone drop to his shoulder a moment oh god was anyone hurt he looked up at serena with eyes that told nothing of his thoughts no theres damage but its fairly minor he called in to tell the police that one was just a bonus to prove he wasnt bluffing he wants the money dropped off at threefifteen vegas time serena dropped a hand to his arm what are you thinking justin im thinking hes cutting it very fine for someone whos after a quarter of a million im wondering if thats all hes after when he called the hotel he asked for me by name serena felt a new ripple of unease a lot of people know you own the comanche she began or its very likely someone who once worked for you or knew someone that did he shifted the phone again well have to wait and see wont we and there was something in the quiet words serena recognized a threat of violence a promise of revenge how many more people left in there justin demanded into the receiver no i want to know the minute everybodys out ill get some coffee serena said no rising kate shook her head ill do it you stay with him serena looked at the trim gold clock on his desk ten fortyfive moistening her lips she gripped the back of justins chair and waited his eyes drifted to the clock as well less than an hour he thought and he was helpless how could he explain that the hotel was more than concrete and stone to him it had been the first thing he had owned his first home after his parents had died it symbolized his independence his success his heritage now he could only stand by and wait for it to be blown apart was that the reason for the feeling in his gut that the threat was directed at him personally running a hand over the back of his neck justin decided that made more sense and yet his instincts told him differently it might be a bluff serenas voice came calm and strong from behind him justin felt the sharp wave of frustration pass holding out a hand he waited for her to come around the chair and slip hers into it i dont think so she pressed his hand between both of hers it would be wrong to pay youre doing the right thing justin its the only thing i know how to do he gave his attention to the voice over the phone good the guests and staff are out he told serena she sat on the arm of his chair while they both watched the clock kate came back with coffee but it sat untouched on the desk while they waited as the minutes ticked by serena could feel the tension coming off justin in waves he sat silently the phone in one hand she tried to imagine the complexity of a search in a hotel the size of justins vegas comanche how many hundreds of rooms serena wondered how many thousands of closets and corners she wondered helplessly if the sound of the explosion would carry through the receiver and how many other times she thought has justins fate rested on the caprices of luck this time she told herself as she placed her hand back on his shoulder fate would have to beat them both because she was watching them serena saw the sudden rigidity in the fingers that lay on the desk yes to keep herself from asking questions serena bit her lip as justin listened to the voice over the phone i see no not that im aware of yes ill be there as soon as possible thank you hanging up the phone he turned to serena they found it oh thank god she dropped her forehead onto his from what i was just told it would have taken out the casino and half the main floor kate book me on the first flight to vegas justin serena stood from the arm of his chair and found her legs were oddly weak do they have any idea who no for the first time he noticed the coffee mug on his desk lifting it he drank half of it down i have to go out smooth over things in the hotel and talk to the authorities ill be back in a couple of days he rose and took her by the shoulders it looks like my new partners going to have a trial by fire ill be fine rising on her toes she brushed a kiss over his mouth and ill take good care of our hotel im sure you will he said then drew her closer i dont like leaving you just now ill be here when you get back she reached up to frame his face with her hands dont worry just come back soon he lowered his mouth to hers and lingered go get some sleep he suggested oh no this is my first full day on the job his face was calm but she could feel the tension in him instead of the endless questions she wanted to ask serena made herself smile and pull away i have quite a few things to do tour the hotel inspect the kitchen go through the files in my office arrange to have my things moved to our suite the our hit him forcibly leaving him a little stunned do that first he demanded taking her hands again i want to know youre in my bed serena i youre on a plane in fortyfive minutes justin kate interrupted poking her head in the doorway youll have to hurry if you want to make it all right have a car brought around justin with a half laugh serena tugged on her hands youre breaking my fingers there was something in the look he gave her part wary part stormy that had her smile fading what is it had he been going to tell her he loved her he thought with a quick flutter of panic had he been going to say the words before they had fully registered in his mind itll keep he said at length all right and because she wanted to erase the tension from his face she smiled again then throwing her arms around his neck serena pressed her mouth to his be miserable without me please ill do my best kate has the number if you need me justin your cars here yes all right he gave serena a last bruising kiss think of me he ordered before he strode away taking a deep breath she sat in the chair still warm from him do i have any choice she wondered aloud chapter nine over the next week serena immersed herself in the routine of the comanche it was she decided her first major investment that hadnt been carefully chosen by her father and one she was determined to understand intimately she didnt mind a few speculative looks the occasional murmured word behind a hand as she inspected the public rooms or pored over the books and files and records she expected them she spent her days learning the hotel from top to bottom her evenings in the casino or her office in the capacity as manager the nights she spent alone in justins suite over the week she discovered two things the comanche was a slickly run organization that catered to people who had money to spend it gave its clientele the best for a price and second justins absence was a blessing in disguise she had little time to miss him with her hours packed with things to do only late at night when she found herself alone did serena fully realize how much shed grown to depend on him for a word a touch his presence but alone she had the opportunity to prove to herself and to her staff that she was born competent and serious about running the hotel serena made the most of it her background served her well over the years shed become accustomed to patronizing fine hotels and knew what a client looked for from checkin to checkout her year on the celebration had given her another perspective she understood the problems that plagued the staff from fatigue to boredom to shortage in the linen count the first day she had won over nero and kate by the second serena had swayed the chef the night manager and the housekeeper she considered each one a major victory behind the trim pecan desk in her office serena went over the current weeks schedule of her croupiers directly in front of her the panel was open giving her a broad view of the casino she found she enjoyed the twin feelings of isolation and companionship since the day had barely started by casino standards she planned to give her paperwork another two hours knowing if she were needed the buzzer on her desk would sound lighting up the location of the trouble then shed work the floor if she kept busy until weariness took over she wouldnt be tempted to pick up the phone and dial justins number in vegas he was a man who needed room who didnt make promises or expect them if she were to win in the end serena knew she couldnt forget that if she were patient there might come a time when hed be comfortable loving her with a quick laugh she shook her head shed never be comfortable loving him nor did she choose to be rubbing the back of her neck serena frowned down at the schedule it could be made less complicated she mused if they hired one more croupier as a floater that would make the hours a bit more flexible and yes come in without glancing up serena continued to look over the list with a floater to pick up the slack she mused she could juggle the shifts then suddenly a spray of violets landed on the paper in front of her i thought that might get your attention feeling her heartbeat speed serena looked up justin she was out of her chair and racing into his arms before either of them expected it as his mouth came down to hers he realized it was the first time hed seen that spontaneous unrestricted joy on her face and it was for him the fatigue of a long flight the tension of a week melted from him what is it about a woman he asked her that makes it so good to hold one smiling she tilted her head back the closer study of his face brought concern you look tired her fingers rose to smooth away the lines of strain around his mouth ive never seen you look tired before was it very bad ive spent more pleasant weeks he drew her back to him wanting to fill himself with the feel of her the scent later he thought hed tell her of the neatly printed note hed received another threat without detail or reasons just a promise that it wasnt over i did what you asked he added running a hand over the smooth flesh the low back of her dress exposed mmm what i was miserable without you she didnt laugh as he had expected but tightened her arms around his neck fighting back tears she pressed her lips to his throat you didnt call i waited for you to call she whispered appalled by her words serena pushed out of his arms swallowing tears and shaking her head no i didnt mean that the way it sounded i know you were busy she lifted her hands then helplessly let them fall and and so was i there were a million things she turned to shuffle papers on her desk were both adults and independent the last thing we need is to start putting chains on each other you ramble when youre nervous justin commented whirling serena glared at him with hot furious eyes dont make fun of me odd that i would have missed that killing look he said as he came to her taking her face in his hands he held it gently his eyes on hers serena felt her anger drain to leave her weak and pulsing serena he said on a sigh as his mouth closed over hers the tender kiss grew hungry quickly she felt the need pour out of him to match her own as their lips clung parting only to seek new angles deeper pleasures longings of a week intensified so that there were two pairs of hot avid lips searching two pairs of urgent hands roaming on a jerky breath justin crushed her against him no woman he thought dimly had ever made him suffer like this oh god i want you serena i want you so that i cant think of anything but having you she pressed her cheek against his but the movements behind the glass caught her eye this is silly she admitted but i feel exposed on a shaky laugh she drew back but the look in his eyes had her heart thudding again why dont you close the panel she whispered and make love to me the knock on the door brought a groan from her on a long breath justin drew her away until he held her lightly by the shoulders i forgot i brought you a present tell them to go away serena suggested and give it to me later she brought her hands to his much later the knock came again come on justin youve had your ten minutes caine justin watched surprise and pleasure race across serenas face caine kissing her nose he let his hands drop away from her why dont you go let them in dashing to the door serena wrenched it open caine alan with a whoop of laughter she launched herself at both of them what are you doing here she demanded kissing them both wont the state and federal governments collapse even public servants need a few days off now and then caine retorted then held serena at arms length hed changed so little she thought though both her brothers had inherited their fathers height caine was lean and rangy nearly thin serena mused now with sisterly objectivity yet he had a fascinating face all planes and angles with a powerful grin he used to his advantage and eyes nearly as dark as her own his hair waved carelessly around his face blond with hints of red looking at him she could easily see why it was reputed his skill with women equalled his skill as a lawyer hmm she hasnt turned out too badly has she alan with an arched brow serena turned to her oldest brother no he answered giving her the slow serious smile that suited his dark brooding looks he looks more like heathcliff she thought than a us senator though shes still a bit scrawny he took her chin in his fingers turning her face right and left pretty girl he stated in a perfect imitation of their fathers burr maybe you should have married arlene judson after all she said sweetly then relenting she wrapped an arm around each of her brothers oh im so glad to see you justin sat on the corner of serenas desk and watched them she looked very small between the two tall men but for the first time he noted the resemblance between her and caine the shape of the mouth the nose the eyes alan was a larger rougher version of anna yet all three of them carried daniels stamp it seemed so clear now justin wondered that he hadnt recognized it the first moment hed seen her perhaps it was seeing them as a family picturing serena as a sister he thought of diana and felt a twinge of regret hed done all he could there justin reminded himself still hed never known what it was like to have that basic lifetime kinship any more than hed ever have the place in serenas heart that belonged to family how long are you staying serena demanded as she pulled them both inside the office just over the weekend alan told her as caine took a quick thorough study of her office so youve taken yourself a partner after all he said to justin we were all a bit surprised after youd turned dad down so often i was more persuasive serena said simply caine shot justin a look that didnt ask questions only because he already knew the answers there was warning in it subtle but perfectly clear you still havent told me what youre doing here like this she walked over to stand beside justin as caine folded himself into a chair and alan moved to glance through the glass we heard about the bomb threat in vegas alan told her i gave justin a call he suggested you might enjoy a visit and he turned with one of his rare grins caine and i thought our coming might keep dad from putting in an appearance for a while last time i talked to him caine said he was hinting he might enjoy a few weeks at the beach serena made a sound that was somewhere between a groan and a laugh i suppose you heard about his last little plot it seems to have worked out well enough alan stated as he watched justins hand come up to rest on the back of her neck i was tempted to break more than a few cigars she muttered then glanced down at the buzzer on her desk as it sounded table six no she said touching justins shoulder as he started to rise ill take care of it why dont the three of you go upstairs and relax ill be up as soon as im sure everything is settled down here is it unethical for me to gamble here now that youre half owner caine wondered aloud not as long as you play as poorly as usual serena answered as she swept out of the door with a quick oath caine stretched out his long legs just because i used to let her beat me at poker let her win hell alan said mildly she used to massacre you you didnt say much on the phone justin he continued as he turned away from the twoway mirror can you discuss what happened in vegas with a shrug justin drew a cigar out of his pocket it was a homemade bomb very compact it was under one of the keno tables the fbis running down the list of former employees regulars whove dropped large amounts of money any known extortionists with a similar mo i dont have too much faith in that there were some threatening calls but they couldnt trace them and i didnt recognize the voice they dont have much to go on as he lit the cigar his gaze wandered past alans shoulder to where serena stood talking to a customer its impossible to trace everyone whos lost money in one of my casinos even if that is the motive behind the bombing you dont think it was caine asked and followed justins gaze out to his sister just a hunch he muttered then rose restlessly there was a threat delivered a couple of days ago nothing specific just enough to let me know hed try something else no wheres whens or hows caine put in no justin gave him a grim smile of course i could close down all of my hotels and wait him out he took a quick savage drag on the cigar im damned if i will with an effort he controlled the impotent fury he was being stalked he knew it just as surely as if hed seen the shadow behind him i want serena to go home until this is resolved he said briefly between the two of you you should be able to convince her caines answer was a short laugh alan gave justin a quiet look shed go he said if you went with her damn it alan im not going to go find a convenient hole and hide while someone plays with my life and serena would he countered she has a half interest in one out of five of my hotels justin said tightly if anything happens to this one the insurance covers her losses his eyes were drawn to the glass again ive more than an investment at stake youre a fool if you think thats all rena has alan murmured justin whirled on him giving way to all the pentup anger hed harnessed for a week i tell you i have a bad feeling about this someones after me and shes too close i want her away safe where nothing can happen to her id think youd understand that for gods sake shes your sister and what is she to you caine asked softly furious justin turned on him a hundred curses trembling on his lips he met the dark direct eyes so much like serenas everything he breathed before he turned back to the glass damn it shes everything well thats settled serena said as she swirled back into the office i just she trailed off as the tension rose up like a wall slowly she looked from one man to the other then walked by her brothers to justin what is it nothing forcing himself to be calm he tapped out his cigar and took her hand have you had dinner no but deliberately he looked past her to alan and caine well have something brought upstairs unless youd prefer the dining room actually i think ill try my luck outside caine rose casually alan can keep me from dropping a months pay got any tips rena stick to the quarter slots she said and made her lips curve o ye of little faith he muttered and tugged on her ear well see you tomorrow late tomorrow alan put in as he opened the door ill never get him away from the tables before three serena waited until the door shut behind them justin whats going on im tired he said taking her arm lets go upstairs justin im not a fool he led her quickly through to his office and into the elevator it felt like something was about to explode when i walked in there are you angry with alan and caine no its nothing that concerns you the cold flat answer had her stiffening in defence justin im not trying to pry into your personal business but as it appeared to involve my brothers i feel entitled to an explanation he recognized the hurt and the anger he wanted to drive them both away drag her into his arms and stop her questions in a way that would erase his own temper and tension but as the elevator doors slid open justin forced himself to think coolly he could use the anger and hurt for his own ends its nothing that concerns you he repeated carelessly why dont you order something from roomservice i want a shower without waiting for her answer he strode off too stunned by his tone to react serena only stared after him what had changed since that desperate tempestuous greeting they had shared why was he treating her like a stranger or worse she realized like a comfortable mistress a man could take or brush aside at his whim standing in the centre of the room serena tried to summon up fury but found only anguish shed known the risk she was taking it seemed shed lost the gamble no bunching her hands into fists she shook her head no she wasnt so easily dismissed let him have his shower and his meal she decided then she would explain to him exactly what she expected calmly she added to herself as she walked to the phone shed be very calm with a vicious stab of her finger she punched the button for room service this is ms macgregor id like a steak and salad of course ms macgregor how would you like your steak burnt she muttered pardon with an effort she got herself under control its for i mr blade she explained im sure you know what he likes of course ms macgregor ill have his dinner sent up right away thank you everyone jumps for justin blade she thought grimly as she replaced the receiver walking to the bar she fixed herself a tall stiff drink when justin came out of the bedroom serena was sitting on the sofa while the room service waiter arranged justins meal on the table across the room justin wore only a robe which parted at the throat when he dipped his hands into his pockets arent you eating he asked with a nod toward the single place setting no she sipped her drink you go right ahead opening her purse she drew out a bill then held it out to the waiter thank you thank you ms macgregor enjoy your meal mr blade when the door shut behind him justin took his seat i thought you hadnt had dinner im not hungry she said simply with a shrug justin applied himself to the salad and tasted nothing apparently there were no major problems while i was gone nothing i couldnt handle though i do have a few personal suggestions i feel the hotel and the casino run very smoothly you made a good investment he sliced through the meat you could look at it that way serena draped an arm over the back of the couch her beaded jacket shimmered in the quiet light looking at her justin wanted nothing more than to drag it off her and the thin black silk she wore beneath to lose himself in her again the soft white skin the masses of gold hair he stabbed a piece of steak with his fork the hotel seems to have gotten over the hump in this last year he said easily it seems unnecessary for both of us to give it twentyfour hours a day unable to swallow any more he poured coffee you might want to think about going back home she held the glass halfway to her lips home she repeated dully youre not needed here at the moment he went on it occurred to me that it would be more practical for you to go home or wherever you like then come back and take over when i have to be away i see blindly she set the glass on the table in front of her and rose ive no intention of falling into the category of silent partner justin her voice was strong and clear but from across the room he could see her eyes swim nor do i have the intention of falling into the category of excess baggage its a very simple matter to go back to our original agreement and forget a onenight mistake because she could feel her hand begin to tremble she reached for her drink again and drained it ill pack my things and move back into my own suite damn it serena i want you to go home watching her fight back tears he felt something twist inside his stomach in defence justin pushed away from the table and strode down to her i dont want you here he heard her quick indrawn breath but the mist in her eyes cleared with it he found the dryeyed wounded look a hundred times worse theres no need to be cruel justin she murmured youve made yourself clear ill get out of your rooms but i own half this hotel and im staying i havent signed the agreement yet he reminded her she stared at him for a long silent moment youre that desperate to get rid of me she murmured my mistake serena stared down at the empty glass in her hands if id been smarter i wouldnt have slept with you until it was finalized enraged he grabbed the glass from her hand and hurled it across the room where it shattered against the wall no dragging her against him he buried his face in her hair and swore again i cant do it this way i wont let you think that rigid with hurt serena didnt struggle please let me go serena listen to me listen to me he repeated as he drew her away with his hands tight on her shoulders there was a letter delivered before i left vegas it was addressed to me personally whoever planted that bomb wanted me to know he wasnt finished hes going to hit me again sometime somewhere theres more than money involved i can feel it its personal do you understand youre not safe with me she stared at him as the words cut through the pain you said those things to me because you think i might be in some kind of danger if i stay i want you to be away from this reaching up serena pushed his hands from her shoulders youre no better than my father she said furiously arranging my life with your little plots and schemes do you know what you did to me tears threatened again and she forced them back do you know how you hurt me did you ever consider just telling me the truth ive told you he retorted struggling against waves of guilt and need now will you go no serena for gods sake you expect me to pack my bags and run she interrupted shoving at him in frustration to hide because someone might plant a bomb in the hotel sometime why dont you just ask me to find a nice little glass ball somewhere and take up residence damn it justin i have as much at stake in this as you do the hotels fully covered by insurance if anything happened you wouldnt lose your investment she closed her eyes on a sigh you idiot serena be reasonable when her eyes opened the fury was back in them youre being reasonable i suppose i dont give a damn if im being reasonable or not he tossed back i want you somewhere where i know nothing can touch you you cant know anything i know that i love you he grabbed her again shaking her i know that you mean more to me than anything else in my life and im not going to take any chances then how can you ask me to go away she shouted people in love belong together they stared at each other as each realized what had been said justins grip gentled then his hands dropped away do this for me serena anything else she answered not this turning he paced to the window outside the sun was sinking into the sea flashes of fire streaks of gold just like the woman behind him ive never loved anyone justin murmured my parents my sister perhaps but theyve been out of my life a long time i managed without them i dont think i could manage without you even the thought that something might happen terrifies me justin going to him serena wrapped her arms around him and pressed her cheek to his back you know therere no guarantees only odds ive played the odds all my life not with you i still make my own choices she reminded him you cant change that justin i cant let you tell me again she demanded before he could answer and this time dont shout it at me im as susceptible to romance as the next person when he turned back to her justin traced the curve of her lips with his fingertip i always thought i love you sounded so ordinary until now he replaced his fingertip with his lips with the same gentle touch i love you serena she sighed as she felt him slip the jacket from her shoulders justin she murmured when he lifted her into his arms hmm lets not tell my father i hate it when he gloats laughing he lowered her to the bed he was going to love her gently it seemed right somehow when he remembered the hurt in her eyes she was precious to him vital to his life a permanent part of his thoughts soft and already warm she drew him to her he was going to love her gently but she drove him mad her hands were already pushing his robe aside moving over his skin her lips were already racing over his face nipping at his teasing tormenting demanding justin swore as he pulled the dress down her body and the sound of her low husky laughter pushed him over the edge perhaps he hurt her he couldnt control his hands they were wild to touch to possess but she only arched beneath him wanton with abandon until her blood roared like thunder in his ears he murmured mindlessly in the tongue of his ancestors threats promises phrases of love and war he could no longer separate serena heard the harsh quiet words words both primitive and erotic when whispered against her skin there was nothing of the smooth sophisticated gambler in him now but something fierce and untamed and he was hers she thought wildly as his hands bruised over her she smelled his rich male scent a scent undiluted by colognes and buried her face against his shoulder wanting to absorb it but his hunger would allow her no leisure hot and open his mouth crushed down on hers demanding not surrender but aggression desire me he seemed to say need me she answered with a torrent of passion that left them both gasping she thought hed shown her everything there was to know everything there was to have in their first night of loving how could there be so much more with still a promise of secrets as yet undiscovered he seemed to have a depthless well of energy and need as he had from the very beginning he challenged her to match it he touched her and a hundred small violent explosions erupted inside her as her body shuddered from them all her girlhood imaginings of lovemaking the tender words the soft touches paled into insignificance this is what shed been meant for the tempest and the fury with mouths desperately clinging they joined into one wild insatiable form with her eyes still closed serena stretched luxuriously oh god i feel wonderful even to her own ears her voice sounded like the purr of a contented cat ive often thought so justin agreed and ran a hand down the length of her with a laugh she sat up stretching her arms high over her head in the half light he watched her hair tumble over her naked back as it arched no i really do if it werent for the fact that im starving you said you werent hungry he reminded her reaching up he hooked an arm around her waist and brought her falling back onto the bed i wasnt she rolled on top of him now i am after nibbling kisses over his face she nipped at his lip famished you can have the rest of my steak its cold she complained with a sultry laugh she pressed her mouth to his throat cant you think of something else i admire your spirit he said bringing her lips back to his after running a hand down her hair he cradled her head on his shoulder want me to call room service she let out a long contented breath in a little while i love you justin as he closed his eyes his arms tightened around her i wondered if youd get around to telling me that didnt i mention it smiling serena propped herself on his chest hows this i love you she began punctuating her words with kisses i adore you im fascinated by you i lust for you it might do for a start taking her hand to his lips he kissed her fingers slowly serena no quickly she pressed her hand over his mouth dont ask me again im not going anywhere and i dont want to fight with you justin not now not tonight she touched her cheek to his it seems like ive waited all my life to feel like this everything up to this moment seems like a prelude it sounds crazy but i think i knew the first minute i looked up and saw you that everything was going to change she laughed again and drew away and i thought i was much too intellectually sound to believe in love at first sight your intellect he told her slowed things down considerably on the contrary she said with a haughty smile it moved them along beautifully i came here with the idea of becoming your partner so that we could deal on equal terms while i convinced you you couldnt live without me did you she grinned down at him it worked you might be a bit too cocky serena giving her hair a tug he rose from the bed where are you going to let a little air out of your balloon opening a drawer justin drew out a small box i picked this up for you in st thomas a present scrambling up on her knees she held out her hand i live for presents greedy little witch he said as he dropped the box into her outstretched hand her chuckle faded into silence as she opened it twin pinwheels of amethysts and diamonds gleamed up at her catching fire even in the dim light of dusk she remembered how they had looked in the sunlit window where she had first seen them hesitantly she touched one with her finger as if the heat were real and not just an illusion in the stones justin theyre gorgeous she whispered as she raised her eyes to his but why because they suited you and you wouldnt indulge yourself and he dropped a hand to her cheek i already decided i wasnt going to let you walk out of my life if you hadnt come here id have brought you willing or not she asked with the beginnings of a smile i warned you its an old tradition in my family he tucked her hair behind her ears put them on ive wondered how theyd look on you serena took them out of the box and clipped them to her ears still kneeling on the bed she caught her hair back in her hand i want to see justin stopped her with no more than a look her skin was pale and flawless her hair when her hand slowly dropped tumbled wildly wearing no more than a glitter of jewels at her ears she looked like an exotic fantasy the flare of desire in his eyes touched off one in her own as her lips parted she held out her arms to him chapter ten serena stretched luxuriously and contemplated getting up if justin hadnt already gone downstairs the idea of lazing away the morning in bed would have been more appealing she lay in the centre of the tangle of sheets the spot they had shared wrapped close throughout the night he was still worried she mused even though hed whispered nothing more than a few foolish endearments into her ear before he had left her serena had sensed the controlled tension in him as long as justin was convinced the bomb planted in vegas had been a direct threat against him personally and a prelude of more there was nothing serena could do to soothe him she could only stay close trying to convince him she was in no danger that she could look after herself men serena thought with a small smile no matter how liberal they simply couldnt accept the fact that women could take care of themselves the last thing she was going to do was sit in massachusetts while the man she loved sat in new jersey it wasnt logical serena told herself as she pulled herself out of bed she believed exactly what she had shouted at justin the night before people in love belonged together justin wasnt likely to relax fully until the police caught whoever had planted the bomb and that could take months if indeed he were ever caught he might have given up completely when his plans were ruined or he could wait days weeks months before striking again taking a robe out of the closet she considered that possibility then shrugged off the unease whether they caught him or not serena didnt share justins certainty that the man would try again the note had probably been sent out of frustration after the extortionists plans had fallen apart that made more sense than someone with a personal vendetta against justin he wasnt being objective serena decided as she belted the robe the hotels were so much a part of him he couldnt see them as an outsider would buildings worth a great deal of money the man had played his hand and lost he had to know the authorities would be investigating and that justin would tighten his own security cowards plant bombs she told herself a coward isnt going to risk getting caught in time justin would see the logic when she heard the knock on the door serena automatically checked the bedside clock too early for the maid she reflected as she walked into the living room now who would be her hand paused on the knob as all of justins words of the night before ran through her head someones after me youre not safe suddenly uneasy serena peered through the peephole there you see she told herself as her nerves drained away its just foolishness opening the door she grinned at her brother you must have lost quickly last night if youre up this early she commented caine stared at her a moment before he stepped into the room its not that early he countered glancing around i came up to see justin youve just missed him serena closed the door and tossed back her sleeptumbled hair he went down to his office about fifteen minutes ago wheres alan caines affection for justin was warring with the fact that serena was his sister his baby sister damn it he thought and she was standing in justins private suite wearing nothing but the short silk robe hed given her last christmas hes just having breakfast caine told her as he prowled around the room well you were always the one to be up and about in the morning serena remembered i always thought it was a disgusting habit want some coffee its one of the few essentials stocked in the kitchen yeah sure still dealing with the shock of realizing he had harboured the illusion that his sister was exclusively his sister caine followed her the kitchen was roomy and striking the floor and walls were white the cabinets glossy black serena plugged in the percolator as she gestured toward the breakfast bar with her free hand sit down you seem to know your way around caine heard himself saying she sent him an infuriatingly amused look i live here annoyed caine slid onto a stool at the bar justin certainly works fast thats quite a chauvinistic remark for the liberal states attorney serena commented as she measured out coffee from another point of view it could be said i work fast you met him only a month ago caine turning around serena cocked her head do you remember luke dennison who he was the local stud when i was fifteen she reminded him you cornered him in the parking lot of the movie theater and told him if he ever put his hands on me youd break all the small vital bones in his body she watched caines grin flash as he remembered he never did did he no then she walked over to him and grabbed both his ears im not fifteen anymore caine and justin isnt luke dennison leaning over he grabbed her ears in turn applying enough pressure to bring her closer i love you be told her and kissed her quick and hard then be happy for me justins everything i want releasing her caine sat back he said the same thing about you he saw the pleasure darken her eyes when yesterday when he asked alan and me to talk you into going home for a while caine lifted a hand as the pleasure turned to temper dont go for the jugular rena we both declined serena let out her breath in a quick huff justins convinced whoever planted that bomb had more than extortion money as a motive because of that he has it fixed in his head that im not safe with him frustrated she gestured widely with both hands he just wont be logical or practical about the whole business he loves you the storm around her stilled instantly i know all the more reason for me to stay with him tell me she leaned back against the counter to watch him what would you do if i were justin id do my damnedest to make you leave if i were you he continued smoothly before she could start to yell i wouldnt budge nothing worse than the analytical legal mind serena murmured as the coffee perked well why dont you tell me what youve been doing with yourself any fascinating new ladies or is your work cramping your style i manage to eke out a little time for recreation he commented and earned a snort as serena took down two mugs ive decided to go back to private practice you have surprised she turned back isnt that rather sudden not really he accepted the mug of black coffee ive been thinking about it for some time alans the politician hes got the patience for it shrugging caine sipped at his coffee i miss the courtroom bureaucracy doesnt give me enough time for it i always loved to watch you argue a case serena remembered taking her seat on the opposite side of the bar there was something deadly about your style like a wolf circling a fire and losing patience caine laughed theres that flighty macgregor imagination surfacing again casting aspersions on the family name alan asked from the kitchen doorway serena turned to him with a quick warm smile the look altered subtly as she shifted her eyes to the man beside her brother alan complained that hed been deserted justin commented any more of that coffee i just made it she held out her hand to him as he entered taking it justin brushed a kiss over her fingers before he moved to the coffeepot alan he was looking at his sister yes thanks caine hasnt told me how much he lost last night serena began as alan leaned on the counter oh his luck wasnt all that bad he sent his brother a shrewd look which caine returned blandly serena arched a brow you better not have been trying your luck with any of my dealers she warned caine the little blonde alan supplied with a flashing grin with the big brown eyes caine serena sent him a look of astonished amusement shes barely twentyone i dont know what hes talking about calmly caine sipped his coffee alan was busy trying to impress some redhead in half a dress with his views on foreign policy well serena turned to justin as he brought over fresh coffee it seems to me that neither the staff nor the customers are safe if we let these two loose you can keep an eye on them tonight at the dinner show justin handed alan a mug before he opened the refrigerator for cream i should have warned you serena told her brothers as she linked her hand with justins he has a habit of making arrangements without consulting anyone but i for one she added smiling at him would love to go to the dinner show lena maxwells opening tonight she mused looking down at her nails i suppose justin could be persuaded to introduce her if you two would like to come what times dinner alan and caine asked together laughing serena rose pitiful dangle a sexy brunette in front of their noses and theyll follow you anywhere ive got to shower and change she stood on her toes and brushed justins mouth with hers ill be downstairs in a half hour as she walked from the room she heard caines question just where is lena maxwell rehearsing this afternoon justin while she showered serena found herself laughing if caine got it into his head to track down lena maxwell he wouldnt need justins introduction to charm his way into a personal conversation with her caine macgregor had more than his fair share of charm she thought again of his reaction when he found her in justins suite it was rather endearing really she decided and she hadnt missed the long quiet look alan had given her when he had walked into the kitchen with justin as soon as her brothers were alone she concluded they would discuss her relationship with justin probably argue a bit about it then give her their unqualified support it had always been that way among the three of them for a moment with the water streaming hot over her body serena felt a wave of regret for justin he had never really known the security the bond the frustration of family ties perhaps with time he would let her show him perhaps one day they would have children deliberately serena stuck her head under the spray she was getting ahead of herself far ahead he loved her but that didnt mean he was looking for marriage and children hed been solitary for so long and their love was so new children would mean a home and hed never chosen to make one hed chosen a lifestyle without permanence and the nomad in him had been and was part of his attraction for her it was foolish to start dreaming about changes when theyd barely lived fortyeight hours under the same roof yet hed spoken of his sister twice and both times serena had sensed a hint of regret justin hadnt turned his back on his family but had been forced by circumstances to do without if one day he wanted one serena promised herself shed be there for him stepping from the shower serena flicked on the overhead heat lamp then wrapped her hair in a towel she began to hum as she rubbed scented lotion over her skin briefly she ran over the scheduling shed outlined for herself that day and decided she could accomplish everything before she needed to change for the dinner show but not if she stood loitering in the bathroom all day she reminded herself as she slipped into her robe unwinding the towel from her hair she walked back into the bedroom as the door from the living room swung open she gasped in surprise justin dragging a hand through her hair serena let out her bream you gave me a start i thought youd gone dipping his hands into his pockets he looked at her slowly from her toes to the crown of her head no why was it she wondered that hes seen and touched every part of my body but he can look at me like that and turn me to jelly alan and caine gone down to compete for lena i believe lord i hate to miss that she thought aloud as she walked to the closet what are you doing well im getting dressed she returned with a laugh what does it look like im doing seems like a waste of time since im just going to take whatever you put on off you again she sent him an arched look over her shoulder somehow i think kate might find it odd if i walked into the office wearing my robe he gave her a slow cool smile youre not getting out of this room justin dont be ridiculous with another laugh serena began to poke through the clothes in the closet i have a dozen things to do before dinner and the rest of the words caught in her throat then came out as a whoosh of air as he tossed her onto the mattress standing above her he nodded i like the way you look in a rumpled bed oh really serena pushed herself up to her knees well id like to know where you got the idea you could throw me around as she stuck her hands on her hips her loosened robe fell off one shoulder its not the first time she went on remembering her dunking in the ocean but if you think you can make a habit i know nobody pushes a macgregor around he murmured as he hooked a finger in the opening of her robe thats right she pushed his hand away and succeeded in widening the gap down her front so just remember that the next time you get a wild urge to toss me around i will sorry with an apologetic smile he held out his hand though wary serena accepted it as she started to climb back out of the bed in an instant she was on her back pinned under him justin fighting against laughter she pushed at him will you stop i have to get dressed uhuh you have to get undressed let me help you with one long gesture of his hand he parted her robe completely stop amused frustrated and aroused she struggled against him justin i mean it the maid could walk in here any minute she wont be coming until this evening he found a spot low on her ribs and felt a thrill of pleasure as she moaned i called housekeeping you with a new spurt of energy she tried to wrest free you did it again she nearly managed to get her arms free before he pinned them didnt it occur to you that i might have had plans that perhaps i dont want to spend the afternoon in bed with you i figured the odds were good that i could persuade you he countered easily oh she kicked out tangling her legs with his as she wiggled under him okay well wrestle first best three out of five this isnt funny she said swallowing a giggle i mean it deadly serious he rolled her over until she was on top of him thats one apiece before she could catch her breath she was back under him and two for me oh sure serena blew the wet hair out of her eyes a real even match when im half naked and youre fully dressed youre right he covered her face with quick teasing kisses why dont you do something about that my hands are busy she moaned involuntarily as they ran down her body foul she said breathlessly justin stop he asked halfheartedly his eyes intent on her face as he let his fingertips do the persuading no tangling her fingers in his hair she brought his mouth down to hers it was always the same always unique every time his lips met hers she felt that enervating shock of heat her bones would soften with exquisite slowness until she thought her body was one warm fluid mass yet the thrill was always fresh as though it were happening for the first time forgetting his request that she undress him serena went lax with the first flood of pleasure justin felt her surrender a surrender he knew was only a prelude to her breathless excitement and frantic demands he enjoyed the brief heady power of total control she was his now a strong vital woman who for a few precious moments would be like putty in his hands the knowledge made him gentle so that he caressed with more tenderness than he had believed himself capable of did love make so much difference he wondered as he ran long lean fingers over her skin his lips touched hers muffling her soft sound of enjoyment her eyes not quite closed met his when he traced the shape of her mouth with his tongue her lids fluttered he rubbed his lips over hers savouring the taste then found that his hands had stilled his whole being seemed focused on the meeting of mouth to mouth the power he had felt became a vulnerability no less of a surrender than serena had given him he felt weak with it and fearless i love you he murmured against her mouth i didnt know how much the kiss was deep and slow and more arousing than anything hed ever known then her tongue sought his moving through his lips to draw in all the tastes and flavours as a shudder passed through him he knew her surrender was over serena slipped the soft wool of his sweater up his torso over his shoulders so that their lips were forced to part but only briefly her hands were busy touching rubbing demanding he could see them in his minds eye smooth and white against his darker skin the glossy feminine nails scraping over him in excitement he moved his lips to her shoulder to nip gently and was assaulted by her scent it made him think of sultry summer nights wild loving in high green grass he ran kisses grown more desperate to the inside of her elbow where her rapid pulse only intensified the fragrance as he buried his mouth against the pale blueveined skin her body arched tossed by passion serena rolled to him so that they were side by side then locked her arms around him she didnt feel the tangle of sheets beneath her the cool silk of her robe that had slipped down to her legs all she felt was his hard hot body against hers and the moist tingling path his mouth streaked over her as he slid down she urged him toward all the secret places hed discovered for both of them no one else would ever bring her this torrid wanton hunger it filled her consumed her made her strong with a sudden burst of energy she was on top of him her mouth greedy her hands quick and clever he groaned gripping her wet sleek hair the sound only made her move over him more urgently hes beautiful so beautiful was all she could think as she touched and tasted again a light film of sweat glistened on his dark skin serena could taste the saltiness of it as she roamed over the hard smooth chest the lean line of ribs marred by the jagged scar the narrow longboned hips then his hands gripped her dragging her up until his mouth was fastened on hers she drew in the mingling flavour of their tastes until her head swam with it her body seemed to act without her knowledge sliding down until she took him inside of her the sensation rocketed through her causing her to cry out as she arched back but he rose up with her his hands still gripping her hair his mouth still fused to hers she couldnt breathe but even as she fought for air her body set up its own raging rhythm her arms were locked around him his around her the mutual grip tightened convulsively as they reached the sharp airless summit then as one form they slid back to the bed to lay gasping i cant seem to get enough of you justin managed in a whisper never enough dont serena let her head slip limply to his shoulder dont ever get enough they lay quietly as breathing settled and trembles eased with her palm over his heart she could feel the pounding beat become slow strong and steady theres only you justin said feeling the sudden fierceness of love theres only you in my life serena lifted her head to look down at him love that is not madness is not love smiling she traced the line of his cheekbone i never understood that until now i know i never want to be sane again he brought her finger to his lips so the brainy serena macgregor chooses insanity wrinkling her nose she folded her elbows over his chest no need to bring my brain into it it fascinates me justin told her and its one part of you i havent really explored just how smart are you she lifted a brow that she said primly is an abstract question ah youre going to be evasive grinning he brushed her hair away from her shoulders how many degrees do you have your first question doesnt have anything to do with your second how smart are you smart enough to know when im getting the runaround he said mildly no burning desire to go into law or politics like your brothers no my only burning desire was to learn then i had a burning desire to be doing now she bit his lower lip i have more basic burning desires hmm he allowed himself the pleasure of feasting on her mouth a moment dont you feel that running a gambling hotel is a bit of a waste of your education of course not my educations mine ill always have it whatever i choose to do what good are degrees if youre not enjoying life with a sigh she lay across his chest again i didnt study so that i could pile up little pieces of paper suitable for framing but because i was curious why do you ran hotels because im good at it serena grinned at him and thats the exact reason i nearly became a professional student but it was becoming too repetitious and too easy therere challenges here every day and a constant variety of people and she added smugly im good at it too nero thinks you have class now serenas smile was just as smug as her voice hes very perceptive why didnt you make him manager he wasnt interested justin began to run a hand up and down her spine he likes his position as unofficial troubleshooter ill be sending him to malta next year youve bought the casino then i will have soon enough thoughtful he studied her face i was considering taking on a partner he saw the smile light in her eyes just before her lips curved were you then i suppose i should put in my bid right away he cupped his hand around the back of her neck the sooner the better he murmured as he brought her lips to his when the phone rang he swore ripely serena laughed and nuzzled against his throat as he reached for it blade listening to kates quiet shaking voice he fought to keep the tension out of his body serena would feel it all right kate ill be down after hanging up he kissed the crown of serenas head somethings come up downstairs she gave a resigned sigh thats the trouble with living where you work rolling over she stretched well i really should go down myself you havent had a day off in over a week dressing justin wondered if he was wiser to leave her there or to keep her with him downstairs he decided shed be better off in the penthouse relax for a while ill be back up soon why dont you order some lunch the thought of having him to herself all afternoon was too appealing serena closed her mind to the paperwork on her desk all right an hour yes fine preoccupied he headed for the elevator kate was waiting for him when he stepped off silently she handed justin a plain white envelope steve found it lying on the front desk as soon as i saw it she trailed off then got control of herself its just like the one you got in vegas isnt it yes justin answered flatly as he studied the carefully executed block letters that spelled out his name he had a quick savage urge to simply rip it into pieces but he took a letter opener from his desk and carefully slit one edge sliding the note out he unfolded it its not over yet you have a price to pay call security he told kate as he read the words a second time then he let out his breath on one violent oath and the police chapter eleven serena pulled a black angora sweater over her head it would feel good to be lazy for a day she decided to lounge around the suite in comfortable clothes and do absolutely nothing she and justin hadnt spent a full day together since st thomas that made her think of the earrings justin had given her shed wear them tonight serena mused as she opened the top drawer of the dresser to draw out the box theyre exquisite she thought as she looked at them again all the more exquisite because he had bought them for her then before they had been lovers what a strange man he is she reflected so cool in some ways so introspective yet he was capable of such incredibly sweet gestures the violets in her room the first day champagne for breakfast and underneath it all there was that latent controlled streak of violence all those aspects of him excited her how smart are you serena laughed as she remembered justins question smart enough to know im a very lucky woman she answered silently reaching into the drawer again she drew out a twoheaded quarter shed picked up while justin had been in vegas with a grin serena examined it then slipped it into the pocket of her jeans and smart enough to keep an ace up my sleeve she added with a gleam of mischief in her eye as she glanced at her reflection in the mirror serenas grin turned to a look of astonishment her hair had dried in a tangled and unruly mop around her face what a mess she thought as she picked up her brush well shed do something about it before she called room service it would serve justin right if he had to wait for his lunch she added as she tugged painfully at the knots in her hair bending from the waist she let her hair fall forward then gritted her teeth and brushed the underside ouch just a minute she called out at the quick quiet knock on the door either caine or alan had struck out with lena maxwell she thought with a smirk as she headed for the door still brushing her hair dont expect me to fix you up with oh housekeeping a slim boy of about twenty gave her a shy smile justin must have decided to have them clean before lunch she concluded typical he might have called to let her know i can come back later if oh no im sorry i was thinking of something else serena gave him a smile as she opened the door wide enough for him to roll the maids cart inside youre new arent you yes maam this is my first day that explains the nervous swallowing she decided and made her smile warmer just relax and take your time she advised him ill stay out of your way gesturing with her brush she turned away why dont you start in the kitchen while i something clamped over her mouth and nose too stunned to be frightened serena grabbed at the hand as she drew her breath to shout she inhaled something strong and cloyingly sweet that made her head spin recognizing the scent she began to struggle more frantically fighting the mists that were whirling in front of her eyes oh god no her arms dropped heavily to her sides the brush slipped from her limp fingers justin the desk clerk found it on the counter justin told lieutenant renicki apparently no one saw who put it there it was during checkout time and the desk staff was busy yes well hes not a fool the police lieutenant picked up the plain sheet of stationery by the corner and slipped it into a plastic bag ill have to turn this over to the bureau i imagine but for now ill leave a few plainclothesmen in the hotel ive my own security stationed in all the public rooms lieutenant renicki lifted both of his bushy greying brows in acknowledgment doesnt like dealing with me he decided oh hes a cool one he watched justin light a cigar with rocksteady hands not much gets under that ones skin got any enemies mr blade justin shot him a mild look apparently anyone specific you want to tell me about no is this the first threat youve received since you got back from nevada yes lieutenant renicki suppressed a sigh characters like blade made him feel like a dentist yanking at a reluctant tooth hired or fired anyone recently for an answer justin pushed his intercom kate check with personnel see who weve put on or let go in the last two months then get a printout from the rest of the hotels great things computers the lieutenant said when justin hung up i got a teenager practically married to one getting no response he shrugged his rounded shoulders im going to check your security myself if hes going to plant a bomb he has to get in first he can get in justin reminded him by signing a name at the registration desk true enough lieutenant renicki watched the cigar smoke drift you can close down the only change in justins expression was a fractional narrowing of his eyes no didnt think so lieutenant renicki hauled himself out of the chair my men will be discreet mr blade but well make a routine search ill check back with you after ive interviewed the desk clerks thank you lieutenant justin waited until the door closed behind him then crushed out his cigar with a force that snapped it in two if hed felt a stalking sensation before now he felt breathing down his neck he was here now if not in the hotel then somewhere close waiting serena was going back to hyannis port if justin had to tie her up and dump her on a plane he sat very still for a moment until he was calm again he wouldnt get through to serena by shouting or threatening the only way would be to make her see that her presence there made it impossible for him to be completely rational if she were gone he could think clearly enough and perhaps reason out who and why justin lifted the intercom again kate ill be upstairs pass my calls through to me up there rising he went to the elevator maybe on the way up he would think of the best way to tell serena he was kicking her and her brothers out of his hotel as he stepped into the living room justin glanced toward the picture window half expecting to see her sitting there already nibbling at lunch he was only vaguely surprised to see the table empty hed taken a bit more than the hour hed allotted thinking perhaps shed fallen back to sleep justin walked into the bedroom the rumpled bed didnt bring on a twinge of desire this time but a feeling of unease calling her name justin walked toward the bathroom the faintest wisp of her scent clung to the air because the room was empty it only made justins unease sharpen dont be an idiot he told himself she isnt tied to this suite she could have gone out for a hundred reasons but she was expecting me she would have phoned down how did he know as he walked back out into the living room justin reminded himself that they hadnt been together long enough to be sure of the others habits she could have run down to the boutique for a dress bending justin picked up the small enamelhandled brush from the rug for a moment his mind went blank and he could do no more than stare at it he shook himself clear he was being an alarmist shed come walking back in any moment it was like her to leave her things all over the suite to be untidy he mused mercilessly not careless picking up the phone justin punched a number page serena macgregor he held the brush as he waited her beaded jacket hung over the back of the sofa he could remember slipping it from her shoulders the night before sometime during the morning she had picked it up and tossed it there then why would she have left her brush on the floor ms macgregor doesnt answer the page sir justin felt the knot in his stomach tighten he gripped the handle of the brush until it threatened to snap page alan or caine macgregor glancing at his watch justin saw that it was thirty minutes past the time he had told serena to expect him caine macgregor its justin is serena with you no alan and i were have you seen her not since this morning it was the first time in the ten years he had known justin caine realized that hed heard a hint of panic in that controlled voice something like ice rippled down his back why justin found his throat closed and stared down at the brush in his hand shes gone came felt the receiver grow wet under his palm where are you upstairs well be right there within minutes justin opened the door to admit serenas brothers she mightve gone out for something caine said immediately did you check to see if she took her car out no justin cursed himself and picked up the phone again this is blade has ms macgregor taken her car out he waited angry impatient while caine prowled the room and alan watched him justin listened to the answer from the garage then hung up without speaking her cars still there she might have gone for a walk on the beach alan suggested she was expecting me here a half hour ago justin said flatly she was supposed to order some lunch but ive checked she never called down i found this near the front door alan took the brush from justins hand he remembered giving the antique vanity set to serena for her sixteenth birthday it was one of the few things she owned that she took meticulous care of had you been arguing justin whirled on caine as his control slipped another notch justin caine said quickly rena has a wicked temper if she were angry she could have stormed out without a word to anyone shed stomp around on the beach until shed cooled off no we hadnt been arguing justin said tightly wed been making love he stuck his hands in his pockets because he wanted to ball them into fists i got a call from downstairs an envelope had been left for me at the front desk it was another threat alan set serenas brush down carefully on the table justin he waited until the angry green eyes met his call the police like an exclamation point at the end of his words the phone rang justin grabbed for it serena he began looking for her already the voice was muffled and sexless ive got your squaw blade the connection broke with a soft click justin stood still as stone for a full ten seconds he tasted copper in his mouth and recognized it as fear hes got her he heard someone say then realized the voice was his own on a blind wave of fury he ripped the phone out of the wall and threw it across the room the son of a bitch has her lieutenant renicki glanced around the living room of justins suite and decided it was warmer than he would have expected the man he had met downstairs seemed suited to cold colours and straight lines his eyes rested on the phone that lay drunkenly against the east wall well still waters run deep he supposed the tall blond man staring out of the window was caine macgregor the hotshot young lawyer who was currently serving as states attorney in massachusetts the dark man sitting in the chair staring at the hairbrush in his hands was alan macgregor us senator a bit of a left winger with a glib tongue the lieutenant looked at justin again suppose you run through it once more justins eyes leveled on lieutenant renickis full of fury and icy control i went downstairs to check out the envelope that had been left for me at the front desk i left serena here it was just past noon we made arrangements to have lunch here in the suite an hour later i was late and when i came back she wasnt here i was concerned then when i found her hairbrush lying on the floor by the front door i had her paged when she didnt answer i paged her brothers fifteen minutes ago i received a call yes apparently from a kidnapper renicki put in not certain if he was pleased or annoyed with justins cool recital you havent told me precisely what he said justin gave the lieutenant a long intense look he told me he had my squaw ready to explode caine whirled away from the window damn it this isnt getting us anywhere why arent you looking for her lieutenant renicki watched him with tired patient eyes were doing just that mr macgregor hell call again alan said quietly he looked up from the hairbrush to meet the lieutenants gaze he must know that between justin and our family we can raise any amount of money to get rena back he let his eyes drift to justins and hold if his motive is money well have to work on that premise for now senator lieutenant renicki stated in a nononsense voice well be putting a tap on your phone with your permission mr blade do whatever it takes caine looked at justin then looked at him for the first since the phone call wheres the brandy what you need a drink when justin merely shook his head caine let out a quiet oath well im going to have one before i call mom and dad justin felt a fresh twinge inside his stomach and gestured in that cabinet from opposite ends of the suite the phone rang without waiting for lieutenant renickis yes or no justin went into the kitchen to answer he couldnt bring himself to go into the bedroom blade closing his eyes he fought frustration then held out the receiver its for you he told the lieutenant when he came back into the living room justin found alan and caine standing in the centre of the room speaking quietly alans going to call our parents caine told him theyll take it better from him theyll want to be here justin struggled not to let the panic through or the grief of course as lieutenant renicki came into the room he waited until all three pairs of eyes were on him my men found an abandoned maids cart down in the garage the lab will go over it thoroughly but they found a rag soaked with ether inside apparently thats how he got her out without anyone seeing her watching closely lieutenant renicki saw caines knuckles whiten on his glass saw the wave of terrified anger in alans eyes he saw no change in justins expression we have your description of miss macgregor mr blade but a picture would be helpful justin stared as pain sprinted from his stomach to his throat i dont have one i do numb alan reached for his wallet well have the trace on the line right away mr blade lieutenant renicki went on glancing at the picture alan handed him well be recording everything thats said the longer you keep him on the line the better whatever demands he makes insist on speaking to miss macgregor before you agree to anything we have to establish that she is indeed with him and alive he added silently and if he refuses justin demanded then you refuse to deal justin forced himself to sit down if he stood he would pace if he paced he would lose control no he said evenly justin alan interrupted before renicki could speak again the lieutenants right we have to be certain rena is with him and unharmed its rena he thought wildly as he struggled to keep his voice even our rena if you make it clear there wont be a ransom unless you hear her voice hell put her on the phone you have a price to pay the words flashed through justins mind not serena he thought desperately god not serena and after ive spoken to her justin began ill agree to any terms he asks i wont bargain and i wont stall its your money mr blade lieutenant renicki gave him a thin smile id like you to listen to his voice very carefully when he phones back chances are he has it disguised but you might recognize a phrasing an inflection there was a brisk knock on the door which the lieutenant answered himself as he stood talking in undertones to one of his men caine again approached justin with the offer of brandy for the second time justin shook his head theyre going to catch him caine said just needing to hear the words aloud slowly justin lifted his eyes when they do he said calmly im going to kill him feeling groggy and sore serena woke moaning had she overslept she wondered shed miss class if she didnt no no it was her shift in the casino and dale justin no justin was coming up for lunch and she hadnt even called room service she had to get up but her eyes refused to open and there was a light rolling sense of nausea in her stomach sick she thought hazily but she was never sick how the door she remembered someone at the door nausea swelled again and with it fear drawing all her strength together serena opened her eyes the room was small and dun over the one window a shade was drawn there was a cheap maple bureau against one wall with a mirror streaked with dust and a small straightbacked rocking chair there was no lamp only a ceiling fixture overhead because it was off and some light filtered through the shade serena knew it was still day but her sense of time was so distorted she had no idea which day someone had once painted the walls an airy yellow but the colour had faded so that they now seemed more like the pages of a very old book serena lay in the middle of a double bed on top of a worn chenille spread when she tried to move her right arm she discovered that it was handcuffed to the centre bedpost thats when the fear overcame the grogginess the boy from housekeeping she remembered ether oh god how could she have been so stupid justin had warned her justin she thought again as she clamped down on her bottom lip hed be frantic by now was he searching for her had he called the police perhaps he thought shed just gone out on an errand i have to get out of here serena told herself desperately and scrambled closer to the headboard to tug on the handcuffs the boy must have had something to do with the bombing in vegas it seemed incredible he looked barely old enough to shave old enough to kidnap she reminded herself grimly yanking uselessly at the metal cuffs when she heard his footsteps she sat very still and waited hed planned it perfectly terry thought as he hung up the phone snatching the woman from under blades nose had been risky but oh so worthwhile better than the bomb he decided as he drummed his fingers against the table hed had to give them too much time and theyd found the bomb because he hadnt wanted to hurt anyone just blade but this this was perfect she was beautiful he mused blade would pay to get her back but before he paid hed suffer terry was going to make sure of it to relieve his own tension he reminded himself how clever he had been even while justin had been in vegas terry had been on his way to atlantic city at the time hed been annoyed with himself for not choosing the east coast hotel in the first place but it had all worked out hed noticed serena the first night hed hung around the casino then hed learned she was justins partner it had only taken a few casual questions in the right places to learn she was much more than that to him then terry had outlined his plan at first hed been frightened getting a woman out of a hotel was trickier than getting a small bomb in but hed watched no one looked twice at the people in the plain white housekeeping uniforms after a couple of days of watching serenas movements he concluded there was a private entrance from the offices to the living quarters probably an elevator he had reasoned that was the way the rich did things hed been patient spending most of his time at the slot machines waiting when hed seen justin come back he knew it was time to move stealing the uniform had been easy as easy as planting the letter no one took any notice of a young harmlesslooking man in plain clothes the minute he had seen the desk clerk deliver the envelope to the offices terry had begun to move hed had to force himself to go slowly hed told himself to give justin a full ten minutes to get downstairs on the third floor hed changed his clothes in a storage closet then hed simply walked off with one of the maids carts that sat in the hallway he remembered how his heart had been pounding as he had wheeled into the service elevator there was a chance that she wouldnt be there that shed gone down with justin and hed have to start all over again when she had opened the door and smiled hed almost lost his nerve then hed remembered blade the rest was easy it had taken him less than five minutes to cover her unconscious body with linen and wheel the cart down to the garage where his car was waiting with serena in the backseat covered with a blanket hed simply driven away but shed been unconscious for a long time maybe hed used too much ether or then he heard her moan terry got up to fix her a cup of tea when he opened the door serena was sitting back against the headboard staring at him but she didnt look as frightened as hed imagined she would he wondered if she was in shock he expected shed start screaming any minute if you yell he said quietly ill have to gag you i dont want to do that serena saw that he was holding a cup and that it shook in his hand a nervous kidnapper she thought quickly would be more dangerous than a calm one she swallowed any urge to scream i wont yell i brought you some tea he came a little closer you might be feeling a little sick he was approaching her serena thought as one approached a cornered animal he expects me to be terrified she realized well he wasnt far off it might be more to her advantage to let her control slip outwardly inside shed force herself to be calm the first thing she had to know was where he kept the keys for the handcuffs i do please she let her voice tremble can i use the bathroom okay im not going to hurt you he spoke soothingly as he set the tea aside and came to her taking a key from the pocket of his jeans he fit it into the wrist lock if you try to run away or start yelling ill have to stop you he paused as his hand replaced the metal on her wrist do you understand serena nodded he was stronger she discovered than he looked silently he led her into a small bathroom im going to be right outside the door he warned just be smart and nothingll happen to you nodding serena went inside immediately she looked for means of escape and was frustrated there wasnt even a window a weapon a rapid search turned up nothing more than a towel bar that wouldnt budge she bit down on her lip as fear and helplessness began to take over shed have to find another way she would find another way running cold water in the sink she splashed it on her face she had to stay calm and alert and she couldnt underestimate the man outside the door he was dangerous because he was every bit as frightened as she was so shed be more frightened she decided she would cower and weep so that he wouldnt know she was watching waiting for the opportunity of escape first she had to find out exactly what his plans were opening the door serena let him seize her wrists again please what are you going to do im not going to hurt you terry said again as he pulled her toward the bed hell pay to get you back who she saw the fury in his eyes blade my father has more she began quickly he i dont want your fathers money at his fierce explosion serena didnt have to simulate a shudder its blade hes going to pay im going to bleed him dry were you were you the one who planted the bomb in vegas terry handed her the tea serena considered throwing it into his face then decided against it if it were hot enough to burn him hed probably leap back and the key would be out of her reach yeah she watched him there was angry colour in his face now and a look in his eyes that had her stomach rolling why he killed my father terry told her then strode out of the room why doesnt he call justin thought as he drank yet another cup of coffee if hes hurt her he looked down to see that hed snapped the handle cleanly away from the mug setting them both down he drew out a cigar behind him in the dinette two detectives played gin caine paced while alan was already on his way to the airport to pick up daniel and anna the living room extension had been repaired and was now attached to a recording device but still they waited it was growing darker as clouds moved in thered be rain before the night was over for gods sake where was she why did i leave her alone justin wanted to bury his face in his hands he wanted to hit something anything he sat perfectly still and stared at the wall why did i think shed be safe here he demanded of himself i would have made her go away if i hadnt wanted her with me so badly i could have made her go away if anything happens to her he pushed the thought aside if he were going to stay in control he couldnt even allow himself the luxury of guilt the only sounds in the room were the desultory conversation of the detectives and the hiss of caines lighter as he lit another cigarette if the phone didnt ring justin was certain hed go mad when it did justin lunged for it keep him on the line as long as you can one of the detectives ordered curtly and tell him you have to talk to her before you deal justin didnt even acknowledge the instructions as he picked up the receiver the recorder was running silently blade want your squaw back blade it was a young voice justin realized and frightened the same voice he had heard on the police recordings in las vegas how much two million cash small bills ill let you know when and where serena let me talk to serena forget it how do i know you have her justin demanded how do i know shes he had to force the words out still alive ill think about it and the line went dead serena huddled under the blanket she was cold scared she corrected herself brutally the chill she was feeling had nothing to do with her thin sweater or bare feet he killed my father the flat statement ran over and over in her head could this be the son of the man who had attacked justin all those years ago hed have been little more than a baby at the time if hed been harbouring hate all those years serena shivered again and drew the blanket over her shoulders she shouldnt have doubted justins instincts hed known somehow that someone was after him personally how far would the boy go for revenge she asked herself be objective she ordered this is real shed seen his face could he take the chance of letting her go when she could identify him yet he didnt seem like a coldblooded killer hed planted a bomb in a crowded hotel she reminded herself oh god she had to get away closing her eyes serena put all her concentration into listening it was quiet no sounds of traffic she thought but couldnt be sure that she heard the ocean it mightve been the wind how far out of town were they she wondered if she threw the teacup through the window and screamed would anyone hear even as she weighed the odds terry came back into the bedroom i brought you a sandwich he seemed more agitated this time or perhaps she reconsidered excited make him talk she told herself please dont leave me alone she grabbed his arm with her free hand and let her eyes plead with his youll feel better after you eat he mumbled and shoved the sandwich under her nose you dont have to be scared i told you i wouldnt hurt you if you didnt try anything ive seen you she said taking the chance how can you let me go ive got plans restless he began to pace the little room he wasnt big she thought if i could just get my hand free id have a chance by the time i let them know where you are ill already be gone he thought of switzerland with grim pleasure they wont find me ill have two million dollars to help me hide in comfort two million she whispered how do you know justin will pay terry laughed turning to look at her her face was pale her eyes huge her hair tumbled wildly around her shoulders hell pay hell beg me to let him pay before im finished you said he killed your father murdered him but he was acquitted justin told me the words slid back down her throat as terry whirled he murdered my father and they let him go he shouted let him go because they felt sorry for him it was all politics my mother told me they let him go because he was a poor indian kid my mother said that his lawyer paid off the witnesses his mother serena thought had been warping his mind for years it would take more than a few words from her to change it now had his mother told him about the scar along justins side had she told him his father had been drunk or that the knife that had killed him had been his own serena studied terrys set frightened face and hating eyes im sorry she said weakly im so sorry hes paying now terry told her and tossed a hank of errant hair out of his eyes i wish i could take the chance of holding you for more than a couple of days he gave a soft wondering laugh whod have thought id make blade crawl for a woman please whats your name terry he said briefly serena struggled to sit up straighter terry you must know justins called the police theyll be looking for me they wont find you he returned simply i didnt start planning yesterday i put a deposit down on this place six months ago when blade opened the hotel i was thinking about squeezing him a second time after hed paid off from vegas he shrugged as if the business in vegas meant little the old couple i rented this from are in florida by now theyve never even seen me just the check i sent them terry look nothings going to happen to you just eat and get some rest ten hours after blade makes the drop ill call and let them know where to find you he stormed out of the room slamming the door before she could say any more what are they doing to get her back daniel demanded as he strode around the living room of justins suite look at these two he tossed out a hand toward the two detectives playing cards while some maniac has my little girl theyre doing everything they can alan told him quietly the phones tapped he didnt stay on the line long enough last time to trace it theyre checking out all the fingerprints on the maids cart hah letting his panic take the form of anger he rounded on his son and what kind of a place is it where a man can dump my daughter in a basket and go off with her daniel from her place on the sofa beside justin anna spoke softly she said only his name but the pain in her eyes had him cursing again and striding to the window she turned to justin putting her hand over his justin but he shook his head rising for the first time in the six hours of fear he knew he was going to fall apart without a word he walked into the bedroom and shut the door behind him her robe was tossed over a chair where she had left it he had only to pick it up to smell her he balled his hands into fists and turned away from it the jewellers box with the earrings hed given her sat open on the dresser he could remember the way they had looked on her the night before gleaming catching fire in the dim light as she had knelt naked on his bed and held her arms out to him fear and anger rolled around inside him until his skin was wet and clammy the silence of the room weighed down on him there was only the sound of rain falling cold and steady outside the windows only a few hours before serena had filled the room with life laughter and passion then hed left her he hadnt told her he loved her or kissed her goodbye hed walked out with his mind occupied with his own business left her alone he thought again oh god running his hands over his face he pressed his fingers hard against his eyes at the soft knock on the door justin dropped his hands and struggled against the sensation of despair daniel came in without waiting for his answer justin he closed the door behind him and stood looking huge and for the first time in justins memory helpless im sorry for that justin met his eyes as he balled his hands in his pockets again you were right if i hadnt been careless no coming to him daniel gripped both his arms theres no blame here rena he wanted rena hed have found a way im scared the big voice quavered as his grip tightened ive only been scared once before in my life when caine took it into his head to explore the roof and we found him hanging on a ledge two stories up i dont know where she is his voice shook as he turned away i cant get a ladder to her daniel i love her on a deep breath daniel turned back aye i can see that whatever he asks whatever he wants me to do ill do nodding daniel held out his hand come the family should wait together chapter twelve she must have dozed because it was dark when serena felt herself being shaken awake youre going to make a phone call terry told her then walked over to flip on the overhead light serena tossed her arm over her eyes to shield them who she began he should have sweated enough by now terry mumbled as he hooked the phone in the bedroom jack its after one listen he jerked her arm down so that she could look at him youre going to tell him youre all right and thats all dont try anything he began to dial when he answers just tell him youre not hurt and youll stay that way as long as he pays understand nodding serena took the receiver justin was on the phone in the first ring a half cup of cold coffee tipped over on the table and dripped on the rug blade serena squeezed her eyes shut at the sound of his voice it was raining she thought dimly it was raining and she was so cold and frightened justin serena are you all right has he hurt you taking a deep breath she looked directly into terrys eyes im all right justin no scars where are you he began but terry clamped his hand over her mouth and grabbed the phone if you want her back get the money together two million small bills unmarked ill let you know where to make the drop and youll make it alone blade if you dont want her hurt he hung up the phone then let serena go the sound of justins voice did what the hours of fear hadnt been able to on a trembling sob she buried her face in the pillow and wept shes all right justin replaced the phone with studied care shes all right thank god anna grabbed both of his hands what next i get the cash together take it wherever he tells me well take photographs of the bills lieutenant renicki stated as he stirred himself from his chair one of my men will tail you when you make the drop no listen mr blade he began patiently theres no guarantee hell let miss macgregor go after hes been paid off hes more likely to no justin repeated we play it my way lieutenant no tails the lieutenant took a deep breath all right we can plant a bug in the case that way when he picks up the money he might lead us right to her and if he spots it justin countered no he said again im not taking any chances youre taking a hell of a chance by handing him two million dollars cold lieutenant renicki tossed back mrs macgregor he turned to anna thinking a woman a mother would be more reasonable we want your daughter back healthy the same as you let us help you she gave him a long steady look while the hand in justins trembled lightly i appreciate your concern lieutenant but im afraid i feel as justin does photograph the money caine put in and go after him when renas safe by god id like to prosecute him myself he added in a savage mutter then youd better hope hell be prosecuted for only kidnapping and extortion not murder lieutenant renicki added cruelly hell keep her alive until hes got the money after that its anyones guess listen blade he continued as his patience snapped you dont like dealing with cops maybe because you had some trouble years back but its a hell of a lot smarter to deal with us than to deal with him he tossed his hand toward the phone in an unconscious gesture justin ran his hand over his ribs no he thought he didnt trust the police the memory of those endless questions while his wound was healing into a scar were ingrained in his memory maybe he was making a mistake maybe he should his fingers froze abruptly scars no scars oh god he murmured as his eyes dropped to his hand oh my god what is it anna was standing beside him her ringers digging into his arm slowly he brought his eyes to hers a ghost he whispered then shook away dread as he faced lieutenant renicki on the phone serena was trying to tell me something she said no scars the man i killed in nevada put a knife in me serena knows the story the lieutenant was already heading for the phone do you remember his name justin gave a mirthless laugh did you ever forget the name of a man when you were tried for his murder charles terrance ford he answered he had a wife and a son she brought the boy to the courtroom every day he had blue eyes justin remembered pale confused blue eyes a wave of sickness rose up threatening to swallow him this time drink it caine ordered as he thrust a snifter of brandy into justins hands looking down at it justin shook his head coffee he mumbled and walked into the kitchen but he couldnt think pressing his palms down on the counter he tried to clear his head helpless he realized he felt the same raging helplessness hed experienced so long ago in that narrow little cell seventeen years he thought dear god hes had seventeen years to hate me what will he do to her because of me if its all you drink then drink it caine said roughly as he pushed a cup of coffee across the counter he was remembering serena standing there only that morning her eyes laughing at him while he dealt with the fact that shed grown up while he wasnt looking i knew justin said quietly as he stared into the black coffee i knew someone was after me i knew she wasnt safe but i didnt make her go caine sat down heavily on a stool ive known rena all her life loved her all her life no one absolutely no one makes her do anything i could have justin picked up the coffee and drank without tasting all i had to do was go with her and hed have followed you justin slammed the cup back down yes the anger cleared his head and dispelled the lingering sickness in his throat im going to get her back caine he said with deadly calm nothing in hells going to stop me from getting her back his names terry ford lieutenant renicki stated as he walked into the room and headed for the coffeepot booked a flight out of vegas five days ago destination atlantic city well have a description soon were checking all the hotels motels condos beach rentals but theres no telling whether hes kept her in town i wouldnt bank on him renting a room in his own name he added as he helped himself to the sugar bowl his mother remarried about three years ago were tracking her down it felt good to have something solid to work with names faces with a satisfied grunt lieutenant renicki sat across from caine well get him he promised you both should try to get some rest he advised odds are he wont be calling again until morning when neither of them answered the lieutenant sighed this family knows how to close ranks he reflected all right mr blade why dont you tell me what arrangements youve made for getting the ransom together the money will be in my office by eight oclock lieutenant renickis bushy brows rose and fell no problem getting that amount of cash together no okay tell him nine then well have time to photograph it in your office that way if he slips by us well be able to grab him once he starts to pass it id like you to reconsider letting us put a tracer in one of the cases i can show you how successfully it can be concealed remember he added before justin could speak our primary concern is the same as yours to get miss macgregor back safe for the first time justin noticed the fatigue in the lieutenants eyes it occurred to him that the policeman hadnt eaten or slept any more than he had himself under most circumstances he would have trusted those eyes ill consider it he said at length the lieutenant only nodded and drained the rest of his coffee at six am the phone rang again anna and daniel woke from a half doze on the sofa alan came to attention in the chair where he had spent the night awake and restless caine stopped in the doorway of the kitchen where he was returning with yet another cup of coffee justins hand snaked out to the receiver hed been staring at the phone for more than an hour blade got the money itll be here by nine theres a gas station two blocks down from the hotel on the right be in the phone booth there by ninefifteen ill call you terry hung up the phone so tied up with nerves he nearly knocked the small table over he hadnt been able to sleep even after serenas weeping had quieted she shouldnt have been able to make him feel sorry for her he thought as he rubbed the heels of his hands over his eyes after all what kind of a woman was she to be living with a murderer his mother would have said she was a tramp but hed sensed something about her classy terry mused as he stretched his stiff and aching muscles shed even looked classy in that sweater and jeans when shed opened the door for him and last night he sighed glancing at the door to the bedroom last night shed looked so small and helpless when shed curled up on the bed and cried well he was sorry he had to scare her that way but she was the best weapon he could use on blade she shouldnt have gotten mixed up with scum like him in the first place terry reminded himself id kill him if i could terry thought but knew he didnt have it in him planting a bomb in a building and drawing a knife or gun on a man were two different things a bomb was remote and he was forced to admit that hed probably never have gotten up the nerve to detonate it but the threat oh the satisfaction of being able to keep the man who had killed his father shaking in his shoes then hed have the money and every dollar he spent would be revenge on justin blade he heard serena stir and rose to check on her she was disgusted with herself what good had crying done but to give her a throbbing head and swollen eyes she needed to be planning a way out not wallowing in selfpity the arm that was attached to the bedpost ached and tingled from the lack of circulation shifting on the bed she tried to rub the blood back into it think she demanded of herself theres always a way out when the bedroom door opened her head spun around serena caught the quick regret in terrys eyes as he looked at her god i must be a pitiful sight she thought wearily then use it rena a small voice ordered impatiently start using your head she allowed the fear to surface again while she clung to her inner strength desperately please my arm hurts i think i wrenched it during the night im sorry he stood irresolutely in the centre of the room ill fix you some breakfast please she said quickly before he could go if i if i could just sit in a chair i ache all over from lying like this where can i go she asked on a half sob as he hesitated youre stronger than i am look ill take you into the kitchen if you try anything ill bring you back in here and put a gag on you all right just please let me get up for a while terry pulled the key from his pocket and unlocked the handcuffs serena pushed down the urge to run knowing shed get no farther than the door clamping his fingers over her arm he led her quickly through the house the shades were drawn i could be in alaska for all i know she thought in frustration if i could run what direction would i go does he have a car he must have a car how else did he get me here if i could get the keys sit down he ordered and nudged her into a rickety chair at the kitchen table quickly he knelt and slipped the cuffs around her ankle and a table leg pushing his hair out of his eyes he rose ill get you some coffee thank you her eyes swept the room swiftly in search of a weapon within reach youll be out of here by tonight terry told her as he poured coffee without taking his eyes from her hes already getting the money together i probably could have asked for twice as much you wont be happy with it hell be unhappy terry countered thats what counts terry youre wasting your life this way he looked so young she thought too young to have so much hate packed inside him it took brains to plan everything out the way you have brains and skill you could be putting your mind to so much better use if you let me go now i might be able to help you my brother i dont want your help he said between his teeth i want blade i want him to crawl justin wont crawl she said wearily lady i heard him on the phone hed crawl to hell and back for you terry shut up he shouted at her as his nerves threatened to snap ive spent all of my life working out how i was going to make blade pay i had to watch my mother scrimp and save and work in a sleazy diner while he got richer and richer instead of rotting in a cell im entitled to the money and im going to have it resigned serena dropped her gaze to the table look im going to fix something to eat are you hungry she started to tell him no then realized hed just lock her back in the bedroom instead she merely nodded keeping her face averted while she tried to think hearing him rummaging in the cupboard she gave her leg a testing jerk she was going to have to take a chance when he took the cuff off this time shed fight with luck she could surprise him enough to at least get outside get someones attention if there were anyone close enough to hear her shouting when she looked back up terry had a large cast iron skillet in his hand without giving herself a chance to think serena moaned and began to slip slowly toward the floor hey alarmed he rushed over dropping the skillet beside her as he tried to lift her by the shoulders what is it he demanded are you sick i feel faint she said weakly as her fingers closed over the handle of the skillet she made herself go limp until his face bent over hers using all of her strength she crashed the skillet against the side of his head he went down like a stone at first serena lay still trying to catch the breath hed knocked out of her when hed landed across her body then she had a moments terror that shed killed him struggling she wiggled out from under him and felt for his pulse thank god she murmured as she felt the beat quickly she shifted until she could reach into his pocket for the key his mother was the one who deserved that blow she thought as she released herself poor kid never had a chance rising she considered her options she could run like hell but the chances were that hed come to and take off no she had to make sure he stayed put first serena stuck the handcuffs into the back pocket of her jeans then began to drag him toward the bedroom he wasnt a big man but as she started across the living room bent over and tugging him by the shoulders she discovered her strength wasnt at its maximum by the time she got him through the doorway she was breathing hard and dripping with sweat resting against the doorjamb she decided shed never be able to drag him onto the bed instead she left him stretched out on the floor attached to the footboard with the handcuffs she stumbled on the way to the phone with a faintness that wasnt contrived it occurred to her that shed barely eaten in two days it would wait she told herself shaking her head to clear it she wasnt about to pass out now quickly she lifted the phone and dialled after a quick shower and change of clothes justin came back into the living room anna was urging daniel to eat though she wasnt touching anything on her own plate she looked up as justin entered well have a family dinner tonight she told him with a valiant smile rena loves the fuss he saw the tears swim into her eyes to be hastily blinked away for the first time since he had known her justin went to her and put his arms around her why dont you go down and speak to the chef hell fix whatever you want he felt her shudder as her fingers dug into his back yes ill do that be careful she whispered be careful justin when the phone rang she jerked then drew away her face was a mask of control he wasnt supposed to call again he probably wants to make sure nothings gone wrong his head pounding justin picked up the phone blade justin serena he heard annas quick gasp behind him are you all right yes yes im fine justin are you sure he hasnt hurt you i didnt think hed let you call again she controlled her impatience and spoke lightly he didnt have any choice she told him hes unconscious and cuffed to the bedpost what caine grabbed at his arm but justin shook him off what did you say i said i knocked him out and cuffed him to the bedpost something rushed through him that he didnt recognize it was relief it came out in a burst of laughter god knows why i was worried about you he said as he sunk onto the couch looking up he saw four pairs of anxious eyes she knocked him out and cuffed him to the bedpost thats a macgregor for you daniel exploded and swung anna into his arms what did she hit him with is that my father serena wanted to know yes he asked what you hit him with a cast iron skillet she realized her legs were shaking and sat on the floor a skillet justin relayed thats my little girl daniel kissed anna lustily then laid his head on her shoulder and wept justin could you come and get me serena demanded ive had a really dreadful night where are you i dont know as reaction set in she buried her face on her knees dont fall apart she ordered herself dont fall apart now she could hear justin calling her name through the receiver and swallowed the tears wait a minute let me pull up the shades and see if i can get my bearings talk to me she demanded as she rose just keep talking to me your familys all here he said hearing the edge of hysteria in her voice your mother wants to have a dinner tonight what would you like a cheeseburger she said as she flipped up the first shade oh god id love to have a cheeseburger and a gallon of champagne i think im east of town near the beach therere a few frame houses farther down the road ive never been in this section she bit down hard on her lip to keep her voice from breaking i just dont know where i am give me the phone number serena well trace it justin scribbled it down quickly as she read it off ill be there just hang on i will im fine really somehow letting the light into the room helped just hurry tell everyone im all right not to worry serena i love you tears welled up again come and show me she said before she hung up justin handed the piece of paper to lieutenant renicki find out where she is with a nod the lieutenant began to dial the phone knocked him out with a skillet eh he gave a quick appreciative laugh must be quite a woman shes a macgregor daniel told him then heartily blew his nose a little waterfront house east of town lieutenant renicki said a few minutes later and headed for the door coming he asked justin justin sent him a mild look were all coming serena stood in the open doorway though she shivered in the brisk morning air it had been less than twentyfour hours she realized she felt as though it had been days since shed seen the sunlight the grass was still wet from the nights rain how was it shed never noticed how many colours there were in a drop of water on a blade of grass then she saw the cars like a procession she thought and wanted badly to weep again no she wouldnt greet justin with tears running down her face straightening her shoulders she went out on the stoop to wait he pulled up in front of two police cars even as the car stopped he was out of the door and rushing toward her serena his arms were around her lifting her off her feet as he crushed her against him with her face buried against his throat she heard him say her name again and again are you all right he demanded but before she could answer his lips were fastened on hers why hes trembling she realized and clutched him tighter as reassurance she put all of the love and warmth she had into the kiss youre freezing he murmured feeling the chill of her skin under his hands here take my jacket as he started to remove it serena caught his face in her hands oh justin she whispered and stroked the lines of strain on his face what did he put you through here now let me take a look at her daniel took her by the shoulders then ran his wide hands over her face so you took him out with a frying pan did you little girl seeing the redrimmed eyes she kissed him fiercely it was handy she told him dont tell me you were worried about me she demanded as if insulted course not he sniffed loudly any daughter of mine can take care of herself your mother she was worried lieutenant renicki watched as serena was passed from one family member to another he intended to keep an eye on justin when terry ford was brought out well need a statement from you miss macgregor he said moving over casually to stand beside justin not now he acknowledged justins words with a simple nod if you could come down to the station later today after youve rested he felt justin tense and bracing himself looked over as terry was brought out by two uniformed officers easy mr blade he murmured your ladys been through enough for one day terry jerked up his head justin remembered those eyes the pale anxious eyes hed seen every day in a courtroom hed been no more than three justin thought a baby he felt serenas hand link with his as the anger drained out of him as they led him to the car terry continued to watch justin over his shoulder im sorry for him serena murmured so sorry for him justin gathered her into his arms so am i some of my men will be going through the house lieutenant renicki said briskly if youd come downtown at your convenience miss macgregor come on lets get the girl back daniel stated and took a step toward her justin will bring her anna took his arm and steered him toward the second police car the rest of us will go back and plan that dinner she doesnt even have any shoes on her feet daniel blustered as he was pushed into the car shell be all right alan commented as he dropped into the front seat he realized he was starving sure shell be fine caine agreed then leaned over to his fathers ear ill buy you a cigar if you go quietly daniel shifted his eyes toward his wife and settled back shell be fine he decided come on justin buttoned his jacket up to serenas throat ill take you back lets walk on the beach she hooked her arm around his waist i really need to walk youre barefoot he pointed out its the best way to walk on the beach you havent slept she commented as they crossed to the sand no but it appears i could have rested easy he wanted to crush her against him be certain she was real trying to keep his arm light around her shoulders he brushed his lips over the top of her head i hated to hurt him she mused but i couldnt be sure how hed react once he had you face to face so much hate locked up inside that boy justin its so sad i took something vital from his life he took something vital from mine he stopped holding her close to his side as he looked out to sea im surprised he asked for such a small amount of money small she cocked a brow at him in most circles two million is a hefty sum for something priceless he took her face in his hands then lowered his mouth to hers then with a shudder he dragged her close and savaged her lips serena his mouth raced over her face coming to rest again on hers i wasnt sure id ever hold you again all i could think about was what he might have done to you what id do to him when i found him he wouldnt have hurt me the violence was bubbling in him again so she soothed it with her hands and lips the reason it was so easy to get away was because he didnt wish me any harm no it was me justin enough she drew him away and her eyes were suddenly touched with anger you didnt cause this im not going to listen to you try to take the blame what happened today was started long ago with drink and bigotry now its over let it rest i wonder why i missed you shouting at me he murmured then drew her close again masochist you know she cuddled against him a moment ive had some time to think about our relationship oh yes i think we need to redefine the ground rules puzzled he drew her away i didnt know we had any ive been thinking she walked toward the surf then discovering the water was freezing stepped back again and wary he took her shoulders and turned her to face him and i dont think the current situation is very practical in what way i think we should get married she said very coolly married thoughtful justin stared at her she was standing barefoot in cold sand in a jacket several sizes too big for her with her hair tangled and tossed calmly telling him they should get married an hour before she knocked out a wouldbe kidnapper with an iron skillet it wasnt he discovered exactly as hed pictured it hed imagined asking her himself when they were in some dimly lit room warm and fresh from loving married he repeated yes i hear people still do it now im willing to be reasonable you are he nodded wondering just what she was up to since its my suggestion well settle it your way digging in her pocket she pulled out a coin justin laughed and reached out to take it from her serena really oh no my coin my flip heads we get married tails we dont before he could say another word she spun the coin in the air then snatched it she slapped it onto the back of her hand then held it out for him to see heads he glanced at it dipping his hands into his pockets justin raised his eyes to hers looks like i lose certainly does serena slipped the twoheaded coin back into her pocket how about the best two out of three a flare of temper lit her eyes forget it she told him and started across the sand she let out a quick screech when justin swooped her up into his arms if you think youre going to welsh she began then gave a sigh of pleasure as he silenced her i never welsh he promised nipping at her lip as he started to carry her back to the car let me take a look at that coin as she twined her arms around his neck her eyes laughed into his over my dead body
