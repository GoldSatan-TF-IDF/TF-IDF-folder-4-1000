when dr rhine cooperstock was put under my care i was enlarged with pride dr cooperstock was a hero to me i dont mean a george washington all virtue and no fire i mean he was a dragon killer he had carried human knowledge far into the tiny spaces of an atomic nucleus he was a very great man and i was his doctor and he was dying dr cooperstock was dying in the finest suite in the morgan pavilion and with all the best doctors we couldnt keep him alive for more than a matter of months and we couldnt cure him at all but we could make him comfortable if roundtheclock nurses and color television constitute comfort i dont ask you to understand technical medical terms he was an old man his blood vessels deteriorating and clots formed impeding the circulation one day a clot would form in heart brain or lungs and he would die if it was in the lung it would be painful and slow in the heart painful and fast in the brain most painful of all but so fast that it would be a mercy meanwhile we fed him heparin and sometimes coumarol and attempted by massages and heat and diet to stave off the end although in fact he was all but dead anyway so little freedom of movement we allowed him martin the leg hurts youd better leave a pill he would say to me once or twice a week and i would hesitate i dont know if i can make it to the bathroom tonight martin he would say his tone cheerfully resigned then he would call for the bedpan while i was there or mention casually that some invisible wrinkle in the sheet caused him pain and stand by bravely while the bed was remade and say at last selfdeprecating i think i will need that pill martin so i would allow myself to be persuaded and let him have a redandwhite capsule and in the morning it would be gone i never told him that they contained only aspirin and he never admitted to me that he did not take the pills at all but was laboriously building up a board against the day when the pain would be really serious and he would take them all at once dr cooperstock knew the lethal dose as well as i did as he knew the names of all his veins and arteries and the chemistry of his disease a man like rhine cooperstock even at seventy can learn enough medicine for that in a week he acquired eleven of the little capsules in one month at the pavilion i know because i counted them after he left that would have been enough for suicide if they had not been aspirin i suppose he would have stopped there perhaps beginning to take a few now and then both to keep me from getting suspicious and for the relief of the real pain he must have felt but he did leave nan halloran came and got him she invaded the pavilion like a queen expensive celebrated hospital we were used to the famous but this was nan halloran blueeyed blackhaired a face like a lovely child and a voice like the sway of hips she was a most remarkable woman i called her a queen but she was not that she was a goddess virgin and fertile i speak subjectively of course for in medical fact she was surely not one and may not have been either she breezed into the room wrinkling her nose coopie she said what is that awful smell will you do me a favor dear i need it very much you would not think that a man like dr cooperstock would have much to do with a television star but he knew her years before when he was still teaching sometimes she had somehow wandered into his class hello nan he said looking quite astonished and pleased ill do anything i can for you of course that smell he apologized touching the leg with its bright spots of color and degenerated tissues is me poor coopie she looked around at me and smiled although i am fat and not attractive and know in my heart that whatever longterm wonders i may work with the brilliance of my mind and the cleverness of my speech no woman will ever lust for me on sight i tingled i looked away she said sweetly its about that fusion power thing coopie you know wayne donner of course he and i are good friends he has these utility company interests and he wants to convert them to fusion power and i told him you were the only man who could help him dr cooperstock began to laugh and laughed until he was choking and gagging i laughed too although i think that in all the world dr cooperstock and i must be two of the very few men who would laugh at the name of wayne donner nan he said when he could youre amazing its utterly impossible im afraid she sat on the edge of his bed with a rustle of petticoats she had lovely legs oh did that hurt you but i didnt even touch your leg dear would you please get up and come now because the drivers waiting nan he cried security regulations death lack of proper engineering did you ever think of any of those things and theyre only a beginning if youre going to make objections well be here all day darling as far as security is concerned she said this is for the peaceful use of atomic power isnt it i promise you that wayne has enough friends in the senate that there will be no problem and the engineerings all right because wayne has all those people already of course this isnt any little manhattan project honey wayne spends money dr cooperstock shook his head and although he was smiling he was interested too what about death nan he said gently oh i know coopie its terrible but you cant lick this thing so wont you do it for me wayne only needs you for a few weeks and he already talked to some doctors they said it would be all right miss halloran i said i admit i was furious dr cooperstock is my patient as long as that is so i will decide what is or is not all right she looked at me again sweetly and attentively i have now and had then no doubt at all i was absolutely right in my position yet i felt as though i had committed the act of a clumsy fool she was clean and lovely her neck so slim that the dress she wore seemed too large for her like an adorable childs she was no child i knew that she had had a hundred lovers because everyone knows that even doctors who are fat and a little ugly and take it all out in intelligence yet she possessed an innocence i could not withstand i wanted to take her sweetly by the hand and shelter her and walk with her beside a brook and then that night crush her and caress her again and again with such violence and snorting passion that she would awaken and then with growing abandon respond i did know it was all foolishness i did but when she mentioned the names of five or six doctors on donners payroll who would care for dr cooperstock and suggested like a child that with them in charge it would really be all right i agreed i even apolo zed truth to tell they were excellent men those doctors but if she had named six chiropractors and an unfrocked abortionist i still would have shrugged and shuffled and stammered oh well i suppose miss halloran yes it will be all right so we called the nurses in and very carefully dressed the old man and wheeled him out into the hall i said something else that was foolish in the elevator i said because i had assumed that it was so that she probably had a cab waiting and a cab would not do to transport a man as sick as dr cooperstock but she had been more sure of herself than that the driver who was waiting was at the wheel of a private ambulance a time cover attributed to artzybashefl with mosaic of dollar signs i did not again hear of dr cooperstock for five weeks then i was telephoned to come and get him for he was ready to return to the pavilion to die it was wayne donner himself who called me i agreed to come to one of donners new york offices to meet him for in truth i was curious i knew all about him of course rather i knew as much as he wished anyone to know i have seen enough of the worlds household names in the pavilion to know what their publicrelations men can do the facts that were on record about wayne donner were that he was very rich he had gone from a lucky strike in oil and the twentyseven and a half per cent depletion allowance to aluminum and thence to electric power he was almost the wealthiest man in the world and i know his secret he could afford anything anything at all because he had schooled himself to purchase only bargains for example i knew that he was nan hallorans lover and although i do not know her price i know that it was what he was willing to pay otherwise he would have given her that thin bright smile that meant the parley was over there would be no contract signed that day and gone on to another incredible beauty more modest in her bargaining donner allowed himself to want only what he could get i think he was the only terrible man i have ever seen and he had nearly been president of the united states except that governor hewlett of ohio spoke so honestly and so truthfully about him in the primaries that not all of donners newspapers could get him the vote what was terrible was not that he then destroyed hewlett but that hewlett was not destroyed for revenge donner hated too deeply to be satisfied with revenge i think he was too contemptuous of his enemies to trouble to crush them he would not give them that satisfaction hewlett was blotted out only incidentally because donners papers had built the campaign against him to such a pitch that it was actually selling papers and thus it was profitable to go on to ruin the man when i saw donner he had hewletts picture framed in gilt in his waiting room i wondered how many of his visitors understood the message for that matter i wondered how many needed it when i was admitted dr cooperstock was on a relaxing couch hello martin he said over the little drone of its motor this is wayne donner dr finneman dr grace i shook hands with the doctors first pettishly enough but i felt obliged to show where i stood and then with donner he was very courteous he had discovered what bargains could be bought with that coin too he said dr finneman here has a good deal of respect for you doctor im sure youre well placed at the pavilion but if you ever consider leaving id like to talk to you i thanked him and refused i was flattered though i thought of how his fusionpower nonsense might have killed dr cooperstock before he was ready to die and i thought of him with nan halloran sweat on that perfect face and i am not impressed by money yet i was flattered that he would take the trouble and time and god knows how much an hour of his time was worth to himself offer me a job i was flattered even though i knew that the courtesy was for his benefit not mine he wanted the best he chose to afford in the way of a doctor in my case but the best of anything else too if he hired a gardener he would want the man to be a very good gardener aware as he was of the dignities assumed by a professional man he had budgeted the time to give me a personal invitation instead of letting his housekeeper or general manager attend to it it was only another installment of expense he chose to afford and yet i was glad to get out of there i was almost afraid i would reconsider and say yes and i hated that man very much when we got dr cooperstock back and bedded and checked over i examined the records dr finneman had sent he had furnished complete tests and a politely guarded prognosis and of course he was right cooperstock was sinking but not fast he was good for another month or two with luck i told him as much snappishly dont be angry with me martin he said youd have done the same thing for nan if she asked you probably but im not dying dont be vulgar martin im not a nuclear physicist either its only to make a few dollars for the man martin heavens what difference can another billion or two make to donner besides he said strongly you know ive always opposed this fetish of security think of oppenheimer not allowed to read his own papers think of the waste the same work done in a dozen different places because in irkutsk they arent allowed to know whats going on in denver and in omaha somebody forgot to tell them think of wayne donner with all the power in the world i said he said i guess nan hit you harder than i thought to make you so mad although i watched the papers i did not see anything about converting donners power stations to fusion energy in fact i didnt see much of donners name at all which caused me to wonder normally he would have been spotted in the stork or cruising off bimini or in some other way photographed and written about a couple of times a week his publicity men must have been laboring extra hard nan halloran came to see dr cooperstock but i did not join them i spent my time with him when there was no one else after my evening rounds sometimes we played cards but more often i listened to him talk the physics of the atomic nucleus was poetry when he talked of it he told me about gamows primordial atom from which all the stars and dust clouds had exploded he explained fred hoyle to me and heisenberg but he was tiring early now behind the drawer of his night table in a used cigarette package thumbtacked to the wood his store of redandwhite capsules was growing again they were still aspirin but i think i would not have denied him the real thing if he had known the deception and asked we took off two toes in march and it was only a miracle that we saved the leg by gilbert stuart his late period size x heroic in the beginning of may newspaper stories again began to appear about donner but i could not understand them the stories were datelined washington donner was reported in toplevel conferences deeply classified there were no leaks no one knew what the talks were about but the presidential press secretary was irritable with the reporters who asked questions and the cabinet members were either visibly worried or visibly under orders to keep their mouths shut and worried i showed one or two of the stories to dr cooperstock but he was too tired to guess at implications he was hanging on but it would not be for long any night i expected the call from his nurses and we would not be able to save him again then i was called to my office i was lecturing to fourthyear men when the annunciator spoke my name and when i got to my office governor hewlett was there i need to see dr cooperstock he said im afraid it may excite him the resident thought you should be present i said i suppose you know that any shock may kill him i hope its important it is important yes the governor limped ahead of me to the elevator his bald head gleaming smiling at the nurses with his bad teeth and his wonderful eyes dr cooperstock was a hero to me governor hewlett was something less perhaps a saint or a martyr he was what st george would have been if in the battle he had been killed as well as the dragon hewlett had spent himself against donner in the campaign and now he lingered on to serve out his punishment for his daring the weasels always chipping away at him a constant witness before commissions and committees with slanders thick in the air a subject for jokes and political cartoons a few senators and others of his own party still listened to him but they could not save him from the committees the governor did not waste words dr cooperstock what have you done what is wayne donner up to cooperstock had been dozing elaborately he sat up i dont see sir that it is will you answer me please im afraid this is quite serious the secretary of defense who was with me in the house fifteen years ago told me something i did not suspect do you know that he may be asked to resign and that wayne donner may get his job dr cooperstock said angrily thats nonsense donners just a businessman now anyway what conceivable difference can it makes a difference dr cooperstock because the rest of the cabinet is to be changed around at the same time every post of importance is to go to a man of donners you recall that he wanted to be president perhaps this time he does not want to bother with a vote what weapon have you given him to make him so strong dr cooperstock weapon weapon cooperstock stopped and began to gasp lying back on his pillow but he thrust me away when i came to him i didnt give him any weapon he said thoughtfully after staring at the governors face for a moment forcing his lungs to work more easily at least i dont think i did it was only a commercial matter you see governor i have never believed in overclassification knowledge should be free the basic theory donner doesnt intend to make it free dr cooperstock he plans to keep it for himself please tell me what you know well its fusion power cooperstock said the hydrogen bomb oh for gods sake governor it is fusion of hydrogen yes but not in any sense a bomb the selfsupporting reaction takes place in a magnetic bottle it will not explode even if the bottle fails you would have to coax it to make it blow up only heat comes out with which donner is going to drive steam generators perfectly normal i assure you there is no danger of accident i was not thinking of an accident said the governor after a moment well in that event i mean it is true said cooperstock with some difficulty that yes as the reactor is set up it would be possible to remove the safeguards this is only the pilot model the thing could be done by remote control as i understand said hewlett wearily and in that event each of donners power stations would become a hydrogen bomb did you know that he has twentyfour of them under construction all over the nation cooperstock said indignantly he could not possibly have twentyfour installations completed in this time i can hardly believe he has even one in the new york plant on the river we designed only the fusion chamber itself the hardware involved in generating power will take months but i dont think he bothered with the hardware for generating power you see said the governor dr cooperstock began to gasp again the governor sat watching him for a moment his face sagging with a painful fatigue and then he roused himself and said at last well you shouldnt have done this dr cooperstock but god bless you youre a great man we all owe you a debt only well have to do something about this now in my office the governor took me aside i am sorry to have disturbed your patient but it was important as you see donner is a terrible man yes i think that describes him well its all up to us now said the governor looking very gray i confess i dont know what we can do surely the government can handle doctor he said i apologize for troubling you with my reflections ive not much chance to talk them out with anyone but i assure you i have thought of everything the government can do donner has eight oil senators in his pocket you know they would be delighted to fflibuster any legislation for more direct action im afraid we cant get what we need without a greater risk than i can lightly contemplate donner has threatened to blow up every city of over eight hundred thousand you see i now find that this threat is not empty thank you doctor he said getting up i hope i havent distressed your patient as much as he has distressed me he limped to the door shook hands and was gone half an hour later it was time for my rounds i had spent the time sitting doing nothing almost not even thinking but i managed to go around and then dr cooperstocks nurse signaled me he had asked her to phone nan halloran for him and should she do it there was a message i have something else for wayne i found that puzzling but as you will understand i was in an emotionally numb state it was difficult to guess at what it meant i told the nurse she could transmit the message but when nan halloran arrived an hour or two later i waited in the hail outside dr cooperstocks room until she came out why doctor she said looking very lovely i took her by the arm it was the first time i had touched that flesh we had not even shaken hands before i took her to my office she seemed eager to go along with me she asked no questions in the office the door closed i was extremely conscious of being alone in a room with her she knew that of course she took a cigarette out of her purse sat down and crossed her legs gallant i stumbled to my desk and found a match to light her cigarette youve been worrying coopie she said reproachfully you and that hewlett cant he stay out of a simple business matter she surprised me it was such a foolish thing to say and she was not foolish i told her very briefly what hewlett lmd said no one had told me to be silent she touched my hand laughing would it make so very much difference martin donners not a monster i dont know that she said impishly i do hes a man like other men martin and really hes not so young even with all the treatments what would you give him with all his treatments twenty more years tops a dictatorship even for twenty minutes is an evil thing miss halloran i said wondering if i had always sounded so completely pompous oh but bad words dont make bad things sakes think what they could call me dear donners only throwing his weight around and doesnt everyone as much weight as he has treason i began but she hardly let me get even the one word out no bad words martin youd be astonished if you knew what wonderful things wayne wants to do it takes a man like him to take care of some problems hell get rid of slums juvenile delinquents gangsters some problems are better not solved hitler solved the jewish question in europe she said sweetly i respect you martin so does wayne you have no idea how much he and dr cooperstock think of you and so do i so please dont do anything impulsive she walked out the room and left it very empty i felt turgid drained and a little bit stupid i had never wanted anything as much as i had wanted her it was several minutes before i began to wonder why she had taken the trouble to entice me in a pointless conversation i knew that nan halloran was her own bank account spent as thriftily as donners billions i wondered what it was that i had had that she was willing to purchase with the small change of a few words and a glimpse of her knees and the scent of her perfume before i had quite come to puzzle the question through while i was still regretting i had had no higherpriced commodity for her my phone rang it was dr cooperstocks nurse hysterical nan hallorans conversation had not been pointless while we were talking two ambulance attendants had come to assist dr cooperstock into a wheelchair and he was gone to whom all things concern on the fourth of may dr cooperstock defected and in the morning of the fifth governor hewlett telephoned me hes not back he said and i said he wasnt and hewlett pausing only a second said well we cant wait any longer the army is moving in i went from my office to the operating room and i was shaking as i scrubbed in it was a splenectomy but the woman was grossly fat with a mild myocarditis that required external circulation it took all of my attention for which i was grateful we were five hours in the room but it was successful and it was not until i was smoking a cigarette in the little or lounge that i began to shake twentyfour nuclear bombs in twentyfour cities and of course one of them the one that we knew was ready to go off was in the city i was in i remembered the power plant off in the hudson river under the bridge yellow brick and green glass it was not more than a mile away and yet i was alive the city was not destroyed there had been no awful blast of heat and concussion i walked into the recovery room to look at the splenectomy she was all right but the nurse stared at me so i went back to my office realizing that i was crying and nan halloran was there waiting for me looking like a drunken doll she pulled herself together as i came in her lipstick was smeared and she shook you win martin she said with a little laugh who would have thought old coopie was such a lion he gave me something for you i poured her a drink what happened oh said she she drank the whiskey politely enough but showing she needed it coopie came to wayne and made a deal politics he said is out of my line but you owe me something ive helped you ill help you more only you must promise that research will be free and well endowed he had it very carefully worked out the man is a genius she giggled and held out her glass funny of course hes a genius so wayne took the hook and said it was a deal what was coopie going to do for him next and coopie offered to show him how to convert the power plant to a different kind of bomb neutrons he said so dr cooperstock had taken the billionaire down into the guarded room and explaining how it wa possible to change the type of nuclear reaction from a simple hot explosion to a cold killing flood of rays that would leave the city unharmed if dead he had diverted the hydrogen fuel supply starved the reaction and shut off the magnetic field that contained it and then he had told donner all deals were off there was nothing hard about rebuilding the field and restarting the reaction of course it only took a few days but donner no longer had days i told wayne said nan halloran gravely draining her glass i told him he should wait until he had all the bombs ready but hes he was hes still but i think not for long hardheaded i have to go now my plump friend and i do thank you for the drink i believe theyre going to arrest me she got up and picked up her white gloves and at the door she paused and said did i tell you ive got so many things on my mind coopies dead he wouldnt let waynes doctors touch him they did arrest her of course but by and by everything calming down they let her go again shes even starring in the movies again you can see her whenever you like ive never gone the letter in the envelope was from dr cooperstock and it said ive pulled their fuses martin for you and the governor and if it kills me as you should know it must please dont think that i mind dying or that i am afraid to live either this is not suicide though i confess that i cannot choose between the fear of living in this world and the fear of what may lie beyond it the leg is very bad you would not even let me wear elastic socks and for the past hour i have been crawling around the inside of donners stainlesssteel plumbing it was really a job for a younger man but i couldnt find one in time so i suppose these are my last words and i wish i could make them meaningful i expect there is a meaning to this science as one of my predecessors once said teller was it has become simpler and more beautiful and surely it has become more wonderful and strange if gravity itself grows old and thin so that the straggling galaxies themselves weaken as they clutch each other it seems somehow a much lesser thing that we too should grow feeble yet i do hate it i am able to bear it at all indeed only through a hope which i never dared confess even to you martin before this when i was young i went to church and dreaded dying for the fear of hellfire when i was older i dreaded nothing and when i was older still i began to dread again the hours my friend in which i held imaginary conversations with the god i denied proving to him martin that he did not exist were endless and then past jehovah and prophets i found another god harsher more awful and more remote i could not pray to him creator of the big bang he who came before the monobloc but i could fear him now i am not afraid of him a galaxy twenty billion years old has given me courage if there was no monobloc there can have been no god who made it i live in the hope of the glorious steady state it was weak and wicked of me to give donner a gun to point at the world therefore and i expect it is fair if i die taking it back but it is not to save the world that i do it but to save my own soul in the galaxies yet to be born for if the steady state is true there is no end to time and infinity is not bounded in any way everything must happen in infinity everything must happen an infinity of times so martin in those times to come when these atoms that compose us come together again under what cisandromedan star i cannot imagine we will meet if there is infinity it is sure and i can hope in that day may we be put together more cleanly martin and may we meet again all of us in shapes of pleasing strength and health members of a race that is i pray a little wiser and more kind that was the letter from dr rhine cooperstock i folded it away i called my secretary on the intercom to tell her that his suite would now be free for another patient and i went out into the spring day to the great black headlines with donners name over all the papers and to the life that copperstock had given back to us all
