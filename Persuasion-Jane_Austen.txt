chapter one sir walter elliot sir walter elliot of kellynch hall in somerset southwest england never read anything except the baronetage he particularly liked to read the pages about his own family walter elliot baronet born march married elizabeth stevenson july three daughters elizabeth born june anne born august and mary born november married charles musgrove december a stillborn son november lady elliot died in heir presumptive william walter elliot the great grandson of the second sir walter this introduction was followed by the history of the elliot family three hundred years of respectability reading it gave sir walter great satisfaction vanity was his principal characteristic he was vain about his noble family and his good looks at fiftyfour he was still a handsome man his friends had been surprised that he had never married again he could have asked lady russell to marry him she was a widow who lived nearby and had been lady elliots closest friend however thirteen years had passed since lady elliots death and sir walter and lady russell were still just good friends and neighbours sir walters favourite daughter was elizabeth she was twentynine but she was still very goodlooking anne was twentysix and had been pretty a few years before but now she was pale and thin mary had grown fat since her marriage lady russell had deep lines around her eyes sir walter took great pleasure in thinking that of all the people he knew only he and elizabeth were still as goodlooking as ever elizabeth will marry a great nobleman he thought and he did not notice that he had been thinking it for the past thirteen years when elizabeth was sixteen she had planned to marry her fathers heir william walter elliot that was the only way she could keep her fathers property when she met the young man she liked him he was invited to kellynch hall but he never came a year later he married a rich woman from a middleclass family elizabeth was angry and upset her life went on rather emptily she went to elegant parties and visited friends she tried to fill the time but it was difficult since she had no talents or interests recently she had been worried about her father he was in debt neither elizabeth nor her father could imagine how to pay these debts both felt that their extravagant lifestyle was essential to the dignity of a noble family lady russell and anne spent hours trying to find a way to save money and pay the debts but every plan for economy they proposed was rejected by sir walter finally he accepted the radical plan of moving to the town of bath there he could live for less money without losing his dignity meanwhile kellynch hall was rented to a gentleman called admiral croft when sir walters lawyer mr shepherd had completed the business arrangements with admiral croft he came to kellynch to report to sir walter admiral croft is very nice said mr shepherd his wifes brother lived in the nearby village of monkford a few years ago perhaps you know the gentleman now what was his name mr shepherd searched his memory but couldnt remember the name of mrs crofts brother he lived in the grey stone house after a moment anne said i suppose you mean mr wentworth ah said sir walter the curate of monkford when you said gentleman i thought you meant a man of property somebody of the nobility mr wentworth was nobody anne left the room quietly and went out into the garden as she walked between the tall trees she thought in a few months perhaps he will be here she was thinking of the curates brother captain frederick wentworth of the royal navy who had spent the year in monkford at that time he was a handsome clever charming young man and anne was a pretty gentle sensitive girl they fell in love and were happy for a short period but when frederick asked sir walter if he could marry anne sir walter was not pleased he thought that fredericks family was not good enough even lady russell who was much more sensible than sir walter disapproved anne was lady russells favourite of the elliot sisters only anne had the gentleness good sense and modesty that lady russell had loved so much in her old friend lady elliot lady russell thought that it was foolish for anne to marry a young man with no money when your father dies she had said hell leave you very little money and no property you need to marry someone rich and so does captain wentworth if you marry each other youll have no money at all and youll both be miserable as a result anne was too gentle to argue against this she broke off her engagement to frederick convinced that it was the best thing for him frederick was angry and hurt im sure that ill earn money and promotion in the navy he said but anne continued to resist him and finally he went to sea that was eight years ago when anne was nineteen very few people knew about the relationship between them his sister mrs croft had been abroad with her husband at the time and annes sister mary had been away at school captain wentworth had never returned to monkford because his brother had moved away in the eight years since captain wentworth had left anne had never fallen in love with anyone else mr charles musgrove had asked her to marry him but she had refused and he had married her sister mary instead anne read about captain wentworths career in the newspapers he had been right his navy career was a great success by now he must be quite rich thought anne sadly he had never married thinking about it now lady russells advice seemed too cautious anne thought she was being prudent but instead she had ruined her life mary lived at uppercross three miles from kellynch hall one day she said to her sister elizabeth when you go to bath please leave anne with me im not well and i need annes help all right said elizabeth no one will miss her in bath elizabeths friend mrs clay a young widow was going to bath with them elizabeth was perfectly happy with the thought of her father and her friend as her only companions anne was also happy with the arrangement and gladly accepted marys invitation she did not like bath she much preferred to stay in the country close to lady russell who appreciated her she and mary did not enjoy each others company but at least mary valued her help and this way she did not have to go to bath there was only one problem with the plan the idea of mrs clay staying for months with elizabeth and sir walter at their house in bath made anne worried mrs clay was not a pretty woman but she was intelligent and friendly anne thought it imprudent to let a pleasant young single woman stay in the house with sir walter for so long a period she told elizabeth this but elizabeth replied nonsense father doesnt find mrs clay attractive besides she isnt from a noble family theres no danger so sir walter elizabeth and mrs clay left for bath and anne moved into marys house mary lived in the cottage the smaller of two houses on a large property owned by her husbands parents mr and mrs musgrove senior lived in the great house anne and mary spent a lot of time with mr and mrs musgrove and their daughters henrietta and louisa they were rather pretty lively fashionable girls who were very popular in the neighbourhood they seemed to enjoy life a lot but the only thing anne was envious of was their friendly feeling towards each other this was very different from annes relationship with either of her sisters chapter two captain wentworth when admiral croft and his wife arrived at kellynch hall mary and charles invited them to the cottage mr and mrs musgrove and their daughters were also invited dear mrs croft said mrs musgrove as soon as the introductions were over did you know that my son dick served in the navy under your brother captain frederick wentworth really asked mrs croft and what does your son do now the poor boy died at sea cried mrs musgrove with tears in her eyes oh im so sorry to hear that said mrs croft but in one of his letters to me he wrote captain wentworth is a fine courageous young gentleman yes he admired your brother very much mrs croft in fact dick musgrove had been a stupid lazy difficult young man so his parents had sent him to sea he was as difficult in the navy as he had been at home when he had died two years before at the age of twenty no one except his mother really felt sorry mrs croft who was a sensible confident straightforward lady tried to comfort mrs musgrove my brother will be very glad to meet you mrs musgrove said mrs croft his career in the navy has been a great success now that the war is over hes back in england hes coming to stay with us at kellynch hall next week anne who was standing nearby heard this and her heart beat fast in agitation the following week henrietta and louisa came to visit anne and mary at the cottage weve met captain wentworth cried henrietta hes very handsome and charming father invited him to dinner this evening yes cried louisa you must all come to meet him im afraid we cant said mary my little boy has a cold we must stay with him this evening well i can go cant i charles asked mary if you want replied mary clearly offended that her husband did not want to stay with her you can both go said anne ill stay here with little charles what a good idea cried mary suddenly happy again charles and mary went to the great house and anne remained at the cottage all evening she thought about the dinner at the great house there frederick wentworth was smiling and talking to other people how does he feel she wondered about meeting me again sooner or later we will have to meet perhaps he feels indifferent or perhaps hell be embarrassed in all these years he has never tried to contact me charles and mary came home late full of enthusiasm for captain wentworth such a friendly young man said mary charles has invited him to go shooting tomorrow after breakfast he invited him to come to breakfast but captain wentworth was afraid of disturbing little charles anne understood it he did not want to see her but anne continued mary he says he knows you he says he met you eight years ago but i dont remember him at all no you were at school then said anne quietly the next morning henrietta and louisa walked down to the cottage with captain wentworth when anne saw captain wentworth walking towards the cottage she blushed and she could hardly breathe from nervousness ah said mary henrietta and louisa have come too they probably want to walk and watch the shooting if you can stay with little charles anne i think ill go with them certainly said anne in a trembling voice and suddenly he was there in the drawing room he bowed to her she curtsied to him her eyes met his briefly then looked away again she heard his voice he made polite conversation with mary for a few minutes and then he was gone with the musgrove sisters charles and mary and anne was left alone in the drawing room thinking thank god thats over captain wentworth wasnt very polite to you anne said mary when she returned as we left the house henrietta asked what he thought of you and he said shes changed so much that hardly recognised her mary being rather insensitive had no idea how much pain her words caused her sister it must be true thought anne but he hasnt changed hes just as goodlooking as ever his comment hurt her but it also made her calm if i have changed so much she thought there is no hope that he will love me as he did before so be calm she told herself if you can be calm you will be content surprised by henriettas question frederick wentworth had told the truth but he had not expected anyone to repeat his comment to anne he had not forgiven anne elliot she had abandoned him and in doing so she had shown weakness of character she had allowed herself to be persuaded by others he had loved her and he had never felt that way again about any other woman he had never met another woman he considered to be equal to her when he came to kellynch he had been curious to meet her again but he thought her power over him was completely gone now that he was rich and the war was over he wanted to settle down with some attractive young woman either of the musgrove sisters could win his heart if she wanted to in fact any attractive young lady could do so except anne elliot when his sister asked him about his intentions he said with a laugh im here sophia to find a wife any young lady can capture me with a little beauty a few smiles and a few compliments about the navy but later he gave his sister a serious description of the kind of wife he wanted the woman marry must have a strong mind and a sweet manner he had not entirely forgotten anne from then on anne was often in frederick wentworths company though never alone with him it was strange to spend hours in the same room with him listening to his voice yet never looking at him closely or talking to him intimately once they had been everything to each other but now they were just acquaintances tell us about your adventures at sea captain wentworth cried louisa one evening you said that your first ship was called the asp did you have any adventures on the asp oh certainly i did replied the captain it was that year i had a strong desire to go to sea and the navy gave me the asp it was an old ship but a fine one that autumn we captured a french ship and brought it into plymouth harbour as we approached plymouth a terrible storm hit us and continued for four days the asp was already damaged from our battles with the french i thought that was the end for me and the asp i said to myself well probably go down to the bottom of the sea together this time but as i said she was a fine old ship and we finally got to the port alive and well henrietta and louisa cried out in pity and horror while anne silently shivered at the terrible thought of him going down to the bottom of the sea your next ship was the laconia wasnt it said mrs musgrove how lucky for us sir frederick looked confused until henrietta whispered to him shes thinking of my brother dick ah said frederick there was something in his face at that moment that suggested to anne that his memories of dick were not happy ones no one else noticed that look only someone who knew him very well could have noticed it he crossed the room sat on the sofa beside mrs musgrove and spoke to her quietly and seriously about her son anne meanwhile sat on the other side of mrs musgrove thinking were on the same sofa however when he got up to leave he bowed to anne with cold politeness like someone who hardly knew her and said good evening chapter three henrietta or louisa the musgroves were cousins of the hayters of winthrop winthrop was a large farm two miles from uppercross and the hayter family were for the most part plain ignorant people for this reason mary was very unhappy that they were connected to the musgrove family she spoke to them as little as possible and never went to winthrop charles hayter the eldest son was better educated and more gentlemanly than his father and his brothers he was a curate and over the past year or so he and henrietta had seemed to be in love with each other he was away on business at the time captain wentworth came to kellynch when he returned after two weeks he found that everything had changed henrietta did not look at him with loving eyes anymore or listen attentively when he spoke both she and louisa gave all their attention to captain wentworth everyone at uppercross seemed to be charmed by the captain but charles hayter did not find him charming at all one evening when they were alone in their room mary said to her husband charles captain wentworth seems to like your sisters very much he spends a lot of time with them do you think hell marry one of them maybe said charles i think perhaps hell marry louisa well louisa is the livelier of the two but henrietta is prettier said mary true her husband replied but i think henrietta is already in love with her cousin charles hayter oh dear i hope not cried mary that hayter family is so common we really dont want to be any more closely connected to them than we already are but charles is in a good position said her husband hes the eldest son so he will inherit winthrop and hes a curate hell probably become curate of the church of uppercross when the old vicar retires well i hope that henrietta will marry captain wentworth instead said mary hes a fine young man and i hear that he made twentyfive thousand pounds during the war thats a splendid fortune the next day louisa henrietta captain wentworth mary charles and anne went for a long walk together mary got tired very early in the walk and began to complain they climbed a hill to see the view there below them was winthrop without beauty and without dignity i had no idea that we were walking towards winthrop cried mary lets go back now im tired henrietta had known the direction of their walk in fact she and louisa had chosen to walk towards winthrop in the hope of seeing their cousin charles hayter he had not been to visit them at uppercross for days and henrietta had begun to feel sorry about paying so much attention to captain wentworth and so little attention to her cousin she looked down at winthrop sadly and not seeing her cousin she replied to mary all right and turned to walk back to uppercross no cried charles and louisa louisa whispered something in her sisters ear then charles said henrietta and i shall go down and say hello to the hayters you can wait for us here we wont be long captain wentworth and louisa went for a walk anne found a place for mary to sit down and rest but mary refused and went off to find herself a more comfortable seat anne was very tired too so she sat down and waited quietly for the others to return after a while she heard louisas voice on the other side of the hedge and so i made henrietta go i knew that she wanted to go to winthrop to see her cousin but shes so weak she always lets herself be persuaded by other people when mary said we should go home she agreed even though she wanted to see her cousin i never let myself be persuaded by other people once i have decided what i want to do no one can persuade me to do something else then frederick spoke shes very fortunate to have you to help her he said if your sister and mr hayter are in love they must be strong they cant let other people influence them your sisters very nice but i see now that you have the stronger character anne sat very still afraid of being seen by the two people on the other side of the hedge well i never let mary tell me what to do louisa replied shes so proud and snobbish i wish anne was charless wife instead do you know that charles wanted to marry anne after a moments pause frederick said did she refuse him yes mother and father think that her friend lady russell persuaded her to refuse she thought that charles wasnt good enough for anne because he doesnt read poetry their voices became quieter as they walked further away anne sat still hardly breathing now she knew what captain wentworth thought of her everything he had said about strength of character and weakness about allowing yourself to be persuaded by others made that perfectly clear he had also shown a curiosity about her which made her heart beat fast charles and henrietta returned from winthrop bringing charles hayter with them henrietta and her cousin looked very happy clearly their misunderstanding was over they began the long walk home louisa and captain wentworth walked in front henrietta and her cousin behind them and charles musgrove was at the back with anne and mary just then mr and mrs croft drove up in their carriage does anyone want a lift to uppercross asked mrs croft im afraid we only have space for one person everyone refused henrietta and louisa were not tired and mary felt offended at not being asked before the others nobody well enjoy your walk said mrs croft but then captain wentworth went up to the carriage and whispered something to his sister miss elliot cried mrs croft you look tired please come with us anne really was tired at first she refused but the admiral and mrs croft insisted and soon she was in the carriage knowing that frederick had worried about her he had seen that she was tired she understood him he could not forgive her for the past and he was now thinking of marrying another woman but even so he could not see her suffer without wanting to help her chapter four lyme regis a week later captain wentworth went to lyme regis to see his friend captain harville when he returned he described the beauties of the town and surrounding countryside to his friends at uppercross they all decided to go to lyme for two days and stay at an inn charles mary anne henrietta louisa and captain wentworth when they arrived they went to the inn and then captain wentworth took them to captain harvilles house captain harville was a tall dark man who had been seriously injured in battle two years before his face was kind and friendly but his injuries had aged him and he looked much older than captain wentworth although they were in fact the same age he lived with his wife his children and his friend captain benwick who had been an officer on the laconia when frederick was captain captain benwick had been engaged to harvilles sister fanny but she had died while captain benwick was at sea ever since he had lived with the harvilles as a member of the family after fannys death captain wentworth had spent an entire week with captain benwick trying to comfort his friend anne saw that the friendships between these three men were very strong and sincere and she thought sadly if i had married him these people would now be my friends too when they left the harvilles house louisa said to captain wentworth what splendid friends you have what kind honest people i think the men in the navy must be the finest men in england they went for a walk by the sea then returned to the inn for dinner anne was looking very pretty the cold wind had made her cheeks pink and her eyes shine as they entered the inn a gentleman dressed in black was going out he looked at anne with great admiration and then stepped to the side politely to let her pass he was not a handsome man but anne thought that his face was that of a pleasant sensible man captain wentworth noticed the gentleman looking at anne and asked the waiter who he was thats mr william walter elliot sir the man replied he has just left us to return to london what a coincidence said mary my fathers heir was here in the same inn the next morning they went for a walk by the sea it was too windy for the ladies to walk on the top of the sea wall so they went down the steps to a path more protected from the wind mary anne and henrietta went down the steps slowly and carefully but louisa asked frederick to hold her hands while she jumped from the top step to the path below its too dangerous said frederick oh please louisa insisted i want to jump just hold my hands and ill jump down i really dont think its a good idea said frederick you might fall you cant persuade me cried louisa when i want to do something i do it so frederick held her hands and she jumped but when she landed on the lower path she slipped on the wet stone and she fell and hit her head she lay unconscious on the path her face went very white and she did not seem to be breathing shes dead shes dead cried mary henrietta fainted from the shock poor charles was trying to comfort his wife and hold henrietta up at the same time frederick on his knees by louisas side cried out will someone help me anne came up to charles put her arms around henrietta and mary and said charles go and help the captain quickly i can take care of mary and henrietta frederick looked up at charles and said what shall we do go and get a doctor cried anne youre right said frederick you go and find a doctor charles ill wait for you here shouldnt we take her to the inn and wait for the doctor there asked anne good idea said frederick or wait harvilles house is closer ill take her there charles bring the doctor to harvilles house charles ran off to find a doctor frederick carried louisa to his friends house and anne with the help of some local people followed with mary and henrietta half an hour later the doctor told them that louisas injuries were not serious someone must go and tell her parents what has happened said frederick please will you go captain said charles i want to stay with my sister certainly replied frederick i will take the other ladies home but i think anne should stay here with you theres no one more capable than anne nonsense said mary i should stay with my husband and his sister anne can go home with you and so it was decided mary and charles stayed at the harvilles house with louisa while anne henrietta and frederick took the inns carriage to uppercross in the carriage frederick spoke mostly to henrietta anne sat quietly beside him and listened at one point he said i should have stopped her i should have insisted but dear sweet louisa has such a strong character she wont be persuaded by anyone anne wondered whether he now questioned the opinions he had expressed so confidently behind the hedge perhaps now he realised that like other qualities of the mind strength of character should have its proportions and limits as they approached uppercross henrietta fell asleep frederick then said to anne in a low voice ive been thinking about what we should do when we get there i think it will upset henrietta too much to be present when i tell her parents do you think its a good idea for you to stay with her in the carriage until ive told them yes i do whispered anne she was very glad that he had asked for her opinion very glad that he valued her thought her capable and treated her as a friend it was a great pleasure to her when they got to the great house frederick went in and told mr and mrs musgrove what had happened then he came back to the carriage and helped henrietta into the house finally he took the carriage back to lyme leaving anne with the musgroves the next day anne received a letter from lady russell saying that she was now home in kellynch and inviting anne to come and stay with her anne wrote back and told lady russell about the accident at lyme im so glad that youre home as soon as mary and charles get back from lyme ill pack my bags and come to your house she was glad she had missed her friend but at the same time she was worried what will lady russell think of me spending all that time in captain wentworths company two days later she was at her friends house how pretty you look my dear cried lady russell when anne walked in i havent seen you look so well for years anne was pleased she remembered the look of admiration that william walter elliot her fathers heir had given her at the inn while he was leaving perhaps i really am pretty again she thought lady russell sat down beside anne and said i hear youve been spending a lot of time with captain wentworth she sat waiting for an answer yes replied anne trying not to seem agitated he came to see the musgroves almost every day so of course i saw him often i think he is in love with louisa really said lady russell and she thought with angry pleasure how can a man who once appreciated the value of anne elliot now eight years later possibly be charmed by louisa musgrove well lady russell continued admiral and mrs croft have gone to visit friends in the north so he probably wont come back to this neighbourhood i think mrs croft said he was going to stay with his brother in shropshire oh said anne chapter five bath anne stayed at lady russells house in kellynch for a month then they both went to bath lady russell had rented a house for herself there anne wished she could stay with her friend but she had to stay at her fathers house with elizabeth and mrs clay when they arrived sir walter elizabeth and mrs clay seemed to be in good spirits and welcomed anne more warmly than she had expected elizabeth told them that william walter elliot had been visiting them often over the past two weeks he was in bath staying with his friend colonel wallis and his wife and new baby its surprising that he visits you so often said lady russell ive never liked the man because he showed no respect for the family he never came to see you while his wife was alive i suppose now that she is dead he is beginning to value his family anne was slightly confused when she had seen him in lyme she had thought that mr elliot seemed a sensible man why anne asked herself is he so interested in making friends with the family now after all these years she thought perhaps it was for elizabeth certainly elizabeth herself and mrs clay thought so that evening mr william walter elliot came to visit when he saw anne his face showed surprise and pleasure my dear cousin he said i saw you just a few weeks ago at lyme but i had no idea that it was you he sat between anne and lady russell his manners were very pleasant he asked anne why she had been in lyme and when she mentioned the accident he was interested and sympathetic he wanted to know every detail then he spoke to lady russell about the years in which there had been no communication between himself and sir walter it was all a misunderstanding he said i thought i had offended him that he didnt want to see me anymore but now i realise that was a mistake im so sorry that i missed all those years of his company after he left lady russell cried what a nice man is this really the same mr elliot i used to dislike him but now he seems completely admirable hes intelligent sophisticated polite and friendly he has the right opinions and strong family feelings anne went to bed that night with a smile on her face her first evening in bath had been surprisingly pleasant the only thing that disturbed annes first few days in bath was her fear that her father was falling in love with mrs clay when mrs clay was in the room with him he talked to her a lot and when she was out of the room he referred to her often mrs clay thinks this and mrs clay says that one evening when mr william walter elliot and lady russell were visiting them sir walter and elizabeth spoke with great enthusiasm about sir walters cousin lady dalrymple she has come to bath and has rented a beautiful house in laura place which is of course the best street in town said sir walter since we are cousins i called on her immediately and she invited us to tea yes said elizabeth shes a really charming lady and her carriage is the most splendid one in bath anne was embarrassed she had never seen her father and sister in contact with nobility before and she felt ashamed of them usually she considered them too proud too conscious of their own position in society and snobbish towards anyone they considered inferior but now for the first time she wished they had more pride she wished they did not show so openly how important it was to them for lady dalrymple to recognise them and treat them as equals lady dalrymple was pleasant enough but she was nothing special she was not intelligent or cultured certainly she smiled at everyone but the only reason elizabeth called her charming was because she was a wealthy aristocrat mr elliot turned to anne and said in a low voice im so glad that sir walter has found good company in bath anne smiled and replied my idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever welleducated people who can make interesting conversation youre mistaken he said gently that is not good company that is the best to be good company you need only to be from a respectable family and have nice manners well said anne im proud of my family and i dont like to see them trying so hard to be friendly with lady dalrymple simply because shes an aristocrat we agree on one thing at least replied mr elliot i too am proud of my family and i would rather see sir walter being friendly with lady dalrymple than with others who are below him he glanced at mrs clay although anne was sure that mr elliots pride was different from hers she was glad that he did not like mrs clay the following week they were all invited to lady dalrymples house anne said that she could not go because she had already made plans to visit a friend of hers mrs smith they had been at school together years ago but now mrs smith was a poor widow her husband mr smith had been wealthy but had lost all his money now mrs smith had very little money to live on and she was in bad health sir walter thought that anne was foolish to waste her time with such a person the next day lady russell told anne all about their evening at lady dalrymples house my dear mr elliot was very sorry that you werent there but he said he admired you for wanting to visit your old friend he thinks that youre an extraordinary young woman a model of female excellence we discussed your virtues for half an hour hearing this gave anne great pleasure just as lady russell had planned lady russell had now decided that mr elliot was an excellent gentleman she was sure that he wanted to marry anne she told anne her thoughts on the subject after a moment anne replied mr elliot is a nice man but we are not compatible just think said lady russell if you marry mr elliot you will have your dear mothers name her position and your old home this vision affected anne very deeply yes she would love to be lady elliot of kellynch hall but she did not want to marry mr elliot there was only one man she had ever wanted to marry and besides she had doubts about mr elliots sincerity he was clever friendly interesting and polite but he was not open he had suggested to her that he disliked mrs clay yet he was just as charming to mrs clay as to everyone else he never expressed anger or pleasure at the good or evil of others she preferred people who occasionally made mistakes but were warmhearted and sincere chapter six a surprise in february the crofts came to bath when they arrived mrs croft sent a note to anne inviting her to visit them the same day anne received a letter from mary dear anne i am sorry not to have written for so long but now i really must write to tell you some interesting news last tuesday louisa came home from lyme to the great house here at uppercross mr and mrs harville and captain benwick came with her as soon as they arrived captain benwick asked to speak with mr musgrove in private what do you think he asked mr musgrove if he could marry louisa mr musgrove agreed and now they are engaged what a surprise we thought that louisa was going to marry captain wentworth when she read this annes heart beat fast and she blushed at the thought that captain wentworth was now free she was full of joy she left the house with the idea of going to visit the crofts but on the way she met admiral croft ah miss elliot what a pleasure to see you said the admiral do you have time to take a little walk with me i have some news for you certainly said anne im so glad that you and mrs croft have come to bath what is the news its miss louisa musgrove he said i thought that sophias brother frederick was going to marry her but now it seems shes going to marry james benwick really said anne i hope that this hasnt caused problems between captain wentworth and captain benwick they are such good friends i dont think so said the admiral frederick wrote and told us all about it he didnt seem angry or disappointed perhaps we were all mistaken in thinking he was in love with her after her accident you know we thought he would stay in lyme until she was better but after two weeks he went off to stay with his brother in shropshire if he was thinking of marrying her hell have to start all over again with somebody else i think we should invite him to stay with us in bath in fact while anne was taking her walk with admiral croft captain wentworth was already on his way to bath and the next time anne went out she saw him she was walking with mr elliot elizabeth and mrs clay when suddenly she saw captain wentworth walking towards them with some of his navy friends and their wives she felt confused lost and embarrassed about her own feelings which were somewhere between delight and misery captain wentworth saw her and immediately went red in the face he seemed even more confused and agitated by the sight of her than she was by the sight of him they stopped and spoke to each other like polite acquaintances anne noticed that elizabeth turned away as if she did not know him when anne and her companions were gone one of the ladies in captain wentworths group said its clear that mr elliot likes his cousin yes replied another lady hes always with them and he always walks with his cousin anne what a goodlooking man he is and anne elliot is very pretty if you look at her closely said the first lady most people think her sister is prettier but i dont captain wentworth listened to them in silence as he walked he had recognised mr elliot immediately from the one time he had seen him in lyme days passed and anne had no opportunity of seeing captain wentworth he moved in a different social circle his friends went to concerts and the theatre her friends spent their time in the elegant stupidity of private parties but at last there was an opportunity a special concert that lady dalrymple had promised to attend sir walter elizabeth mrs clay mr elliot lady russell and anne were all going with her sir walter his two daughters and mrs clay were the first to arrive at the concert hall they stood by the fire in the large entrance room waiting for the others captain wentworth walked in alone he was simply going to bow and move on but anne stepped forward and said hello he stopped and made polite conversation with her sir walter made a slight bow to captain wentworth and elizabeth curtsied captain wentworth bowed to them when they had discussed the weather bath and the concert there was a pause in the conversation then captain wentworth said have you heard louisas accident in lyme did produce one good result shes engaged to be married to benwick yes i heard said anne i hope they will be very happy said the captain they have no difficulties at home mr and mrs musgrove are behaving very honourably and kindly they dont oppose the marriage even though louisa could have found a richer man he stopped speaking suddenly when he noticed that anne was blushing and looking at the ground then he realised that his words might seem to refer to their own past i was surprised by their engagement he continued a little nervously they are so different louisa is a very sweet friendly girl and shes not stupid but benwick is something more hes a really intelligent man he reads a lot and thinks deeply fanny harville was like him in that way she was an extraordinary woman and his love for her was real a man doesnt get over the loss of a woman like that im surprised that hes able to love someone else at all especially so soon after fannys death anne was breathing very quickly and feeling a hundred things at the same time but they were in a public place surrounded by other people she tried to bring their conversation back to everyday things i would like to go to lyme again she said but you had such a terrible experience there im surprised you want to go back my memories of lyme are not all bad said anne just then lady dalrymple and the others came in and anne had to leave the captain when they took their seats in the concert hall anne looked around hoping to see him mr elliot sat beside her and began talking to her in a low voice im so glad i can sit beside you this evening he said on thursday im going to visit some friends in thornberry and i wont be back until friday evening ill miss the pleasure of your company the concert opened with some italian love songs and the texts were included in the concert programme mr elliot asked anne to translate them for him and she did so you are so clever he said oh replied anne not really my italian isnt very good and modest too modest said mr elliot youve only known me a few weeks said anne you dont know my character well yet perhaps i know more about you than you think he replied i heard about your character long before i came to bath really said anne in great surprise who spoke about me to you ill tell you some other time not now said mr elliot for now all ill say is that the name anne elliot has for many years been an interesting one for me i hope that name will never change anne looked away from him in embarrassment she did not want to talk to him anymore she wished he wasnt sitting next to her just then she heard lady dalrymple say to her father a very fine young man who is he captain wentworth sir walter replied i know him only slightly anne looked in the direction in which they were looking and saw him he was looking at her just as her eyes met his he looked away mr elliot said lady dalrymple during the interval come and sit beside me i want to ask you something to annes relief mr elliot moved away the seat beside her was now empty and after a few minutes captain wentworth came over to talk to her he looked unhappy something must have happened since they had spoken in the entrance room anne thought that perhaps lady russell or her father had glanced at him in an unpleasant way do you like the concert she asked no the music isnt very good he replied i think ill leave now the next song is beautiful its worth waiting for said anne no he said in a voice full of emotion theres no reason for me to stay and he left hes jealous of mr elliot thought anne for a moment this thought gave her great pleasure but then she felt hopeless and depressed how could she tell him the truth how could she let him know that she did not care for mr elliot at all chapter seven mrs smith tells all the next day anne went to visit mrs smith she was glad to get out of the house she did not want to see mr elliot and he was sure to visit sir walter my friend tells me that mr elliot is often at your house said mrs smith when they were sitting in her small room drinking tea who is your friend asked anne mrs rooke shes a nurse and she works for colonel wallis you know his wife has just had a baby yes and colonel wallis is mr elliots friend do you know mr elliot i used to know him very well said mrs smithbut i havent seen him for three years now did you ever talk about me to him asked anne yes i did i often spoke about your fine character your modesty and intelligence it was at the time when he met your father and sister before his marriage speaking of marriage mrs rooke tells me that mrs wallis thinks you will marry mr elliot well said anne mrs wallis is mistaken mr elliot hasnt asked me to marry him and if he did i would refuse him im glad to hear youre not engaged to him you dont know his real character please tell me about it ive often wondered what he was like when he was young mrs smith looked at anne with a serious expression on her face mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience she said angrily he thinks only of himself my husband was his close friend before we were married and after our marriage i became his friend too i thought he was a fine young gentleman then i remember when he met your father and sister and they invited him to kellynch he spent the evening with us afterwards and told us the whole story he laughed at your father and said he knew that sir walter wanted him to marry his daughter but he had no money and he wanted to marry a rich woman he knew that he would get kellynch hall and the title anyway even if he didnt marry elizabeth at that time he didnt care at all about the honour of his family he once said that if titles could be sold he would sell his for fifty pounds anne was shocked and angry but why has he been so friendly to us since he came to bath she asked ah well people change you see that was years ago when he was a young man now he cares a lot about the family honour and the title colonel wallis told him that mrs clay was staying with your sister and that she was trying to make sir walter fall in love with her how do you know you said you havent spoken to him for three years mrs rooke again replied mrs smith you see colonel wallis tells his wife everything and mrs wallis tells her nurse everything and mrs rooke very kindly told me she said that when mr elliot heard about mrs clay he decided to make friends with sir walter and separate him from mrs clay he has spoken to mrs clay in private and warned her not to try to win sir walters affections mrs clay is afraid of him and doesnt want to spend a lot of time with sir walter while mr elliot is present and so he spends as much time as possible with sir walter you see mr elliot is afraid that sir walter might marry her and have a son then he wouldnt inherit kellynch hall this is terrible said anne yes said mrs smith as i said hes a heartless man but for me the clearest example of it is the way he treated my poor husband and the way he has treated me since my husband died after his marriage mr elliot was very rich my husband was never good at managing money and he was getting into serious financial difficulties mr elliot did nothing to help him before my husband died he had made mr elliot the executor of his will if mr elliot had tried a bit harder and invested a little of his own money my husbands property in the west indies would now be mine but he did nothing and now the bank owns the property so you see its mr elliots fault that im so poor ive written him several letters asking him for help but he always refuses here are some of the letters ive received from him mrs smith handed anne a packet of letters as she read them anne felt more and more angry each letter showed coldness and hardhearted indifference as she walked home anne thought about her conversation with mrs smith she wanted to tell her family immediately but she knew that they would not listen to her she decided that she would tell lady russell and ask her advice the idea of mr elliots interest in her now filled her with disgust at least he was going to be away at thornberry for two days and she would not have to talk to him she shivered at the thought that lady russell might have persuaded her to marry him then she would have discovered his true character when it was too late when she got home she found charles and mary there they had come to bath for a few days with captain harville henrietta and mrs musgrove they were all staying at the white hart inn anne was surprised and really glad to see them before she left mary turned to anne and said you must come and spend the day with us at the inn tomorrow we have so much to talk about and mrs musgrove and henrietta want to tell you all about the wedding plans the next morning anne went to the white hart captain wentworth was there visiting his friend captain harville anne tried to be calm if he still loves me and i still love him which i certainly do she thought surely well understand each other before long anne cried mary who was standing by the window come and look theres mrs clay and mr elliot it cant be said anne going to the window hes in thornberry until tomorrow evening captain wentworth was looking at her and she felt sorry that she had spoken she turned and looked out of the window it really was mr elliot in order to correct any wrong impression her words might have given captain wentworth she said oh it is him i must have been mistaken i wasnt listening very closely when he spoke about his plans charles went up to mrs musgrove and said mother i have a surprise for you i have taken a box at the theatre for tomorrow night i know you love the theatre theres space for nine people captain wentworth says hell come and i know anne likes the theatre we all do charles cried mary youve forgotten that my father is giving a party tomorrow night and were all invited lady dalrymple will be there and mr elliot my fathers heir surely you want to meet him why should i said charles mr elliot is nothing to me captain wentworth had been listening intently to this conversation at this last remark captain wentworths eyes moved from charles to anne then mrs musgrove said to charles youd better go back to the theatre and change the box to tuesday night if theres a party at her fathers house anne will have to go to it and we dont want to go to the theatre without anne id much prefer to go to the theatre than stay home for my fathers party said anne but perhaps it would be best to go on tuesday instead captain wentworth came over and sat by anne dont you like parties he asked no she replied i remember you didnt use to like them but people change over time i havent changed much said anne hoping to suggest to him that her love was unchanged but then she realised he might think she meant the opposite that she would still refuse to marry him she fell silent and blushed in confusion eight and a half years is a very long time he said just then the door opened and sir walter elizabeth and mrs clay came in weve come with invitations to our party said elizabeth and she handed an invitation to everyone there including captain wentworth captain wentworth thanked her but did not say whether he would come to the party after they had left he stood staring at the invitation in confusion anne understood him he could not accept the invitation as an apology for all their insulting behaviour in the past that evening at home she thought about these things a lot would captain wentworth come to the party she had no idea turning to mrs clay she said i saw you talking to mr elliot in the street today i had thought he was in thornberry oh yes i forgot to tell you said mrs clay i was surprised to see him too he told me why he hadnt yet left for thornberry but i forget what he said i wasnt really listening i remember he said that he would definitely be back in time for the party tomorrow chapter eight a conversation with captain harville anne spent the next day with her friends at the white hart inn captain wentworth was there too he asked if he could write a letter mrs musgrove showed him the writing table and brought him pen and paper captain harville who was standing by the window not far away from captain wentworths table smiled at anne she went and stood by him he was holding a small painting and he showed it to her do you know who that is he asked certainly its captain benwick yes and hes giving it to miss louisa musgrove but it wasnt painted for her he had it done for my poor sister and now he has asked me to bring it to bath he wants to have it framed so that he can give it to another woman captain wentworth is writing to him now to tell him when it will be ready im glad that benwick has found someone else but poor fanny he said with strong emotion she wouldnt have forgotten him so quickly no said anne i dont think any woman who has truly loved can forget we dont forget you as soon as you forget us we live at home quietly with nothing to distract us from our feelings you always have business of some sort to take you back into the world immediately your lives are filled with activity and so its easier for you to forget but benwick has not been busy out in the world said captain harville hes been living very quietly with us true said anne well if it isnt the result of the differences between mens and womens lives it must be the differences between their natures no no i dont think its more in mans nature than in womans to forget about love i believe the opposite our bodies are stronger than yours and so are our feelings your feelings may be stronger said anne but ours are more tender i too will make a comparison between the mind and the body man is more robust than woman but he doesnt live longer they were interrupted by the sound of captain wentworths pen falling to the floor captain harville turned to him and asked have you finished your letter ill be five minutes then we can go was the reply then captain harville turned back to anne and said all literature is against you you know poetry and novels all talk of womans inconstancy but perhaps youll say they were all written by men perhaps i will said anne with a smile its easier for men to tell their own story theyre much better educated than we are no books prove nothing we can only speak from our own experience well in my experience men suffer a great deal in love when a sailor goes to sea leaving his wife and children behind wondering if hell ever see them again he suffers greatly then he thinks of them every day until he returns oh cried anne im sure thats true i didnt mean to suggest that only women are capable of true love and loyalty i only meant to say that men forget more easily when the object of their love has gone but women go on loving even when there is no hope she stopped speaking because she felt too much emotion to continue captain wentworth stood up and said to his friend ive finished we can go now captain harville said goodbye to anne and went off to say goodbye to mrs musgrove captain wentworth looked at her with strong emotion in his eyes there were two letters in his hand he gave her one of them quickly so that no one else would see then he was gone anne looked down at the letter her name was written on the envelope her heart beat fast her whole happiness depended on the contents of that letter she sat down at the writing desk opened the letter with a trembling hand and read the following words i cannot listen in silence anymore listening to you i feel both pain and hope tell me that i am not too late i offer myself to you again i love you even more than i did eight and a half years ago when you broke my heart please do not believe that man forgets about love sooner than woman i have loved no one else i was angry with you and i could not forgive you but i was never inconstant i came to bath because you were here i think about nothing but you have you not noticed do you not see that i love you i did not tell you my feelings earlier because i was afraid you did not love me anymore please believe that i have always loved you and i always will i have to go now but i will come back as soon as possible a word a look from you will be enough to tell me whether i enter your fathers house this evening or never f w anne put the letter down with tears in her eyes she had to get out of this room out of the inn and away from other people she went to mrs musgrove and said im afraid i must go home now are you ill you look very pale then charles came up to mrs musgrove and said he had to go out i have an appointment it wont take long ill be back in half an hour all right said mrs musgrove but charles will you please take anne home first shes feeling ill certainly said charles and they left chapter nine union street anne could not feel angry with charles or mrs musgrove they were both so kind but she felt frustrated she wanted to be alone she wanted above all to find captain wentworth and talk to him when they were walking up union street captain wentworth saw them and crossed the street to walk with them he looked at anne nervously she blushed and looked at him with an expression she hoped would show her true feelings ah captain wentworth said charles are you going towards annes house shes not feeling well and must go home i have an appointment in five minutes could you please walk her home of course said captain wentworth charles said goodbye and left them anne and frederick walked on together slowly they were surrounded by people on the busy street but they did not notice them soon they had expressed again all those feelings of love which eight and a half years earlier had made their future seem so secure now they were older wiser and stronger than they had been then and their love was based on a fuller knowledge of each others character i never loved louisa musgrove he said i tried to like her and was thinking of marrying her because i wanted to marry i wanted to have children and a home and i was too angry and proud to ask you again i had thought for years that you were too weak too easily persuaded by other people but in lyme i saw the dangers of the opposite a character that would not be persuaded at all i began to realise your true excellence when louisa had her accident you were so strong so capable so fine i realised then that your character is the perfect balance of strength and gentleness but by that point people thought that louisa and i would get married perhaps even she thought so i felt that the only honourable thing to do would be to marry her if she wanted me in the hope that she would forget me i went to stay with my brother in shropshire feeling lost and depressed then harville wrote to me and told me that louisa was engaged to benwick i came immediately to bath to find you but then i saw you with mr elliot everyone in bath was sure that you would marry him and i was afraid that lady russell would persuade you to do so they had reached her house they said goodbye and anne ran up to her room feeling happier than she had ever felt before the evening came and the guests arrived annes happiness made her cheeks pink and her eyes bright she looked lovely as she moved through the rooms talking to the guests lady dalrymple and mr elliot were there but she did not care no one could affect her happiness she did not mind the snobbish irritating things her father and elizabeth said she did not mind mrs clay standing by her fathers side she talked to mrs musgrove and the crofts and captain harville she tried to talk to lady russell but found it impossible sometimes captain wentworth came and talked to her sometimes she saw him across the room talking to someone else but looking at her at one point they stood side by side pretending to admire the plants ive been thinking about the past said anne and trying to decide if i was right or wrong to follow my friends advice i think i was right i dont mean that i think her advice was good she was too prudent and i would never give such advice to a young person now but i think i was right to do as she advised she said that if we married we would be poor and we would both be miserable if i had married you then i would have felt guilty i would have felt that i was the cause of any financial worries you might have in the years ahead now i have nothing to feel guilty about i hope one day you will be able to forgive lady russell and to like her more than you do now captain wentworth looked across the room at lady russell maybe one day he said i too have been thinking and ive decided that one person was more my enemy than lady russell and that person was myself tell me if i had come to you two years later in with a few thousand pounds would you have married me then oh yes good god he cried i was such a fool i wanted to do it but i was too proud to ask you again i didnt understand you i shut my eyes and refused to understand you i ought to forgive everyone before i forgive myself this realisation is a new pain for me ive always thought of myself as a man who works hard and gets what he deserves now ill have to get used to being happier than i deserve to be who can be in doubt about what followed if two young people decide to marry theyll probably do so even if they have no money have no common sense and are completely incompatible this may be a bad moral with which to end my story but i believe it to be true and if couples like that succeed can you doubt that captain wentworth and anne elliot with the advantages of maturity intelligence and twentyfive thousand pounds succeeded too sir walter and elizabeth were not enthusiastic but they did not oppose the marriage now that captain wentworth was at the top of his profession and had earned a fine fortune in the war sir walter could not say that he was nobody he was now good enough to marry the daughter of a foolish spendthrift baronet annes only real worry was for lady russell she had told her friend everything that mrs smith had told her about mr elliots true character anne knew that lady russell must be suffering from the knowledge that she had been wrong about both mr elliot and captain wentworth she had mistaken manners for character in both cases anne though so much younger than lady russell was a much better judge of character but lady russell was a good woman and her greatest concern was annes happiness very soon she began to feel affection for the man who had made anne happy mary was very pleased about the marriage captain wentworth was much richer and better looking than either charles hayter or captain benwick so she felt that her own sister had done better than her husbands sisters and this gave her great pleasure soon after anne and frederick announced their engagement mr elliot left bath elizabeth had always believed that he was there for her so she felt humiliated by his departure mr elliot was shocked and upset by the news of annes engagement he had hoped to marry her so that he could watch sir walter more closely and make sure he did not marry again but since that plan had not worked he made a new plan for his own comfort and pleasure he left bath and mrs clay left soon afterwards she moved into a house in london and mr elliot paid the rent he was often seen at her house and people said that though he had stopped mrs clay from becoming the wife of sir walter she might one day convince him to make her the wife of sir william when frederick heard mrs smiths story and how she had helped anne to understand what kind of man mr elliot really was he felt very friendly and grateful towards her he became as good a friend to her as anne was she was their first guest when they were settled in their new home frederick wrote letters to the west indies and worked hard to help mrs smith to get her west indian property back so that mrs smith finally had enough money to live a quiet contented life anne and frederick were very happy together annes only worry was that a future war might take him away from her but she was very proud to be a sailors wife she felt that the men of the navy were the finest men in england the end
