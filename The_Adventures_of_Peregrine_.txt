the adventures of peregrine pickle volume i chapter i an account of mr gamaliel pickle the disposition of his sister described he yields to her solicitations and returns to the country in a certain county of england bounded on one side by the sea and at the distance of one hundred miles from the metropolis lived gamaliel pickle esq the father of that hero whose fortunes we propose to record he was the son of a merchant in london who like rome from small beginnings had raised himself to the highest honours of the city and acquired a plentiful fortune though to his infinite regret he died before it amounted to a plum conjuring his son as he respected the last injunction of a parent to imitate his industry and adhere to his maxims until he should have made up the deficiency which was a sum considerably less than fifteen thousand pounds this pathetic remonstrance had the desired effect upon his representative who spared no pains to fulfil the request of the deceased but exerted all the capacity with which nature had endowed him in a series of efforts which however did not succeed for by the time he bad been fifteen years in trade he found himself five thousand pounds worse than he was when he first took possession of his fathers effects a circumstance that affected him so nearly as to detach his inclinations from business and induce him to retire from the world to some place where he might at leisure deplore his misfortunes and by frugality secure himself from want and the apprehensions of a jail with which his imagination was incessantly haunted he was often heard to express his fears of coming upon the parish and to bless god that on account of his having been so long a housekeeper he was entitled to that provision in short his talents were not naturally active and there was a sort of inconsistency in his character for with all the desire of amassing which any citizen could possibly entertain he was encumbered by a certain indolence and sluggishness that prevailed over every interested consideration and even hindered him from profiting by that singleness of apprehension and moderation of appetites which have so frequently conduced to the acquisition of immense fortunes qualities which he possessed in a very remarkable degree nature in all probability had mixed little or nothing inflammable in his composition or whatever seeds of excess she might have sown within him were effectually stifled and destroyed by the austerity of his education the sallies of his youth far from being inordinate or criminal never exceeded the bounds of that decent jollity which an extraordinary pot on extraordinary occasions may be supposed to have produced in a club of sedate bookkeepers whose imaginations were neither very warm nor luxuriant little subject to refined sensations he was scarce ever disturbed with violent emotions of any kind the passion of love never interrupted his tranquility and if as mr creech says after horace not to admire is all the art i know to make men happy and to keep them so mr pickle was undoubtedly possessed of that invaluable secret at least he was never known to betray the faintest symptom of transport except one evening at the club where he observed with some demonstrations of vivacity that he had dined upon a delicate loin of veal notwithstanding this appearance of phlegm he could not help feeling his disappointments in trade and upon the failure of a certain underwriter by which he lost five hundred pounds declared his design of relinquishing business and retiring to the country in this resolution he was comforted and encouraged by his only sister mrs grizzle who had managed his family since the death of his father and was now in the thirtieth year of her maidenhood with a fortune of five thousand pounds and a large stock of economy and devotion these qualifications one would think might have been the means of abridging the term of her celibacy as she never expressed any aversion to wedlock but it seems she was too delicate in her choice to find a mate to her inclination in the city for i cannot suppose that she remained so long unsolicited though the charms of her person were not altogether enchanting nor her manner over and above agreeable exclusive of a very wan not to call it sallow complexion which perhaps was the effects of her virginity and mortification she had a cast in her eyes that was not at all engaging and such an extent of mouth as no art or affectation could contract into any proportionable dimension then her piety was rather peevish than resigned and did not in the least diminish a certain stateliness in her demeanour and conversation that delighted in communicating the importance and honour of her family which by the bye was not to be traced two generations back by all the power of heraldry or tradition she seemed to have renounced all the ideas she had acquired before her father served the office of sheriff and the eye which regulated the dates of all her observation was the mayoralty of her papa nay so solicitous was this good lady for the support and propagation of the family name that suppressing every selfish motive she actually prevailed upon her brother to combat with his own disposition and even surmount it so far as to declare a passion for the person whom he afterwards wedded as we shall see in the sequel indeed she was the spur that instigated him in all his extraordinary undertakings and i question whether be would or not have been able to disengage himself from that course of life in which he had so long mechanically moved unless he had been roused and actuated by her incessant exhortations london she observed was a receptacle of iniquity where an honest unsuspecting man was every day in danger of falling a sacrifice to craft where innocence was exposed to continual temptations and virtue eternally persecuted by malice and slander where everything was ruled by caprice and corruption and merit utterly discouraged and despised this last imputation she pronounced with such emphasis and chagrin as plainly denoted how far she considered herself as an example of what she advanced and really the charge was justified by the constructions that were put upon her retreat by her female friends who far from imputing it to the laudable motives that induced her insinuated in sarcastic commendations that she had good reason to be dissatisfied with a place where she had been so overlooked and that it was certainly her wisest course to make her last effort in the country where in all probability her talents would be less eclipsed and her fortune more attractive be this as it will her admonitions though they were powerful enough to convince would have been insufficient to overcome the languor and vis inertiae of her brother had she not reinforced her arguments by calling in question the credit of two or three merchants with whom he was embarked in trade alarmed at these hints of intelligence be exerted himself effectually he withdrew his money from trade and laying it out in bankstock and indiabonds removed to a house in the country which his father had built near the seaside for the convenience of carrying on a certain branch of traffic in which he had been deeply concerned here then mr pickle fixed his habitation for life in the sixandthirtieth year of his age and though the pangs he felt at parting with his intimate companions and quitting all his former connections were not quite so keen as to produce any dangerous disorder in his constitution he did not fail to be extremely disconcerted at his first entrance into a scene of life to which he was totally a stranger not but that he met with abundance of people in the country who in consideration of his fortune courted his acquaintance and breathed nothing but friendship and hospitality yet even the trouble of receiving and returning these civilities was an intolerable fatigue to a man of his habits and disposition he therefore left the care of the ceremonial to his sister who indulged herself in all the pride of formality while he himself having made a discovery of a publichouse in the neighbourhood went thither every evening and enjoyed his pipe and can being very well satisfied with the behaviour of the landlord whose communicative temper was a great comfort to his own taciturnity for he shunned all superfluity of speech as much as he avoided any other unnecessary expense chapter ii he is made acquainted with the characters of commodore trunnion and his adherents meets with them by accident and contracts an intimacy with that commander this loquacious publican soon gave him sketches of all the characters in the county and among others described that of his next neighbour commodore trunnion which was altogether singular and odd the commodore and your worship said he will in a short time be hand and glove he has a power of money and spends it like a prince that is in his own way for to be sure he is a little humorsome as the saying is and swears woundily though ill be sworn he means no more harm than a sucking babe lord help us it will do your honours heart good to hear him tell a story as how he lay alongside of the french yardarm and yardarm board and board and of heaving grapplings and stinkpots and grapes and round and doubleheaded partridges crows and carters lord have mercy upon us he has been a great warrior in his time and lost an eye and a heel in the service then he does not live like any other christian landman but keeps garrison in his house as if he were in the midst of his enemies and makes his servants turn out in the night watch and watch as he calls it all the year round his habitation is defended by a ditch over which he has laid a drawbridge and planted his courtyard with patereroes continually loaded with shot under the direction of one mr hatchway who had one of his legs shot away while he acted as lieutenant on board the commodores ship and now being on halfpay lives with him as his companion the lieutenant is a very brave man a great joker and as the saying is hath got the length of his commanders foot though he has another favourite in the house called tom pipes that was his boatswains mate and now keeps the servants in order tom is a man of few words but an excellent hand at a song concerning the boatswains whistle hustlecap and chuckfarthing there is not such another pipe in the county so that the commodore lives very happy in his own manner though he be sometimes thrown into perilous passions and quandaries by the application of his poor kinsmen whom he cant abide because as how some of them were the first occasion of his going to sea then he sweats with agony at the sight of an attorney just for all the world as some people have an antipathy to a cat for it seems he was once at law for striking one of his officers and cast in a swinging sum he is moreover exceedingly afflicted with goblins that disturb his rest and keep such a racket in his house that you would think god bless us all the devils in hell had broke loose upon him it was no longer ago than last year about this time that he was tormented the livelong night by the mischievous spirits that got into his chamber and played a thousand pranks about his hammock for there is not one bed within his walls well sir he rang his bell called up all his servants got lights and made a thorough search but the devil a goblin was to be found he had no sooner turned in again and the rest of the family gone to sleep than the foul fiends began their game anew the commodore got up in the dark drew his cutlass and attacked them both so manfully that in five minutes everything in the apartment went to pieces the lieutenant hearing the noise came to his assistance tom pipes being told what was the matter lighted his match and going down to the yard fired all the patereroes as signals of distress well to be sure the whole parish was in a pucker some thought the french had landed others imagined the commodores house was beset by thieves for my own part i called up two dragoons that are quartered upon me and they swore with deadly oaths it was a gang of smugglers engaged with a party of their regiment that lies in the next village and mounting their horses like lusty fellows rode up into the country as fast as their beasts could carry them ah master these are hard times when an industrious body cannot earn his bread without fear of the gallows your worships father god rest his soul was a good gentleman and as well respected in this parish as eer a he that walks upon neats leather and if your honour should want a small parcel of fine tea or a few ankers of right nantes ill be bound you shall be furnished to your hearts content but as i was saying the hubbub continued till morning when the parson being sent for conjured the spirits into the red sea and the house has been pretty quiet ever since true it is mr hatchway makes a mock of the whole affair and told his commander in this very blessed spot that the two goblins were no other than a couple of jackdaws which had fallen down the chimney and made a flapping with their wings up and down the apartment but the commodore who is very choleric and does not like to be jeered fell into a main high passion and stormed like a perfect hurricane swearing that he knew a devil from a jackdaw as well as eer a man in the three kingdoms he owned indeed that the birds were found but denied that they were the occasion of the uproar for my own part master i believe much may be said on both sides of the question though to be sure the devil is always going about as the saying is this circumstantial account extraordinary as it was never altered one feature in the countenance of mr pickle who having heard it to an end took the pipe from his mouth saying with a look of infinite sagacity and deliberation i do suppose he is of the cornish trunnions what sort of a woman is his spouse spouse cried the other oddsheart i dont think he would marry the queen of sheba lackaday sir he wont suffer his own maids to be in the garrison but turns them into an outhouse every night before the watch is set bless your honours soul he is as it were a very oddish kind of a gentleman your worship would have seen him before now for when he is well he and my good master hatchway come hither every evening and drink a couple of cans of rumbo a piece but he has been confined to his house this fortnight by a plaguy fit of the gout which ill assure your worship is a good penny out of my pocket at that instant mr pickles ears were saluted with such a strange noise as even discomposed the muscles of his face which gave immediate indications of alarm this composition of notes at first resembled the crying of quails and croaking of bulldogs but as it approached nearer he could distinguish articulate sounds pronounced with great violence in such a cadence as one would expect to hear from a human creature scolding through the organs of an ass it was neither speaking nor braying but a surprising mixture of both employed in the utterance of terms absolutely unintelligible to our wondering merchant who had just opened his mouth to express his curiosity when the starting up at the wellknown sound cried odds niggers there is the commodore with his company as sure as i live and with his apron began to wipe the dust off an elbowchair placed at one side of the fire and kept sacred for the ease and convenience of this infirm commander while he vas thus occupied a voice still more uncouth than the former bawled aloud ho the house ahoy upon which the publican clapping a hand to each side of his head with his thumbs fixed to his ears rebellowed in the same tone which he had learned to imitate hilloah the voice again exclaimed have you got any attorneys aboard and when the landlord replied no no this man of strange expectation came in supported by his two dependents and displayed a figure every way answerable to the oddity of his character he was in stature at least six feet high though he had contracted a habit of stooping by living so long on board his complexion was tawny and his aspect rendered hideous by a large scar across his nose and a patch that covered the place of one eye being seated in his chair with great formality the landlord complimented him upon his being able to come abroad again and having in a whisper communicated the name of his fellowguest whom the commodore already knew by report went to prepare with all imaginable despatch the first allowance of his favourite liquor in three separate cans for each was accommodated with his own portion apart while the lieutenant sat down on the blind side of his commander and tom pipes knowing his distance with great modesty took his station in the rear after a pause of some minutes the conversation was begun by this ferocious chief who fixing his eye upon the lieutenant with a sternness of countenance not to be described addressed him in these words d my eyes hatchway i always took you to be a better seaman than to overset our chaise in such fair weather blood didnt i tell you we were running bump ashore and bid you set in the icebrace and haul up a wind yes replied the other with an arch sneer i do confess as how you did give such orders after you had run us foul of a post so as that the carriage lay along and could not right herself i run you foul of a post cried the commander d my heart youre a pretty dog ant you to tell me so aboveboard to my face did i take charge of the chaise did i stand at the helm no answered hatchway i must confess you did not steer but howsomever you cunned all the way and so as you could not see how the land lay being blind of your larboard eye we were fast ashore before you knew anything of the matter pipes who stood abaft can testify the truth of what i say d my limbs resumed the commodore i dont value what you or pipes say a ropeyarn youre a couple of mutinous ill say no more but you shant run your rig upon me d ye i am the man that learnt you jack hatchway to splice a rope and raise a perpendicular the lieutenant who was perfectly well acquainted with the trim of his captain did not choose to carry on the altercation any further but taking up his can drank to the health of the stranger who very courteously returned the compliment without however presuming to join in the conversation which suffered a considerable pause during this interruption mr hatchways wit displayed itself in several practical jokes upon the commodore with whom he knew it was dangerous to tamper in any other way being without the sphere of his vision he securely pilfered his tobacco drank his rumbo made wry faces and to use the vulgar phrase cocked his eye at him to the no small entertainment of the spectators mr pickle himself not excepted who gave evident tokens of uncommon satisfaction at the dexterity of this marine p pantomime meanwhile the captains choler gradually subsided and he was pleased to desire hatchway by the familiar and friendly diminutive of jack to read a newspaper that lay on the table before him this task was accordingly undertaken by the lame lieutenant who among paragraphs read that which follows with an elevation of voice which seemed to prognosticate something extraordinary we are informed that admiral bower will very soon be created a british peer for his eminent services during the war particularly in his late engagement with the french fleet trunnion was thunderstruck at this piece of intelligence the ring dropped front his hand and shivered into a thousand pieces his eye glistened like that of a rattlesnake and some minutes elapsed before he could pronounce avast overhaul that article again it was no sooner read the second time than smiting the table with his fist he started up and with the most violent emphasis of rage and indignation exclaimed d my heart and liver tis a land lie dye see and i will maintain it to be a lie from the spritsail yard to the mizentopsail haulyards blood and thunder will bower a peer of this realm a fellow of yesterday that scarce knows a mast from a manger a snottynose boy whom i myself have ordered to the gun for stealing eggs out of the hencoops and i hawser trunnion who commanded a ship before be could keep a reckoning am laid aside dye see and forgotten if so be as this be the case there is a rotten plank in our constitution which ought to be hove down and repaired d my eyes for my own part dye see i was none of your guinea pigs i did not rise in the service by parlamenteering interest or a handsome b of a wife i was not over the bellies of better men nor strutted athwart the quarterdeck in a laced doublet and thingumbobs at the wrists d my limbs i have been a hardworking man and served all offices on board from cooks shifter to the command of a vessel here you tunley theres the hand of a seaman you dog so saying he laid hold on the landlords fist and honoured him with such a squeeze as compelled him to roar with great vociferation to the infinite satisfaction of the commodore whose features were a little unblended by this acknowledgment of his vigour and he thus proceeded in a less outrageous strain they make a d d noise about this engagement with the french but egad it was no more than a bumboat battle in comparison with some that i have seen there was old rook and jennings and another whom ill be d d before i name that knew what fighting was as for my own share dye see i am none of those that hallo in their own commendation but if so be that i were minded to stand my own trumpeter some of those little fellows that hold their heads so high would be taken all aback as the saying is they would be ashamed to show their colours d my eyes i once lay eight glasses alongside of the flour de louse a french manofwar though her mettle was heavier and her complement larger by a hundred hands than mine you jack hatchway d ye what dye grin at dye think i tell a story because you never heard it before why look ye sir answered the lieutenant i am glad to find you can stand your own trumpeter on occasion though i wish you would change the tune for that is the same you have been piping every watch for these ten months past tunley himself will tell you he has heard it five hundred times god forgive you mr hatchway said the landlord interrupting him as i am an honest man and a housekeeper i never heard a syllable of the matter this declaration though not strictly true was extremely agreeable to mr trunnion who with an air of triumph observed aha jack i thought i should bring you up with your gibes and your jokes but suppose you had heard it before is that any reason why it shouldnt be told to another person theres the stranger belike he has heard it five hundred times too hant you brother addressing himself to mr pickle who replying with a look expressing curiosity no never he thus went on well you seem to be an honest quiet sort of a man and therefore you must know as i said before i fell in with a french manofwar cape finistere bearing about six leagues on the weather bow and the chase three leagues to leeward going before the wind whereupon i set my studding sails and coming up with her hoisted my jack and ensign and poured in a broadside before you could count three rattlins in the mizen shrouds for i always keep a good lookout and love to have the first fire that ill be sworn said hatchway for the day we made the triumph you ordered the men to fire when she was hullto by the same token we below pointed the guns at a flight of gulls and i won a can of punch from the gunner by killing the first bird exasperated at this sarcasm he replied with great vehemence you lie lubber d your bones what business have you to come always athwart my hawse in this manner you pipes was upon deck and can bear witness whether or not i fired too soon speak you blood of a and that upon the word of a seaman how did the chase bear of us when i gave orders to fire pipes who had hitherto sat silent being thus called upon to give his evidence after divers strange gesticulations opened his mouth like a gasping cod and with a cadence like that of the east wind singing through a cranny pronounced half a quarter of a league right upon our leebeam nearer you porpussfaced swab cried the commodore nearer by twelve fathom but howsomever thats enough to prove the falsehood of hatchways jaw and so brother dye see turning to pickle i lay alongside of the flour de louse yardarm and yardarm plying out great guns and small arms and heaving in stinkpots powderbottles and handgrenades till our shot was all expended doubleheaded partridge and grape then we loaded with iron crows marlinspikes and old nails but finding the frenchman took a good deal of drubbing and that he had shot away all our rigging and killed and wounded a great number of our men dye see i resolved to run him on board upon his quarter and so ordered our grapplings to be got ready but monsieur perceiving what we were about filled his topsails and sheered off leaving us like a log upon the water and our scuppers running with blood mr pickle and the landlord paid such extraordinary attention to the rehearsal of this exploit that trunnion was encouraged to entertain them with more stories of the same nature after which he observed by way of encomium on the government that all he had gained in the service was a lame foot and the loss of an eye the lieutenant who could not find in his heart to lose any opportunity of being witty at the expense of his commander gave a loose to his satirical talent once more saying i have heard as how you came by your lame foot by having your upper decks overstowed with liquor whereby you became crank and rolled dye see in such a manner that by a pitch of the ship your starboard heel was jammed in one of the scuppers and as for the matter of your eye that was knocked out by your own crew when the lightning was paid off theres poor pipes who was beaten into all the colours of the rainbow for taking your part and giving you time to sheer off and i dont find as how you have rewarded him according as he deserves as the commodore could not deny the truth of these anecdotes however unseasonably they were introduced he affected to receive them with good humour as jokes of the lieutenants own inventing and replied ay ay jack everybody knows your tongue is no slander but howsomever ill work you to an oil for this you dog so saying he lifted up one of his crutches intending to lay it gently across mr hatchways pate but jack with great agility tilted up his wooden leg with which he warded off the blow to the no small admiration of mr pickle and utter astonishment of the landlord who by the bye had expressed the same amazement at the same feet at the same hour every night for three months before trunnion then directing his eye to the boatswains mate you pipes said he do you go about and tell people that i did not reward you for standing by me when i was bustled by these rebellious rapscallions d you hant you been rated on the books ever since tom who indeed had no words to spare sat smoking his pipe with great indifference and never dreamed of paying any regard to these interrogations which being repeated and reinforced with many oaths that however produced no effect the commodore pulled out his purse saying here you b baby heres something better than a smart ticket and threw it at his silent deliverer who received and pocketed his bounty without the least demonstration of surprise or satisfaction while the donor turning to mr pickle you see brother said he i make good the old saying we sailors get money like horses and spend it like asses come pipes lets have the boatswains whistle and be jovial this musician accordingly applied to his mouth the silver instrument that hung at the buttonhole of his jacket by a chain of the same metal and though not quite so ravishing as the pipe of hermes produced a sound so loud and shrill that the stranger as it were instinctively stopped his ears to preserve his organs of hearing from such a dangerous invasion the prelude being thus executed pipes fixed his eyes upon the egg of an ostrich that depended from the ceiling and without once moving them from that object performed the whole cantata in a tone of voice that seemed to be the joint issue of an irish bagpipe and a sowgelders horn the commodore the lieutenant and landlord joined in the chorus repeating this elegant stanza bustle bustle brave boys let us sing let us toil and drink all the while since labours the price of our joys the third line was no sooner pronounced than the can was lifted to every mans mouth with admirable uniformity and the next word taken up at the end of their draught with a twang equally expressive and harmonious in short the company began to understand one another mr pickle seemed to relish the entertainment and a correspondence immediately commenced between him and trunnion who shook him by the hand drank to further acquaintance and even invited him to a mess of pork and pease in the garrison the compliment was returned goodfellowship prevailed and the night was pretty far advanced when the merchants man arrived with a lantern to light his master home upon which the new friends parted after a mutual promise of meeting next evening in the same place chapter iii mrs grizzle exerts herself in finding a proper match for her brother who is accordingly introduced to the young lady whom he marries in due season i have been the more circumstantial in opening the character of trunnion because he bears a considerable share in the course of these memoirs but now it is high time to resume the consideration of mrs grizzle who since her arrival in the country had been engrossed by a double care namely that of finding a suitable match for her brother and a comfortable yokefellow for herself neither was this aim the result of any sinister or frail aggression but the pure dictates of that laudable ambition which prompted her to the preservation of the family name nay so disinterested was she in this pursuit that postponing her nearest concern or at least leaving her own fate to the silent operation of her charms she laboured with such indefatigable zeal in behalf of her brother that before they had been three months settled in the country the general topic of conversation in the neighbourhood was an intended match between the rich mr pickle and the fair miss appleby daughter of a gentleman who lived in the next parish and who though he had but little fortune to bestow upon his children had to use his own phrase replenished their veins with some of the best blood in the country this young lady whose character and disposition mrs grizzle had investigated to her own satisfaction was destined for the spouse of mr pickle and an overture accordingly made to her father who being overjoyed at the proposal gave his consent without hesitation and even recommended the immediate execution of the project with such eagerness as seemed to indicate either a suspicion of mr pickles constancy or a diffidence of his own daughters complexion which perhaps he thought too sanguine to keep much longer cool the previous point being thus settled our merchant at the instigation of mrs grizzle went to visit his future fatherinlaw and was introduced to the daughter with whom he had that same afternoon an opportunity of being alone what passed in that interview i never could learn though from the character of the suitor the reader may justly conclude that she was not much teased with the impertinence of his addresses he was not i believe the less welcome for that reason certain it is she made no objection to his taciturnity and when her father communicated his resolution acquiesced with the most pious resignation but mrs grizzle in order to give the lady a more favourable idea of his intellects than his conversation could possibly inspire resolved to dictate a letter which her brother should transcribe and transmit to his mistress as the produce of his own understanding and had actually composed a very tender billet for this purpose yet her intention was entirely frustrated by the misapprehension of the lover himself who in consequence of his sisters repeated admonitions anticipated her scheme by writing for himself and despatching the letter one afternoon while mrs grizzle was visiting at the parsons neither was this step the effect of his vanity or precipitation but having been often assured by his sister that it was absolutely necessary for him to make a declaration of his love in writing he took this opportunity of acting in conformity with her advice when his imagination was unengaged or undisturbed by any other suggestion without suspecting in the least that she intended to save him the trouble of exercising his own genius left therefore as he imagined to his own inventions he sat down and produced the following morceau which was transmitted to miss appleby before his sister and counsellor had the least intimation of the affair miss sally appleby madam understanding you have a parcel of heart warranted sound to be disposed of shall be pleased to treat for said commodity on reasonable terms doubt not shall agree for same shall wait on you for further information when and where you shall appoint this the needful from yours etc gam pickle this laconic epistle simple and unadorned as it was met with as cordial a reception from the person to whom it was addressed as if it had been couched in the most elegant terms that delicacy of passion and cultivated genius could supply nay i believe was the more welcome on account of its mercantile plainness because when an advantageous match is in view a sensible woman often considers the flowery professions and rapturous exclamations of love as ensnaring ambiguities or at best impertinent preliminaries that retard the treaty they are designed to promote whereas mr pickle removed all disagreeable uncertainty by descending at once to the most interesting particular she had no sooner as a dutiful child communicated this billetdoux to her father than he as a careful parent visited mr pickle and in presence of mrs grizzle demanded a formal explanation of his sentiments with regard to his daughter sally mr gamaliel without any ceremony assured him he had a respect for the young woman and with his good leave would take her for better for worse mr appleby after having expressed his satisfaction that he had fixed his affections in his family comforted the lover with the assurance of his being agreeable to the young lady and they forthwith proceeded to the articles of the marriagesettlement which being discussed and determined a lawyer was ordered to engross them the weddingclothes were bought and in short a day was appointed for the celebration of their nuptials to which everybody of any fashion in the neighbourhood was invited among these commodore trunnion and mr hatchway were not forgotten being the sole companions of the bridegroom with whom by this time they had contracted a sort of intimacy at their nocturnal rendezvous they had received a previous intimation of what was on the anvil from the landlord before mr pickle thought proper to declare himself in consequence of which the topic of the oneeyed commanders discourse at their meeting for several evenings before had been the folly and plague of matrimony on which he held forth with great vehemence of abuse leveled at the fair sex whom he represented as devils incarnate sent from hell to torment mankind and in particular inveighed against old maids for whom he seemed to entertain a singular aversion while his friend jack confirmed the truth of all his allegations and gratified his own malignant vein at the same time by clenching every sentence with a sly joke upon the married state built upon some allusion to a ship or seafaring life he compared a woman to a great gun loaded with fire brimstone and noise which being violently heated will bounce and fly and play the devil if you dont take special care of her breechings he said she was like a hurricane that never blows from one quarter but veers about to all points of the compass he likened her to a painted galley curiously rigged with a leak in her hold which her husband would never be able to stop he observed that her inclinations were like the bay of biscay for why because you may heave your deep sea lead long enough without ever reaching the bottom that he who comes to anchor on a wife may find himself moored in d d foul ground and after all cant for his blood slip his cable and that for his own part though he might make short trips for pastime he would never embark in woman on the voyage of life he was afraid of foundering in the first foul weather in all probability these insinuations made some impression on the mind of mr pickle who was not very much inclined to run great risks of any kind but the injunctions and importunities of his sister who was bent upon the match overbalanced the opinion of his sea friends who finding him determined to marry notwithstanding all the hints of caution they had thrown out resolved to accept his invitation and honoured his nuptials with their presence accordingly chapter iv the behaviour of mrs grizzle at the wedding with an account of the guests i hope it will not be thought uncharitable if i advance by way of conjecture that mrs grizzle on this grand occasion summoned her whole exertion to play off the artillery of her charms on the single gentlemen who were invited to the entertainment sure i am she displayed to the best advantage all the engaging qualities she possessed her affability at dinner was altogether uncommon her attention to the guests was superfluously hospitable her tongue was sheathed with a most agreeable and infantine lisp her address was perfectly obliging and though conscious of the extraordinary capacity of her month she would not venture to hazard a laugh she modelled her lips into an enchanting simper which played on her countenance all day long nay she even profited by that defect in her vision we have already observed and securely contemplated those features which were most to her liking while the rest of the company believed her regards were disposed in a quite contrary direction with what humility of complaisance did she receive the compliments of those who could not help praising the elegance of the banquet and how piously did she seize that opportunity of commemorating the honours of her sire by observing that it was no merit in her to understand something of entertainments as she had occasion to preside at so many during the mayoralty of her papa far from discovering the least symptom of pride and exultation when the opulence of her family became the subject of conversation she assumed a severity of countenance and after having moralized on the vanity of riches declared that those who looked on her as a fortune were very much mistaken for her father had left her no more than a poor five thousand pounds which with what little she had saved of the interest since his death was all she had to depend on indeed if she had placed her chief felicity in wealth she should not have been so forward in destroying her own expectations by advising and promoting the event at which they were now so happily assembled but she hoped she should always have virtue enough to postpone any interested consideration when it should happen to clash with the happiness of her friends finally such was her modesty and selfdenial that she industriously informed those whom it might concern that she was no less than three years older than the bride though had she added ten to the reckoning she would have committed no mistake in point of computation to contribute as much as lay in her power to the satisfaction of all present she in the afternoon regaled them with a tune on the harpsichord accompanied with her voice which though not the most melodious in the world i dare say would have been equally at their service could she have vied with philomel in song and as the last effort of her complaisance when dancing was proposed she was prevailed on at the request of her new sister to open the ball in person in a word mrs grizzle was the principal figure in this festival and almost eclipsed the bride who far from seeming to dispute the preeminence very wisely allowed her to make the best of her talents contenting herself with the lot to which fortune had already called her and which she imagined would not be the less desirable if her sisterinlaw were detached from the family i believe i need scarce advertise the reader that during this whole entertainment the commodore and his lieutenant were quite out of their element and this indeed was the case with the bridegroom himself who being utterly unacquainted with any sort of polite commerce found himself under a very disagreeable restraint during the whole scene trunnion who had scarce ever been on shore till he was paid off and never once in his whole life in the company of any females above the rank of those who herd on the point at portsmouth was more embarrassed about his behaviour than if he had been surrounded at sea by the whole french navy he had never pronounced the word madam since he was born so that far from entering into conversation with the ladies he would not even return the compliment or give the least note of civility when they drank to his health and i verily believe would rather have suffered suffocation than allowed the simple phrase your servant to proceed from his mouth he was altogether as inflexible with respect to the attitudes of his body for either through obstinacy or bashfulness he sat upright without motion insomuch that he provoked the mirth of a certain wag who addressing himself to the lieutenant asked whether that was the commodore himself or the wooden lion that used to stand at his gate an image to which it must be owned mr trunnions person bore no faint resemblance mr hatchway who was not quite so unpolished as the commodore and had certain notions that seemed to approach the ideas of common life made a less uncouth appearance but then he was a wit and though of a very peculiar genius partook largely of that disposition which is common to all wits who never enjoy themselves except when their talents meet with those marks of distinction and veneration which in their own opinion they deserve these circumstances being premised it is not to be wondered at if this triumvirate made no objections to the proposal when some of the graver personages of the company made a motion for adjourning into another apartment where they might enjoy their pipes and bottles while the young folks indulged themselves in the continuance of their own favourite diversion thus rescued as it were from a state of annihilation the first use the two lads of the castle made of their existence was to ply the bridegroom so hard with bumpers that in less than an hour he made divers efforts to sing and soon after was carried to bed deprived of all manner of sensation to the utter disappointment of the bridemen and maids who by this accident were prevented from throwing the stocking and performing certain other ceremonies practised on such occasions as for the bride she bore this misfortune with great good humour and indeed on all occasions behaved like a discreet woman perfectly well acquainted with the nature of her own situation chapter v mrs pickle assumes the reins of government in her own family her sisterinlaw undertakes an enterprise of great moment but is for some time diverted from her purpose by a very interesting consideration whatever deference not to say submission she had paid to mrs grizzle before she nearly allied to her family she no sooner became mrs pickle than she thought it encumbent on her to act up to the dignity of the character and the very day after the marriage ventured to dispute with her sisterinlaw on the subject of her own pedigree which she affirmed to be more honourable in all respects than that of her husband observing that several younger brothers of her house had arrived at the station of lordmayor of london which was the highest pitch of greatness that any of mr pickles predecessors had ever attained this presumption was like a thunderbolt to mrs grizzle who began to perceive that she had not succeeded quite so well as she imagined in selecting for her brother a gentle and obedient yokefellow who would always treat her with that profound respect which she thought due to her superior genius and be entirely regulated by her advice and direction however she still continued to manage the reins of government in the house reprehending the servants as usual an office she performed with great capacity and in which she seemed to take singular delight until mrs pickle on pretence of consulting her ease told her one day she would take that trouble on herself and for the future assume the management of her own family nothing could be more mortifying to mrs grizzle than such a declaration to which after a considerable pause and strange distortion of look she replied i shall never refuse or repine at any trouble that may conduce to my brothers advantage dear madam answered the sister i am infinitely obliged for your kind concern for mr pickles interest which i consider as my own but i cannot bear to see you a sufferer by your friendship and therefore insist on exempting you from the fatigue you have borne so long in vain did the other protest that she took pleasure in the task mrs pickle ascribed the assurance to her excess of complaisance and expressed such tenderness of zeal for her dear sisters health and tranquility that the reluctant maiden found herself obliged to resign her authority without enjoying the least pretext for complaining of her being deposed this disgrace was attended by a fit of peevish devotion that lasted three or four weeks during which period she had the additional chagrin of seeing the young lady gain an absolute ascendency over the mind of her brother who was persuaded to set up a gay equipage and improve his housekeeping by an augmentation in his expense to the amount of a thousand a year at least though his alteration in the economy of his household effected no change in his own disposition or manner of life for as soon as the painful ceremony of receiving and returning visits was performed he had recourse to the company of his sea friends with whom he spent the best part of his time but if he was satisfied with his condition the case was otherwise with mrs grizzle who finding her importance in the family greatly diminished her attractions neglected by all the male sex in the neighbourhood and the withering hand of time hang threatening over her head began to feel the horror of eternal virginity and in a sort of desperation resolved at any rate to rescue herself from that reproachful and uncomfortable situation thus determined she formed a plan the execution of which to a spirit less enterprising and sufficient than hers would have appeared altogether impracticable this was no other than to make a conquest of the commodores heart which the reader will easily believe was not very susceptible of tender impressions but on the contrary fortified with insensibility and prejudice against the charms of the whole sex and particularly prepossessed to the prejudice of that class distinguished by the appellation of old maids in which mrs grizzle was by this time unhappily ranked she nevertheless took the field and having invested this seemingly impregnable fortress began to break ground one day when trunnion dined at her brothers by springing certain ensnaring commendations on the honesty and sincerity of seafaring people paying a particular attention to his plate and affecting a simper of approbation at everything which he said which by any means she could construe into a joke or with modesty be supposed to hear nay even when he left decency on the left hand which was often the case she ventured to reprimand his freedom of speech with a grin saying sure you gentlemen belonging to the sea have such an odd way with you but all this complacency was so ineffectual that far from suspecting the true cause of it the commodore that very evening at the club in presence of her brother with whom by this time he could take any manner of freedom did not scruple to d her for a squinting blockfaced chattering p kitchen and immediately after drank despair to all old maids the toast mr pickle pledged without the least hesitation and next day intimated to his sister who bore the indignity with surprising resignation and did not therefore desist from her scheme unpromising as it seemed to be until her attention was called off and engaged in another care which for some time interrupted the progress of this design her sister had not been married many months when she exhibited evident symptoms of pregnancy to the general satisfaction of all concerned and the inexpressible joy of mrs grizzle who as we have already hinted was more interested in the preservation of the family name than in any other consideration whatever she therefore no sooner discovered appearances to justify and confirm her hopes than postponing her own purpose and laying aside that pique and resentment she had conceived from the behaviour of mrs pickle when she superseded her authority or perhaps considering her in no other light than that of the vehicle which contained and was destined to convey her brothers heir to light she determined to exert her uttermost in nursing tending and cherishing her during the term of her important charge with this view she purchased culpeppers midwifery which with that sagacious performance dignified with aristotles name she studied with indefatigable care and diligently perused the complete housewife together with quincys dispensatory culling every jelly marmalade and conserve which these authors recommend as either salutary or toothsome for the benefit and comfort of her sisterinlaw during her gestation she restricted her from eating roots potherbs fruit and all sorts of vegetables and one day when mrs pickle had plucked a peach with her own hand and was in the very act of putting it between her teeth mrs grizzle perceived the rash attempt and running up to her fell on her knees in the garden entreating her with tears in her eyes to desist such a pernicious appetite her request was no sooner complied with than recollecting that if her sisters longing was balked the child might be affected with some disagreeable mark or deplorable disease she begged as earnestly that she would swallow the fruit and in the mean time ran for some cordial water of her own composing which she forced on her sister as an antidote to the poison she had received this excessive zeal and tenderness did not fail to be very troublesome to mrs pickle who having resolved divers plans for the recovery of her own ease at length determined to engage mrs grizzle in such employment as would interrupt that close attendance which she found so teasing and disagreeable neither did she wait long for an opportunity of putting her resolution in practice the very next day a gentleman happening to dine with mr pickle unfortunately mentioned a pineapple part of which he had eaten a week before at the house of a nobleman who lived in another part of the country at the distance of a hundred miles at least the name of this fatal fruit was no sooner pronounced than mrs grizzle who incessantly watched her sisters looks took the alarm because she thought they gave certain indications of curiosity and desire and after having observed that she herself could never eat pineapples which were altogether unnatural productions extorted by the force of artificial fire out of filthy manure asked with a faltering voice if mrs pickle was not of her way of thinking this young lady who wanted neither slyness nor penetration at once divined her meaning and replied with seeming unconcern that for her own part she should never repine if there was no pineapple in the universe provided she could indulge herself with the fruits of her own country this answer was calculated for the benefit of the stranger who would certainly have suffered for his imprudence by the resentment of mrs grizzle had her sister expressed the least relish for the fruit in question it had the desired effect and reestablished the peace of the company which was not a little endangered by the gentlemans want of consideration next morning however after breakfast the pregnant lady in pursuance of her plan yawned as it were by accident full in the face of her maiden sister who being infinitely disturbed by this convulsion affirmed it was a symptom of longing and insisted upon knowing the object in desire when mrs pickle affecting a smile told her she had eaten a most delicious pineapple in her sleep this declaration was attended with an immediate scream uttered by mrs grizzle who instantly perceiving her sister surprised at the exclamation clasped her in her arms and assured her with a sort of hysterical laugh that she could not help screaming with joy because she had it in her power to gratify her dear sisters wish a lady in the neighbourhood having promised to send her as a present a couple of delicate pineapples which she would on that very day go in quest of mrs pickle would by no means consent to this proposal on pretence of sparing the other unnecessary fatigue and assured her that if she had any desire to eat a pineapple it was so faint that the disappointment could produce no bad consequence but this assurance was conveyed in a manner which she knew very well how to adopt that instead of dissuading rather stimulated mrs grizzle to set out immediately not on a visit to that lady whose promise she herself had feigned with a view of consulting her sisters tranquility but on a random search through the whole country for this unlucky fruit which was like to produce so much vexation and prejudice to her and her fathers house during three whole days and nights did she attended by a valet ride from place to place without success unmindful of her health and careless of her reputation that began to suffer from the nature of her inquiry which was pursued with such peculiar eagerness and distraction that everybody with whom she conversed looked upon her as an unhappy person whose intellects were not a little disordered baffled in all her researches within the country she at length decided to visit that very nobleman at whose house the officious stranger had been for her so unfortunately regaled and actually arrived in a postchaise at the place of his habitation when she introduced her business as an affair on which the happiness of a whole family depended by virtue of a present to his lordships gardener she procured the hesperian fruit with which she returned in triumph chapter vi mrs grizzle is indefatigable in gratifying her sisters longings peregrine is born and managed contrary to the directions and remonstrances of his aunt who is disgusted upon that account and resumes the plan which she had before rejected the success of this device would have encouraged mrs pickle to practise more of the same sort upon her sisterinlaw had she not been deterred by a violent fever which seized her zealous ally in consequence of the fatigue and uneasiness she had undergone which while it lasted as effectually conduced to her repose as any other stratagem she could invent but mrs grizzles health was no sooner restored than the other being as much incommoded as ever was obliged in her own defence to have recourse to some other contrivance and managed her artifices in such a manner as leaves it at this day a doubt whether she was really so whimsical and capriccios in her appetites as she herself pretended to be for her longings were not restricted to the demands of the palate and stomach but also affected all the other organs of sense and even invaded her imagination which at this period seemed to be strangely diseased one time she longed to pinch her husbands ear and it was with infinite difficulty that his sister could prevail upon him to undergo the operation yet this task was easy in comparison with another she undertook for the gratification of mrs pickles unaccountable desire which was no other than to persuade the commodore to submit his chin to the mercy of the bigbellied lady who ardently wished for an opportunity of plucking three black hairs from his beard when this proposal was first communicated to mr trunnion by the husband his answer was nothing but a dreadful effusion of oaths accompanied with such a stare and delivered in such a tone of voice as terrified the poor beseecher into immediate silence so that mrs grizzle was fain to take the whole enterprise upon herself and next day went to the garrison accordingly where having obtained entrance by means of the lieutenant who while his commander was asleep ordered her to be admitted for the jokes sake she waited patiently till he turned out and then accosted him in the yard where he used to perform his morning walk he was thunderstruck at the appearance of a woman in a place he had hitherto kept sacred from the whole sex and immediately began to utter an apostrophe to tom pipes whose turn it was then to watch when mrs grizzle falling on her knees before him conjured him with many pathetic supplications to hear and grant her request which was no sooner signified than he bellowed in such an outrageous manner that the whole court reechoed the opprobrious term b and the word damnation which he repeated with surprising volubility without any sort of propriety or connection and retreated into his penetralia leaving the baffled devotee in the humble posture she had so unsuccessfully chosen to melt his obdurate heart mortifying as this repulse must have been to a lady of her stately disposition she did not relinquish her aim but endeavoured to interest the commodores counsellors and adherents in her cause with this view she solicited the interest of mr hatchway who being highly pleased with a circumstance so productive of mirth and diversion readily entered into her measures and promised to employ his whole influence for her satisfaction and as for the boatswains mate he was rendered propitious by the present of a guinea which she slipped into his hand in short mrs grizzle was continually engaged in this negotiation for the space of ten days during which the commodore was so incessantly pestered with her remonstrances and the admonitions of his associates that he swore his people had a design upon his life which becoming a burden to him he at last complied and was conducted to the scene like a victim to the altar or rather like a reluctant bear when he is led to the stake amidst the shouts and cries of butchers and their dogs after all this victory was not quite so decisive as the conquerors imagined for the patient being set and the performer prepared with a pair of pincers a small difficulty occurred she could not for some time discern one black hair on the whole superficies of mr trunnions face when mrs grizzle very much alarmed and disconcerted had recourse to a magnifyingglass that stood upon her toilet and after a most accurate examination discovered a fibre of a dusky hue to which the instrument being applied mrs pickle pulled it up by the roots to the no small discomposure of the owner who feeling the smart much more severe than he had expected started up and swore he would not part with another hair to save them all from damnation mr hatchway exhorted him to patience and resignation mrs grizzle repeated her entreaties with great humility but finding him deaf to all her prayers and absolutely bent upon leaving the house she clasped his knees and begged for the love of god that he would have compassion upon a distressed family and endure a little more for the sake of the poor infant who would otherwise be born with a gray beard upon its chin far from being melted he was rather exasperated by this reflection to which he replied with great indignation d you for a yawsighted b ill be hanged long enough before he has any beard at all so saying he disengaged himself from her embraces flung out at the door and halted homewards with such surprising speed that the lieutenant could not overtake him until he had arrived at his own gate and mrs grizzle was so much affected with his escape that her sister in pure compassion desired she would not afflict herself protesting that her own wish was already gratified for she had plucked three hairs at once having from the beginning been dubious of the commodores patience but the labours of this assiduous kinswoman did not end with the achievement of this adventure her eloquence or industry was employed without ceasing in the performance of other tasks imposed by the ingenious craft of her sisterinlaw who at another time conceived an insuppressible affection for a fricassee of frogs which should be the genuine natives of france so that there was a necessity for despatching a messenger on purpose to that kingdom but as she could not depend upon the integrity of any common servant mrs grizzle undertook that province and actually set sail in a cutter for boulogne from whence she returned in eightandforty hours with a tub full of those live animals which being dressed according to art her sister did not taste them on pretence that her fit of longing was past but then her inclinations took a different turn and fixed themselves upon a curious implement belonging to a lady of quality in the neighbourhood which was reported to be a great curiosity this was no other than a porcelain chamberpot of admirable workmanship contrived by the honourable owner who kept it for her own private use and cherished it as a utensil of inestimable value mrs grizzle shuddered at the first hint she received of her sisters desire to possess this piece of furniture because she knew it was not to be purchased and the ladys character which was none of the most amiable in point of humanity and condescension forbad all hopes of borrowing it for a season she therefore attempted to reason down this capricious appetite as an extravagance of imagination which ought to be combated and repressed and mrs pickle to all appearance was convinced and satisfied by her arguments and advice but nevertheless could make use of no other convenience and was threatened with a very dangerous suppression roused at the peril in which she supposed her to be mrs grizzle flew to the ladys house and having obtained a private audience disclosed the melancholy situation of her sister and implored the benevolence of her ladyship who contrary to expectation received her very graciously and consented to indulge mrs pickles longing mr pickle began to be out of humour at the expense to which he was exposed by the caprice of his wife who was herself alarmed at this last accident and for the future kept her fancy within bounds insomuch that without being subject to any more extraordinary trouble mrs grizzle reaped the longwished fruits of her dearest expectation in the birth of a fine boy whom her sister in a few months brought into the world i shall omit the description of the rejoicings which were infinite on this important occasion and only observe that mrs pickles mother and aunt stood godmothers and the commodore assisted at the ceremony as godfather to the child who was christened by the name of peregrine in compliment to the memory of a deceased uncle while the mother confined to her bed and incapable of maintaining her own authority mrs grizzle took charge of the infant baby double claim and superintended with surprising vigilance the nurse and midwife in all the particulars of their respective offices which were performed by her express direction but no sooner was mrs pickle in a condition to reassume the management of her own affairs when she thought proper to alter certain regulations concerning the child which had obtained in consequence of her sisters orders directing among other innovations that the bandages with which the infant had been so neatly rolled up like an egyptian mummy should be loosened and laid aside in order to rid nature of all restraint and give the blood free scope to circulate and with her own hands she plunged him headlong every morning into a tub full of cold water this operation seemed so barbarous to the tenderhearted mrs grizzle that she not only opposed it with all her eloquence shedding abundance of tears over the sacrifice when it was made and took horse immediately and departed for the habitation of an eminent country physician whom she consulted in these words pray doctor is it not both dangerous and cruel to be the means of letting a poor tender infant perish by sousing it in water as cold as ice yes replied the doctor downright murder i affirm i see you are a person of great learning and sagacity said the other and i must beg you will be so good as to signify your opinion in your own handwriting the doctor immediately complied with her request and expressed himself upon a slip of paper to this purpose these are to certify whom it may concern that i firmly believe and it is my unalterable opinion that who soever letteth an infant perish by sousing it in cold water even though the said water should not be so cold as ice is in effect guilty of the murder of the said infant as witness my hand comfit colocynth having obtained this certificate for which the physician was handsomely acknowledged she returned exalting and hoping with such authority to overthrow all opposition accordingly next morning when her nephew was about to undergo his diurnal baptism she produced the commission whereby she conceived herself empowered to overrule such inhuman proceedings but she was disappointed in her expectation confident as it was not that mrs pickle pretended to differ in opinion from dr colocynth for whose character and sentiments said she i have such veneration that i shall carefully observe the caution implied in this very certificate by which far from condemning my method of practice he only asserts that killing is murder an asseveration the truth of which it is to be hoped i shall never dispute mrs grizzle who sooth to say had rather too superficially considered the clause by which she thought herself authorized perused the paper with more accuracy and was confounded at her own want of penetration yet though she was confuted she was by no means convinced that her objections to the cold bath were unreasonable on the contrary after having bestowed sundry opprobrious epithets on the physician for his want of knowledge and candour she protested in the most earnest and solemn manner the pernicious practice of dipping the child a piece of cruelty which with gods assistance she should never suffer to be inflicted on her own issue and washing her hands of the melancholy consequence that would certainly ensue shut herself up in her closet to indulge her sorrow and vexation she was deceived however in her prognostic the boy instead of declining in point of health seemed to acquire fresh vigour from every plunge as if he had been resolved to discredit the wisdom and foresight of his aunt who in all probability could never forgive him for this want of reverence and respect this conjecture is founded upon her behaviour to him in the sequel of his infancy during which she was known to torture him more than once when she had opportunities of thrusting pins into his flesh without any danger of being detected in short her affections were in a little time altogether alienated from this hope of her family whom she abandoned to the conduct of his mother whose province it undoubtedly was to manage the nurture of her own child while she herself resumed her operations upon the commodore whom she was resoled at any rate to captivate and enslave and it must be owned that mrs grizzles knowledge of the human heart never shone so conspicuous as in the methods she pursued for the accomplishment of this important aim through the rough unpolished hulk that cased the soul of trunnion she could easily distinguish a large share of that vanity and selfconceit that generally predominate even in the most savage beast and to this she constantly appealed in his presence she always exclaimed against the craft and dishonest dissimulation of the world and never failed of uttering particular invectives against those arts of chicanery in which the lawyers are so conversant to the prejudice and ruin of their fellowcreatures observing that in a seafaring life as far as she had opportunities of judging or being informed there was nothing but friendship sincerity and a hearty contempt for everything that was mean or selfish this kind of conversation with the assistance of certain particular civilities insensibly made an impression on the mind of the commodore and the more effectual as his former prepossessions were built upon very slender foundations his antipathy to old maids which he had conceived upon hearsay began gradually to diminish when he found they were not quite such infernal animals as they had been presented and it was not long before he was heard to observe at the club that pickles sister had not so much of the core of b in her as he had imagined this negative compliment by the medium of her brother soon reached the ears of mrs grizzle who thus encouraged redoubled in her arts and attention so that in less than three months after he in the same place distinguished her with the epithet of a d d sensible jade hatchway taking the alarm at this declaration which he feared foreboded something fatal to his interest told his commander with a sneer that she had sense enough to bring him to under her stern and he did not doubt but that such an old crazy vessel would be the better for being taken in tow but howsomever added this arch adviser id have you take care of your upperworks for if once you are made fast to her poop egad shell spank it away and make every beam in your body crack with straining our sheprojectors whole plan had like to have been ruined by the effect which this malicious hint had upon trunnion whose rage and suspicion being wakened at once his colour changed from tawny to a cadaverous pale and then shifting to a deep and dusky red such as we sometimes observe in the sky when it is replete with thunder he after his usual preamble of unmeaning oaths answered in these words d you you juryleggd dog you would give all the stowage in your hold to be as sound as i am and as for being taken in tow dye see im not so disabled that i can lie my course and perform my voyage without assistance and egad no man shall ever see hawser trunnion lagging astern in the wake of eer a b in christendom mrs grizzle who every morning interrogated her brother with regard to the subject of his nights conversation with his friends soon received the unwelcome news of the commodores aversion to matrimony and justly imputing the greatest part of his disgust to the satirical insinuations of mr hatchway resolved to level this obstruction to her success and actually found means to interest him in her scheme she had indeed on some occasions a particular knack at making converts being probably not unacquainted with that grand system of persuasion which is adopted by the greatest personages of the age and fraught with maxims much more effectual than all the eloquence of tully or demosthenes even when supported by the demonstrations of truth besides mr hatchways fidelity to his new ally was confirmed by his foreseeing in his captains marriage an infinite fund of gratification for his own cynical disposition thus therefore converted and properly cautioned he for the future suppressed all the virulence of his wit against the matrimonial state and as he knew not how to open his mouth in the positive praise of any person whatever took all opportunities of excepting mrs grizzle by name from the censures he liberally bestowed upon the rest of her sex she is not a drunkard like nan castick of deptford he would say not a nincompoop like peg simper of woolwich not a brimstone like kate koddle of chatham nor a shrew like nell griffin on the point portsmouth ladies to whom at different times they had both paid their addresses but a tight goodhumoured sensible wench who knows very well how to box her compass welltrimmed aloft and wellsheathed alow with a good cargo under her hatches the commodore at first imagined this commendation was ironical but hearing it repeated again and again was filled with astonishment at this surprising change in the lieutenants behaviour and after a long fit of musing concluded that hatchway himself harboured a matrimonial design on the person of mrs grizzle pleased with this conjecture he rallied jack in his turn and one night toasted her health as a compliment to his passion a circumstance which the lady learned next day by the usual canal of her intelligence and interpreting as the result of his own tenderness for her she congratulated herself on the victory she had obtained and thinking it unnecessary to continue the reserve she had hitherto industriously affected resolved from that day to sweeten her behaviour towards him with such a dash of affection as could not fail to persuade him that he had inspired her with a reciprocal flame in consequence of this determination he was invited to dinner and while he stayed treated with such cloying proofs of her regard that not only the rest of the company but even trunnion perceived her drift and taking the alarm accordingly could not help exclaiming oho i see how the land lies and if i dont weather the point ill be d d having thus expressed himself to his afflicted inamorata he made the best of his way to the garrison in which he shut himself up for the space of ten days and had no communication with his friends and domestics but by looks which were most significantly picturesque chapter vii divers stratagems are invented and put in practice in order to overcome the obstinacy of trunnion who at length is teased and tortured into the noose of wedlock this abrupt departure and unkind declaration affected mrs grizzle so much that she fell sick of sorrow and mortification and after having confined herself to her bed for three days sent for her brother told him she perceived her end drawing near and desired that a lawyer might be brought in order to write her last will mr pickle surprised at her demand began to act the part of a comforter assuring her that her distemper was not at all dangerous and that he would instantly send for a physician who would convince her that she was in no manner of jeopardy so that there was no occasion at present to employ any officious attorney in such a melancholy task indeed this affectionate brother was of opinion that a will was altogether superfluous at any rate as he himself was heirinlaw to his sisters whole real and personal estate but she insisted on his compliance with such determined obstinacy that he could no longer resist her importunities and a arriving she dictated and executed her will in which she bequeathed to commodore trunnion one thousand pounds to purchase a mourning ring which she hoped he would wear as a pledge of her friendship and affection her brother though he did not much relish this testimony of her love nevertheless that same evening gave an account of this particular to mr hatchway who was also as mr pickle assured him generously remembered by the testatrix the lieutenant fraught with this piece of intelligence watched for an opportunity and as soon as he perceived the commodores features a little unbended from that ferocious contraction they had retained so long ventured to inform him that pickles sister lay at the point of death and that she had left him a thousand pounds in her will this piece of news overwhelmed him with confusion and mr hatchway imputing his silence to remorse resolved to take advantage of that favourable moment and counselled him to go and visit the poor young woman who was dying for love of him but his admonition happened to be somewhat unseasonable trunnion no sooner heard him mention the cause of her disorder than his morosity recurring he burst out into a violent fit of cursing and forthwith betook himself again to his hammock where he lay uttering in a low growling tone of voice a repetition of oaths and imprecations for the space of fourandtwenty hours without ceasing this was a delicious meal to the lieutenant who eager to enhance the pleasure of the entertainment and at the same the conduce to the success of the cause he had espoused invented a stratagem the execution of which had all the effect he could desire he prevailed on pipes who was devoted to his service to get on the top of the chimney belonging to the commodores chamber at midnight and lower down by a rope a bunch of stinking whitings which being performed he put a speakingtrumpet to his mouth and hallooed down the vent in a voice like thunder trunnion trunnion turn out and be spliced or he still and be d this dreadful note the terror of which was increased by the silence and darkness of the night as well as the cello of the passage through which it was conveyed no sooner reached the ears of the astonished commodore than turning his eyes towards the place from whence this solemn address seemed to proceed he beheld a glittering object that vanished in an instant just as his superstitious fear had improved the apparition into some supernatural messenger clothed in shining array his opinion was confirmed by a sudden explosion which he took for thunder though it was no other than the noise of a pistol fired down the chimney by the boatswains mate according to the instructions he had received and he had time enough to descend before he was in any danger of being detected by his commodore who could not for an hour recollect himself from the amazement and consternation which had overpowered his faculties at length however he got up and rang his bell with great agitation he repeated the summons more than once but no regard being paid to this alarm his dread returned with double terror a cold sweat bedewed his limbs his knees knocked together his hair bristled up and the remains of his teeth were shattered in pieces in the convulsive vibrations of his jaws in the midst of this agony he made one desperate effort and bursting open the door of apartment bolted into hatchways chamber which happened to be on the same floor there he found the lieutenant in a counterfeit swoon who pretended to wake from his trance in an ejaculation of lord have mercy upon us and being questioned by the terrified commodore with regard to what had happened assured him he had heard the same voice and clap of thunder by which trunnion himself had been discomposed pipes whose turn it was to watch concurred in giving evidence to the same purpose and the commodore not only owned that he had heard the voice but likewise communicated his vision with all the aggravation which his disturbed fancy suggested a consultation immediately ensued in which mr hatchway gravely observed that the finger of heaven was plainly perceivable in those signals and that it would be both sinful and foolish to disregard its commands especially as the match proposed was in all respects more advantageous than any that one of his years could reasonably expect declaring that for his own part he would not endanger his soul and body by living one day longer under the same roof with a man who despised the will of heaven and tom pipes adhered to the same pious resolution trunnions perseverance could not resist the number and diversity of considerations that assaulted it he revolved in silence all the opposite motives that occurred to his reflection and after having been to all appearance bewildered in the labyrinth of his own thoughts he wiped the sweat from his forehead and heaving a piteous groan yielded to their remonstrances in these words well since it must be so i think we must evn grapple but d my eyes tis a d d hard case that a fellow of my years should be compelled dye see to beat up to windward all the rest of my life against the current of my own inclination this important article being discussed mr hatchway set out in the morning to visit the despairing shepherdess and was handsomely rewarded for the enlivening tidings with which he blessed her ears sick as she was she could not help laughing heartily at the contrivance in consequence of which her swains assent had been obtained and gave the lieutenant ten guineas for tom pipes in consideration of the part he acted in the farce in the afternoon the commodore suffered himself to be conveyed to her apartment like a felon to execution and was received by her in a languishing manner and genteel dishabille accompanied by her sisterinlaw who was for very obvious reasons extremely solicitous about her success though the lieutenant had tutored him touching his behaviour it this interview he made a thousand wry faces before he could pronounce the simple salutation of how dye to his mistress and after his counsellor had urged him with twenty or thirty whispers to each of which he had replied aloud d your eyes i wont he got up and halting towards the couch on which mrs grizzle reclined in a state of strange expectation he seized her hand and pressed it to his lips but this piece of gallantry he performed in such a reluctant uncouth indignant manner that the nymph had need of all her resolution to endure the compliment without shrinking and he himself was so disconcerted at what he had done that he instantly retired to the other end of the room where he sat silent and broiled with shame and vexation mrs pickle like a sensible matron quitted the place on pretence of going to the nursery and mr hatchway taking the hint recollected that he had left his tobaccopouch in the parlour whither he descended leaving the two lovers to their mutual endearments never had the commodore found himself in such a disagreeable dilemma before he sat in an agony of suspense as if he every moment dreaded the dissolution of nature and the imploring sighs of his future bride added if possible to the pangs of his distress impatient of this situation he rolled his eye around in quest of some relief and unable to contain himself exclaimed d n seize the fellow and his pouch too i believe he has sheered off and left me here in the stays mrs grizzle who could not help taking some notice of this manifestation of chagrin lamented her unhappy fate in being so disagreeable to him that he could not put up with her company for a few moments without repining and began in very tender terms to reproach him with his inhumanity and indifference to this expostulation he replied zounds what would the woman have let the parson do his office when he wool here i am ready to be reeved in the matrimonial block dye see and d all nonsensical palaver so saying he retreated leaving his mistress not at all disobliged at his plain dealing that same evening the treaty of marriage was brought upon the carpet and by means of mr pickle and the lieutenant settled to the satisfaction of all parties without the intervention of lawyers whom mr trunnion expressly excluded from all share in the business making that condition the indispensable preliminary of the whole agreement things being brought to this bearing mrs grizzles heart dilated with joy her health which by the bye was never dangerously impaired she recovered as if by enchantment and a day being fixed for the nuptials employed the short period of her celibacy in choosing ornaments for the celebration of her entrance into the married state chapter viii preparations are made for the commodores wedding which is delayed by an accident that hurried him the lord knows whither the fame of this extraordinary conjunction spread all over the county and on the day appointed for their spousals the church was surrounded by an inconceivable multitude the commodore to give a specimen of his gallantry by the advice of his friend hatchway resolved to appear on horseback on the grand occasion at the head of all his male attendants whom he had rigged with the white shirts and black caps formerly belonging to his barges crew and he bought a couple of hunters for the accommodation of himself and his lieutenant with this equipage then he set out from the garrison for the church after having despatched a messenger to apprise the bride that he and his company were mounted she got immediately into the coach accompanied by her brother and his wife and drove directly to the place of assignation where several pews were demolished and divers persons almost pressed to death by the eagerness of the crowd that broke in to see the ceremony performed thus arrived at the altar and the priest in attendance they waited a whole halfhour for the commodore at whose slowness they began to be under some apprehension and accordingly dismissed a servant to quicken his pace the valet having ridden something more than a mile espied the whole troop disposed in a long field crossing the road obliquely and headed by the bridegroom and his friend hatchway who finding himself hindered by a hedge from proceeding farther in the same direction fired a pistol and stood over to the other side making an obtuse angle with the line of his former course and the rest of the squadron followed his example keeping always in the rear of each other like a flight of wild geese surprised at this strange method of journeying the messenger came up and told the commodore that his lady and her company expected him in the church where they had tarried a considerable time and were beginning to be very uneasy at his delay and therefore desired he would proceed with more expedition to this message mr trunnion replied hark ye brother dont you see we make all possible speed go back and tell those who sent you that the wind has shifted since we weighed anchor and that we are obliged to make very short trips in tacking by reason of the narrowness of the channel and that as we be within six points of the wind they must make some allowance for variation and leeway lord sir said the valet what occasion have you to go zigzag in that manner do but clap spurs to your horses and ride straight forward and ill engage yea shall be at the churchporch in less than a quarter of an hourwhat right in the winds eye answered the commodore ahey brother where did you learn your navigation hawser trunnion is not to be taught at this time of day how to lie his course or keep his own reckoning and as for you brother you best know the trim of your own frigate the courier finding he had to do with people who would not be easily persuaded out of their own opinions returned to the temple and made a report of what he had seen and heard to the no small consolation of the bride who had begun to discover some signs of disquiet composed however by this piece of intelligence she exerted her patience for the space of another halfhour during which period seeing no bridegroom arrive she was exceedingly alarmed so that all the spectators could easily perceive her perturbation which manifested itself in frequent palpitations heartheavings and alterations of countenance in spite of the assistance of a smellingbottle which she incessantly applied to her nostrils various were the conjectures of the company on this occasion some imagined he had mistaken the place of rendezvous as he had never been at church since he first settled in that parish others believed he had met with some accident in consequence of which his attendants had carried him back to his own house and a third set in which the bride herself was thought to be comprehended could not help suspecting that the commodore had changed his mind but all these suppositions ingenious as they were happened to be wide of the true cause that detained him which was no other than this the commodore and his crew had by dint of turning almost weathered the parsons house that stood to windward of the church when the notes of a pack of hounds unluckily reached the ears of the two hunters which trunnion and the lieutenant bestrode these fleet animals no sooner heard the enlivening sound than eager for the chase they sprang away all of a sudden and strained every nerve to partake of the sport flew across the fields with incredible speed overleaped hedges and ditches and everything in their way without the least regard to their unfortunate riders the lieutenant whose steed had got the heels of the other finding it would be great folly and presumption in him to pretend to keep the saddle with his wooden leg very wisely took the opportunity of throwing himself off in his passage through a field of rich clover among which he lay at his ease and seeing his captain advancing at full gallop hailed him with the salutation of what cheer ho the commodore who was in infinite distress eyeing him askance as he passed replied with a faltering voice d ye you are safe at an anchor i wish to god i were as fast moored nevertheless conscious of his disabled heel he would not venture to try the experiment which had succeeded so well with hatchway but resolved to stick as close as possible to his horses back until providence should interpose in his behalf with this view he dropped his whip and with his right hand laid fast hold on the pommel contracting every muscle in his body to secure himself in the seat and grinning most formidably in consequence of this exertion in this attitude he was hurried on a considerable way when all of a sudden his view was comforted by a fivebar gate that appeared before him as he never doubted that there the career of his hunter must necessarily end but alas he reckoned without his host far from halting at this obstruction the horse sprang over it with amazing agility to the utter confusion and disorder of his owner who lost his hat and periwig in the leap and now began to think in good earnest that he was actually mounted on the back of the devil he recommended himself to god his reflections forsook him his eyesight and all his other senses failed he quitted the reins and fastening by instinct on the mane was in this condition conveyed into the midst of the sportsmen who were astonished at the sight of such an apparition neither was their surprise to be wondered at if we reflect on the figure that presented itself to their view the commodores person was at all times an object of admiration much more so on this occasion when every singularity was aggravated by the circumstances of his dress and disaster he had put on in honour of his nuptials his best coat of blue broadcloth cut by a tailor of ramsgate and trimmed with five dozen of brass buttons large and small his breeches were of the same piece fastened at the knees with large bunches of tape his waistcoat was of red plush lappelled with green velvet and garnished with vellum holes his boots bore an infinite resemblance both in colour and shape to a pair of leather buckets his shoulder was graced with a broad buff belt from whence depended a huge hanger with a hilt like that of a backsword and on each side of his pommel appeared a rusty pistol rammed in a case covered with a bearskin the loss of his tieperiwig and laced hat which were curiosities of the kind did not at all contribute to the improvement of the picture but on the contrary by exhibiting his bald pate and the natural extension of his lantern jaws added to the peculiarity and extravagance of the whole such a spectacle could not have failed of diverting the whole company from the chase had his horse thought proper to pursue a different route but the beast was too keen a sporter to choose any other way than that which the stag followed and therefore without stopping to gratify the curiosity of the spectators he in a few minutes outstripped every hunter in the field there being a deep hollow betwixt him and the hounds rather than ride round about the length of a furlong in a path that crossed the lane he transported himself at one jump to the unspeakable astonishment and terror of a waggoner who chanced to be underneath and saw this phenomenon fly over his carriage this was not the only adventure he achieved the stag having taken a deep river that lay in his way every man directed his course to a bridge in the neighbourhood but our bridegrooms courser despising all such conveniences plunged into the stream without hesitation and swam in a twinkling to the opposite shore this sudden immersion into an element of which trunnion was properly a native in all probability helped to recruit the exhausted spirits of his rider at his landing on the other side gave some tokens of sensation by hallooing aloud for assistance which he could not possibly receive because his horse still maintained the advantage he had gained and would not allow himself to be overtaken in short after a long chase that lasted several hours and extended to a dozen miles at least he was the first in at the death of the deer being seconded by the lieutenants gelding which actuated by the same spirit had without a rider followed his companions example our bridegroom finding himself at last brought up or in other words at the end of his career took the opportunity of this first pause to desire the huntsmen would lend him a hand in dismounting and by their condescension safely placed on the grass where he sat staring at the company as they came in with such wildness of astonishment in his looks as if he bad been a creature of another species dropped among them from the clouds before they had fleshed the hounds however he recollected himself and seeing one of the sportsmen take a small flask out of his pocket and apply it to his mouth judged the cordial to be no other than neat cognac which it really was and expressing a desire of participation was immediately accommodated with a moderate dose which perfectly completed his recovery by this time he and his two horses had engrossed the attention of the whole crowd while some admired the elegant proportion and uncommon spirit of the two animals the rest contemplated the surprising appearance of their master whom before they had only seen en passant and at length one of the gentlemen accosting him very courteously signified his wonder at seeing him in such an equipage and asked if he had not dropped his companion by the way why look ye brother replied the commodore mayhap you think me an odd sort of a fellow seeing me in this trim especially as i have lost part of my rigging but this here is the case dye see i weighed anchor from my own house this morning at ten am with fair weather and a favourable breeze at southsoutheast being bound to the next church on the voyage of matrimony but howsomever we had not run down a quarter of a league when the wind shifting blowed directly in our teeth so that we were forced to tack all the way dye see and had almost been up within sight of the port when these sonsofb s of horses which i had bought but two days before for my own part i believe they are devils incarnate luffed round in a trice and then refusing the helm drove away like lightning with me and my lieutenant who soon came to anchor in an exceeding good berth as for my own part i have been carried over rocks and quicksands among which i have pitched away a special good tieperiwig and an ironbound hat and at last thank god am got into smooth water and safe riding but if ever i venture my carcass upon such a hareum scareum bloodofab again my name is not hawser trunnion d my eyes one of the company struck with this name which lie had often heard immediately laid hold on his declaration at the close of this singular account and observing that his horses were very vicious asked how he intended to return as for that matter replied mr trunnion i am resolved to hire a sledge or waggon or such a thing as a jackass for ill be d d if ever i cross the back of a horse again and what do you propose to do with these creatures said the other pointing to the hunters they seem to have some mettle but then they are mere colts and will take the devilandall of breaking methinks this hinder one is shoulderslipped d them cried the commodore i wish both their necks were broke thof the two cost me forty good yellowboysforty guineas exclaimed the stranger who was a squire and a jockey as well as owner of the pack lord lord how a man may be imposed upon why these cattle are clumsy enough to go to plough mind what a flat counter do but observe how sharp this here one is in the withers then hes fired in the further fetlock in short this connoisseur in horseflesh having discovered in them all the defects which can possibly be found in this species of animal offered to give him ten guineas for the two saying he would convert them into beasts of burden the owner who after what had happened was very well disposed to listen to anything that was said to their prejudice implicitly believed the truth of the strangers asseverations discharged a furious volley of oaths against the rascal who had taken him in and forthwith struck a bargain with the squire who paid him instantly for his purchase in consequence of which he won the plate at the next canterbury races this affair being transacted to the mutual satisfaction of both parties as well as to the general entertainment of the company who laughed in their sleeves at the dexterity of their friend trunnion was set upon the squires own horse and led by his servant in the midst of this cavalcade which proceeded to a neighbouring village where they had bespoke dinner and where our bridegroom found means to provide himself with another hat and wig with regard to his marriage he bore his disappointment with the temper of a philosopher and the exercise he had undergone having quickened his appetite sat down at table in the midst of his new acquaintance making a very hearty meal and moistening every morsel with a draught of the ale which he found very much to his satisfaction chapter ix he is found by lieutenant reconducted to his own house married to mrs grizzle who meets with a small misfortune in the night and asserts her prerogative next morning in consequence of which her husbands eye is endangered meanwhile lieutenant hatchway made shift to hobble to the church where he informed the company of what had happened to the commodore and the bride behaved with great decency on the occasion for as she understood the danger to which her future husband was exposed she fainted in the arms of her sisterinlaw to the surprise of all the spectators who could not comprehend the cause of her disorder and when she was recovered by the application of smellingbottles earnestly begged that mr hatchway and tom pipes should take her brothers coach and go in quest of their commander this task they readily undertook being escorted by all the rest of his adherents on horseback while the bride and her friends were invited to the parsons horse and the ceremony deferred till another occasion the lieutenant steering his course as near the line of direction in which trunnion went off as the coachroad would permit got intelligence of his track from one farmhouse to another for such an apparition could not fail of attracting particular notice and one of the horsemen having picked up his hat and wig in a bypath the whole troop entered the village where he was lodged about four oclock in the afternoon when they understood he was safely housed at the george they rode up to the door in a body and expressed their satisfaction in three cheers which were returned by the company within as soon as they were instructed in the nature of the salute by trunnion who by this time had entered into all the jollity of his new friends and was indeed more than halfseasover the lieutenant was introduced to all present as his sworn brother and had something tossed up for his dinner tom pipes and the crew were regaled in another room and a fresh pair of horses being put to the coach about six in the evening the commodore with all his attendants departed for the garrison after having shook hands with every individual in the house without any further accident he was conveyed in safety to his own gate before nine and committed to the care of pipes who carried him instantly to his hammock while the lieutenant was driven away to the place where the bride and her friends remained in great anxiety which vanished when he assured them that his commodore was safe being succeeded by abundance of mirth and pleasantry at the account he gave of trunnions adventure another day was fixed for the nuptials and in order to balk the curiosity of idle people which had given great offence the parson was prevailed upon to perform the ceremony in the garrison which all that day was adorned with flags and pendants displayed and at night illuminated by the direction of hatchway who also ordered the patereroes to be fired as soon as the marriageknot was tied neither were the other parts of the entertainment neglected by this ingenious contriver who produced undeniable proofs of his elegance and art in the weddingsupper which had been committed to his management and direction this genial banquet was entirely composed of seadishes a huge pillaw consisting of a large piece of beef sliced a couple of fowls and half a peck of rice smoked in the middle of the board a dish of hard fish swimming in oil appeared at each end the sides being furnished with a mess of that savoury composition known by the name of lubscourse and a plate of salmagundy the second course displayed a goose of a monstrous magnitude flanked with two guineahens a pig barbacued a hock of salt pork in the midst of a peasepudding a leg of mutton roasted with potatoes and another boiled with yams the third service was made up of a loin of fresh pork with applesauce a kid smothered with onions and a terrapin baked in the shell and last of all a prodigious seapie was presented with an infinite volume of pancakes and fritters that everything might be answerable to the magnificence of this delicate feast he had provided vast quantifies of strong beer flip rumbo and burnt brandy with plenty of barbadoes water for the ladies and hired all the fiddles within six miles which with the addition of a drum bagpipe and welsh harp regaled the guests with a most melodious concert the company who were not at all exceptions seemed extremely well pleased with every particular of the entertainment and the evening being spent in the most social manner the bride was by her sister conducted to her apartment where however a trifling circumstance had like to have destroyed the harmony which had been hitherto maintained i have already observed that there was not one standing bed within the walls therefore the reader will not wonder that mrs trunnion was out of humour when she found herself under the necessity of being confined with her spouse in a hammock which though enlarged with a double portion of canvas and dilated with a yoke for the occasion was at best but a disagreeable not to say dangerous situation she accordingly complained with some warmth of this inconvenience which she imputed to disrespect and at first absolutely refused to put up with the expedient but mrs pickle soon brought her to reason and compliance by observing that one night will soon be elapsed and next day she might regulate her own economy thus persuaded she ventured into the vehicle and was visited by her husband in less than an hour the company being departed to their own homes and the garrison left to the command of his lieutenant and mate but it seems the hooks that supported this swinging couch were not calculated for the addition of weight which they were now destined to bear and therefore gave way in the middle of the night to the no small terror of mrs trunnion who perceiving herself falling screamed aloud and by that exclamation brought hatchway with a light into the chamber though she had received no injury by the fall she was extremely discomposed and incensed at the accident which she even openly ascribed to the obstinacy and whimsical oddity of the commodore in such petulant terms as evidently declared that she thought her great aim accomplished and her authority secured against all the shocks of fortune indeed her bedfellow seemed to be of the same opinion by his tacit resignation for he made no reply to her insinuations but with a most vinegar aspect crawled out of his nest and betook himself to rest in another apartment while his irritated spouse dismissed the lieutenant and from the wreck of the hammock made an occasional bed for herself on the floor fully determined to provide better accommodation for the next nights lodging having no inclination to sleep her thoughts during the remaining part of the night were engrossed by a scheme of reformation she was resolved to execute in the family and no sooner did the first lark bid salutation to the morn than starting from her humble couch and huddling on her clothes she sallied from her chamber explored her way through paths before unknown and in the course of her researches perceived a large bell to which she made such effectual application as alarmed every soul in the family in a moment she was surrounded by hatchway pipes and all the rest of the servants halfdressed but seeing none of the feminine gender appear she began to storm at the sloth and laziness of the maids who she observed ought to have been at work an hour at least before she called and then for the first time understood that no woman was permitted to sleep within the walls she did not fail to exclaim against this regulation and being informed that the cook and chambermaid lodged in a small officehouse that stood without the gate ordered the drawbridge to be let down and in person beat up their quarters commanding them forthwith to set about scouring the rooms which had not been hitherto kept in a very decent condition while two men were immediately employed to transport the bed on which she used to lie from her brothers house to her new habitation so that in less than two hours the whole economy of the garrison was turned topsyturvy and everything involved in tumult and noise trunnion being disturbed and distracted with the uproar turned out in his shirt like a maniac and arming himself with a cudgel of crabtree made an irruption into his wifes apartment where perceiving a couple of carpenters at work in joining a bedstead he with many dreadful oaths and opprobrious invectives ordered them to desist swearing he would suffer no bulkheads nor hurricanehouses to stand where he was master but finding his remonstrances disregarded by these mechanics who believed him to be some madman belonging to the family who had broken from his confinement he assaulted them both with great fury and indignation and was handled so roughly in the encounter that in a very short time he measured his length on the floor in consequence of a blow that he received from a hammer by which the sight of his remaining eye was grievously endangered having thus reduced him to a state of subjection they resolved to secure him with cords and were actually busy in adjusting his fetters when he was exempted from the disgrace by the accidental entrance of his spouse who rescued him from the hands of his adversaries and in the midst of her condolence imputed his misfortune to the inconsiderate roughness of his own disposition he breathed nothing but revenge and made some efforts to chastise the insolence of the workmen who as soon as they understood his quality asked forgiveness for what they had done with great humility protesting that they did not know he was master of the house but far from being satisfied with this apology he groped about for the bell the inflammation of his eye having utterly deprived him of sight and the rope being by the precaution of the delinquents conveyed out of his reach began to storm with incredible vociferation like a lion roaring in the toil pouring forth innumerable oaths and execrations and calling by name hatchway and pipes who being within hearing obeyed the extraordinary summons and were ordered to put the carpenters in irons for having audaciously assaulted him in his own house his myrmidons seeing he had been eviltreated were exasperated at the insult he had suffered which they considered as an affront upon the dignity of the garrison the more so as the mutineers seemed to put themselves in a posture of defence and set their authority at defiance they therefore unsheathed their cutlasses which they commonly wore as badges of their commission and a desperate engagement in all probability would have ensued had not the lady of the castle interposed and prevented the effects of their animosity by assuring the lieutenant that the commodore had been the aggressor and that the workmen finding themselves attacked in such an extraordinary manner by a person whom they did not know were obliged to act in their own defence by which he had received that unlucky contusion mr hatchway no sooner learnt the sentiments of mrs trunnion than sheathing his indignation he told the commodore he should always be ready to execute his lawful commands but that he could not in conscience be concerned in oppressing poor people who had been guilty of no offence this unexpected declaration together with the behaviour of his wife who in his hearing desired the carpenters to resume their work filled the breast of trunnion with rage and mortification he pulled off his woollen nightcap pummeled his bare pate beat the floor alternately with his feet swore his people had betrayed him and cursed himself to the lowest pit of hell for having admitted such a cockatrice into his family but all these exclamations did not avail they were among the last essays of his resistance to the will of his wife whose influence among his adherents had already swallowed up his own and peremptorily told him that he must leave the management of everything withindoors to her who understood best what was for his honour and advantage she then ordered a poultice to be prepared for his eye which being applied he was committed to the care of pipes by whom he was led about the house like a blind bear growling for prey while his industrious yokefellow executed every circumstance of the plan she had projected so that when he recovered his vision he was an utter stranger in his own house chapter x the commodore being in some cases restive his lady has recourse to artifice in the establishment of her throne she exhibits symptoms of pregnancy to the unspeakable joy of trunnion who nevertheless is balked in his expectation these innovations were not effected without many loud objections on his part and divers curious dialogues passed between him and his yokefellow who always came off victorious from the dispute insomuch that his countenance gradually fell he began to suppress and at length entirely devoured his chagrin the terrors of superior authority were plainly perceivable in his features and in less than three months he became a thoroughpaced husband not that his obstinacy was extinguished though overcome in some things he was as inflexible and mulish as ever but then he durst not kick so openly and was reduced to the necessity of being passive in his resentments mrs trunnion for example proposed that a coach and six should be purchased as she could not ride on horseback and the chaise was a scandalous carriage for a person of her condition the commodore conscious of his own inferior capacity in point of reasoning did not think proper to dispute the proposal but lent a deaf ear to her repeated remonstrances though they were enforced with every argument which she thought could soothe terrify shame or decoy him into compliance in vain did she urge the excess of affection she had for him as meriting some return of tenderness and condescension he was even proof against certain menacing hints she gave touching the resentment of a slighted woman and he stood out against all the considerations of dignity or disgrace like a bulwark of brass neither was he moved to any indecent or unkind expressions of contradiction even when she upbraided him with his sordid disposition and put him in mind of the fortune and honour he had acquired by his marriage but seemed to retire within himself like a tortoise when attacked that shrinks within its shell and silently endured the scourge of her reproaches without seeming sensible of the smart this however was the only point in which she had been baffled since her nuptials and as she could by no means digest the miscarriage she tortured her invention for some new plan by which she might augment her influence and authority what her genius refused was supplied by accident for she had not lived four months in the garrison when she was seized with frequent qualms and retchings in a word she congratulated herself on the symptoms of her own fertility and the commodore was transported with joy at the prospect of an heir of his own begetting she knew this was the proper season for vindicating her own sovereignty and accordingly employed the means which nature had put in her power there was not a rare piece of furniture or apparel for which she did not long and one day as she went to church seeing lady statelys equipage arrive she suddenly fainted away her husband whose vanity had never been so perfectly gratified as with this promised harvest of his own sowing took the alarm immediately and in order to prevent relapses of that kind which might be attended with fatal consequence to his hope gave her leave to bespeak a coach horses and liveries to her own liking thus authorized she in a very little time exhibited such a specimen of her own taste and magnificence as afforded speculation to the whole country and made trunnions heart quake within him because he foresaw no limits to her extravagance which also manifested itself in the most expensive preparations for her lyingin her pride which had hitherto regarded the representative of her fathers house seemed now to lose all that hereditary respect and prompt her to outshine and undervalue the elder branch of her family she behaved to mrs pickle with a sort of civil reserve that implied a conscious superiority and an emulation in point of grandeur immediately commenced between the two sisters she every day communicated her importance to the whole parish under pretence of taking the air in her coach and endeavoured to extend her acquaintance among people of fashion nor was this an undertaking attended with great difficulty for all persons whatever capable of maintaining a certain appearance will always find admission into what is called the best company and be rated in point of character according to their own valuation without subjecting their pretensions to the smallest doubt or examination in all her visits and parties she seized every opportunity of declaring her present condition observing that she was forbid by her physicians to taste such a pickle and that such a dish was poison to a woman in her way nay where she was on a footing of familiarity she affected to make wry faces and complained that the young rogue began to be very unruly writhing herself into divers contortions as if she had been grievously incommoded by the mettle of this future trunnion the husband himself did not behave with all the moderation that might have been expected at the club he frequently mentioned this circumstance of his own vigour as a pretty successful feat to be performed by an old fellow of fiftyfive and confirmed the opinion of his strength by redoubled squeezes of the landlords hand which never failed of extorting a satisfactory certificate of his might when his companions drank to the hans en kelder or jack in the low cellar he could not help displaying an extraordinary complacence of countenance and signified his intention of sending the young dog to sea as soon as he should be able to carry a cartridge in hopes of seeing him an officer before his own death this hope helped to console him under the extraordinary expense to which he was exposed by the profusion of his wife especially when he considered that his compliance with her prodigality would be limited to the expiration of the nine months of which the best part was by this time elapsed yet in spite of all this philosophical resignation her fancy sometimes soared to such a ridiculous and intolerable pitch of insolence and absurdity that his temper forsook him and he could not help wishing in secret that her pride might be confounded in the dissipation of her most flattering hopes even though he himself should be a principal sufferer by the disappointment these however were no other than the suggestions of temporary disgusts that commonly subsided as suddenly as they arose and never gave the least disturbance to the person who inspired them because he took care to conceal them carefully from her knowledge meanwhile she happily advanced in her reckoning with the promise of a favourable issue the term of her computation expired and in the middle of the night she was visited by certain warnings that seemed to bespeak the approach of the critical moment the commodore got up with great alacrity and called the midwife who had been several days in the house the gossips were immediately summoned and the most interesting expectations prevailed but the symptoms of labour gradually vanished and as the matrons sagely observed this was no more than a false alarm two nights after they received a second intimation and as she was sensibly diminished in the waist everything was supposed to be in a fair way yet this visitation was not more conclusive than the former her pains wore off in spite of all her endeavours to encourage them and the good women betook themselves to their respective homes in expectation of finding the third attack decisive alluding to the wellknown maxim that number three is always fortunate for once however this apophthegm failed the next call was altogether as ineffectual as the former and moreover attended with a phenomenon which to them was equally strange and inexplicable this was no other than such a reduction in the size of mrs trunnion as might have been expected after the birth of a fullgrown child startled at such an unaccountable event they sat in close divan and concluding that the case was in all respects unnatural and prodigious desired that a messenger might be immediately despatched for some male practitioner in the art of midwifery the commodore without guessing the cause of her perplexity ordered pipes immediately on this piece of duty and in less than two hours they were assisted by the advice of a surgeon of the neighbourhood who boldly affirmed that the patient had never been with child this asseveration was like a clap of thunder to mr trunnion who had been during eight whole days and nights in continual expectation of being hailed with the appellation of father after some recollection he swore the surgeon was an ignorant fellow and that he would not take his word for what he advanced being comforted and confirmed in his want of faith by the insinuations of the midwife who still persisted to feed mrs trunnion with hopes of a speedy and safe delivery observing that she had been concerned in many a case of the same nature where a fine child was found even after all signs of the mothers pregnancy had disappeared every twig of hope how slender soever it may be is eagerly caught hold on by people who find themselves in danger of being disappointed to every question proposed by her to the lady with the preambles of hant you or dont you answer was made in the affirmative whether agreeable to truth or not because the respondent could not find in her heart to disown any symptom that might favour the notion she had so long indulged this experienced proficient in the obstetric art was therefore kept in close attendance for the space of three weeks during which the patient had several returns of what she pleased herself with believing to be labour pains till at length she and her husband became the standing joke of the parish and this infatuated couple could scarce be prevailed upon to part with their hope even when she appeared as lank as a greyhound and they were furnished with other unquestionable proofs of their having been deceived but they could not for ever remain under the influence of this sweet delusion which at last faded away and was succeeded by a paroxysm of shame and confusion that kept the husband withindoors for the space of a whole fortnight and confined his lady to her bed for a series of weeks during which she suffered all the anguish of the most intense mortification yet even this was subdued by the lenient hand of time the first respite from her chagrin was employed in the strict discharge of what are called the duties of religion which she performed with the most rancorous severity setting on foot a persecution in her own family that made the house too hot for all the menial servants even ruffled the almost invincible indifference of tom pipes harassed the commodore himself out of all patience and spared no individual but lieutenant hatchway whom she never ventured to disoblige chapter xi mrs trunnion erects a tyranny in the garrison while her husband conceives an affection for his nephew perry who manifests a peculiarity of disposition even in his tender years having exercised herself three months in such pious amusements she appeared again in the world but her misfortune had made such an impression on her mind that she could not bear the sight of a child and trembled whenever conversation happened to turn upon a christening her temper which was naturally none of the sweetest seemed to have imbibed a double proportion of souring from her disappointment of consequence her company was not much coveted and she found very few people disposed to treat her with those marks of consideration which she looked upon as her due this neglect detached her from the society of an unmannerly world she concentrated the energy of all her talents in the government of her own house which groaned accordingly under her arbitrary sway and in the brandybottle found ample consolation for all the affliction she had undergone as for the commodore he in a little time weathered his disgrace after having sustained many severe jokes from the lieutenant and now his chief aim being to be absent from his own house as much as possible he frequented the publichouse more than ever more assiduously cultivated the friendship of his brotherinlaw mr pickle and in the course of their intimacy conceived an affection for his nephew perry which did not end but with his life indeed it must be owned that trunnion was not naturally deficient in the social passions of the soul which though they were strangely warped disguised and overborne by the circumstance of his boisterous life and education did not fail to manifest themselves occasionally through the whole course of his behaviour as all the hopes of propagating his own name had perished and his relations lay under the interdiction of his hate it is no wonder that through the familiarity and friendly intercourse subsisting between him and mr gamaliel he contracted a liking for the boy who by this time entered the third year of his age and was indeed a very handsome healthy and promising child and what seemed to ingratiate him still more with his uncle was a certain oddity of disposition for which he had been remarkable even from his cradle it is reported of him that before the first year of his infancy was elapsed he used very often immediately after being dressed in the midst of the caresses which were bestowed upon him by his mother while she indulged herself in the contemplation of her own happiness all of a sudden to alarm her with a fit of shrieks and cries which continued with great violence till he was stripped to the skin with the utmost expedition by order of his affrighted parent who thought his tender body was tortured by the misapplication of some unlucky pill and when he had given them all this disturbance and unnecessary trouble he would he sprawling and laughing in their faces as if he ridiculed the impertinence of their concern nay it is affirmed that one day when an old woman who attended in the nursery had by stealth conveyed a bottle of cordial waters to her mouth he pulled his nurse by the sleeve by a slight glance detected the theft and tipped her the wink with a particular slyness of countenance as if he had said with a sneer ay ay that is what you must all come to but these instances of reflection in a babe nine months old are so incredible that i look upon them as observations founded upon imaginary recollection when he was in a more advanced age and his peculiarities of temper became much more remarkable of a piece with the ingenious discoveries of those sagacious observers who can discern something evidently characteristic in the features of any noted personage whose character they have previously heard explained yet without pretending to specify at what period of his childhood this singularity first appeared i can with great truth declare that when he first attracted the notice and affection of his uncle it was plainly perceivable one would imagine he had marked out the commodore as a proper object of ridicule for almost all his little childish satire was leveled against him i will not deny that he might have been influenced in this particular by the example and instruction of mr hatchway who delighted in superintending the first essays of his genius as the gout had taken up its residence in mr trunnions great toe from whence it never removed no not for a day little perry took great pleasure in treading by accident on this infirm member and when his uncle incensed by the pain used to damn him for a hellbegotten brat he would appease him in a twinkling by returning the curse with equal emphasis and asking what was the matter with old hannibal tough an appellation by which the lieutenant had taught him to distinguish this grim commander neither was this the only experiment he tried upon the patience of the commodore with whose nose he used to take indecent freedoms even while he was fondled on his knee in one month he put him to the expense of two guineas in sealskin by picking his pocket of divers tobaccopouches all of which he in secret committed to the flames nor did the caprice of his disposition abstain from the favourite beverage of trunnion who more than once swallowed a whole draught in which his brothers snuffbox had been emptied before he perceived the disagreeable infusion and one day when the commodore had chastised him by a gentle tap with his cane he fell flat on the floor as if he had been deprived of all sense and motion to the terror and amazement of the striker and after having filled the whole house with confusion and dismay opened his eyes and laughed heartily at the success of his own imposition it would be an endless and perhaps no very agreeable task to enumerate all the unlucky pranks he played upon his uncle and others before he attained the fourth year of his age about which time he was sent with an attendant to a dayschool in the neighbourhood that to use his good mothers own expression he might be out of harms way here however he made little progress except in mischief which he practised with impunity because the schoolmistress would run no risk of disobliging a lady of fortune by exercising unnecessary severities upon her only child nevertheless mrs pickle was not so blindly partial as to be pleased with such unseasonable indulgence perry was taken out of the hands of this courteous teacher and committed to the instruction of a pedagogue who was ordered to administer such correction as the boy should in his opinion deserve this authority he did not neglect to use his pupil was regularly flogged twice a day and after having been subjected to this course of discipline for the space of eighteen months declared the most obstinate dull and untoward genius that ever had fallen under his cultivation instead of being reformed he seemed rather hardened and confirmed in his vicious inclinations and was dead to all sense of fear as well as shame his mother was extremely mortified at these symptoms of stupidity which she considered as an inheritance derived from the spirit of his father and consequently insurmountable by all the efforts of human care but the commodore rejoiced over the ruggedness of his nature and was particularly pleased when upon inquiry he found that perry had beaten all the boys in the school a circumstance from which he prognosticated everything that was fair and fortunate in his future fate observing that at his age he himself was just such another the boy who was now turned of six having profited so little under the birch of his unsparing governor mrs pickle was counselled to send him to a boardingschool not far from london which was kept by a certain person very eminent for his successful method of education this advice she the more readily embraced because at that time she found herself pretty far gone with another child that she hoped would console her for the disappointment she had met with in the unpromising talents of perry or at any rate divide her concern so as to enable her to endure the absence of either chapter xii peregrine is sent to a boardingschool becomes remarkable for his genius and ambition the commodore understanding her determination to which her husband did not venture to make the least objection interested himself so much in behalf of his favourite as to fit him out at his own charge and accompany him in person to the place of his destination where he defrayed the expense of his entrance and left him to the particular care and inspection of the usher who having been recommended to him as a person of parts and integrity received per advance a handsome consideration for the task he undertook nothing could be better judged than this piece of liberality the assistant was actually a man of learning probity and good sense and though obliged by the scandalous administration of fortune to act in the character of an inferior teacher had by his sole capacity and application brought the school to that degree of reputation which it never could have obtained from the talents of its superior he had established an economy which though regular was not at all severe by enacting a body of laws suited to the age and comprehension of every individual and each transgressor was fairly tried by his peers and punished according to the verdict of the jury no boy was scourged for want of apprehension but a spirit of emulation was raised by welltimed praise and artful comparison and maintained by a distribution of small prizes which were adjudged to those who signalized themselves either by their industry sobriety or genius this tutor whose name was jennings began with perry according to his constant maxim by examining the soil that is studying his temper in order to consult the bias of his disposition which was strangely perverted by the absurd discipline he had undergone he found him in a state of sullen insensibility which the child had gradually contracted in a long course of stupefying correction and at first he was not in the least actuated by that commendation which animated the rest of his schoolfellows nor was it in the power of reproach to excite his ambition which had been buried as it were in the grave of disgrace the usher therefore had recourse to contemptuous neglect with which he affected to treat this stubborn spirit foreseeing that if he retained any seeds of sentiment this weather would infallibly raise them into vegetation his judgment was justified by the event the boy in a little time began to make observations he perceived the marks of distinction with which virtue was rewarded grew ashamed of the despicable figure he himself made among his companions who far from courting rather shunned his conversation and actually pined at his own want of importance mr jennings saw and rejoiced at his mortification which he suffered to proceed as far as possible without endangering his health the child lost all relish for diversion loathed his food grew pensive solitary and was frequently found weeping by himself these symptoms plainly evinced the recovery of his feelings to which his governor thought it now high time to make application and therefore by little and little altered his behaviour from the indifference he had put on to the appearance of more regard and attention this produced a favourable change in the boy whose eyes sparkled with satisfaction one day when his master expressed himself with a show of surprise in these words so perry i find you dont want genius when you think proper to use it such encomiums kindled the spirit of emulation in his little breast he exerted himself with surprising alacrity by which he soon acquitted himself of the imputation of dullness and obtained sundry honorary silver pennies as acknowledgments of his application his schoolfellows now solicited his friendship as eagerly as they had avoided it before and in less than a twelvemonth after his arrival this supposed dunce was remarkable for the brightness of his parts having in that short period learnt to read english perfectly well made great progress in writing enabled himself to speak the french language without hesitation and acquired some knowledge in the rudiments of the latin tongue the usher did not fail to transmit an account of his proficiency to the commodore who received it with transport and forthwith communicated the happy tidings to the parents mr gamaliel pickle who was never subject to violent emotions heard them with a sort of phlegmatic satisfaction that scarce manifested itself either in his countenance or expressions nor did the childs mother break forth into that rapture and admiration which might have been expected when she understood how much the talents of her firstborn had exceeded the hope of her warmest imagination not but that she professed herself well pleased with perrys reputation though she observed that in these commendations the truth was always exaggerated by schoolmasters for their own interest and pretended to wonder that the usher had not mingled more probability with his praise trunnion was offended at her indifference and want of faith and believing that she refined too much in her discernment swore that jennings had declared the truth and nothing but the truth for he himself had prophesied from the beginning that the boy would turn out a credit to his family but by this time mrs pickle was blessed with a daughter whom she had brought into the world about six months before the intelligence arrived so that her care and affection being otherwise engrossed the praise of perry was the less greedily devoured the abatement of her fondness was an advantage to his education which would have been retarded and perhaps ruined by pernicious indulgence and preposterous interposition had her love considered him as an only child whereas her concern being now diverted to another object that shared at least onehalf of her affection he was left to the management of his preceptor who tutored him according to his own plan without any let or interruption indeed all his sagacity and circumspection were but barely sufficient to keep the young gentleman in order for now that he had won the palm of victory from his rivals in point of scholarship his ambition dilated and he was seized with the desire of subjecting the whole school by the valour of his arm before he could bring his project to bear innumerable battles were fought with various success every day a bloody nose and complaint were presented against him and his own visage commonly bore some livid marks of obstinate contention at length however he accomplished his aim his adversaries were subdued his prowess acknowledged and he obtained the laurel in war as well is in wit thus triumphant he was intoxicated with success his pride rose in proportion to his power and in spite of all the endeavours of jennings who practised every method he could invent for curbing his licentious conduct without depressing his spirit he contracted a large proportion of insolence which series of misfortunes that happened to him in the sequel could scarce effectually tame nevertheless there was a fund of good nature and generosity in his composition and though he established a tyranny among his comrades the tranquility of his reign was maintained by the love rather than by the fear of his subjects in the midst of all this enjoyment of empire he never once violated that respectful awe with which the usher had found means to inspire him but he by no means preserved the same regard for the principal master an old illiterate german quack who had formerly practised corncutting among the quality and sold cosmetic washes to the ladies together with teethpowders hairdyeing liquors prolific elixirs and tinctures to sweeten the breath these nostrums recommended by the art of cringing in which he was consummate ingratiated him so much with people of fashion that he was enabled to set up school with fiveandtwenty boys of the best families whom he boarded on his own terms and undertook to instruct in the french and latin languages so as to qualify them for the colleges of westminster and eton while this plan was in its infancy he was so fortunate as to meet with jennings who for the paltry consideration of thirty pounds a year which his necessities compelled him to accept took the whole trouble of educating the children upon himself contrived an excellent system for that purpose and by his assiduity and knowledge executed all the particulars to the entire satisfaction of those concerned who by the bye never inquired into his qualifications but suffered the other to enjoy the fruits of his labour and ingenuity over and above a large stock of avarice ignorance and vanity this superior had certain ridiculous peculiarities in his person such as a hunch upon his back and distorted limbs that seemed to attract the satirical notice of peregrine who young as he was took offence at his want of reverence for his usher over whom he sometimes chose opportunities of displaying his authority that the boys might not misplace their veneration mr keypstick therefore such as i have described him incurred the contempt and displeasure of this enterprising pupil who now being in the tenth year of his age had capacity enough to give him abundance of vexation he underwent many mortifying jokes front the invention of pickle and his confederates so that he began to entertain suspicion of mr jennings who he could not help thinking had been at the bottom of them all and spirited up principles of rebellion in the school with a view of making himself independent possessed with this chimera which was void of all foundation the german descended so low as to tamper in private with the boys from whom he hoped to draw some very important discovery but he was disappointed in his expectations and this mean practice reaching the ears of his usher he voluntarily resigned his employment finding interest to obtain holy orders in a little time after he left the kingdom hoping to find a settlement in some of our american plantations the departure of mr jennings produced a great revolution in the affairs of keypstick which declined from that moment because he had neither authority to enforce obedience nor prudence to maintain order among his scholars so that the school degenerated into anarchy and confusion and he himself dwindled in the opinion of his employers who looked upon him as superannuated and withdrew their children front his tuition peregrine seeing this dissolution of their society and finding himself every day deprived of some companion began to repine at his situation and resolved if possible to procure his release from the jurisdiction of the person whom he both detested and despised with this view he went to work and composed the following billet addressed to the commodore which was the first specimen of his composition in the epistolary way honoured and loving uncle hoping you are in good health this serves to inform you that mr jennings is gone and mr keypstick will never meet with his fellow the school is already almost broke up and the rest daily going away and i beg of you of all love to have me fetched away also for i cannot bear to be any longer under one who is a perfect ignoramus who scarce knows the declination of musa and is more fit to be a scarecrow than a schoolmaster hoping you will send for me soon with my love to my aunt and my duty to my honoured parents craving their blessing and yours and this is all at present from honoured uncle your wellbeloved and dutiful nephew and godson and humble servant to command till death peregrine pickle trunnion was overjoyed at the receipt of this letter which he looked upon as one of the greatest efforts of human genius and as such communicated the contents to his lady whom he had disturbed for the purpose in the middle of her devotion by sending a message to her closet whither it was her custom very frequently to retire she was out of humour at being interrupted and therefore did not peruse this specimen of her nephews understanding with all the relish that the commodore himself had enjoyed on the contrary after sundry paralytical endeavours to speak for her tongue sometimes refused its office she observed that the boy was a pert jackanapes and deserved to be severely chastised for treating his betters with such disrespect her husband undertook his godsons defence representing with great warmth that he knew keypstick to be a goodfornothing pimping old rascal and that perry showed a great deal of spirit and good sense in desiring to be taken from under his command he therefore declared that the boy should not live a week longer with such a shambling son of a b and sanctioned this declaration with abundance of oaths mrs trunnion composing her countenance into a look of religions demureness rebuked him for his profane way of talking and asked in a magisterial tone if he intended never to lay aside that brutal behaviour irritated at this reproach he answered in terms of indignation that he knew how to behave himself as well as eer a woman that wore a head bade her mind her affairs and with another repetition of oaths gave her to understand that he would be master in his own house the insinuation operated upon her spirits like friction upon a glass globe her face gleamed with resentment and every pore seemed to emit particles of flame she replied with incredible fluency of the bitterest expressions he retorted equal rage in broken hints and incoherent imprecations she rejoined with redoubled fury and in conclusion he was fain to betake himself to flight ejaculating curses against her and muttering something concerning the brandybottle which however he took care should never reach her ears from his own house he went directly to visit mrs pickle to whom he imparted peregrines epistle with many encomiums upon the boys promising parts and finding his commendations but coolly received desired she would permit him to take his godson under his own care this lady whose family was now increased by another son who seemed to engross her care for the present had not seen perry during a course of four years and with regard to him was perfectly weaned of that infirmity known by the name of maternal fondness she therefore consented to the commodores request with great condescension and a polite compliment to him on the concern he had all along manifested for the welfare of the child chapter xiii the commodore takes peregrine under his own care the boy arrives at the garrison is strangely received by his own mother enters into a confederacy with hatchway and pipes and executes a couple of waggish enterprises upon his aunt trunnion having obtained this permission that very afternoon despatched the lieutenant in a postchaise to keypsticks house from whence in two days he returned with our young hero who being now in the eleventh year of his age had outgrown the expectation of all his family and was remarkable for the beauty and elegance of his person his godfather was transported at his arrival as if he had been actually the issue of his own loins he shook him heartily by the hand turned him round and round surveyed him from top to bottom bade hatchway take notice how handsomely he was built and squeezed his hand again saying d ye you dog i suppose you dont value such an old crazy son of a b as me a ropes end you have forgot how i was wont to dandle you on my knee when you was a little urchin no bigger than a davit and played a thousand tricks upon me burning my baccopouches and poisoning my rumbo o d ye you can grin fast enough i see i warrant you have learnt more things than writing and the latin lingo even tom pipes expressed uncommon satisfaction on this joyful occasion and coming up to perry thrust forth his fore paw and accosted him with the salutation of what cheer my young master i am glad to see thee with all my heart these compliments being passed his uncle halted to the door of his wifes chamber at which he stood hallooing heres your kinsman perry belike you wont come and bid him welcome lord mr trunnion said she why will you continually harass me in this manner with your impertinent intrusioni harrow you replied the commodore sblood i believe your upper works are damaged i only came to inform you that here was your cousin whom you have not seen these four long years and ill be d d if there is such another of his age within the kings dominions dye see either for make or mettle hes a credit to the name dye see but d my eyes ill say no more of the matter if you come you may if you wont you may let it alone well i wont come then answered his yokefellow for i am at present more agreeably employed oho you are i believe so too cried the commodore making wry faces and mimicking the action of dramdrinking then addressing himself to hatchway prithee jack said he go and try thy skill on that stubborn hulk if anybody can bring her about i know you wool the lieutenant accordingly taking his station at the door conveyed his persuasion in these words what wont you turn out and hail little perry it will do your heart good to see such a handsome young dog im sure he is the very moral of you and as like as if he had been spit out of your own mouth as the saying is do show a little respect for your kinsman cant you to this remonstrance she replied in a mild tone of voice dear mr hatchway you are always teasing one in such a manner sure i am nobody can tax me with unkindness or want of natural affection so saying she opened the door and advancing to the hall where her nephew stood received him very graciously and observed that he was the very image of her papa in the afternoon he was conducted by the commodore to the house of his parents and strange to tell no sooner was he presented to his mother than her countenance changed she eyed him with tokens of affliction and surprise and bursting into tears exclaimed her child was dead and this was no other than an impostor whom they had brought to defraud her sorrow trunnion was confounded at this unaccountable passion which had no other foundation than caprice and whim and gamaliel himself was so disconcerted and unsettled in his own belief which began to waver that he knew not how to behave towards the boy whom his godfather immediately carried back to the garrison swearing all the way that perry should never cross their threshold again with his goodwill nay so much was he incensed at this unnatural and absurd renunciation that he refused to carry on any further correspondence with pickle until he was appeased by his solicitations and submission and peregrine owned as his son and heir but this acknowledgment was made without the privity of his wife whose vicious aversion he was obliged in appearance to adopt thus exiled from his fathers house the young gentleman was left entirely to the disposal of the commodore whose affection for him daily increased insomuch that he could scarcely prevail upon himself to part with him when his education absolutely required that he should be otherwise disposed of in all probability this extraordinary attachment was if not produced at least riveted by that peculiar turn in peregrines imagination which we have already observed and which during his residence in the castle appeared in sundry stratagems he practised upon his uncle and aunt under the auspices of mr hatchway who assisted him in the contrivance and execution of all his schemes nor was pipes exempted from a share in their undertakings for being a trusty fellow not without dexterity in some cases and altogether resigned to their will they found him a serviceable instrument for their purpose and used him accordingly the first sample of their art was exhibited upon mrs trunnion they terrified that good lady with strange noises when she retired to her devotion pipes was a natural genius in the composition of discords he could imitate the sound produced by the winding of a jack the filing of a saw and the swinging of a malefactor hanging in chains he could counterfeit the braying of an ass the screeching of a nightowl the caterwauling of cats the howling of a dog the squeaking of a pig the crowing of a cock and he had learned the warwhoop uttered by the indians in north america these talents were exerted successively at different times and places to the terror of mrs trunnion the discomposure of the commodore himself and the consternation of all the servants in the castle peregrine with a sheet over his clothes sometimes tumbled before his aunt in the twilight when her organs of vision were a little impaired by the cordial she had swallowed and the boatswains mate taught him to shoe cats with walnutshells so that they made a most dreadful clattering in their nocturnal excursions the mind of mrs trunnion was not a little disturbed by these alarms which in her opinion portended the death of some principal person in the family she redoubled her religious exercises and fortified her spirits with fresh potations nay she began to take notice that mr trunnions constitution was very much broken and seemed dissatisfied when people observed that they never saw him look better her frequent visits to the closet where all her consolation was deposited inspired the confederates with a device which had like to have been attended with tragical consequences they found an opportunity to infuse jalap in one of her casebottles and she took so largely of this medicine that her constitution had well nigh sunk under the violence of its effect she suffered a succession of fainting fits that reduced her to the brink of the grave in spite of all the remedies that were administered by a physician who was called in the beginning of her disorder after having examined the symptoms he declared that the patient had been poisoned with arsenic and prescribed only draughts and lubricating injections to defend the coats of the stomach and intestines from the vellicating particles of that pernicious mineral at the same time hinting with a look of infinite sagacity that it was not difficult to divine the whole mystery he affected to deplore the poor lady as if she was exposed to more attempts of the same nature thereby glancing obliquely at the innocent commodore whom the officious son of aesculapius suspected as the author of this expedient to rid his hands of a yokefellow for whom he was well known to have no great devotion this impertinent and malicious insinuation made some impression upon the bystanders and furnished ample field for slander to asperse the morals of trunnion who was represented through the whole district as a monster of barbarity nay the sufferer herself though she behaved with great decency and prudence could not help entertaining some small diffidence of her husband not that she imagined he had any design upon her life but that he had been at pains to adulterate the brandy with a view of detaching her from that favourite liquor on this supposition she resolved to act with more caution for the future without setting on foot any inquiry about the affair while the commodore imputing her indisposition to some natural cause after the danger was past never bestowed a thought upon the subject so that the perpetrators were quit of their fear which however had punished them so effectually that they never would hazard any more jokes of the same nature the shafts of their wit were now directed against the commander himself whom they teased and terrified almost out of his senses one day while he was at dinner pipes came and told him that there was a person below that wanted to speak with him immediately about an affair of the greatest importance that would admit of no delay upon which he ordered the stranger to be told that he was engaged and that he must send up his name and business to this demand he received for answer a message importing that the persons name was unknown to him and his business of such a nature that it could not be disclosed to any one but the commodore himself whom he earnestly desired to see without loss of time trunnion surprised at this importunity got up with great reluctance in the middle of his meal and descending to a parlour where the stranger was asked him in a surly tone what he wanted with him in such a d d hurry that he could not wait till he had made an end of his mess the other not at all disconcerted at this rough address advanced close up to him on his tiptoes and with a look of confidence and conceit laying his mouth to one side of the commodores head whispered softly in his car sir i am the attorney whom you wanted to converse with in private the attorney cried trunnion staring and halfchoked with choler yes sir at your service replied this retainer of the law and if you please the sooner we despatch the affair the better for tis an old observation that delay breeds danger truly brother said the commodore who could no longer contain himself i do confess that i am very much of your way of thinking dye see and therefore you shall be despatched in a trice so saying he lifted up his walkingstaff which was something between a crutch and a cudgel and discharged it with such energy on the seat of the attorneys understanding that if there had been anything but solid bone the contents of his skull must have been evacuated fortified as he was by nature against all such assaults he could not withstand the momentum of the blow which in an instant laid him flat on the floor deprived of all sense and motion and trunnion hopped upstairs to dinner applauding himself in ejaculations all the way for the vengeance he had taken on such an impudent pettifogging miscreant the attorney no sooner awaked from his trance into which he had been so unexpectedly killed than he cast his eyes around in quest of evidence by which he might be enabled the more easily to prove the injury he had sustained but not a soul appearing he made shift to get upon his legs again and with the blood trickling over his nose followed one of the servants into the diningroom resolved to come to an explanation with the assailant and either extort money from him by way of satisfaction or provoke him to a second application before witnesses with this view he entered the room in a peal of clamour to the amazement of all present and the terror of mrs trunnion who shrieked at the appearance of such a spectacle and addressing himself to the commodore ill tell you what sir said he if there be law in england ill make you smart for this here assault you think you have screened yourself from a prosecution by sending all your servants out of the way but that circumstance will appear upon trial to be a plain proof of the malice prepense with which the fact was committed especially when corroborated by the evidence of this here letter under your own hand whereby i am desired to come to your own house to transact an affair of consequence so he produced the writing and read the contents in these words mr roger ravine sir being in a manner prisoner in my own house i desire you will give me a call precisely at three oclock in the afternoon and insist upon seeing myself as i have an affair of great consequence in which your particular advice is wanted by your humble servant hawser trunnion the oneeyed commander who had been satisfied with the chastisement he had already bestowed upon the plaintiff hearing him read this audacious piece of forgery which he considered as the effect of his own villainy started up from table and seizing a huge turkey that lay in a dish before him would have applied it sauce and all by way of poultice to his wound had he not been restrained by hatchway who laid fast hold on both his arms and fixed him to his chair again advising the attorney to sheer off with what he had got far from following this salutary counsel he redoubled his threats set trunnion at defiance telling him he not a man of true courage although he had commanded a ship of war or else he would not have attacked any person in such a cowardly and clandestine manner this provocation would have answered his purpose effectually had not his adversarys indignation been repressed by the suggestions of the lieutenant who desired his friend in a whisper to be easy for he would take care to have the attorney tossed in a blanket for his presumption this proposal which he received with great approbation pacified him in a moment he wiped the sweat from his forehead and his features relaxed into a grim smile hatchway disappeared and ravine proceeded with great fluency of abuse until he was interrupted by the arrival of pipes who without any expostulation led him out by the hand and conducted him to the yard where he was put into a carpet and in a twinkling sent into the air by the strength and dexterity of five stout operators whom the lieutenant had selected from the number of domestics for that singular spell of duty in vain did the astonished vaulter beg for the love of god that they would take pity upon him and put an end to his involuntary gambols they were deaf to his prayers and protestations even when he swore in the most solemn manner that if they would cease tormenting him he would forget and forgive what was past and depart in peace to his own habitation and continued the game till they were fatigued with the exercise ravine being dismissed in a most melancholy plight brought an action of assault and battery against the commodore and subpoenaed all the servants as evidences in the cause but as none of them had seen what happened he did not find his account in the prosecution though he himself examined all the witnesses and among their questions asked whether they had not seen him come in like another man and whether they had ever seen any other man in such condition as that in which he had crawled off but this last interrogation they were not obliged to answer because it had reference to the second discipline he bad undergone in which they and they only were concerned and no person is bound to give testimony against himself in short the attorney was nonsuited to the satisfaction of all who knew him and found himself under the necessity of proving that he had received in course of post the letter which was declared in court a scandalous forgery in order to prevent an indictment with which he vas threatened by the commodore who little dreamt that the whole affair had been planned and executed by peregrine and his associates the next enterprise in which this triumvirate engaged was a scheme to frighten trunnion with an apparition which they prepared and exhibited in this manner to the hide of a large ox pipes fitted a leathern vizor of a most terrible appearance stretched on the jaws of a shark which he had brought from sea and accommodated with a couple of broad glasses instead of eyes on the inside of these he placed two rushlights and with a composition of sulphur and saltpetre made a pretty large fusee which he fixed between two rows of the teeth this equipage being finished he one dark night chosen for the purpose put it on and following the commodore into a long passage in which he was preceded by perry with a light in his hand kindled his firework with a match and began to bellow like a bull the boy as it was concerted looked behind him screamed aloud and dropped the light which was extinguished in the fall when trunnion alarmed at his nephews consternation exclaimed zounds whats the matter and turning about to see the cause of his dismay beheld a hideous phantom vomiting blue flame which aggravated the horrors of its aspect he was instantly seized with an agony of fear which divested him of his reason nevertheless he as it were mechanically raised his trusty supporter in his own defence and the apparition advancing towards him aimed it at this dreadful annoyance with such a convulsive exertion of strength that had not the blow chanced to light upon one of the horns mr pipes would have had no cause to value himself upon his invention misapplied as it was he did not fail to stagger at the shock and dreading another such salutation closed with the commodore and having tripped up his heels retreated with great expedition it was then that peregrine pretending to recollect himself a little ran with all the marks of disturbance and affright and called up the servants to the assistance of their master whom they found in a cold sweat upon the floor his features betokening horror and confusion hatchway raised him up and having comforted him with a cup of nantz began to inquire into the cause of his disorder but he could not extract one word of answer from his friend who after a considerable pause during which he seemed to be wrapt in profound contemplation pronounced aloud by the lord jack you may say what you wool but ill be d if it was not davy jones himself i know him by his saucer eyes his three rows of teeth his horns and tail and the blue smoke that came out of his nostrils what does the blackguard hells baby want with me im sure i never committed murder except in the way of my profession nor wronged any man whatsomever since i first went to sea this same davy jones according to the mythology of sailors is the fiend that presides over all the evil spirits of the deep and is often seen in various shapes perching among the rigging on the eve of hurricanes shipwrecks and other disasters to which a seafaring life is exposed warning the devoted wretch of death and woe no wonder then that trunnion was disturbed by a supposed visit of this demon which in his opinion foreboded some dreadful calamity chapter xiv he is also by their device engaged in an adventure with the exciseman who does not find his account in his own drollery howsomever preposterous and unaccountable that passion may be which prompts persons otherwise generous and sympathizing to afflict and perplex their fellowcreatures certain it is our confederates entertained such a large proportion of it that not satisfied with the pranks they had already played they still persecuted the commodore without ceasing in the course of his own history the particulars of which he delighted to recount he had often rehearsed an adventure of deerstealing in which during the unthinking impetuosity of his youth he had been unfortunately concerned far from succeeding in that achievement he and his associates had it seems been made prisoners after an obstinate engagement with the keepers and carried before a neighbouring justice of the peace who used trunnion with great indignity and with his companions committed him to jail his own relations and in particular an uncle on whom he chiefly depended treated him during his confinement with great rigour and inhumanity and absolutely refused to interpose his influence in his behalf unless he would sign a writing obliging himself to go to sea within thirty days after his release under the penalty of being proceeded against as a felon the alternative was either to undergo this voluntary exile or remain in prison disowned and deserted by everybody and after all suffer an ignominious trial that might end in a sentence of transportation for life he therefore without much hesitation embraced the proposal of his kinsman and as he observed was in less than a month after his discharge turned adrift to the mercy of the wind and waves since that period he had never maintained any correspondence with his relations all of whom had concurred in sending him off nor would he ever pay the least regard to the humiliations and supplications of some among them who had prostrated themselves before him on the advancement of his fortune but he retained a most inveterate resentment against his uncle who was still in being though extremely old and infirm and frequently mentioned his name with all the bitterness of revenge perry being perfectly well acquainted with the particulars of this story which he had heard so often repeated proposed to hatchway that a person should be hired to introduce himself to the commodore with a supposititious letter of recommendation from this detested kinsman an imposition that in all likelihood would afford abundance of diversion the lieutenant relished the scheme and young pickle having composed an epistle for the occasion the exciseman of the parish a fellow of great impudence and some humour in whom hatchway could confide undertook to transcribe and deliver it with his own hand and also personate the man in whose favour it was feigned to be written he accordingly one morning arrived on horseback at the garrison two hours at least before trunnion used to get up and gave pipes who admitted him to understand that he had a letter from his master which he was ordered to deliver to none but the commodore himself this message was no sooner communicated than the indignant chief who had been waked for the purpose began to curse the messenger for breaking his rest and swore he would not budge till his usual time of turning out this resolution being conveyed to the stranger he desired the carrier to go back and tell him he had such joyful tidings to impart that he was sure the commodore would think himself amply rewarded for his trouble even if he had been raised from the grave to receive them this assurance flattering as it was would not have been powerful enough to persuade him had it not been assisted with the exhortations of his spouse which never failed to influence his conduct he therefore crept out of bed though not without great repugnance and wrapping himself in his morning gown was supported downstairs rubbing his eye yawning fearfully and grumbling in the way as soon as he popped his head into the parlour the supposed stranger made divers awkward bows and with a grinning aspect accosted him in these words your most humble servant most noble commodore i hope you are in good health you look pure and hearty and if it was not for that misfortune of your eye one would not desire to see a more pleasant countenance in a summers day sure as i am a living soul one would take you to be on this side of threescore lord help us i should have known you to be a trunnion if i had met with one in the midst of salisbury plain as the saying is the commodore who was not at all in the humour of relishing such an impertinent preamble interrupted him in this place saying with a peevish accent pshaw pshaw brother theres no occasion to bowse out so much unnecessary gun if you cant bring your discourse to bear on the right subject you had much better clap a stopper on your tongue and bring yourself up dye see i was told you had something to deliver deliver cried the waggish impostor odds heart i have got something for you that will make your very entrails rejoice within your body heres a letter from a dear and worthy friend of yours take read it and be happy blessings on his old heart one would think he had renewed his age like the eagles trunnions expectation being thus raised he called for his spectacles adjusted them to his eye took the letter and being curious to know the subscription no sooner perceived his uncles name then he started back his lip quivered and he began to shake in every limb with resentment and surprise eager to know the subject of an epistle from a person who had never before troubled him with any sort of address he endeavoured to recollect himself and perused the contents which were these loving nephew i doubt not but you will be rejoiced to hear of my welfare and well you may considering what a kind uncle i have been to you in the days of your youth and how little you deserved any such thing for yet was always a graceless young man given to wicked courses and bad company whereby you would have come to a shameful end had it not been for my care in sending you out of mischiefs way but this is not the cause of my present writing the bearer mr timothy trickle is a distant relation of yours being the son of the cousin of your aunt margery and is not over and above well as to worldly matters he thinks of going to london to see for some post in the excise or customs if so be that you will recommend him to some great man of your acquaintance and give him a small matter to keep him till he is provided i doubt not nephew but you will be glad to serve him if it was no more but for the respect you bear to me who am loving nephew your affectionate uncle and servant to command tobiah trunnion it would be a difficult task for the inimitable hogarth himself to exhibit the ludicrous expression of the commodores countenance while he read this letter it was not a stare of astonishment a convulsion of rage or a ghastly grin of revenge but an association of all three that took possession of his features at length he hawked up with incredible straining the interjection ah that seemed to have stuck some time in his windpipe and thus gave vent to his indignation have i come alongside of you at last you old stinking curmudgeon you lie you lousy hulk ye lie you did all in your power to founder me when i was a stripling and as for being graceless and wicked and keeping bad company you tell a d d lie again you thief there was not a more peaceable lad in the county and i kept no bad company but your own dye see therefore you trickle or whats your name tell the old rascal that sent you hither that i spit in his face and call him horse that i tear his letter into rags so and that i trample upon it as i would upon his own villainous carcase dye see so saying he danced in a sort of frenzy upon the fragments of the paper which he had scattered about the room to the inexpressible satisfaction of the triumvirate who beheld the scene the exciseman having got between him and the door which was left open for his escape in case of necessity affected great confusion and surprise at his behaviour saying with an air of mortification lord be merciful unto me is this the way you treat your own relations and the recommendation of your best friend surely all gratitude and virtue has left this sinful world what will cousin tim and dick and tom and good mother pipkin and her daughters cousin sue and prue and peg with all the rest of our kinsfolks say when they hear of this unconscionable reception that i have met with consider sir that ingratitude is worse than the sin of witchcraft as the apostle wisely observes and do not send me away with such unchristian usage which will lay a heavy load of guilt upon your poor miserable soul what you are on a cruise for a post brother trickle ant ye said trunnion interrupting him we shall find a post for you in a trice my boy here pipes take this saucy son of a b and help him to the whippingpost in the yard ill teach you to rouse me in the morning with such impertinent messages pipes who wanted to carry the joke farther than the exciseman dreamt of laid hold of him in a twinkling and executed the orders of his commander notwithstanding all his nods winking and significant gestures which the boatswains mate would by no means understand so that he began to repent of the part he acted in this performance which was like to end so tragically and stood fastened to the stake in a very disagreeable state of suspense casting many a rueful look over his left shoulder while pipes was absent in quest of a catoninetails in expectation of being relieved by the interposition of the lieutenant who did not however appear tom returning with the instrument of correction undressed the delinquent in a trice and whispering in his ear that he was very sorry for being employed in such an office but durst not for his soul disobey the orders of his commander flourished the scourge about his head and with admirable dexterity made such a smarting application to the offenders back and shoulders that the distracted gauger performed sundry new cuts with his feet and bellowed hideously with pain to the infinite satisfaction of the spectators at length when he was almost flayed from his rump to the nape of his neck hatchway who had purposely absented himself hitherto appeared in the yard and interposing in his behalf prevailed upon trunnion to call off the executioner and ordered the malefactor to be released the exciseman mad with the catastrophe he had undergone threatened to be revenged upon his employers by making a candid confession of the whole plot but the lieutenant giving him to understand that in so doing he would bring upon himself a prosecution for fraud forgery and imposture he was fain to put up with his loss and sneaked out of the garrison attended with a volley of curses discharged upon him by the commodore who was exceedingly irritated by the disturbance and disappointment he had undergone chapter xv the commodore detects the machinations of the conspirators and hires a tutor for peregrine whom he settles in winchester school this was not the least affliction he had suffered from the unwearied endeavours and unexhausted invention of his tormentors who harassed him with such a variety of mischievous pranks that he began to think all the devils in hell had conspired against his peace and accordingly became very serious and contemplative on the subject in the course of his meditations when he recollected and compared the circumstances of every mortification to which he had been lately exposed he could not help suspecting that some of them must have been contrived to vex him and as he was not ignorant of his lieutenants disposition nor unacquainted with the talents of peregrine he resolved to observe them both for the future with the utmost care and circumspection this resolution aided by the incautious conduct of the conspirators whom by this time success had rendered heedless and indiscreet was attended with the desired effect he in a little time detected perry in a new plot and by dint of a little chastisement and a great many threats extorted from him a confession of all the contrivances in which he had been concerned the commodore was thunderstruck at the discovery and so much incensed against hatchway for the part he had acted in the whole that he deliberated with himself whether he should demand satisfaction with sword and pistol or dismiss him from the garrison and renounce all friendship with him at once but he bad been so long accustomed to jacks company that he could not live without him and upon more cool reflection perceiving that what he had done was rather the effect of wantonness than malice which he himself would have laughed to see take place upon any other person he determined to devour his chagrin and extended his forgiveness even to pipes whom in the first sally of his passion he had looked upon in a more criminal light than that of a simple mutineer this determination was seconded by another which he thought absolutely necessary for his own repose and in which his own interest and that of his nephew concurred peregrine who was now turned of twelve had made such advances under the instruction of jennings that he often disputed upon grammar and was sometimes thought to have the better in his contests with the parishpriest who notwithstanding this acknowledged superiority of his antagonist did great justice to his genius which he assured mr trunnion would be lost for want of cultivation if the boy was not immediately sent to prosecute his studies at some proper seminary of learning this maxim had been more than once inculcated upon the commodore by mrs trunnion who over and above the deference she paid to the parsons opinion had a reason of her own for wishing to see the house clear of peregrine at whose prying disposition she began to be very uneasy induced by these motives which were joined by the solicitation of the youth himself who ardently longed to see a little more of the world his uncle determined to send him forthwith to winchester under the immediate care and inspection of a governor to whom he allowed a very handsome appointment for that purpose this gentleman whose name was mr jacob jolter had been schoolfellow with the parson of the parish who recommended him to mrs trunnion as a person of great worth and learning in every respect qualified for the office of a tutor he likewise added by way of eulogium that he was a man of exemplary piety and particularly zealous for the honour of the church of which he was a member having been many years in holy orders though he did not then exercise any function of the priesthood indeed mr jolters zeal was so exceedingly fervent as on some occasions to get the better of his discretion for being a high churchman and of consequence a malcontent his resentment was habituated into an insurmountable prejudice against the present disposition of affairs which by confounding the nation with the ministry sometimes led him into erroneous not to say absurd calculations otherwise a man of good morals well versed in mathematics and school divinity studies which had not at all contributed to sweeten and unbend the natural sourness and severity of his complexion this gentleman being destined to the charge of superintending perrys education everything was prepared for their departure and tom pipes in consequence of his own petition put into livery and appointed footman to the young squire but before they set out the commodore paid the compliment of communicating his design to mr pickle who approved of the plan though he durst not venture to see the boy so much was he intimidated by the remonstrances of his wife whose aversion to her firstborn became every day more inveterate and unaccountable this unnatural caprice seemed to be supported by a consideration which one would imagine might have rather vanquished her disgust her second son gam who was now in the fourth year of his age had been rickety from the cradle and as remarkably unpromising in appearance as perry was agreeable in his person as the deformity increased the mothers fondness was augmented and the virulence of her hate against the other son seemed to prevail in the same proportion far from allowing perry to enjoy the common privileges of a child she would not suffer him to approach his fathers house expressed uneasiness whenever his name happened to be mentioned sickened at his praise and in all respects behaved like a most rancorous stepmother though she no longer retained that ridiculous notion of his being an impostor she still continued to abhor him as if she really believed him to be such and when any person desired to know the cause of her surprising dislike she always lost her temper and peevishly replied that she had reasons of her own which she was not obliged to declare nay so much was she infected by this vicious partiality that she broke off all commerce with her sisterinlaw and the commodore because they favoured the poor child with their countenance and protection her malice however was frustrated by the love and generosity of trunnion who having adopted him as his own son equipped him accordingly and carried him and his governor in his own coach to the place of destination where they were settled on a very genteel footing and everything regulated according to their desires mrs trunnion with great decency at the departure of her nephew to whom with a great many pious advices and injunctions to behave with submission and reverence towards his tutor she presented a diamond ring of small value and a gold medal as tokens of her affection and esteem as for the lieutenant he accompanied them in the coach and such was the friendship he had contracted for perry that when the commodore proposed to return after having accomplished the intent of his journey jack absolutely refused to attend him and signified his resolution to stay where he was trunnion was the more startled a this declaration as hatchway was become so necessary to him in almost all the purposes of his life that he foresaw he should not be able to exist without his company not a little affected with this consideration he turned his eye ruefully upon the lieutenant saying in a piteous tone what leave me at last jack after we have weathered so many hard gales together d my limbs i thought you had been more of an honest heart i looked upon you as my foremast and tom pipes as my mizen now he is carried away if so be as you go too my standing rigging being decayed dye see the first squall will bring me by the board d ye if in case i have given offence cant you speak aboveboard and i shall make you amends jack being ashamed to own the true situation of his thoughts after some hesitation answered with perplexity and incoherence no d me that ant the case neither to be sure you always used me in an officerlike manner that i must own to give the devil his due as the saying is but for all that this here is the case i have some thoughts of going to school myself to learn your latin lingo for as the saying is better late mend than never and i am informed as how one can get more for the money here than anywhere else in vain did trunnion endeavour to convince him of the folly of going to school at his years by representing that the boys would make game of him and that he would become a laughingstock to all the world he persisted in his resolution to stay and the commodore was fain to have recourse to the mediation of pipes and perry who employed their influence with jack and at last prevailed upon him to return to the garrison after trunnion had promised he should be at liberty to visit them once a month this stipulation being settled he and his friend took leave of the pupil governor and attendant and next morning set out for their habitation which they reached in safety that same night such was hatchways reluctance to leave peregrine that he is said for the first time in his life to have looked misty at parting certain i am that on the road homewards after a long pause of silence which the commodore never dreamt of interrupting he exclaimed all of a sudden ill be d d if the dog hant given me some stuff to make me love him indeed there was something congenial in the disposition of these two friends which never failed to manifest itself in the sequel howsoever different their education circumstances and connections happened to be chapter xvi peregrine distinguishes himself among his schoolfellows exposes his tutor and attracts the particular notice of the master thus left to the prosecution of his studies peregrine was in a little time a distinguished character not only for his acuteness of apprehension but also for that mischievous fertility of fancy of which we have already given such pregnant examples but as there was a great number of such luminaries in this new sphere to which he belonged his talents were not so conspicuous while they shone in his single capacity as they afterwards appeared when they concentrated and reflected the rays of the whole constellation at first he confined himself to piddling game exercising his genius upon his own tutor who attracted his attention by endeavouring to season his mind with certain political maxims the fallacy of which he had discernment enough to perceive scarce a day passed in which he did not find means to render mr jolter the object of ridicule his violent prejudices ludicrous vanity awkward solemnity and ignorance of mankind afforded continual food for the raillery petulance and satire of his pupil who never neglected an opportunity of laughing and making others laugh at his expense sometimes in their parties by mixing brandy in his wine he decoyed this pedagogue into a debauch during which his caution forsook him and he exposed himself to the censure of the company sometimes when the conversation turned upon intricate subjects he practised upon him the socratic method of confutation and under pretence of being informed by an artful train of puzzling questions insensibly betrayed him into selfcontradiction all the remains of authority which he had hitherto preserved over peregrine soon vanished so that for the future no sort of ceremony subsisted between them and all mr jolters precepts were conveyed in hints of friendly advice which the other might either follow or neglect at his own pleasure no wonder then that peregrine gave a loose to his inclinations and by dint of genius and an enterprising temper made a figure among the younger class of heroes in the school before he had been a full year at winchester he had signallized himself in so many achievements in defiance to the laws and regulations of the place that he was looked upon with admiration and actually chosen dux or leader by a large body of his contemporaries it was not long before his fame reached the ears of the master who sent for mr jolter communicated to him the informations he had received and desired him to check the vivacity of his charge and redouble his vigilance in time to come else he should be obliged to make a public example of his pupil for the benefit of the school the governor conscious of his own unimportance was not a little disconcerted at this injunction which it was not in his power to fulfil by any compulsive means he therefore went home in a very pensive mood and after mature deliberation resolved to expostulate with peregrine in the most familiar terms and endeavour to dissuade him from practices which might affect his character as well as interest he accordingly frankly told him the subject of the masters discourse represented the disgrace he might incur by neglecting this warning and putting him in mind of his own situation hinted the consequences of the commodores displeasure in case he should be brought to disapprove of his conduct these insinuations made the greater impression as they were delivered with many expressions of friendship and concern the young gentleman was not so raw but that he could perceive the solidity of mr jolters advice to which he promised to conform because his pride was interested in the affair and he considered his own reformation as the only means of avoiding that infamy which even in idea he could not bear his governor finding him so reasonable profited by these moments of reflection and in order to prevent a relapse proposed that he should engage in some delightful study that would agreeably amuse his imagination and gradually detach him from those connections which had involved him in so many troublesome adventures for this purpose he with many rapturous encomiums recommended the mathematics as yielding more rational and sensible pleasures to a youthful fancy than any other subject of contemplation and actually began to read euclid with him that same afternoon peregrine entered upon this branch of learning with all that warmth of application which boys commonly yield on the first change of study but he had scarce advanced beyond the pons asinorum when his ardour abated the test of truth by demonstration did not elevate him to those transports of joy with which his preceptor had regaled his expectation and before he arrived at the fortyseventh proposition he began to yawn drearily make abundance of wry faces and thought himself but indifferently paid for his attention when he shared the vast discovery of pythagoras and understood that the square of the hypotenuse was equal to the squares of the other two sides of a rightangled triangle he was ashamed however to fail in his undertaking and persevered with great industry until he had finished the first four books acquired plane trigonometry with the method of algebraical calculation and made himself well acquainted with the principles of surveying but no consideration could prevail upon him to extend his inquiries farther in this science and he returned with double relish to his former avocations like a stream which being dammed accumulates more force and bursting over its mounds rushes down with double impetuosity mr jolter saw with astonishment and chagrin but could not resist the torrent his behaviour was now no other than a series of license and effrontery prank succeeded prank and outrage followed outrage with surprising velocity complaints were every day preferred against him in vain were admonitions bestowed by the governor in private and menaces discharged by the masters in public he disregarded the first despised the latter divested himself of all manner of restraint and proceeded in his career to such a pitch of audacity that a consultation was held upon the subject in which it was determined that this untoward spirit should be humbled by a severe and ignominious flogging for the very next offence he should commit in the mean time mr jolter was desired to write in the masters name to the commodore requesting him to remove tom pipes from the person of his nephew the said pipes being a principal actor and abettor in all his malversations and to put a stop to the monthly visitations of the mutilated lieutenant who had never once failed to use his permission but came punctual to a day always fraught with some new invention indeed by this time mr hatchway was as well known and much better beloved by every boy in the school than the master who instructed him and always received by a number of scholars who used to attend peregrine when he went forth to meet his friend and conduct him to his lodging with public testimonies of joy and applause as for tom pipes he was not so properly the attendant of peregrine as master of the revels of the whole school he mingled in all their parties and superintended the diversions deciding between boy and boy as if he acted by commission under the great seal he regulated their motions by his whistle instructed the young boys in the games of hustlecap leapfrog and chuckfarthing imparted to those of a more advanced age the sciences of cribbage and allfours together with the method of storming the castle acting the comedy of prince arthur and other pantomimes as they commonly exhibited at sea and instructed the seniors who were distinguished by the appellation of bloods in cudgelplaying dancing the st giless hornpipe drinking flip and smoking tobacco these qualifications had rendered him so necessary and acceptable to the scholars that exclusive of perrys concern in the affair his dismission in all probability would have produced some dangerous convulsion in the community jolter therefore knowing his importance informed his pupil of the directions he had received and very candidly asked how he should demean himself in the execution for he durst not write to the commodore without this previous notice fearing that the young gentleman as soon as he should get an inkling of the affair would follow the example and make his uncle acquainted with certain anecdotes which it was the governors interest to keep concealed peregrine was of opinion that he should spare himself the trouble of conveying any complaints to the commodore and if questioned by the master assure him he had complied with his desire at the same time he promised faithfully to conduct himself with such circumspection for the future that the masters should have no temptation to revive the inquiry but the resolution attending this extorted promise was too frail to last and in less than a fortnight our young hero found himself entangled in an adventure from which he was not extricated with his usual good fortune chapter xvii he is concerned in a dangerous adventure with a certain gardener sublimes his ideas commences gallant and becomes acquainted with miss emily gauntlet he and some of his companions one day entered a garden in the suburbs and having indulged their appetites desired to know what satisfaction they must make for the fruit they had pulled the gardener demanded what in their opinion was an exorbitant price and they with many opprobrious terms refused to pay it the peasant being surly and untractable insisted upon his right neither was he deficient or sparing in the eloquence of vulgar abuse his guests attempted to retreat a scuffle ensued in which peregrine lost his cap and the gardener being in danger from the number of his foes called to his wife to let loose the dog which instantly flew to his masters assistance and after having torn the leg of one and the shoulder of another put the whole body of scholars to flight enraged at the indignity which had been offered them they solicited a reinforcement of their friends and with tom pipes at their head marched back to the field of battle their adversary seeing them approach called his apprentice who worked at the other end of the ground to his assistance armed him with a mattock while he himself wielded a hoe bolted his door on the inside and flanked with his man and mastiff waited the attack without flinching he had not remained three minutes in this posture of defence when pipes who acted as the enemys forlorn hope advanced to the gate with great intrepidity and clapping his foot to the door which was none of the stoutest with the execution and despatch of a petard split it into a thousand pieces this sudden execution had an immediate effect upon the apprentice who retreated with great precipitation and escaped at a postern but the master placed himself like another hercules in the breach and when pipes brandishing his cudgel stepped forward to engage him leveled his weapon with such force and dexterity at his head that had the skull been made of penetrable stuff the iron edge must have cleft his pate in twain casemated as he was the instrument cut sheer even to the bone on which it struck with such amazing violence that sparks of real fire were produced by the collision and let not the incredulous reader pretend to doubt the truth of this phenomenon until he shall have first perused the ingenious peter kolbens natural history of the cape of good hope where the inhabitants commonly used to strike fire with the shinbones of lions which had been killed in that part of africa pipes though a little disconcerted far from being disabled by the blow in a trice retorted the compliment with his truncheon which had not his antagonist expeditiously slipped his head aside would have laid him breathless across his own threshold but happily for him he received the salutation upon his right shoulder which crashed beneath the stroke and the hoe dropped instantly from his tingling hand tom perceiving and being unwilling to forego the advantage he had gained darted his head into the bosom of this son of earth and overturned him on the plain being himself that instant assaulted by the mastiff who fastened upon the outside of his thigh feeling himself incommoded by this assailant in his rear he quitted the prostrate gardener to the resentment of his associates who poured upon him in shoals and turning about laid hold with both his hands of this ferocious animals throat which he squeezed with such incredible force and perseverance that the creature quitted his hold his tongue lolled out of his jaws the blood started from his eyes and he swung a lifeless trunk between the hands of his vanquisher it was well for his master that he did not longer exist for by this time he was overwhelmed by such a multitude of foes that his whole body scarce afforded points of contact to all the fists that drummed upon him consequently to use a vulgar phrase his wind was almost knocked out before pipes had leisure to interpose in his he behalf and persuade his offenders to desist by representing that the wife had gone to alarm the neighbourhood and in all probability they would be intercepted in their return they accordingly listened to his remonstrances and marched homewards in triumph leaving the gardener in the embraces of his mother earth from which he had not power to move when he was found by his disconsolate helpmate and some friends whom she had assembled for his assistance among these was a blacksmith and farrier who took cognizance of his carcase every limb of which having examined he declared there was no bone broken and taking out his fleam blooded him plentifully as he lay he was then conveyed to his bed from which he was not able to stir during a whole month his family coming upon the parish a formal complaint was made to the master of the school and peregrine represented as the ringleader of those who committed this barbarous assault an inquiry was immediately set on foot and the articles of impeachment being fully proved our hero was sentenced to be severely chastised in the face of the whole school this was a disgrace the thoughts of which his proud heart could not brook he resolved to make his elopement rather than undergo the punishment to which he was doomed and having signified his sentiments to his confederates they promised one and all to stand by him and either screen him from chastisement or share his fate confiding in this friendly protestation he appeared unconcerned on the day that was appointed for his punishment and when he was called to his destiny advanced the scene attended by the greatest part of the scholars who intimated their determination to the master and proposed that peregrine should be forgiven the superior behaved with that dignity of demeanour which became his place represented the folly and presumption of their demand reprehended them for their audacious proceeding and ordered every boy to his respective station they obeyed his command and our unfortunate hero was publicly horsed in terrorem of all whom it might concern this disgrace had a very sensible effect upon the mind of peregrine who having by this time passed the fourteenth year of his age began to adopt the pride and sentiments of a man thus dishonourably stigmatized he was ashamed to appear in public as usual he was incensed against his companions for their infidelity and irresolution and plunged into a profound reverie that lasted several weeks during which he shook off his boyish connections and fixed his view upon objects which he thought more worthy of his attention in the course of his gymnastic exercises at which he was very expert he contracted intimacies with several youths who were greatly his superiors in point of age and who pleased with his aspiring genius and address introduced him into parties of gallantry which strongly captivated his inclination he was by nature particularly adopted for succeeding in all adventures of this kind over and above a most engaging person that improved with his years he possessed a dignified assurance an agreeable ferocity which enhanced the conquest of the fair who had the good fortune to enslave him unlimited generosity and a fund of humour which never failed to please nor was he deficient in the more solid accomplishments of youth he had profited in his studies beyond expectation and besides that sensibility of discernment which is the foundation of taste and in consequence of which he distinguished and enjoyed the beauties of the classics he had already given several specimens of a very promising poetic talent with this complexion and these qualifications no wonder that our hero attracted the notice and affections of the young delias in town whose hearts had just begun to flutter for they knew not what inquiries were made concerning his condition and no sooner were his expectations known than he was invited and caressed by all the parents while the daughters vied with each other in treating him with particular complacency he inspired love and emulation wherever he appeared envy and jealous rage followed of course so that he became a very desirable though a very dangerous acquaintance his moderation was not equal to his success his vanity took the lead of his passions dissipating his attention which might otherwise have fixed him to one object and he was possessed with the rage of increasing the number of his conquests with this view he frequented public walks concerts and assemblies became remarkably rich and fashionable in his clothes gave entertainments to the ladies and was in the utmost hazard of turning out a most egregious coxcomb while his character thus wavered between the ridicule of some and the regard of others an accident happened which by contracting his view to one object detached him from those vain pursuits that would in time have plunged him into an abyss of folly and contempt being one evening at the ball which is always given to the ladies at the time of the races the person acted as master of the ceremonies knowing how fond mr pickle was of every opportunity to display himself came up and told him that there was a fine young creature at the other end of the room who seemed to have a great inclination to dance a minuet but wanted a partner the gentleman who attended her being in boots peregrines vanity being aroused at this intimation he went up to reconnoitre the young lady and was struck with admiration at her beauty she seemed to be of his own age was tall though slender exquisitely shaped her hair was auburn and in such plenty that the barbarity of dress had not been able to prevent it from shading both sides of her forehead which was high and polished the contour of her face was oval her nose very little raised into the aquiline form that contributed to the spirit and dignity of her aspect her mouth was small her lips plump juicy and delicious her teeth regular and white as driven snow her complexion incredibly delicate and glowing with health and her full blue eyes beamed forth vivacity and love her mien was at the same time commanding and engaging her address perfectly genteel and her whole appearance so captivating that our young adonis looked and was overcome he no sooner recollected himself from his astonishment than he advanced to her with a graceful air of respect and begged she would do him the honour to walk a minuet with him she seemed particularly pleased with his application and very frankly complied with his request this pair was too remarkable to escape the particular notice of the company mr pickle was well known by almost everybody in the room but his partner was altogether a new face and of consequence underwent the criticism of all the ladies in the assembly one whispered she has a good complexion but dont you think she is a little awry a second pitied her for her masculine nose a third observed that she was awkward for want of seeing company a fourth distinguished something very bold in her countenance and in short there was not a beauty in her whole composition which the glass of envy did not pervert into a blemish the men however looked upon her with different eyes among them her appearance produced a universal murmur of applause they encircled the space on which she danced and were enchanted by her graceful motion while they launched out in the praise of her they expressed their displeasure at the good fortune of her partner whom they d d for a little finical coxcomb that was too much engrossed by the contemplation of his own person to discern or deserve the favour of his fate he did not hear therefore could not repine at these invectives but while they imagined he indulged his vanity a much more generous passion had taken possession of his heart instead of that petulance of gaiety for which he had been distinguished in his public appearance he now gave manifest signs of confusion and concern he danced with an anxiety which impeded his performance and blushed to the eyes at every false step he made though this extraordinary agitation was overlooked by the men it could not escape the observation of the ladies who perceived it with equal surprise and resentment and when peregrine led this fair unknown to her seat expressed their pique in an affected titter which broke from every mouth at the same instant as if all of them had been informed by the same spirit peregrine was nettled at this unmannerly mark of disapprobation and in order to increase their chagrin endeavoured to enter into particular conversation with their fair rival the young lady herself who neither wanted penetration nor the consciousness of her own accomplishments resented their behaviour though she triumphed at the cause of it and gave her partner all the encouragement he could desire her mother who was present thanked him for his civility in taking such notice of a stranger and he received a compliment of the same nature from the young gentleman in boots who was her own brother if he was charmed with her appearance he was quite ravished with her discourse which was sensible spirited and gay her frank and sprightly demeanour excited his own confidence and goodhumour and he described to her the characters of those females who had honoured them with such a spiteful mark of distinction in terms so replete with humorous satire that she seemed to listen with particular complacency of attention and distinguished every nymph thus ridiculed with such a significant glance as overwhelmed her with chagrin and mortification in short they seemed to relish each others conversation during which our young damon acquitted himself with great skill in all the duties of gallantry he laid hold of proper opportunities to express his admiration of her charms had recourse to the silent rhetoric of tender looks breathed divers insidious sighs and attached himself wholly to her during the remaining part of the entertainment when the company broke up he attended her to her lodgings and took leave of her with a squeeze of the hand after having obtained permission to visit her next morning and been informed by the mother that her name was miss emilia gauntlet all night long he closed not an eye but amused himself with plans of pleasure which his imagination suggested in consequence of this new acquaintance he rose with the lark adjusted his hair into an agreeable negligence of curl and dressing himself in a genteel gray frock trimmed with silver binding waited with the utmost impatience for the hour of ten which no sooner struck than he hied him to the place of appointment and inquiring for miss gauntlet was shown into a parlour here he had not waited above ten minutes when emilia entered in a most enchanting undress with all the graces of nature playing about her person and in a moment riveted the chains of his slavery beyond the power of accident to unbind her mother being still abed and her brother gone to give orders about the chaise in which they proposed to return that same day to their own habitation he enjoyed her company a whole hour during which he declared his love in the most passionate terms and begged that he might be admitted into the number of those admirers whom she permitted to visit and adore her she affected to look upon his vows and protestations as the ordinary effect of gallantry and very obligingly assured him that were she to live in that place she should be glad to see him often but as the spot on which she resided was at a considerable distance she could not expect he would go so far upon such a trifling occasion as to take the trouble of providing himself with her mammas permission to this favourable hint he with all the eagerness of the most fervent passion that he had uttered nothing but the genuine dictates of his heart that he desired nothing so much as an opportunity of evincing the sincerity of his professions and that though he lived at the extremity of the kingdom he would find means to lay himself at her feet provided he could visit her with her mothers consent which he assured her he would not fail to solicit she then gave him to understand that her habitation was about sixteen miles front winchester in a village which she named and where as he could easily collect from her discourse he would be no unwelcome guest in the midst of this communication they were joined by mrs gauntlet who received him with great courtesy thanking him again for his politeness to emy at the ball and anticipated his intention by saying that she should be very glad to see him at her house if ever his occasions should call him that way chapter xviii he inquires into the situation of this young lady with whom he is enamoured elopes from school is found by the lieutenant conveyed to winchester and sends a letter with a copy of verses to his mistress he was transported with pleasure at this invitation which he assured her he should not neglect and after a little more conversation on general topics took his leave of the charming emilia and her prudent mamma who had perceived the first emotions of mr pickles passion for her daughter and been at some pains to inquire about his family and fortune neither was peregrine less inquisitive about the situation and pedigree of his new mistress who he learned was the only daughter of a fieldofficer who died before he had it in his power to make suitable provision for his children that the widow lived in a frugal though decent manner on her pension assisted by the bounty of her relations that the son carried arms as a volunteer in the company which his father had commanded and that emilia had been educated in london at the expense of a rich uncle who was seized with the whim of marrying at the age of fiftyfive in consequence of which his niece had returned to her mother without any visible dependence except on her own conduct and qualifications this account though it could not diminish his affection nevertheless alarmed his pride for his warm imagination had exaggerated all his own prospects and he began to fear that his passion for emilia might be thought to derogate from the dignity of his situation the struggle between his interest and love produced a perplexity which had an evident effect upon his behaviour he became pensive solitary and peevish avoided public diversions and grew so remarkably negligent in his dress that he was scarce distinguishable by his own acquaintance this contention of thoughts continued several weeks at the end of which the charms of emilia triumphed over every other consideration having received a supply of money from the commodore who acted towards him with great generosity he ordered pipes to put up some linen and other necessaries in a sort of knapsack which he could conveniently carry and thus attended set out early one morning on foot for the village where his charmer lived at which he arrived before two oclock in the afternoon having chosen this method of travelling that his route might not be so easily discovered as it must have been had he hired horses or taken a place in the stagecoach the first thing he did was to secure a convenient lodging at the inn where he dined then he shifted himself and according to the direction he had received went to the house of mrs gauntlet in a transport of joyous expectation as he approached the gate his agitation increased he knocked with impatience and concern the door opened and he had actually asked if mrs gauntlet was at home before he perceived that the portress was no other than his dear emilia she was not without emotion at the unexpected sight of her lover who instantly recognising his charmer obeyed the irresistible impulse of his love and caught the fair creature in his arms nor did she seem offended at this forwardness of behaviour which might have displeased another of a less open disposition or less used to the freedom of a sensible education but her natural frankness had been encouraged and improved by the easy and familiar intercourse in which she had been bred and therefore instead of reprimanding him with a severity of look she with great good humour rallied him upon his assurance which she observed was undoubtedly the effect of his own conscious merit and conducted him into a parlour where he found her mother who in very polite terms expressed her satisfaction at seeing him within her house after tea miss emy proposed an evening walk which they enjoyed through a variety of little copses and lawns watered by a most romantic stream that quite enchanted the imagination of peregrine it was late before they returned from this agreeable excursion and when our lover wished the ladies good night mrs gauntlet insisted upon his staying to supper and treated him with particular demonstrations of regard and affection as her economy was not encumbered with an unnecessary number of domestics her own presence was often required in different parts of the house so that the young gentleman was supplied with frequent opportunities of promoting his suit by all the tender oaths and insinuations that his passion could suggest he protested her idea had taken such entire possession of his heart that finding himself unable to support her absence one day longer he had quitted his studies and left his governor by stealth that he might visit the object of his adoration and be blessed in her company for a few days without interruption she listened to his addresses with such affability as denoted approbation and delight and gently chided him as a thoughtless truant but carefully avoided the confession of a mutual flame because she discerned in the midst of all his tenderness a levity of pride which she durst not venture to trust with such a declaration perhaps she was confirmed in this caution by her mother who very wisely in her civilities to him maintained a sort of ceremonious distance which she thought not only requisite for the honour and interest of her family but likewise for her own exculpation should she ever be taxed with having encouraged or abetted him in the imprudent sallies of his youth yet notwithstanding this affected reserve he was treated with such distinction by both that he was ravished with his situation and became more and more enamoured every day while he remained under the influence of this sweet intoxication his absence produced great disturbance at winchester mr jolter was grievously afflicted at his abrupt departure which alarmed him the more as it happened after a long fit of melancholy which he had perceived in his pupil he communicated his apprehensions to the master of the school who advised him to apprise the commodore of his nephews disappearance and in the mean time inquire at all the inns in town whether he had hired horses or any sort of carriage for his conveyance or was met with on the road by any person who could give an account of the direction in which he travelled the scrutiny though performed with great diligence and minuteness was altogether ineffectual they could obtain no intelligence of the runaway mr trunnion was well distracted at the news of his flight he raved with great fury at the imprudence of peregrine whom in his first transports he d d as an ungrateful deserter then he cursed hatchway and pipes who he swore had foundered the lad by their pernicious counsels and lastly transferred his execrations upon jolter because he had not kept a better lookout finally he made an apostrophe to that son of a b the gout which for the present disabled him from searching for his nephew in person that he might not however neglect any means in his power he immediately despatched expresses to all the seaport towns on that coast that he might be prevented from leaving the kingdom and the lieutenant at his own desire was sent across the country in quest of this young fugitive four days had he unsuccessfully carried on his inquiries with great accuracy when resolving to return by winchester where he hoped to meet with some hints of intelligence by which he might profit in his future search he struck off the common road to take the benefit of a nearer cut and finding himself benighted near a village took up his lodgings at the first inn to which his horse directed him having bespoke something for supper and retired to his chamber where he amused himself with a pipe he heard a confused noise of rustic jollity which being all of a sudden interrupted after a short pause his ear was saluted with the voice of pipes who at the solicitation of the company began to entertain them with a song hatchway instantly recognised the wellknown sound in which indeed he could not possibly be mistaken as nothing in nature bore the least resemblance to it he threw his pipe into the chimney and snatching up one of his pistols ran immediately to the apartment from whence the voice issued he no sooner entered than distinguishing his old shipmate in a crowd of country peasants he in a moment sprang upon him and clapping his pistol to his breast exclaimed d n you pipes you are a dead man if you dont immediately produce young master this menacing application had a much greater effect upon the company than upon tom who looking at the lieutenant with great tranquility replied why so i can master hatchway what safe and sound cried the other as a roach answered pipes so much to the satisfaction of his friend jack that he shook him by the hand and desired him to proceed with his song this being performed and the reckoning discharged the two friends adjourned to the other room where the lieutenant was informed of the manner in which the young gentleman had made his elopement from college as well as of the other particulars of his present situation as far as they had fallen within the sphere of his comprehension while they sat thus conferring together peregrine having taken leave of his mistress for the night came home and was not a little surprised when hatchway entering his chamber in his sea attitude thrust out his hand by way of salutation his old pupil received him as usual with great cordiality and expressed his astonishment at meeting him in that place but when he understood the cause and intention of his arrival he started with concern and his visage glowing with indignation told him he was old enough to be judge of his own conduct and when he should see it convenient would return of himself but those who thought he was to be compelled to his duty would find themselves egregiously mistaken the lieutenant assured him that for his own part he had no intention to offer him the least violence but at the same time he represented to him the danger of incensing the commodore who was already almost distracted on account of his absence and in short conveyed his arguments which were equally obvious and valid in such expressions of friendship and respect that peregrine yielded to his remonstrances and promised to accompany him next day to winchester hatchway overjoyed at the success of his negotiation went immediately to the hostler and bespoke a postchaise for mr pickle and his man with whom he afterwards indulged himself in a double can of rumbo and when the night was pretty far advanced left the lover to his repose or rather to the thorns of his own meditation for he slept not one moment being incessantly tortured with the prospect of parting with his divine emilia who had now acquired the most absolute empire over his soul one minute he proposed to depart early in the morning without seeing this enchantress in whose bewitching presence he durst not trust his own resolution then the thoughts of leaving her in such an abrupt and disrespectful manner interposed in favour of his love and honour this war of sentiments kept him all night upon the rack and it was time to rise before he had determined to visit his charmer and candidly impart the motives that induced him to leave her he accordingly repaired to her mothers house with a heavy heart being attended to the gate by hatchway who did not choose to leave him alone and being admitted found emilia just risen and in his opinion more beautiful than ever alarmed at his early visit and the gloom that overspread his countenance she stood in silent expectation of hearing some melancholy tidings and it was not till after a considerable pause that he collected resolution enough to tell her he was come to take his leave though she strove to conceal her sorrow nature was not to be suppressed every feature of her countenance saddened in a moment and it was not without the utmost difficulty that she kept her lovely eyes from overflowing he saw the situation of her thoughts and in order to alleviate her concern assured her he should find means to see her again in a very few weeks meanwhile he communicated his reasons for departing in which she readily acquiesced and having mutually consoled each other their transports of grief subsided and before mrs gauntlet came downstairs they were in a condition to behave with great decency and resignation this good lady expressed her concern when she learned his resolution saying she hoped his occasions and inclinations would permit him to favour them with his agreeable company another time the lieutenant who began to be uneasy at peregrines stay knocked at the door and being introduced by his friend had the honour of breakfasting with the ladies on which occasion his heart received such a rude shock from the charms of emilia that he afterwards made a merit with his friend of having constrained himself so far as to forbear commencing his professed rival at length they bade adieu to their kind entertainers and in less than an hour setting out from the inn arrived about two oclock in winchester where mr jolter was overwhelmed with joy at their appearance the nature of this adventure being unknown to all except those who could be depended upon everybody who inquired about the cause of peregrines absence was told that he had been with a relation in the country and the master condescended to overlook his indiscretion so that hatchway seeing everything settled to the satisfaction of his friend returned to the garrison and gave the commodore an account of his expedition the old gentleman was very much startled when he heard there was a lady in the case and very emphatically observed that a man had better be sucked into the gulf of florida than once get into the indraught of a woman because in one case he may with good pilotage bring out his vessel safe between the bahamas and the indian shore but in the other there is no outlet at all and it is in vain to strive against the current so that of course he must be embayed and run chuck upon a leeshore he resolved therefore to lay the state of the case before gamaliel pickle and concert such measures with him as should be thought likeliest to detach his son from the pursuit of an idle amour which could not fail of interfering in a dangerous manner with the plan of his education in the mean time perrys ideas were totally engrossed by his amiable mistress who whether he slept or waked was still present in his imagination which produced the following stanzas in her praise adieu ye streams that smoothly flow ye vernal airs that softly blow ye plains by blooming spring arrayed ye birds that warble through the shade unhurt from you my soul could fly nor drop one tear nor heave one sigh but forced from celias charms to part all joy deserts my drooping heart o fairer than the rosy morn when flowers the dewy fields adorn unsallied as the genial ray that warms the balmy breeze of may thy charms divinely bright appear and add new splendour to the year improve the day with fresh delight and gild with joy the dreary night this juvenile production was enclosed in a very tender billet to emilia and committed to the charge of pipes who was ordered to set out for mrs gauntlets habitation with a present of venison and a compliment to the ladies and directed to take some opportunity of delivering the letter to miss without the knowledge of her mamma chapter xix his messenger meets with a misfortune to which he applies a very extraordinary expedient that is attended with strange consequences as a stagecoach passed within two miles of the village where she lived tom bargained with the driver for a seat on the box and accordingly departed on this message though he was but indifferently qualified for commissions of such a nature having received particular injunctions about the letter he resolved to make that the chief object of his care and very sagaciously conveyed it between the stocking and the sole of his foot where he thought it would be perfectly secure from all injury or accident here it remained until he arrived at the inn where he had formerly lodged when after having refreshed himself with a draught of beer he pulled off his stocking and found the poor billet sullied with dust and torn in a thousand tatters by the motion of his foot in walking the last two miles of his journey thunderstruck at this phenomenon he uttered it loud whew which was succeeded by an exclamation of d my old shoes a bite by g then he rested his elbows on the table and his forehead upon his two fists and in that attitude deliberated with himself upon the means of remedying this misfortune as he was not distracted by a vast number of ideas he soon concluded that his best expedient would be to employ the clerk of the parish who he knew was a great scholar to write another epistle according to the directions he should give him and never dreaming that the mangled original would in the least facilitate this scheme he very wisely committed it to the flames that it might never rise up in judgment against him having taken this wise step he went in quest of the scribe to whom he communicated his business and promised a full pot by way of gratification the clerk who was also schoolmaster proud of an opportunity to distinguish his talents readily undertook the task and repairing with his employer to the inn in less than a quarter of an hour produced a morsel of eloquence so much to the satisfaction of pipes that he squeezed his hand by way of acknowledgment and doubled his allowance of beer this being discussed our courier betook himself to the house of mrs gauntlet with the haunch of venison and this succedaneous letter and delivered his message to the mother who received it with great respect and many kind inquiries about the health and welfare of his master attempting to tip the messenger a crown which he absolutely refused to accept in consequence of mr pickles repeated caution while the old gentlewoman turned to a servant in order to give directions about the disposal of the present pipes looked upon this as a favourable occasion to transact his business with emilia and therefore shutting one eye with a jerk of his thumb towards his left shoulder and a most significant twist of his countenance he beckoned the young lady into another room as if he had been fraught with something of consequence which he wanted to impart she understood the hint howsoever strangely communicated and by stepping to one side of the room gave him an opportunity of slipping the epistle into her hand which be gently squeezed at the same time in token of regard then throwing a sideglance at the mother whose back was turned clapped his finger on the side of his nose thereby recommending secrecy and discretion emilia conveying the letter into her bosom could not help smiling at toms politeness and dexterity but lest her mamma should detect him in the execution of his pantomime she broke off this intercourse of signs by asking aloud when he proposed to set out on his return to winchester when he answered tomorrow morning miss gauntlet recommended him to the hospitality of her own footman desiring him to make much of mr pipes below where he was kept to supper and very cordially entertained our young heroine impatient to read her lovers billet which made her heart throb with rapturous expectation retired to her chamber as soon as possible with a view of perusing the contents which were these divine empress of my soul if the refulgent flames of your beauty had not evaporated the particles of my transported brain and scorched my intellects into a cinder of stolidity perhaps the resplendency of my passion might shine illustrious through the sable curtain of my ink and in sublimity transcend the galaxy itself though wafted on the pinions of a gray goose quill but ah celestial enchantress the necromancy of thy tyrannical charms hath fettered my faculties with adamantine chains which unless thy compassion shall melt i must eternally remain in the tartarean gulf of dismal despair vouchsafe therefore o thou brightest luminary of this terrestrial sphere to warm as well as shine and let the genial rays of thy benevolence melt the icy emanations of thy disdain which hath frozen up the spirits of angelic preeminence thy most egregious admirer and superlative slave peregrine pickle never was astonishment more perplexing than that of emilia when she read this curious composition which she repeated verbatim three times before she would credit the evidence of her own senses she began to fear in good earnest that love had produced a disorder in her lovers understanding but after a thousand conjectures by which she attempted to account for this extraordinary fustian of style she concluded that it was the effect of mere levity calculated to ridicule the passion he had formerly professed irritated by this supposition she resolved to balk his triumph with affected indifference and in the mean time endeavoured to expel him from that place which he possessed within her heart and indeed such a victory over her inclinations might have been obtained without great difficulty for she enjoyed an easiness of temper that could accommodate itself to the emergencies of her fate and her vivacity by amusing her imagination preserved herself from the keener sensations of sorrow thus determined and disposed she did not send any sort of answer or the least token of remembrance by pipes who was suffered to depart with a general compliment from the mother and arrived at winchester the next day peregrines eyes sparkled when he saw his messenger come in and he stretched out his hand in full confidence of receiving some particular mark of his emilias affection but how was he confounded when he found his hope so cruelly disappointed in an instant his countenance fell he stood for some time silent and abashed then thrice repeated the interrogation of what not one word from emilia and dubious of his couriers discretion inquired minutely into all the particulars of his reception he asked if he had seen the young lady if she was in good health if he had found an opportunity of delivering his letter and how she looked when he put it into her hand pipes answered that he had never seen her in better health or better spirits that he had managed matters so as not only to present the billet unperceived but also to ask her commands in private before he took his leave when she told him that the letter required no reply this last circumstance he considered as a manifest mark of disrespect and gnawed his lips with resentment upon further reflection however he supposed that she could not conveniently write by the messenger and would undoubtedly favour him by the post this consideration consoled him for the present and he waited impatiently for the fruits of his hope but after he had seen eight days elapse without reaping the satisfaction with which he had flattered himself his temper forsook him he raved against the whole sex and was seized with a fit of sullen chagrin but his pride in a little time came to his assistance and rescued him from the horrors of the melancholy fiend he resolved to retort her own neglect upon her ungrateful mistress his countenance gradually resumed its former serenity and though by this time he was pretty well cured of his foppery he appeared again at public diversions with an air of gaiety and unconcern that emilia might have a chance of hearing how much in all likelihood he disregarded her disdain there are never wanting certain officious persons who take pleasure in promoting intelligence of this sort his behaviour soon reached the ears of miss gauntlet and confirmed her in the opinion she had conceived from his letter so that she fortified herself in her former sentiments and bore his indifference with great philosophy thus a correspondence which had commenced with all the tenderness and sincerity of love and every promise of duration was interrupted in its infancy by a misunderstanding occasioned by the simplicity of pipes who never once reflected upon the consequences of his deceit though their mutual passion was by these means suppressed for the present it was not altogether extinguished but glowed in secret though even to themselves unknown until an occasion which afterwards offered blew up the latent flame and love resumed his empire in their breasts while they moved as it were without the sphere of each others attraction the commodore hearing that perry was in danger of involving himself in some pernicious engagement resolved by advice of mr jolter and his friend the parish priest to recall him from the place where he had contracted such imprudent connections and send him to the university where his education might be completed and his fancy weaned from all puerile amusements this plan had been proposed to his own father who as hath been already observed stood always neuter in everything that concerned his eldest son and as for mrs pickle she had never heard his name mentioned since his departure with any degree of temper or tranquility except when her husband informed her that he was in a fair way of being ruined by this indiscreet amour it was then she began to applaud her own foresight which had discerned the mark of reprobation in that vicious boy and launched out in comparison between him and gammy who she observed was a child of uncommon parts and solidity and with the blessing of god would be a comfort to his parents and an ornament to the family should i affirm that this favourite whom she commended so much was in every respect the reverse of what she described that he was a boy of mean capacity and though remarkably distorted in his body much more crooked in his disposition and that she had persuaded her husband to espouse her opinion though it was contrary to common sense as well as to his own perception i am afraid the reader will think i represent a monster that never existed in nature and be apt to condemn the economy of my invention nevertheless there is nothing more true than every circumstance of what i have advanced and i wish the picture singular as it is may not be thought to resemble more than one original chapter xx peregrine is summoned to attend his uncle is more and more hated by his own mother appeals to his father whose condescension is defeated by the dominion of his wife but waiving these reflections let us return to peregrine who received a summons to attend his uncle and in a few days arrived with mr jolter and pipes at the garrison which he filled with joy and satisfaction the alteration which during his absence had happened in his person was very favourable to his appearance which from that of a comely boy was converted into that of a most engaging youth he was already taller than a middlesized man his shape ascertained his sinews well knit his mien greatly improved and his whole figure as elegant and graceful as if it had been cast in the same mould with the apollo of belvedere such an outside could not fail of prepossessing people in his favour the commodore notwithstanding the advantageous reports he had heard found his expectation exceeded in the person of peregrine and signified his approbation in the most sanguine terms mrs trunnion was struck with his genteel address and received him with uncommon marks of complacency and affection he was caressed by all the people in the neighbourhood who while they admired his accomplishments could not help pitying his infatuated mother for being deprived of that unutterable delight which any other parent would have enjoyed in the contemplation of such an amiable son divers efforts were made by some welldisposed people to conquer if possible this monstrous prejudice but their endeavours instead of curing served only to inflame the distemper and she never could be prevailed upon to indulge him with the least mark of maternal regard on the contrary her original disgust degenerated into such inveteracy of hatred that she left no stone unturned to alienate the commodores affection for this her innocent child and even practised the most malicious defamation to accomplish her purpose every day did she abuse her husbands ear with some forged instance of peregrines ingratitude to his uncle well knowing that it would reach the commodores knowledge at night accordingly mr pickle used to tell him at the club that his hopeful favourite had ridiculed him in such a company and aspersed his spouse on another occasion and thus retail the little scandalous issue of his own wifes invention luckily for peregrine the commodore paid no great regard to the authority of his informer because he knew from what channel the intelligence flowed besides the youth had a staunch friend in mr hatchway who never failed to vindicate him when he was thus unjustly accused and always found argument enough to confute the assertions of his enemies but though trunnion had been dubious of the young gentlemans principles and deaf to the remonstrances of the lieutenant perry was provided with a bulwark strong enough to defend him from all such assaults this was no other than his aunt whose regard for him was perceived to increase in the same proportion as his own mothers diminished and indeed the augmentation of the one was in all probability owing to the decrease of the other for the two ladies with great civility performed all the duties of good neighbourhood and hated each other most piously in their hearts mrs pickle having been disobliged at the splendour of her sisters new equipage had ever since that time in the course of her visiting endeavoured to make people merry with satirical jokes on the poor ladys infirmities and mrs trunnion seized the very first opportunity of making reprisals by inveighing against her unnatural behaviour to her own child so that peregrine as on the one hand he was abhorred so on the other was he caressed in consequence of this contention and i firmly believe that the most effectual method of destroying his interest at the garrison would have been the show of countenancing him at his fathers house but whether this conjecture be reasonable or chimerical certain it is the experiment was never tried and therefore mr peregrine ran no risk of being disgraced the commodore who assumed and justly too the whole merit of his education was now as proud of the youths improvements as if he had actually been his own offspring and sometimes his affection rose to such a pitch of enthusiasm that he verily believed him to be the issue of his own loins notwithstanding this favourable predicament in which our hero stood with his aunt and her husband he could not help feeling the injury he suffered from the caprice of his mother and though the gaiety of his disposition hindered him from afflicting himself with reflections of any gloomy cast he did not fail to foresee that if any sudden accident should deprive him of the commodore he would in all likelihood find himself in a very disagreeable situation prompted by this consideration he one evening accompanied his uncle to the club and was introduced to his father before that worthy gentleman had the least inkling of his arrival mr gamaliel was never so disconcerted as at this reencounter his own disposition would not suffer him to do anything that might create the least disturbance or interrupt his enjoyment so strongly was he impressed with the terror of his wife that he durst not yield to the tranquility of his temper and as i have already observed his inclination was perfectly neutral thus distracted between different motives when perry was presented to him he sat silent and absorbed as if he did not or would not perceive the application and when he was urged to declare himself by the youth who pathetically begged to know how he had incurred his displeasure he answered in a peevish strain why good now child what would you have me to do your mother cant abide you if my mother is so unkind i will not call it unnatural said peregrine the tears of indignation starting from his eyes as to banish me from her presence and affection without the least cause assigned i hope you will not be so unjust as to espouse her barbarous prejudice before mr pickle had time to reply to his expostulation for which he was not at all prepared the commodore interposed and enforced his favourites remonstrance by telling mr gamaliel that he was ashamed to see any man drive in such a miserable manner under his wifes petticoat as for my own part said he raising his voice and assuming a look of importance and command before i would suffer myself to be steered all weathers by any woman in christendom dye see id raise such a hurricane about her ears that here he was interrupted by mr hatchway who thrusting his head towards the door in the attitude of one that listens cried ahey theres your spouse come to pay us a visit trunnions features that instant adopted a new disposition fear and confusion took possession of his countenance his voice from a tone of vociferation sank into a whisper of sure you must be mistaken jack and in great perplexity he wiped off his sweat which had started on his forehead at this false alarm the lieutenant having thus punished him for the rodomontade he had uttered told him with an arch sneer that he was deceived with the sound of the outward door creaking upon its hinges which he mistook for mrs trunnions voice and desired him to proceed with his admonitions to mr pickle it is not to be denied that this arrogance was a little unseasonable to the commodore who was in all respects as effectually subdued to the dominion of his wife as the person whose submission he then ventured to condemn with this difference of disposition trunnions subjection was like that of a bear chequered with fits of surliness and rage whereas pickle bore the yoke like an ox without repining no wonder then that this indolence this sluggishness this stagnation of temper rendered gamaliel incapable of withstanding the arguments and importunity of his friends to which he at length surrendered he acquiesced in the justice of their observations and taking his son by the hand promised to favour him for the future with his love and fatherly protection but this laudable resolution did not last mrs pickle still dubious of his constancy and jealous of his communication with the commodore never failed to interrogate him every night about the conversation that happened at the club and to regulate her exhortations according to the intelligence she received he was no sooner therefore conveyed to bed that academy in which all notable wives communicate their lectures when her catechism began and she in a moment perceived something reluctant and equivocal in her husbands answers aroused at this discovery she employed her influence and skill with such success that he disclosed every circumstance of what had happened and after having sustained a most severe rebuke for his simplicity and indiscretion humbled himself so far as to promise that he would next day annul the condescensions he had made and for ever renounce the ungracious object of her disgust this undertaking was punctually performed in a letter to the commodore which she herself dictated in these words sir whereas my goodnature being last night imposed upon i was persuaded to countenance and promise i know not what to that vicious youth whose parent i have the misfortune to be i desire you will take notice that i will revoke all such countenance and promises and shall never look upon that man as my friend who will in such a cause solicit sir yours etc gam pickle chapter xxi trunnion is enraged at the conduct of pickle peregrine resents the injustice of his mother to whom he explains his sentiments in a letteris entered at the university of oxford where he signalizes himself as a youth of an enterprising genius unspeakable were the transports of rage to which trunnion was incensed by this absurd renunciation he tore the letter with his gums teeth he had none spit with furious grimaces in token of the contempt he entertain the for the author whom he not only damned as a lousy scabby nasty scurvy skulking lubberly noodle but resolved to challenge to single combat with fire and sword but he was dissuaded from this violent measure and appeased by the intervention and advice of the lieutenant and mr jolter who represented the message as the effect of the poor mans infirmity for which he was rather an object of pity than of resentment and turned the stream of his indignation against the wife whom he reviled accordingly nor did peregrine himself bear with patience this injurious declaration the nature of which he no sooner understood from hatchway than equally shocked and exasperated he retired to his apartment and in the first emotions of his ire produced the following epistle which was immediately conveyed to his mother madam had nature formed me a bugbear to the sight and inspired me with a soul as vicious as my body was detestable perhaps i might have enjoyed particular marks of your affection and applause seeing you have persecuted me with such unnatural aversion for no other visible reason than that of my differing so widely in shape as well as disposition from that deformed urchin who is the object of your tenderness and care if these be the terms on which alone i can obtain your favour i pray god you may never cease to hate madam your muchinjured son peregrine pickle this letter which nothing but his passion and inexperience could excuse had such an effect upon his mother as may be easily conceived she was enraged to a degree of frenzy against the writer though at the same time she considered the whole as the production of mrs trunnions particular pique and represented it to her husband as an insult that he was bound in honour to resent by breaking off all correspondence with the commodore and his family this was a bitter pill to gamaliel who through a long course of years was so habituated to trunnions company that he could as easily have parted with a limb as have relinquished the club all at once he therefore ventured to represent his own incapacity to follow her advice and begged that be might at least be allowed to drop the connection gradually protesting that he would do his endeavour to give her all manner of satisfaction meanwhile preparations were made for peregrines departure to the university and in a few weeks he set out in the seventeenth year of his age accompanied by the same attendants who lived with him at winchester his uncle laid strong injunctions upon him to avoid the company of immodest women to mind his learning to let him hear of his welfare as often as he could find time to write and settled his appointments at the rate of five hundred a year including his governors salary which was onefifth part of the sum the heart of our young gentleman dilated at the prospect of the figure he should make with such a handsome annuity the management of which was left to his own discretion and he amused his imagination with the most agreeable reveries during his journey to oxford which he performed in two days here being introduced to the head of the college to whom he had been recommended accommodated with genteel apartments entered as gentleman commoner in the books and provided with a judicious tutor instead of returning to the study of greek and latin in which he thought himself already sufficiently instructed he renewed his acquaintance with some of his old schoolfellows whom he found in the same situation and was by them initiated in all the fashionable diversions of the place it was not long before he made himself remarkable for his spirit and humour which were so acceptable to the bucks of the university that he was admitted as a member of their corporation and in a very little time became the most conspicuous personage of the whole fraternity not that he valued himself upon his ability in smoking the greatest number of pipes and drinking the largest quantity of ale these were qualifications of too gross a nature to captivate his refined ambition he piqued himself on his talent for raillery his genius and taste his personal accomplishments and his success at intrigue nor were his excursions confined to the small villages in the neighbourhood which are commonly visited once a week by the students for the sake of carnal recreation he kept his own horses traversed the whole country in parties of pleasure attended all the races within fifty miles of oxford and made frequent jaunts to london where he used to be incognito during the best part of many a term the rules of the university were too severe to be observed by a youth of his vivacity and therefore he became acquainted with the proctor betimes but all the checks he received were insufficient to moderate his career he frequented taverns and coffeehouses committed midnight frolics in the streets insulted all the sober and pacific class of his fellowstudents the tutors themselves were not sacred from his ridicule he laughed at the magistrate and neglected every particular of college discipline in vain did they attempt to restrain his irregularities by the imposition of fines he was liberal to profusion and therefore paid without reluctance thrice did he scale the windows of a tradesman with whose daughter he had an affair of gallantry as often was he obliged to seek his safety by a precipitate leap and one night would in all probability have fallen a sacrifice to an ambuscade that was laid by the father had not his trusty squire pipes interposed in his behalf and manfully rescued him from the clubs of his enemies in the midst of these excesses mr jolter finding his admonitions neglected and his influence utterly destroyed attempted to wean his pupil from his extravagant courses by engaging his attention in some more laudable pursuit with this view he introduced him into a club of politicians who received him with great demonstrations of regard accommodated themselves more than he could have expected to his jovial disposition and while they revolved schemes for the reformation of the state drank with such devotion to the accomplishment of their plans that before parting the cares of their patriotism were quite overwhelmed peregrine though he could not approve of their doctrine resolved to attach himself for some time to their company because he perceived ample subject for his ridicule in the characters of these wrongheaded enthusiasts it was a constant practice with them in their midnight consistories to swallow such plentiful draughts of inspiration that their mysteries commonly ended like those of the bacchanalian orgia and they were seldom capable of maintaining that solemnity of decorum which by the nature of their functions most of them were obliged to profess now as peregrines satirical disposition was never more gratified than when he had an opportunity of exposing grave characters in ridiculous attitudes he laid a mischievous snare for his new confederates which took effect in this manner in one of their nocturnal deliberations he promoted such a spirit of good fellowship by the agreeable sallies of his wit which were purposely leveled against their political adversaries that by ten oclock they were all ready to join in the most extravagant proposal that could be made they broke their glasses in consequence of his suggestion drank healths out of their shoes caps and the bottoms of the candlesticks that stood before them sometimes standing with one foot on a chair and the knee bent on the edge of the table and when they could no longer stand in that posture setting their bare posteriors on the cold floor they huzzaed hallooed danced and sang and in short were elevated to such a pitch of intoxication that when peregrine proposed that they should burn their periwigs the hint was immediately approved and they executed the frolic as one man their shoes and caps underwent the same fate by the same instigation and in this trim he led them forth into the street where they resolved to compel everybody they should find to subscribe to their political creed and pronounce the shibboleth of their party in the achievement of this enterprise they met with more opposition than they expected they were encountered with arguments which they could not well withstand the noses of some and eyes of others in a very little time bore the marks of obstinate disputation their conductor having at length engaged the whole body in a fray with another squadron which was pretty much in the same condition he very fairly gave them the slip and slyly retreated to his apartment foreseeing that his companions would soon be favoured with the notice of their superiors nor was he deceived in his prognostic the proctor going his round chanced to fall in with this tumultuous uproar and interposing his authority found means to quiet the disturbance he took cognizance of their names and dismissed the rioters to their respective chambers not a little scandalized at the behaviour of some among them whose business and duty it was to set far other examples for the youth under their care and direction about midnight pipes who had orders to attend at a distance and keep an eye upon jolter brought home that unfortunate governor upon his back peregrine having beforehand secured his admittance into the college and among other bruises he was found to have received a couple of contusions on his face which next morning appeared in a black circle that surrounded each eye this was a mortifying circumstance to a man of his character and deportment especially as he had received a message from the proctor who desired to see him forthwith with great humility and contrition he begged the advice of his pupil who being used to amuse himself with painting assured mr jolter that he would cover those signs of disgrace with a slight coat of fleshcolour so dexterously that it would be almost impossible to distinguish the artificial from the natural skin the rueful governor rather than expose such opprobrious tokens to the observation and censure of the magistrate submitted to the expedient although his counsellor had overrated his own skill he was persuaded to confide in the disguise and actually attended the proctor with such a staring addition to the natural ghastliness of his features that his visage bore a very apt resemblance to some of those ferocious countenances that hang over the doors of certain taverns and alehouses under the denomination of the saracens head such a remarkable alteration of physiognomy could not escape the notice of the most undiscerning beholder much less the penetrating eye of his severe judge already whetted with what he had seen overnight he was therefore upbraided with this ridiculous and shallow artifice and together with the companions of his debauch underwent such a cutting reprimand for the scandalous irregularity of his conduct that all of them remained crestfallen and were ashamed for many weeks to appear in the public execution of their duty peregrine was too vain of his finesse to conceal the part he acted in this comedy with the particulars of which he regaled his companions and thereby entailed upon himself the hate and resentment of the community whose maxims and practices he had disclosed for he was considered as a spy who had intruded himself into their society with a view of betraying it or at best as an apostate and renegado from the faith and principles which he had professed chapter xxii he is insulted by his tutor whom he lampoons makes a considerable progress in polite literature and in an excursion to windsor meets with emilia by accident and is very coldly received among those who suffered by his craft and infidelity was mr jumble his own tutor who could not at all digest the mortifying affront he had received and was resolved to be revenged on the insulting author with this view he watched the conduct of mr pickle with the utmost rancour of vigilance and let slip no opportunity of treating him disrespect which he knew the disposition of his pupil could less brook than any other severity it was in his power to exercise peregrine had been several mornings absent from chapel and as mr jumble never failed to question him in a very peremptory style about his nonattendance he invented some very plausible excuses but at length his ingenuity was exhausted he received a very galling rebuke for his proffigacy of morals and that he might feel it the more sensibly was ordered by way of exercise to compose a paraphrase in english verse upon these two lines in virgil vane ligur frustraque animis elate superbis nequicquam patrias tentasti lubricus artes the imposition of this invidious theme had all the desired effect upon peregrine who not only considered it as a piece of unmannerly abuse leveled against his own conduct but also a retrospective insult on the memory of his grandfather who as he had been informed was in his lifetime more noted for his cunning than candour in trade exasperated at this instance of the pedants audacity he had well nigh in his first transports taken corporal satisfaction on the spot but foreseeing the troublesome consequences that would attend such a flagrant outrage against the laws of the university he checked his indignation and resolved to revenge the injury in a more cool and contemptuous manner thus determined he set on foot an inquiry into the particulars of jumbles parentage and education he learnt that the father of this insolent tutor was a bricklayer that his mother sold pies and that the son in different periods of his youth had amused himself in both occupations before he converted his views to the study of learning fraught with this intelligence he composed the following ballad in doggerel rhymes and next day presented it as a gloss upon the text which the tutor had chosen come listen ye students of every degree i sing of a wit and a tutor perdie a statesman profound a critic immense in short a mere jumble of learning and sense and yet of his talents though laudably vain his own family arts he could never attain his father intending his fortune to build in his youth would have taught him the trowel to wield but the mortar of discipline never would stick for his skull was secured by a facing of brick and with all his endeavours of patience and pain the skill of his sire he could never attain his mother a housewife neat artful and wise renownd for her delicate biscuit and pies soon alterd his studies by flattering his taste from the raising of walls to the rearing of paste but all her instructions were fruitless and vain the piemaking mystery he neer could attain yet true to his race in his labours were seen a jumble of both their professions i ween for when his own genius he ventured to trust his pies seemed of brick and his houses of crust then good mr tutor pray be not so vain since your family arts you could never attain this impudent production was the most effectual vengeance he could have taken on his tutor who had all the supercilious arrogance and ridiculous pride of a lowborn pedant instead of overlooking this petulant piece of satire with that temper and decency of disdain that became a person of his gravity and station he no sooner cast his eye over the performance than the blood rushed into his countenance and immediately after exhibited a ghastly pale colour with a quivering lip he told his pupil that he was an impertinent jackanapes and he would take care that he should be expelled from the university for having presumed to write and deliver such a licentious and scurrilous libel peregrine answered with great resolution that when the provocation he had received should be known he was persuaded that he should be acquitted by the opinion of all impartial people and that he was ready to submit the whole to the decision of the master this arbitration he proposed because he knew the master and jumble were at variance and for that reason the tutor durst not venture to put the cause on such an issue nay when this reference was mentioned jumble who was naturally jealous suspected that peregrine had a promise of protection before he undertook to commit such an outrageous insult and this notion had such an effect upon him that he decided to devour his vexation and wait for a more proper opportunity of gratifying his hate meanwhile copies of the ballad were distributed among the students who sang it under the very nose of mr jumble to the tune of a cobbler there was etc and the triumph of our hero was complete neither was his whole time devoted to the riotous extravagancies of youth he enjoyed many lucid intervals during which he contracted a more intimate acquaintance with the classics applied himself to the reading of history improved his taste for painting and music in which he made some progress and above all things cultivated the study of natural philosophy it was generally after a course of close attention to some of these arts and sciences that his disposition broke out into those irregularities and wild sallies of a luxuriant imagination for which he became so remarkable and he was perhaps the only young man in oxford who at the same time maintained an intimate and friendly intercourse with the most unthinking as well as the most sedate students at the university it is not to be supposed that a young man of peregrines vanity inexperience and profusion could suit his expense to his allowance liberal as it was for he was not one of those fortunate people who are born economists and knew not the art of withholding his purse when he saw his companion in difficulty thus naturally generous and expensive he squandered away his money and made a most splendid appearance upon the receipt of his quarterly appointment but long before the third month was elapsed his finances were consumed and as he could not stoop to ask an extraordinary supply was too proud to borrow and too haughty to run in debt with tradesmen he devoted those periods of poverty to the prosecution of his studies and shone forth again at the revolution of quarterday in one of these eruptions he and some of his companions went to windsor in order to see the royal apartments in the castle whither they repaired in the afternoon and as peregrine stood contemplating the picture of hercules and omphale one of his fellowstudents whispered in his car zounds pickle there are two fine girls he turned instantly about and in one of them recognized his almost forgotten emilia her appearance acted upon his imagination like a spark of fire that falls among gunpowder that passion which had lain dormant for the space of two years flashed up in a moment and he was seized with a trepidation she perceived and partook of his emotion for their souls like unisons vibrated with the same impulse however she called her pride and resentment to her aid and found resolution enough to retire from such a dangerous scene alarmed at her retreat he recollected all his assurance and impelled by love which he could no longer resist followed her into the next room where in the most disconcerted manner he accosted her with your humble servant miss gauntlet to which salutation she replied with an affectation of indifference that did not however conceal her agitation your servant sir and immediately extending her finger toward the picture of duns scotus which is fixed over one of the doors asked her companion in a giggling tone if she did not think he looked like a conjurer peregrine nettled into spirits by this reception answered for the other lady that it was an easy matter to be a conjurer in those times when the simplicity of the age assisted his divination but were he or merlin himself to rise from the dead now when such deceit and dissimulation prevail they would not be able to earn their bread by the profession sir said she turning full upon him without doubt they would adopt new maxims tis no disparagement in this enlightened age for one to alter ones opinion no sure madam replied the youth with some precipitation provided the change be for the better and should it happen otherwise retorted the nymph with a flirt of her fan inconstancy will never want countenance from the practice of mankindtrue madam resumed our hero fixing his eyes upon her examples of levity are every where to be met withoh lord sir cried emilia tossing her head youll scarce ever find a fop without it by this time his companion seeing him engaged with one of the ladies entered into conversation with the other and in order to favour his friends gallantry conducted her into the next apartment on pretence of entertaining her with the sight of a remarkable piece of painting peregrine laying hold on this opportunity of being alone with the object of his love assumed a most seducing tenderness of look and heaving a profound sigh asked if she had utterly discarded him from her remembrance reddening at this pathetic question which recalled the memory of the imagined slight he had put upon her she answered in great confusion sir i believe i once had the pleasure of seeing you at a ball in winchester miss emilia said he very gravely will you be so candid as to tell me what misbehaviour of mine you are pleased to punish by restricting your remembrance to that single occasion mr pickle she replied in the same tone it is neither my province nor inclination to judge your conduct and therefore you misapply your question when you ask such an explanation of me at least resumed our lover give me the melancholy satisfaction to know for what offence of mine you refused to take least notice of that letter which i had the honour to write from winchester by your own express permission your letter said miss with great vivacity neither required nor in my opinion deserved an answer and to be free with you mr pickle it was but a shallow artifice to rid yourself of a correspondence you had deigned to solicit peregrine confounded at this repartee replied that howsoever he might have failed in point of elegance or discretion he was sure he had not been deficient in expressions of respect and devotion for those charms which it was his pride to adore as for the verses said he i own they were unworthy of the theme but i flattered myself that they would have merited your acceptance though not your approbation and been considered not so much as the proof of my genius as the genuine effusion of my love verses cried emilia with an air of astonishment what verses i really dont understand you the young gentleman was thunderstruck at this exclamation to which after a long pause he answered i begin to suspect and heartily wish it may appear that we have misunderstood each other from the beginning pray miss gauntlet did you not find a copy of verses inclosed in that unfortunate letter truly sit said the lady i am not so much of a connoisseur as to distinguish whether that facetious production which you merrily style as an unfortunate letter was composed in verse or prose but methinks the jest is a little too stale to be brought upon the carpet again so saying she tripped away to her companion and left her lover in a most tumultuous suspense he now perceived that her neglect of his addresses when he was at winchester must have been owing to some mystery which he could not comprehend and she began to suspect and to hope that the letter which she received was spurious though she could not conceive how that could possibly happen as it had been delivered to her by the hands of his own servant however she resolved to leave the task of unravelling this affair to him who she knew would infallibly exert himself for his own as well as her satisfaction she was not deceived in her opinion he went up to her again at the staircase and as they were improvided with a male attendant insisted upon squiring the ladies to their lodgings emilia saw his drift which was no other than to know where she lived and though she approved of his contrivance thought it was incumbent upon her for the support of her own dignity to decline the chivalry she therefore thanked him for his polite offer but would by no means consent to his giving himself such unnecessary trouble especially as they had a very little way to walk he was not repulsed by this refusal the nature of which he perfectly understood nor was she sorry to see him persevere in his determination he therefore accompanied them in their return and made divers efforts to speak with emilia in particular but she had a spice of the coquette in her disposition and being determined to whet his impatience artfully baffled all his endeavours by keeping her companion continually engaged in the conversation which turned upon the venerable appearance and imperial situation of the place thus tantalized he lounged with them to the door of the house in which they lodged when his mistress perceiving by the countenance of her comrade that she was on the point of desiring him to walk in checked her intention with a frown then turning to mr pickle dropped him a very formal curtsy seized the other young lady by the arm and saying come cousin sophy vanished in a moment chapter xxiii after sundry unsuccessful efforts he finds means to come to an explanation with his mistress and a reconciliation ensues peregrine disconcerted at their sudden disappearance stood for some minutes gaping in the street before he could get the better of his surprise and then deliberated with himself whether he should demand immediate admittance to his mistress or choose some other method of application piqued at her abrupt behaviour though pleased with her spirit he set his invention to work in order to contrive some means of seeing her and in a fit of musing arrived at the inn where he found his companions whom he had left at the castlegate they had already made inquiry about the ladies in consequence of which he learnt that miss sophy was daughter of a gentleman in town to which his mistress was related that an intimate friendship subsisted between the two young ladies that emilia had lived almost a month with her cousin and appeared at the last assembly where she was universally admired and that several young gentlemen of fortune had since that time teased her with addresses our heros ambition was flattered and his passion inflamed with this intelligence and he swore within himself that he would not quit the spot until he should have obtained an undisputed victory over all his rivals that same evening he composed a most eloquent epistle in which he earnestly entreated that she would favour him with an opportunity of vindicating his conduct but she would neither receive his billet nor see his messenger balked in this effort he inclosed it in a new cover directed by another hand and ordered pipes to ride next morning to london on purpose to deliver it at the postoffice that coming by such conveyance she might have no suspicion of the author and open it before she should be aware of the deceit three days he waited patiently for the effect of this stratagem and in the afternoon of the fourth ventured to hazard a formal visit in quality of an old acquaintance but here too he failed in his attempt she was indisposed and could not see company these obstacles served only to increase his eagerness he still adhered to his former resolution and his companions understanding his determination left him next day to his own inventions thus relinquished to his own ideas he doubled his assiduity and practised every method his imagination could suggest in order to promote his plan pipes was stationed all day long within sight of her door that he might be able to give his master an account of her motions but she never went abroad except to visit in the neighbourhood and was always housed before peregrine could be apprised of her appearance he went to church with a view of attracting her notice and humbled his deportment before her but she was so mischievously devout as to look at nothing but her book so that he was not favoured with one glance of regard he frequented the coffeehouse and attempted to contract an acquaintance with miss sophys father who he hoped would invite him to his house but this expectation was also defeated that prudent gentleman looked upon him as one of those forward fortunehunters who go about the country seeking whom they may devour and warily discouraged all his advances chagrined by so many unsuccessful endeavours he began to despair of accomplishing his aim and as the last suggestion of his art paid off his lodging took horse at noon and departed in all appearance for the place from whence he had come he rode but a few miles and in the dusk of the evening returned unseen alighted at another inn ordered pipes to stay within doors and keeping himself incognito employed another person as a sentinel upon emilia it was not long before he reaped the fruits of his ingenuity next day in the afternoon he was informed by his spy that the two young ladies were gone to walk in the park whither he followed them on the instant fully determined to come to an explanation with his mistress even in presence of her friend who might possibly be prevailed upon to interest herself in his behalf when he saw them at such a distance that they could not return to town before he should have an opportunity of putting his resolution in practice he mended his pace and found means to appear before them so suddenly that emilia could not help expressing her surprise in a scream our lover putting on a mien of humility and mortification begged to know if her resentment was implacable and asked why she had so cruelly refused to grant him the common privilege that every criminal enjoyed dear miss sophy said he addressing himself to her companion give me leave to implore your intercession with your cousin i am sure you have humanity enough to espouse my cause did you but know the justice of it and i flatter myself that by your kind interposition i may be able to rectify that fatal misunderstanding which hath made me wretched sir said sophy you appear like a gentleman and i doubt not but your behaviour has been always suitable to your appearance but you must excuse me from undertaking any such office in behalf of a person whom i have not the honour to know madam answered peregrine i hope miss emy will justify my pretensions to that character notwithstanding the mystery of her displeasure which upon my honour i cannot for my soul explain lord mr pickle said emilia who had by this time recollected herself i never questioned your gallantry and taste but i am resolved that you shall never have cause to exercise your talents at my expense so that you tease yourself and me to no purpose come sophy let us walk home again good god madam cried the lover with great emotion why will you distract me with such barbarous indifference stay dear emilia i conjure you on my knees to stay and hear me by all that is sacred i was not to blame you must have been imposed upon by some villain who envied my good fortune and took some treacherous method to ruin my love miss sophy who possessed a large stock of good nature and to whom her cousin had communicated the cause of her reserve seeing the young gentleman so much affected with that disdain which she knew to be feigned laid hold on emilias sleeve saying with a smile not quite so fast emily i begin to perceive that this is a lovequarrel and therefore there may be hopes of a reconciliation for i suppose both parties are open to conviction for my own part cried peregrine with great eagerness i appeal to miss sophys decision but why do i say appeal though i am conscious of having committed no offence i am ready to submit to any penance let it be never so rigorous that my fair enslaver herself shall impose provided it will entitle me to her favour and forgiveness at last emily well nigh overcome by this declaration told him that as she taxed him with no guilt she expected no atonement and pressed her companion to return to town but sophy who was too indulgent to her friends real inclination to comply with her request observed that the gentleman seemed so reasonable in his concessions that she began to think her cousin was in the wrong and felt herself disposed to act as umpire in the dispute overjoyed at this condescension mr pickle thanked her in the most rapturous terms and in the transport of his expectation kissed the hand of his kind mediatrix a circumstance which had a remarkable effect on the countenance of emilia who did not seem to relish the warmth of his acknowledgment after many supplications on one hand and pressing remonstrances on the other she yielded at length and turning to her lover while her face was overspread with blushes well sir said she supposing i were to put the difference on that issue how could you excuse the ridiculous letter which you sent to me from winchester this expostulation introduced a discussion of the whole affair in which all the circumstances were canvassed and emilia still affirmed with great heat that the letter must have been calculated to affront her for she could not suppose the author was so weak as to design it for any other purpose peregrine who still retained in his memory the substance of this unlucky epistle as well as the verses which were inclosed could recollect no particular expression which could have justly given the least umbrage and therefore in the agonies of perplexity begged that the whole might be submitted to the judgment of miss sophy and faithfully promised to stand to her award in short this proposal was with seeming reluctance embraced by emilia and an appointment made to meet next day in the place whither both parties were desired to come provided with their credentials according to which definitive sentence would be pronounced our lover having succeeded thus far overwhelmed sophy with acknowledgments on account of her generous mediation and in the course of their walk which emilia was now in no hurry to conclude whispered a great many tender protestations in the ear of his mistress who nevertheless continued to act upon the reserve until her doubts should be more fully resolved mr pickle having found means to amuse them in the fields till the twilight was obliged to wish them good even after having obtained a solemn repetition of their promise to meet him at the appointed time and place and then retreated to his apartment where he spent the whole night in various conjectures on the subject of the letter the gordian knot of which he could by no means untie one while he imagined that some wag had played a trick on his messenger in consequence of which emilia had received a supposititious letter but upon farther reflection he could not conceive the practicability of any such deceit then he began to doubt the sincerity of his mistress who perhaps had only made that a handle for discarding him at the request of some favoured rival but his own integrity forbade him to harbour this mean suspicion and therefore he was again involved in the labyrinth of perplexity next day he waited on the rack of impatience for the hour of five in the afternoon which no sooner struck than he ordered pipes to attend him in case there should be occasion for his evidence and repaired to the place of rendezvous where he had not tarried five minutes before the ladies appeared mutual compliments being passed and the attendant stationed at a convenient distance peregrine persuaded them to sit down upon the grass under the shade of a spreading oak that they might be more at their ease while he stretched himself at their feet and desired that the paper on which his doom depended might be examined it was accordingly put into the hand of his fair arbitress who read it immediately with an audible voice the first two words of it were no sooner pronounced than he started with great emotion and raised himself upon his hand and knee in which posture he listened to the rest of the sentence then sprang upon his feet in the utmost astonishment and glowing with resentment at the same time exclaimed hell and the devil whats all that sure you make a jest of me madam pray sir said sophy give me the hearing for a few moments and then urge what you shall think proper in your own defence having thus cautioned him she proceeded but before she had finished onehalf of the performance her gravity forsook her and she was seized with a violent fit of laughter in which neither of the lovers could help joining notwithstanding the resentment which at that instant prevailed in the breasts of both the judge however in a little time resumed her solemnity and having read the remaining part of this curious epistle all three continued staring at each other alternately for the space of half a minute and then broke forth at the same instant in another paroxysm of mirth from this unanimous convulsion one would have thought that both parties were extremely well pleased with a joke yet this was by no means the case emilia imagined that notwithstanding his affected surprise her lover in spite of himself had received the laugh at her expense and in so doing applauded his own unmannerly ridicule this supposition could not fail of raising and reviving her indignation while peregrine highly resented the indignity with which he supposed himself treated in their attempting to make him the dupe of such a gross and ludicrous artifice this being the situation of their thoughts their mirth was succeeded by a mutual gloominess of aspect and the judge addressing herself to mr pickle asked if he had anything to offer why sentence should not be pronounced madam answered the culprit i am sorry to find myself so low in the opinion of your cousin as to be thought capable of being deceived by such shallow contrivance nay sir said emilia the contrivance is your own and i cannot help admiring your confidence in imputing it to me upon my honour miss emily resumed our hero you wrong my understanding as well as my love in accusing me of having written such a silly impertinent performance the very appearance and address of it is so unlike the letter which i did myself the honour to write that i dare say my man even at this distance of time will remember the difference so saying he extended his voice and beckoned to pipes who immediately drew near his mistress seemed to object to the evidence by observing that to be sure mr pipes had his cue when peregrine begging she would spare him the mortification of considering him in such a dishonourable light desired his valet to examine the outside of the letter and recollect if it was the same which he had delivered to miss gauntlet about two years ago pipes having taken a superficial view of it pulled up his breeches saying mayhap it is but we have made so many trips and been in so many creeks and corners since that time that i cant pretend to be certain for i neither keep journal nor logbook of our proceedings emilia commended him for his candour at the same time darting a sarcastic look at his master as if she thought he had tampered with his servants integrity in vain and peregrine began to live and curse his fate for having subjected him to such mean suspicion attesting heaven and earth in the most earnest manner that far from having composed and conveyed that stupid production he had never seen it before nor been privy to the least circumstance of the plan pipes now for the first time perceived the mischief which he had occasioned and moved with the transports of his master for whom he had a most inviolable attachment frankly declared he was ready to make oath that mr pickle had no hand in the letter which he delivered all three were amazed at this confession the meaning of which they could not comprehend peregrine after some pause leaped upon pipes and seizing him by the throat exclaimed in an ecstasy of rage rascal tell me this instant what became of the letter i entrusted to your care the patient valet halfstrangled as he was squirted a collection of tobaccojuice out of one corner of his mouth and with great deliberation replied why burnt it you wouldnt have me to give the young woman a thing that shook all in the wind in tatters would you the ladies interposed in behalf of the distressed squire from whom by dint of questions which he had neither art nor inclination to evade they extorted an explanation of the whole affair such ridiculous simplicity and innocence of intention appeared in the composition of his expedient that even the remembrance of all the chagrin which it had produced could not rouse their indignation or enable the to resist a third eruption of laughter which they forthwith underwent pipes was dismissed with many menacing injunctions to beware of such conduct for the future emilia stood with a confusion of joy and tenderness in her countenance peregrines eyes kindled into rapture and when miss sophy pronounced the sentence of reconciliation advanced to his mistress saying truth is mighty and will prevail then clapping her in his arms very impudently ravished a kiss which she had not power to refuse nay such was the impulse of his joy that he took the same freedom with the lips of sophy calling her his kind mediatrix and guardian angel and behaved with such extravagance of transport as plainly evinced the fervour and sincerity of his love i shall not pretend to repeat the tender protestations that were uttered on one side or describe the bewitching glances of approbation with which they were received on the other suffice it to say that the endearing intimacy of their former connection was instantly renewed and sophy who congratulated them on the happy termination of their quarrel favoured with their mutual confidence in consequence of this happy pacification they deliberated upon the means of seeing each other often and as he could not without some previous introduction visit her openly at the house of her relation they agreed to meet every afternoon in the park till the next assembly at which he would solicit her as a partner and she be unengaged in expectation of his request by this connection he would be entitled to visit her next day and thus an avowed correspondence would of course commence this plan was actually put in execution and attended with a circumstance which had wellnigh produced some mischievous consequence had not peregrines good fortune been superior to his discretion chapter xxiv he achieves an adventure at the assembly and quarrels with his governor at the assembly were no fewer than three gentlemen of fortune who rivalled our lover in his passion for emilia and who had severally begged the honour of dancing with her upon this occasion she had excused herself to each on pretence of a slight indisposition that she foresaw would detain her from the ball and desired they would provide themselves with other partners obliged to admit her excuse they accordingly followed her advice and after they had engaged themselves beyond the power of retracting had the mortification of seeing her there unclaimed they in their turn made up to her and expressed their surprise and concern at finding her in the assembly unprovided after she had declined their invitation but she told them that her cold had forsaken her since she had the pleasure of seeing them and that she would rely upon accident for a partner just as she pronounced these words to the last of the three peregrine advanced as an utter stranger bowed with great respect told her he understood she was unengaged and would think himself highly honoured in being accepted as her partner for the night and he had the good fortune to succeed in his application as they were by far the handsomest and bestaccomplished couple in the room they could not fail of attracting the notice and admiration of the spectators which inflamed the jealousy of his three competitors who immediately entered into a conspiracy against this gaudy stranger whom as their rival they resolved to affront in public pursuant to the plan which they projected for this purpose the first countrydance was no sooner concluded than one of them with his partner took place of peregrine and his mistress contrary to the regulation of the ball our lover imputing his behaviour to inadvertency informed the gentleman of his mistake and civilly desired he would rectify his error the other told him in an imperious tone that he wanted none of his advice and bade him mind his own affairs peregrine answered with some warmth and insisted upon his right a dispute commenced high words ensued in the course of which our impetuous youth hearing himself reviled with the appellation of scoundrel pulled off his antagonists periwig and flung it in his face the ladies immediately shrieked the gentlemen interposed emilia was seized with a fit of trembling and conducted to her seat by her youthful admirer who begged pardon for having discomposed her and vindicated what he had done by representing the necessity he was under to resent the provocation he had received though she could not help owning the justice of his plea she not the less concerned at the dangerous situation in which he had involved himself and in the utmost consternation and anxiety insisted upon going directly home he could not resist her importunities and her cousin being determined to accompany her he escorted to their lodgings where he wished them good night after having in order to quiet their apprehensions protested that if his opponent was satisfied he should never take any step towards the prosecution of the quarrel meanwhile the assemblyroom became a of scene of tumult and uproar the person who conceived himself injured seeing peregrine retire struggled with his companions in order to pursue and take satisfaction of our hero whom he loaded with terms of abuse and challenged to single combat the director of the ball held a consultation with all the subscribers who were present and it was determined by a majority of votes that the two gentlemen who had occasioned the disturbance should be desired to withdraw this resolution being signified to one of the parties then present he made some difficulty of complying but was persuaded to submit by his two confederates who accompanied him to the streetdoor where he was met by peregrine on his return to the assembly this choleric gentleman who was a country squire no sooner saw his rival than he began to brandish his cudgel in a menacing posture when our adventurous youth stepping back with one foot laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword which he drew half way out of the scabbard this attitude and the sight of the blade which glistened by moonlight in his face checked in some sort the ardour of his assailant who desired he would lay aside his toaster and take a bout with him at equal arms peregrine who was an expert cudgelplayer accepted the invitation then exchanging weapons with pipes who stood behind him put himself in a posture of defence and received the attack of his adversary who struck at random without either skill or economy pickle could have beaten the cudgel out of his hand at the first blow but as in that case he would have been obliged in honour to give immediate quarter he resolved to discipline his antagonist without endeavouring to disable him until he should be heartily satisfied with the vengeance he had taken with this view be returned the salute and raised such a clatter about the squires pate that one who had heard without seeing the application would have taken the sound for that of a saltbox in the hand of a dexterous merryandrew belonging to one of the booths at bartholomewfair neither was this salutation confined to his head his shoulders arms thighs ankles and ribs were visited with amazing rapidity while tom pipes sounded the charge through his fist peregrine tired with his exercise which had almost bereft his enemy of sensation at last struck the decisive blow in consequence of which the squires weapon flew out of his grasp and he allowed our hero to be the better man satisfied with this acknowledgment the victor walked upstairs with such elevation of spirits and insolence of mien that nobody chose to intimate the resolution which had been taken in his absence there having amused himself for some time in beholding the countrydances he retreated to his lodging where he indulged himself all night in the contemplation of his own success next day in the forenoon he went to visit his partner and the gentleman at whose house she lived having been informed of his family and condition received him with great courtesy as the acquaintance of his cousin gauntlet and invited him to dinner that same day emilia was remarkably well pleased when she understood the issue of his adventure which began to make some noise in town even though it deprived her of a wealthy admirer the squire having consulted an attorney about the nature of the dispute in hopes of being able to prosecute peregrine for an assault found little encouragement to go to law he therefore resolved to pocket the insult and injury he had undergone and to discontinue his addresses to her who was the cause of both our lover being told by his mistress that she proposed to stay a fortnight longer in windsor he determined to enjoy her company all that time and then to give her a convoy to the house of her mother whom he longed to see in consequence of this plan he every day contrived some fresh party of pleasure for the ladies to whom he had by this time free access and entangled himself so much in the snares of love that he seemed quite enchanted by emilias charms which were now indeed almost irresistible while he thus heedlessly roved in the flowery paths of pleasure his governor at oxford alarmed at the unusual duration of his absence went to the young gentlemen who had accompanied him in his excursion and very earnestly entreated them to tell him what they knew concerning his pupil they accordingly gave him an account of the reencounter that happened between peregrine and miss emily gauntlet in the castle and mentioned circumstances sufficient to convince him that his charge was very dangerously engaged far from having an authority over peregrine mr jolter durst not even disoblige him therefore instead of writing to the commodore he took horse immediately and that same night reached windsor where he found his stray sheep very much surprised at his unexpected arrival the governor desiring to have some serious conversation with him they shut themselves up in an apartment when jolter with great solemnity communicated the cause of his journey which was no other than his concern for his pupils welfare and very gravely undertook to prove by mathematical demonstration that this intrigue if further pursued would tend to the young gentlemans ruin and disgrace this singular proposition raised the curiosity of peregrine who promised to yield all manner of attention and desired him to begin without further preamble the governor encouraged by this appearance of candour expressed his satisfaction in finding him so open to conviction and told him he would proceed upon geometrical principles then hemming thrice observed that no mathematical inquiries could be carried on except upon certain data or concessions of truth that were selfevident and therefore he must have his assent to a few axioms which he was sure mr pickle would see no reason to dispute in the first place then said he you will grant i hope that youth and discretion are with respect to each other as two parallel lines which though infinitely produced remain still equidistant and will never coincide then you must allow that passion acts upon the human mind in a ratio compounded of the acuteness of sense and constitutional heat and thirdly you will not deny that the angle of remorse is equal to that of precipitation these postulata being admitted added he taking pen ink and paper and drawing a parallelogram let youth be represented by the right line a b and discretion by another right line c d parallel to the former complete the parallelogram a b c d and let the point of intersection b represent perdition let passion represented under the letter c have a motion in the direction c a at the same time let another motion be communicated to it in the direction c d it will proceed in the diagonal c b and describe it in the same time that it would have described the side c a by the first motion or the side c d by the second to understand the demonstration of this corollary we must premise this obvious principle that when a body is acted upon by a motion of power parallel to a right line given in position this power or motion has no effect to cause the body to approach towards that line or recede from it but to move in a line parallel to a right line only as appears from the second law of motion therefore c a being parallel to d b his pupil having listened to him thus far could contain himself no longer but interrupted the investigation with a loud laugh and told him that his postulata put him in mind of a certain learned and ingenious gentleman who undertook to disprove the existence of natural evil and asked no other datum on which to found his demonstration but an acknowledgment that everything that is is right you may therefore said he in a peremptory tone spare yourself the trouble of torturing your invention for after all i am pretty certain that i shall want capacity to comprehend the discussion of your lemma and consequently be obliged to all the pangs of an ingenuous mind that i refuse my assent to your deduction mr jolter was disconcerted at this declaration and so much offended at peregrines disrespect that he could not help expressing his displeasure by telling him flatly that he was too violent and headstrong to be reclaimed by reason and gentle means that he the tutor must be obliged in the discharge of his duty and conscience to inform the commodore of his pupils imprudence that if the laws of this realm were effectual they would take cognizance of the gipsy who had led him astray and observed by way of contrast that if such a preposterous intrigue had happened in france she would have been clapped up in a convent two years ago our lovers eyes kindled with indignation when he heard his mistress treated with such irreverence he could scarce refrain from inflicting manual chastisement on the blasphemer whom he reproached in his wrath as an arrogant pedant without either delicacy or sense and cautioned him against rising any such impertinent freedoms with his affairs for the future on pain of incurring more severe effects of his resentment mr jolter who entertained very high notions of that veneration to which he thought himself entitled by his character and qualifications had not borne without repining his want of influence and authority over his pupil against whom he cherished a particular grudge ever since the adventure of the painted eye and therefore on this occasion his politic forbearance had been overcome by the accumulated motives of his disgust indeed he would have resigned his charge with disdain had not he been encouraged to persevere by the hopes of a good living which trunnion had in his gift or known how to dispose of himself for the present to better advantage chapter xxv he receives a letter from his aunt breaks with the commodore and disobliges the lieutenant who nevertheless undertakes his cause meanwhile he quitted the youth in high dudgeon and that same evening despatched a letter for mrs trunnion which was dictated by the first transports of his passion and of course replete with severe animadversions on the misconduct of his pupil in consequence of this complaint it was not long before peregrine received an epistle from his aunt wherein she commemorated all the circumstances of the commodores benevolence towards him when he was helpless and forlorn deserted and abandoned by his own parents upbraided him for his misbehaviour and neglect of his tutors advice and insisted upon his breaking off an intercourse with that girl who had seduced his youth as he valued the continuance of her affection and her husbands regard as our lovers own ideas of generosity were extremely refined he was shocked at the indelicate insinuations of mrs trunnion and felt all the pangs of an ingenuous mind that labours under obligations to a person whom it contemns far from obeying her injunction or humbling himself by a submissive answer to her reprehension his resentment buoyed him up above every selfish consideration he resolved to attach himself to emilia if possible more than ever and although he was tempted to punish the officiousness of jolter by recriminating upon his life and conversation he generously withstood the impulse of his passion because he knew that his governor had no other dependence than the good opinion of the commodore he could not however digest in silence the severe expostulations of his aunt to which he replied by the following letter addressed to her husband sir though my temper could never stoop to offer nor i believe your disposition deign to receive that gross incense which the illiberal only expect and none but the baseminded condescend to pay my sentiments have always done justice to your generosity and my intention scrupulously adhered to the dictates of my duty conscious of this integrity of heart i cannot but severely feel your ladys unkind i will not call it ungenerous recapitulation of the favours i have received and as i take it for granted that you knew and approved of her letter i must beg leave to assure you that far from being swayed by menaces and reproach i am determined to embrace the most abject extremity of fortune rather than submit to such dishonourable compulsion when i am treated in a more delicate and respectful manner i hope i shall behave as becomes sir your obliged p pickle the commodore who did not understand those nice distinctions of behaviour and dreaded the consequence of peregrines amour against which he was strangely prepossessed seemed exasperated at the insolence and obstinacy of this adopted son to whose epistle he wrote the following answer which was transmitted by the hands of hatchway who had orders to bring the delinquent along with him to the garrison hark ye child you need not bring your fine speeches to bear upon me you only expend your ammunition to no purpose your aunt told you nothing but truth for it is always fair and honest to be aboveboard dye see i am informed as how you are in chase of a painted galley which will decoy you upon the flats of destruction unless you keep a better lookout and a surer reckoning than you have hitherto done and i have sent jack hatchway to see how the land lies and warn you of your danger if so be as you will put about ship and let him steer you into this harbour you shall meet with a safe berth and friendly reception but if you refuse to alter your course you cannot expect any farther assistance from yours as you behave hawser trunnion peregrine was equally piqued and disconcerted at the receipt of this letter which was quite different from what he had expected and declared in a resolute tone to the lieutenant who brought it that he might return as soon as he pleased for he was determined to consult his own inclination and remain for some time longer where he was hatchway endeavoured to persuade him by all the arguments which his sagacity and friendship could supply to show a little more deference for the old man who was by this time rendered fretful and peevish by the gout which now hindered him from enjoying himself as usual who might in his passion take some step very much to the detriment of the young gentleman whom he had hitherto considered as his own son among other remonstrances jack observed that mayhap peregrine had got under emilias hatches and did not choose to set her adrift and that if that was the case he himself would take charge of the vessel and see her cargo safely delivered for he had a respect for the young woman and his needle pointed towards matrimony and as in all probability she could not be much the worse for the wear he would make shift to scud through life with her under an easy sail our lover was deaf to all his admonitions and having thanked him for this last instance of his complaisance repeated his resolution of adhering to his first purpose hatchway having profited so little by mild exhortations assumed a more peremptory aspect and plainly told him that he neither could nor would go home without him so he had best make immediate preparation for the voyage peregrine made no other reply to this declaration than by a contemptuous smile and rose from his seat in order to retire upon which the lieutenant started up and posting himself by the door protested with some menacing gestures that he would not suffer him to run ahead neither the other incensed at his presumption in attempting to detain him by force tripped up his wooden leg and laid him on his back in a moment then walked deliberately towards the park in order to indulge his reflection which at that time teemed with disagreeable thoughts he had not proceeded two hundred steps when he heard something blowing and stamping behind him and looking back perceived the lieutenant at his heels with rage and indignation in his countenance this exasperated seaman impatient of the affront he had received and forgetting all the circumstances of their former intimacy advanced with great eagerness to his old friend saying look ye brother youre a saucy boy and if you was at sea i would have your backside brought to the davit for your disobedience but as we are on shore you and i must crack a pistol at one another here is a brace you shall take which you please peregrine upon recollection was sorry for having been laid under the necessity of disobliging honest jack and very frankly asked his pardon for what he had done but this condescension was misinterpreted by the other who refused any other satisfaction but that which an officer ought to claim and with some irreverent expressions asked if perry was afraid of his bacon the youth inflamed at this unjust insinuation darted a ferocious look at the challenger told him he had paid but too much regard to his infirmities and bid him walk forward to the park where he would soon convince him of his error if he thought his concession proceeded from fear about this time they were overtaken by pipes who having heard the lieutenants fall and seen him pocket his pistols suspected there was a quarrel in the case and followed him with a view of protecting his master peregrine seeing him arrive and guessing his intention assumed an air of serenity and pretending that he had left his handkerchief at the inn ordered his man to go thither and fetch it to him in the park where he would find them at his return this command was twice repeated before tom would take any other notice of the message except by shaking his head but being urged with many threats and curses to obedience he gave them to understand that he knew their drift too well to trust them by themselves as for you lieutenant hatchway said he i have been your shipmate and know you to be a sailor thats enough and as for master i know him to be as good a man as ever stept betwixt stem and stern whereby if you have anything to say to him i am your man as the saying is heres my sapling and i dont value your crackers of a ropes end this oration the longest that ever pipes was known to make he concluded with a flourish of his cudgel and enforced with such determined refusals to leave them that they found it impossible to bring the cause to mortal arbitrement at that time and strolled about the park in profound silence during which hatchways indignation subsiding he all of a sudden thrust out his hand as an advance to reconciliation which being cordially shaken by peregrine a general pacification ensued and was followed by a consultation about the means of extricating the youth from his present perplexity had his disposition been like that of most other young men it would have been no difficult task to overcome his difficulties but such was the obstinacy of his pride that he deemed himself bound in honour to resent the letters he had received and instead of submitting to the pleasure of the commodore expected an acknowledgment from him without which he would listen to no terms of accommodation had i been his own son said he i should have borne his reproof and sued for forgiveness but knowing myself to be on the footing of an orphan who depends entirely upon his benevolence i am jealous of everything that can be construed into disrespect and insist upon being treated with the most punctual regard i shall now make application to my father who is obliged to provide for me by the ties of nature as well as the laws of the land and if he shall refuse to do me justice i can never want employment while men are required for his majestys service the lieutenant alarmed at this intimation begged he would take no new step until he should hear from him and that very evening set out for the garrison where he gave trunnion an account of the miscarriage of his negotiation told him how highly peregrine was offended at the letter communicated the young gentlemans sentiments and resolution and finally assured him that unless he should think proper to ask pardon for the offence he had committed he would in all appearance never more behold the face of his godson the old commodore was utterly confounded at this piece of intelligence he had expected all the humility of obedience and contrition from the young man and instead of that received nothing but the most indignant opposition and even found himself in the circumstances of an offender obliged to make atonement or forfeit all correspondence with his favourite these insolent conditions at first threw him into an agony of wrath and he vented execrations with such rapidity that he left himself no time to breathe and had almost been suffocated with his choler he inveighed bitterly against the ingratitude of peregrine whom he mentioned with many opprobrious epithets and swore that he ought to be keelhauled for his presumption but when he began to reflect more coolly upon the spirit of the young gentleman which had already manifested itself on many occasions and listened to the suggestions of hatchway whom he had always considered as an oracle in his way his resentment abated and he determined to take perry into favour again this placability being not a little facilitated by jacks narrative of our heros intrepid behaviour at the assembly as well as the contest with him in the park but still this plaguy amour occurred like a bugbear to his imagination for he held it as an infallible maxim that woman was an eternal source of misery to man indeed this apophthegm he seldom repeated since his marriage except in the company of a very few intimates to whose secrecy and discretion he could trust finding jack himself at a nonplus in the affair of emilia he consulted mrs trunnion who was equally surprised and offended when she understood that her letter did not produce the desired effect and after having imputed the youths obstinacy to his uncles unseasonable indulgence had recourse to the advice of the parson who still with an eye to his friends advantage counselled them to send the young gentleman on his travels in the course of which he would in all probability forget the amusements of his greener years the proposal was judicious and immediately approved when trunnion going into his closet after divers efforts produced the following billet with which jack departed for windsor that same afternoon my good lad if i gave offence in my last letter im sorry fort dye see i thought it was the likeliest way to bring you up but in time to come you shall have a larger swing of cable when you can spare time i should be glad if you will make a short trip and see your aunt and him who is your loving godfather and humble servant hawser trunnion ps if you want money you may draw upon me payable at sight chapter xxvi he becomes melancholy and despondent is favoured with the condescending letter from his uncle reconciles himself to his governor and sets out with emilia and her friend for mrs gauntlets house peregrine fortified as he was with pride and indignation did not fail to feel the smarting suggestions of his present situation after having lived so long in an affluent and imperious manner he could ill brook the thoughts of submitting to the mortifying exigencies of life all the gaudy schemes of pomp and pleasure which his luxuriant imagination had formed began to dissolve a train of melancholy ideas took possession of his thoughts and the prospect of losing emilia was not the least part of his affliction though he endeavoured to suppress the chagrin that preyed upon his heart he could not conceal the disturbance of his mind from the penetration of that amiable young lady who sympathized with him in her heart though she could not give her tongue the liberty of asking the cause of his disorder for notwithstanding all the ardour of his addresses he never could obtain from her the declaration of a mutual flame because though he had hitherto treated her with the utmost reverence of respect he had never once mentioned the final aim of his passion however honourable she supposed it to be she had discernment enough to foresee that vanity or interest cooperating with the levity of youth might one day deprive her of her lover and she was too proud to give him any handle of exulting at her expense although he was received by her with the most distinguished civility and even an intimacy of friendship all his solicitations could never extort from her an acknowledgment of love on the contrary being of a gay disposition she sometimes coquetted with other admirers that his attention thus whetted might never abate and that he might see she had other resources in case he should flag in his affection this being the prudential plan on which she acted it cannot be supposed that she would condescend to inquire into the state of his thoughts when she saw him thus affected but she nevertheless imposed that task on her cousin and confidant who as they walked together in the park observed that he seemed to be out of humour when this is the case such a question generally increases the disease at least it had that effect upon peregrine who replied somewhat peevishly i assure you madam you never were more mistaken in your observations i think so too said emilia for i never saw mr pickle in higher spirits this ironical encomium completed his confusion he affected to smile but it was a smile of anguish and in his heart he cursed the vivacity of both he could not for his soul recollect himself so as to utter one connected sentence and the suspicion that they observed every circumstance of his behaviour threw such a damp on his spirits that he was quite overwhelmed with shame and resentment when sophy casting her eyes towards the gate said yonder is your servant mr pickle with another man who seems to have a wooden leg peregrine started at this intelligence and immediately underwent sundry changes of complexion knowing that his fate in a great measure depended upon the information he would receive from his friend hatchway advancing to the company after a brace of sea bows to the ladies took the youth aside and put the commodores letter into his hand which threw him into such an agitation that he could scarce pronounce ladies will you give me leave when in consequence of their permission he attempted to open the billet he fumbled with such manifest disorder that his mistress who watched his motions began to think that there was something very interesting in the message and so much was she affected with his concern that she was fain to turn her head another way and wipe the tears from her lovely eyes meanwhile peregrine no sooner read the first sentence than his countenance which before was overcast with a deep gloom began to be lighted up and every feature unbending by degrees he recovered his serenity having perused the letter his eyes sparkling with joy and gratitude he hugged the lieutenant in his arms and presented him to the ladies as one of his best friends jack met with a most gracious reception and shook emilia by the hand telling her with the familiar appellation of old acquaintance that he did not care how soon he was master of such another cleangoing frigate as herself the whole company partook of this favourable change that evidently appeared in our lovers recollection and enlivened his conversation with such an uncommon flow of sprightliness and good humour as even made an impression on the iron countenance of pipes himself who actually smiled with satisfaction as he walked behind them the evening being pretty far advanced they directed their course homeward and while the valet attended hatchway to the inn peregrine escorted the ladies to their lodgings where he owned the justness of sophys remark in saying he vas out of humour and told them he had been extremely chagrined at a difference which had happened between him and his uncle to whom by the letter which they had seen him receive he now found himself happily reconciled having received their congratulations and declined staying to sup with them on account of the longing desire he had to converse with his friend jack he took his leave and repaired to the inn where hatchway informed him of everything that had happened in the garrison upon his presentations far from being disgusted he was perfectly well pleased with the prospect of going abroad which flattered his vanity and ambition gratified his thirst after knowledge and indulged that turn for observation for which he had been remarkable from his most tender years neither did he believe a short absence would tend to the prejudice of his love but on the contrary enhance the value of his heart because he should return better accomplished consequently a more welcome offering to his mistress elevated with these sentiments his heart dilated with joy and the sluices of his natural benevolence being opened by this happy turn of his affairs he sent his compliment to mr jolter to whom he had not spoken during a whole week and desired he would favour mr hatchway and him with his company at supper the governor was not weak enough to decline this invitation in consequence of which he forthwith appeared and was cordially welcomed by the relenting pupil who expressed his sorrow for the misunderstanding which had prevailed between them and assured him that for the future he would avoid giving him any just cause of complaint jolter who did not want affections was melted by this acknowledgment which he could not have expected and earnestly protested that his chief study had always been and ever should be to promote mr pickles interest and happiness the best part of the night being spent in the circulation of a cheerful glass the company broke up and next morning peregrine went out with a view of making his mistress acquainted with his uncles intention of sending him out of the kingdom for his improvement and of saying everything which he thought necessary for the interest of his love he found her at breakfast with her cousin and as he was very full of the subject of his visit had scarce fixed himself in his seat when he brought it upon the carpet by asking with a smile if the ladies had any commands for paris emilia at this question began to stare and her confidant desired to know who was going thither he no sooner gave to understand that he himself intended in a short time to visit that capital than his mistress with great precipitation wished him a good journey and affected to talk with indifference the pleasures he would enjoy in france but when he seriously assured sophy who asked if he was in earnest and his uncle actually insisted upon his making a short tour the tears gushed in poor emilias eyes and she was at great pains to conceal her concern by observing that the tea was so scalding hot as to make her eyes water this pretext was too thin to impose upon her lover or even deceive the observation of her friend sophy who after breakfast took an opportunity of quitting the room thus left by themselves peregrine imparted to her what he had learnt of the commodores intention without however mentioning a syllable of his being offended at their correspondence and accompanied his information with such fervent vows of eternal constancy and solemn promises of a speedy return that emilys heart which had been invaded by a suspicion that this scheme of travelling was an effect of her lovers inconstancy began to be more at ease and she could not help signifying her approbation of his design this affair being amicably compromised he asked how soon she proposed to set out for her mothers house and understanding that her departure was fixed for next day but one and that her cousin sophy intended to accompany her in her fathers chariot he repeated his intention of attending her in the mean time he dismissed the governor and the lieutenant to the garrison with his compliments to his aunt and the commodore and a faithful promise of his being with them in six days at farthest these previous measures being taken he attended by pipes set out with the ladies and they had also a convoy for twelve miles from sophys father who at parting recommended them piously to the care of peregrine with whom by this time he was perfectly well acquainted chapter xxvii they meet with a dreadful alarm on the road arrive at their journeys end peregrine is introduced to emilys brother these two young gentlemen misunderstand each other pickle departs for the garrison as they travelled at an easy rate they had performed something more than one half of their journey when they were benighted near an inn at which they resolved to lodge the accommodation was very good they supped together with great mirth and enjoyment and it was not till after he had been warned by the yawns of the ladies that he conducted them to their apartment where wishing them good night he retired to his own and went to rest the house was crowded with countrypeople who had been at a neighbouring fair and now regaled themselves with ale and tobacco in the yard so that their consideration which at any time was but slender being now overwhelmed by this debauch they staggered into their respective kennels and left a lighted candle sticking to one of the wooden pillars that supported the gallery the flame in a little time laid hold on the wood which was as dry as tinder and the whole gallery was on fire when peregrine suddenly waked and found himself almost suffocated he sprang up in an instant slipped on his breeches and throwing open the door of his chamber saw the whole entry in a blaze heavens what were the emotions of his soul when he beheld the volumes of flame and smoke rolling towards the room where his dear emilia lay regardless of his own danger he darted himself through the thickest of the gloom when knocking hard and calling at the same time to the ladies with the most anxious entreaty to be admitted the door was opened by emilia in her shift who asked with the utmost trepidation what was the matter he made no reply but snatching her up in his arms like another aeneas bore her through the flames to a place of safety where leaving her before she could recollect herself or pronounce one word but alas my cousin sophy he flew back to the rescue of that young lady and found her already delivered by pipes who having been alarmed by the smell of fire had got up rushed immediately to the chamber where he knew these companions lodged and emily being saved by her lover brought off miss sophy with the loss of his own shockhead of hair which was singed off in his retreat by this time the whole inn was alarmed every lodger as well as servant exerted himself in order to stop the progress of this calamity and there being a wellreplenished horsepond in the yard in less than an hour the fire was totally extinguished without having done any other damage than that of consuming about two yards of the wooden gallery all this time our young gentleman closely attended his fair charge each of whom had swooned with apprehension but as their constitutions were good and their spirits not easily dissipated when upon reflection they found themselves and their company safe and that the flames were happily quenched the tumult of their fears subsided they put on their clothes recovered their good humour and began to rally each other on the trim in which they had been secured sophy observed that now mr pickle had an indisputable claim to her cousins affection and therefore she ought to lay aside all affected reserve for the future and frankly avow the sentiments of her heart emily retorted the argument putting her in mind that by the same claim mr pipes was entitled to the like return from her her friend admitted the force of the conclusion provided she could not find means of satisfying his deliverer in another shape and turning to the valet who happened to be present asked if his heart was not otherwise engaged tom who did not conceive the meaning of the question stood silent according to custom and the interrogation being repeated answered with a grin heartwhole as a biscuit ill assure you mistress what said emilia have you never been in love thomas yes forsooth replied the valet without hesitation sometimes of a morning peregrine could not help laughing and his mistress looked a little disconcerted at this blunt repartee while sophy slipping a purse into his hand told him there was something to purchase a periwig tom having consulted his masters eyes refused the present saying no thank ye as much as if i did and though she insisted upon his putting it in his pocket as a small testimony of her gratitude he could not be prevailed upon to avail himself of her generosity but following her to the other end of the room thrust it into her sleeve without ceremony exclaiming ill be d d to hell if i do peregrine having checked him for his boorish behaviour sent him out of the room and begged that miss sophy would not endeavour to debauch the morals of his servant who rough and uncultivated as he was had sense enough to perceive that he had no pretension to any such acknowledgment but she argued with great vehemence that she should never be able to make acknowledgment adequate to the service he had done her and that she should never be perfectly easy in her own mind until she found some opportunity of manifesting the sense she had of the obligation i do not pretend said she to reward mr pipes but i shall be absolutely unhappy unless i am allowed to give him some token of my regard peregrine thus earnestly solicited desired that since she was bent upon displaying her generosity she would not bestow upon him any pecuniary gratification but honour him with some trinket as a mark of consideration because he himself had such a particular value for the fellow on account of his attachment and fidelity that be should be sorry to see him treated on the footing of a common mercenary domestic there was not one jewel in the possession of this grateful young lady that she would not have gladly given as a recompense or badge of distinction to her rescuer but his master pitched upon a seal ring of no great value that hung at her watch and pipes being called in had permission to accept that testimony of miss sophys favour tom received it accordingly with sundry scrapes and having kissed it with great devotion put it on his little finger and strutted off extremely proud of his acquisition emilia with a most enchanting sweetness of aspect told her lover that he had instructed her how to behave towards him and taking a diamond ring from her finger desired he would wear it for her sake he received the pledge as became him and presented another in exchange which she at first refused alleging that it would destroy the intent of her acknowledgment but peregrine assured her he had accepted her jewel not as a proof of her gratitude but as the mark of her love and that if she refused a mutual token he should look upon himself as the object of her disdain her eyes kindled and her cheeks glowed with resentment at this impudent intimation which she considered as an unseasonable insult and the young gentleman perceiving her emotion stood corrected for his temerity and asked pardon for the liberty of his remonstrance which he hoped she would ascribe to the prevalence of that principle alone which he had always taken pride in avowing sophy seeing him disconcerted interposed in his behalf and chid her cousin for having practised such unnecessary affectation upon which emilia softened into compliance held out her finger as a signal of her condescension peregrine put on the ring with great eagerness and mumbled her soft white hand in an ecstasy which would not allow him to confine his embraces to that limb but urged him to seize her by the waist and snatch a delicious kiss from her lovepouting lips nor would he leave her a butt to the ridicule of sophy on whose mouth he instantly committed a rape of the same nature so that the two friends countenanced by each other reprehended him with such gentleness of rebuke that he was almost tempted to repeat the offence the morning being now lighted up and the servants of the inn on foot he ordered some chocolate for breakfast and at the desire of the ladies sent pipes to see the horses fed and the chariot prepared while he went to the bar and discharged the bill these measures being taken they set out about five oclock and having refreshed themselves and their cattle at another inn on the road proceeded in the afternoon without meeting with any other accident they safely arrived at the place of their destination where mrs gauntlet expressed her joy at seeing her old friend mr pickle whom however she kindly reproached for the long discontinuance of his regard without explaining the cause of that interruption he protested that his love and esteem had never been discontinued and that for the future he should omit no occasion of testifying how much he had her friendship at heart she then made him acquainted with her son who at that time was in the house being excused from his duty by furlough this young man whose name was godfrey was about the age of twenty of a middling size vigorous make remarkably wellshaped and the scars of the smallpox of which he bore a good number added a peculiar manliness to the air of his countenance his capacity was good and his disposition naturally frank and easy but he had been a soldier from his infancy and his education was altogether in the military style he looked upon taste and letters as mere pedantry beneath the consideration of a gentleman and every civil station of life as mean when compared with the profession of arms he had made great progress in the gymnastic sciences of dancing fencing and riding played perfectly well on the german flute and above all things valued himself upon a scrupulous observance of all the points of honour had peregrine and he considered themselves upon equal footing in all probability they would have immediately entered into a league of intimacy and friendship but this sufficient soldier looked upon his sisters admirer as a young student raw from the university and utterly ignorant of mankind while squire pickle beheld godfrey in the light of a needy volunteer greatly inferior to himself in fortune as well as every other accomplishment this mutual misunderstanding could not fail of animosities the very next day after peregrines arrival some sharp repartees passed between them in presence of the ladies before whom each endeavoured to assert his own superiority in these contests our hero never failed of obtaining the victory because his genius was more acute and his talents better cultivated than those of his antagonist who therefore took umbrage at his success became jealous of his reputation and began to treat him with marks of scorn and disrespect his sister saw and dreading the consequence of his ferocity not only took him to task in private for his impolite behaviour but also entreated her lover to make allowances for the roughness of her brothers education he kindly assured her that whatever pains it might cost him to vanquish his own impetuous temper he would for her sake endure all the mortifications to which her brothers arrogance might expose him and after having stayed with her two days and enjoyed several private interviews during which he acted the part of a most passionate lover he took his leave of mrs gauntlet overnight and told the young ladies be would call early next morning to bid them farewell he did not neglect this piece of duty and found the two friends and breakfast already prepared in the parlour all three being extremely affected with the thoughts of parting a most pathetic silence for some time prevailed till peregrine put an end to it by lamenting his fate in being obliged to exile himself so long from the dear object of his most interesting wish he begged with the most earnest supplications that she would now in consideration of the cruel absence he must suffer give him the consolation which she had hitherto refused namely that of knowing he possessed a place within her heart the confidante seconded his request representing that it was now no time to disguise her sentiments when her lover was about to leave the kingdom and might be in danger of contracting other connections unless he was confirmed in his constancy by knowing how far he could depend upon her love and in short she was plied with such irresistible importunities that she answered in the utmost confusion though i have avoided literal acknowledgments methinks the circumstances of my behaviour might have convinced mr pickle that i do not regard him as a common acquaintance my charming emily cried the impatient lover throwing himself at her feet why will you deal out my happiness in such scanty portions why will you thus mince the declaration which would overwhelm me with pleasure and cheer my lonely reflection while i sigh amid the solitude of separation his fair mistress melted by this image replied with the tears gushing from her eyes im afraid i shall feel that separation more severely than you imagine transported at this flattering confession he pressed her to his breast and while her head reclined upon his neck mingled his tears with hers in great abundance breathing the most tender vows of eternal fidelity the gentle heart of sophy could not bear this scene unmoved she wept with sympathy and encouraged the lovers to resign themselves to the will of fate and support their spirits with the hope of meeting again on happier terms finally after mutual promises exhortations and endearments peregrine took his leave his heart being so full that he could scarce pronounce the word adieu and mounting his horse at the door set out with pipes for the garrison chapter xxviii peregrine is overtaken by mr gauntlet with whom he fights a duel and contracts an intimate friendship he arrives at the garrison and finds his mother as implacable as ever he is insulted by his brother gam whose preceptor he disciplines with a horsewhip in order to expel the melancholy images that took possession of his fancy at parting from his mistress he called in the flattering ideas of those pleasures he expected to enjoy in france and before he had rode ten miles his imagination was effectually amused while he thus prosecuted his travels by anticipation and indulged himself in all the insolence of hope at the turning of a lane he was all of a sudden overtaken by emilias brother on horseback who told him he was riding the same way and should be glad of his company this young gentleman whether prompted by personal pique or actuated with zeal for the honour of his family had followed our hero with the view of obliging him to explain the nature of his attachment to his sister peregrine returned his compliment with such disdainful civility as gave him room to believe that he suspected his errand and therefore without further preamble he declared his business in these words mr pickle you have carried on a correspondence with my sister for some time and i should be glad to know the nature of it to this question our lover replied sir i should be glad to know what title you have to demand that satisfaction sir answered the other i demand it in the capacity of a brother jealous of his own honour as well as of his sisters reputation and if your intentions are honourable you will not refuse it sir said peregrine i am not at present disposed to appeal to your opinion for the rectitude of my intentions and i think you assume a little too much importance in pretending to judge my conduct sir replied the soldier i pretend to judge the conduct of every man who interferes with my concerns and even to chastise him if i think he acts amiss chastise cried the youth with indignation in his looks sure you dare not apply that term to me you are mistaken said godfrey i dare do anything that becomes the character of a gentleman gentleman god wot replied the other looking contemptuously at his equipage which was none of the most superb a very pretty gentleman truly the soldiers wrath was inflamed by this ironical repetition the contempt of which his conscious poverty made him feel and he called his antagonist presumptuous boy insolent upstart and with other epithets which perry retorted with great bitterness a formal challenge having passed between them they alighted at the first inn and walked into the next field in order to decide their quarrel by the sword having pitched upon the spot helped to pull off each others boots and laid aside their coats and waistcoats mr gauntlet told his opponent that he himself was looked upon in the army as an expert swordsman and that if mr pickle had not made that science his particular study they should be upon a more equal footing in using pistols peregrine was too much incensed to thank him for his plain dealing and too confident of his own skill to relish the others proposal which he accordingly rejected then drawing his sword he observed that were he to treat mr gauntlet according to his deserts he would order his man to punish his audacity with a horsewhip exasperated at this expression which he considered as an indelible affront he made no reply but attacked his adversary with equal ferocity and address the youth parried his first and second thrust but received the third in the outside of his swordarm though the wound was superficial he was transported with rage at sight of his own blood and returned the assault with such fury and precipitation that gauntlet loath to take advantage of his unguarded heat stood upon the defensive in the second lounge peregrines weapon entering a kind of network in the shell of godfreys sword the blade snapped in two and left him at the mercy of the soldier who far from making an insolent use of the victory he had gained put up his toledo with great deliberation like a man who had been used to that kind of reencounters and observed that such a blade as peregrines was not to be trusted with a mans life then advising the owner to treat a gentleman in distress with more respect for the future he slipped on his boots and with sullen dignity of demeanour stalked back to the inn though pickle was extremely mortified at his miscarriage in this adventure he was also struck with the behaviour of his antagonist which affected him the more as he understood that godfreys fierte had proceeded from the jealous sensibility of a gentleman declined into the vale of misfortune gauntlets valour and moderation induced him to put a favourable construction on all those circumstances of that young soldiers conduct which before had given him disgust though in any other case he would have industriously avoided the least appearance of submission he followed his conqueror to the inn with a view of thanking him for his generous forbearance and of soliciting his friendship and correspondence godfrey had his foot in the stirrup to mount when peregrine coming up to him desired he would defer his departure for a quarter of an hour and favour him with a little private conversation the soldier who mistook the meaning of the request immediately quitted his horse and followed pickle into a chamber where he expected to find a brace of pistols loaded on the table but he was very agreeably deceived when our hero in the most respectful terms acknowledged his noble deportment in the field owned that till then he had misunderstood his character and begged that he would honour him with his intimacy and correspondence gauntlet who had seen undoubted proofs of peregrines courage which had considerably raised him in his esteem and had sense enough to perceive that this concession was not owing to any sordid or sinister motive embraced his offer with demonstrations of infinite satisfaction when he understood the terms on which mr pickle was with his sister he proffered his service in his turn either as agent mediator or confidant nay to give this new friend a convincing proof of his sincerity he disclosed to him a passion which he had for some time entertained for his cousin miss sophy though he durst not reveal his sentiments to her father lest he should be offended at his presumption and withdraw his protection from the family peregrines generous heart was wrung with anguish when he understood that this young gentleman who was the only son of a distinguished officer had carried arms for the space of five years without being able to obtain a subalterns commission though he always had behaved with remarkable regularity and spirit and acquired the friendship and esteem of all the officers under whom he had served he would at that time with the utmost pleasure have shared his finances with him but as he would not run the risk of offending the young soldiers delicacy of honour by a premature exertion of his liberality he resolved to insinuate himself into an intimacy with him before he would venture to take such freedoms and with that view pressed mr gauntlet to accompany him to the garrison where he did not doubt of having influence enough to make him a welcome guest godfrey thanked him very courteously for his invitation which he said he could not immediately accept but promised if he would favour him with a letter and fix the time at which he proposed to set out for france he would endeavour to visit him at the commodores habitation and from thence give him a convoy to dover this new treaty being settled and a dossil of lint with a snip of plaster applied to our adventurers wound he parted from the brother of his dear emilia to whom and his friend sophy he sent his kindest wishes and having lodged one night upon the road arrived next day in the afternoon at the garrison where he found all his friends in good health and overjoyed at his return the commodore who was by this time turned of seventy and altogether crippled by the gout seldom went abroad and as his conversation was not very entertaining had but little company within doors so that his spirits must have quite stagnated had not they been kept in motion by the conversation of hatchway and received at different times a wholesome fillip from the discipline of his spouse who by the force of pride religion and cognac had erected a most terrible tyranny in the house there was such a quick circulation of domestics in the family that every suit of livery had been worn by figures of all dimensions trunnion himself had long before this time yielded to the torrent of her arbitrary sway though not without divers obstinate efforts to maintain his liberty and now that he was disabled by his infirmities when he used to bear his empress singing the loud orthyan song among the servants below he would often in whispers communicate to the lieutenant hints of what he would do if so be as how he was not deprived of the use of his precious limbs hatchway was the only person whom the temper of mrs trunnion respected either because she dreaded his ridicule or looked upon his person with eyes of affection this being the situation of things in the garrison it is not to be doubted that the old gentleman highly enjoyed the presence of peregrine who found means to ingratiate himself so effectually with his aunt that while he remained at home she seemed to have exchanged the disposition of a tigress for that of a gentle kid but he found his own mother as implacable and his father as much henpecked as ever gamaliel who now very seldom enjoyed the conversation of his old friend the commodore had some time ago entered into an amicable society consisting of the barber apothecary attorney and exciseman of the parish among whom he used to spend the evening at tunleys and listen to their disputes upon philosophy and politics with great comfort and edification while his sovereign lady domineered at home as usual visited with pomp in the neighbourhood and employed her chief care in the education of her darling son gam who was now in the fifteenth year of his age and so remarkable for his perverse disposition that in spite of his mothers influence and authority he was not only hated but also despised both at home and abroad she had put him under the tuition of the curate who lived in the family and was obliged to attend him in all his exercises and excursions this governor was a lowbred fellow who had neither experience nor ingenuity but possessed a large fund of adulation and servile complaisance by which he had gained the good graces of mrs pickle and presided over all her deliberations in the same manner as his superior managed those of mrs trunnion he had one day rode out to take the air with his pupil who as i have already observed was odious to the poor people for having killed their dogs and broken their inclosures and on account of his hump distinguished by the title of my lord when in a narrow lane they chanced to meet peregrine on horseback the young squire no sooner perceived his elder brother for whom he had been instructed to entertain the most inveterate grudge than he resolved to insult him en passant and actually rode against him from gallop our hero guessing his aim fixed himself in his stirrups and by a dexterous management of the reins avoided the shock in such a manner as that their legs only should encounter by which means my lord was tilted out of his saddle and in a twinkling laid sprawling in the dirt the governor enraged at the disgrace of his charge advanced with great insolence and fury and struck at peregrine with his whip nothing could be more agreeable to our young gentleman than this assault which furnished him with an opportunity of chastising an officious wretch whose petulance and malice he had longed to punish he therefore spurring up his horse towards his antagonist overthrew him in the middle of a hedge before he had time to recollect himself from the confusion of the fall pickle alighted in a trice and exercised his horsewhip with such agility about the curates face and ears that he was fain to prostrate himself before his enraged conqueror and implore his forbearance in the most abject terms while peregrine was thus employed his brother gam had made shift to rise and attack him in the rear for which reason when the tutor was quelled the victor faced about snatched the weapon out of his hand and having broken it to pieces remounted his horse and rode off without deigning to honour him with any other notice the condition in which they returned produced infinite clamour against the conqueror who was represented as a ruffian who had lain in ambush to make away with his brother in whose defence the curate was said to have received those cruel stripes that hindered him from appearing for three whole weeks in the performance of his duty at church complaints were made to the commodore who having inquired into the circumstances of the affair approved of what his nephew had done adding with many oaths that provided peregrine had been out of the scrape he wished crookback had broken his neck in the fall chapter xxix he projects a plan of revenge which is executed against the curate our hero exasperated at the villainy of the curate in the treacherous misrepresentation he had made of this encounter determined to rise upon him a method of revenge which should be not only effectual but also unattended any bad consequence to himself for this purpose he and hatchway to whom he imparted his plan went to the alehouse one evening and called for an empty room knowing there was no other but that which they had chosen for the scene of action this apartment was a sort of a parlour that fronted the kitchen with a window towards the yard where after they had sat some time the lieutenant found means to amuse the landlord in discourse while peregrine stepping out into the yard by the talent of mimickry which he possessed in a surprising degree counterfeited a dialogue between the curate and tunleys wife this reaching the ears of the publican for whose hearing it was calculated inflamed his naturally jealous disposition to such a degree that he could not conceal his emotion but made a hundred efforts to quit the room while the lieutenant smoking his pipe with great gravity as if he neither heard what passed nor took notice of the landlords disorder detained him on the spot by a succession of questions which he could not refuse to answer though he stood sweating with agony all the time stretching his neck every instant towards the window through which the voices were conveyed scratching his head and exhibiting sundry other symptoms of impatience and agitation at length the supposed conversation came to such a pitch of amorous complaisance that the husband quite frantic with his imaginary disgrace rushed out of the door crying coming sir but as he was obliged to make a circuit round onehalf of the house peregrine had got in by the window before tunley arrived in the yard according to the feigned intelligence he had received he ran directly to the barn in expectation of making some very extraordinary discovery and having employed some minutes in rummaging the straw to no purpose returned in a state of distraction to the kitchen just as his wife chanced to enter at the other door the circumstance of her appearance confirmed him in the opinion that the deed was done as the disease of being henpecked was epidemic in the parish he durst not express the least hint of his uneasiness to her but resolved to take vengeance on the libidinous priest who he imagined had corrupted the chastity of his spouse the two confederates in order to be certified that their scheme had taken effect as well as to blow up the flame which they had kindled called for tunley in whose countenance they could easily discern his confusion peregrine desiring him to sit down and drink a glass with them began to interrogate him about his family and among other things asked him how long he had been married to that handsome wife this question which was put with an arch significance of look alarmed the publican who began to fear that pickle had overheard his dishonour and this suspicion was not at all removed when the lieutenant with a sly regard pronounced tunley warnt you noosed by the curate yes is was replied the landlord with an eagerness and perplexity of tone as if he thought the lieutenant knew that thereby hang a tale and hatchway supported the suspicion by nay as for that matter the curate may be a very sufficient man in his way this transition from his wife to the curate convinced him that his shame was known to his guests and in the transport of his indignation he pronounced with great emphasis a sufficient man odds heart i believe they are all wolves in sheeps clothing i wish to god i could see the day master when there shall not be a priest an exciseman or a customhouse officer in the kingdom as for that fellow of a curate if i do catch him it dont signify talking but by the lord gentlemen my service to you the associates being satisfied by these abrupt insinuations that they had so far succeeded in their aim waited with impatience two or three days in expectation of hearing that tunley had fallen upon some method of being revenged for this imaginary wrong but finding that either his invention was too shallow or his inclination too languid to gratify their desire of his own accord they determined to bring the affair to such a crisis that he should not be able to withstand the opportunity of executing his vengeance with this view they one evening hired a boy to run to mr pickles house and tell the curate that mrs tunley being taken suddenly ill her husband desired he would come immediately and pray with her they had taken possession of a room in the house and hatchway engaging the landlord in conversation peregrine in his return from the yard observed as if by accident that the parson was gone into the kitchen in order as he supposed to catechise tunleys wife the publican started at this intelligence and under pretence of serving another company in the next room went out to the barn where arming himself with a flail he repaired to a lane through which the curate was under a necessity of passing in his way home there he lay in ambush with fell intent and when the supposed author of his shame arrived greeted him in the dark with such a salutation as forced him to stagger backward three paces at least if the second application had taken effect in all probability that spot would have been the boundary of the parsons mortal peregrination but luckily for him his antagonist was not expert in the management of his weapon which by a twist of the thong that connected the legs instead of pitching upon the head of the astonished curate descended in an oblique direction on his own pate with such a swing that the skull actually rang like an apothecarys mortar and ten thousand lights seemed to dance before his eyes the curate recollecting himself during the respite he obtained from this accident and believing his aggressor to be some thief who lurked in that place for prey resolved to make a running fight until he should arrive within cry of his habitation with this design he raised up his cudgel for the defence of his head and betaking himself to his heels began to roar for help with the lungs of a stentor tunley throwing away the flail which he durst no longer trust with the execution of his revenge pursued the fugitive with all the speed he could exert and the other either unnerved by fear or stumbling over a stone was overtaken before he had run a hundred paces he no sooner felt the wind of the publicans fist that whistled round his ears than he fell flat upon the earth at full length and the cudgel flew from his unclasping hand when tunley springing like a tiger on his back rained such a shower of blows upon his carcase that he imagined himself under the discipline of ten pairs of fists at least yet the imaginary cuckold not satisfied with annoying the priest in this manner laid hold of one of his ears with his teeth and bit so unmercifully that the curate was found almost entranced with pain by two labourers at whose approach the assailant retreated unperceived the lieutenant had posted himself at the window in order to see the landlord at his first return and no sooner perceived him enter the yard than he called him into the apartment impatient to learn the effects of their stratagem tunley obeyed the summons and appeared before his guests in all the violence of rage disorder and fatigue his nostrils were dilated more than onehalf beyond their natural capacity his eyes rolled his teeth chattered he snored in breathing as if he had been oppressed by the nightmare and streams of sweat flowed down each side of his forehead peregrine affecting to start at the approach of such an uncouth figure asked if he had been with a spirit upon which he answered with great vehemence spirit no no master i have had a roll and tumble with the flesh a dog ill teach him to come a caterwauling about my doors guessing from this reply that his aim was accomplished and curious to know the particulars of the rencounter well then said the youth i hope you have prevailed against the flesh tunley yes yes answered the publican i have cooled his capissens as the saying is i have played such a tune about his ears that ill be bound he shant long for music this month a goatish manfaced rascal why hes a perfect parish bull as i hope to live hatchway observing that he seemed to have made a stout battle desired he would sit down and recover wind and after he had swallowed a brace of bumpers his vanity prompted him to expatiate upon his own exploit in such a manner that the confederates without seeming to know the curate was his antagonist became acquainted with every circumstance of the ambuscade tunley had scarce got the better of his agitation when his wife entering the room told them by way of news that some waggish body had sent mr sackbut the curate to pray with her this name inflamed the husbands choler anew and forgetting all his complaisance for his spouse he replied with a rancorous grin add rabbit him i doubt not but you found his admonitions deadly comfortable the landlady looking at her vassal with a sovereign aspect what crotchets said she have you got in your fools head i trow i know no business you have to sit here like a gentleman with your arms akimbo theres another company in the house to be served the submissive husband took the hint and without further expostulation sneaked out of the room next day it was reported that mr sackbut had been waylaid and almost murdered by robbers and an advertisement was pasted upon the churchdoor offering a reward to any person that should discover the assassin but he reaped no satisfaction from this expedient and was confined to his chamber a whole fortnight by the bruises he had received chapter xxx mr sackbut and his pupil conspire against peregrine who being apprised of their design by his sister takes measures for counterworking their scheme which is executed by mistake upon mr gauntlet this young soldier meets with a cordial reception from the commodore who generously decoys him into his own interest when he considered the circumstances of the ambuscade he could not persuade himself that he had been assaulted by a common thief because it was not to be supposed that a robber would have amused himself in pummeling rather than in rifling his prey he therefore ascribed his misfortune to the secret enmity of some person who had a design upon his life and upon mature deliberation fixed his suspicion upon peregrine who was the only man on earth from whom he thought he deserved such treatment he communicated his conjecture to his pupil who readily adopted his opinion and advised him strenuously to revenge the wrong by a like contrivance without seeking to make a narrower inquiry lest his enemy should be thereby put upon his guard this proposal being relished they in concert revolved the means of retorting the ambush with interest and actually laid such a villainous plan for attacking our hero in the dark that had it been executed according to their intention the young gentlemans scheme of travelling would have been effectually marred but their machinations were overheard by miss pickle who was now in the seventeenth year of her age and in spite of the prejudice of education entertained in secret a most sisterly affection for her brother perry though she had never spoken to him and was deterred by the precepts vigilance and menaces of her mother from attempting any means of meeting him in private she was not however insensible to his praise which was loudly sounded forth in the neighbourhood and never failed of going to church and every other place where she thought she might have an opportunity of seeing this amiable brother with these sentiments it cannot be supposed that she would hear the conspiracy without emotion she was shocked at the treacherous barbarity of gam and shuddered at the prospect of the danger to which peregrine would be exposed from their malice she durst not communicate this plot to her mother because she was afraid that ladys unaccountable aversion for her firstborn would hinder her from interposing in his behalf and consequently render her a sort of accomplice in the guilt of his assassins she therefore resolved to warn peregrine of the conspiracy on account of which she transmitted to him in an affectionate letter by means of a young gentleman in that neighbourhood who made his addresses to her at that time and who at her request offered his service to our hero in defeating the projects of his adversaries peregrine was startled when he read the particulars of their scheme which was no other than an intention to sally upon him when he should be altogether unprovided against such an attack cut off his ears and otherwise mutilate him in such a manner that he should have no cause to be vain of his person for the future incensed as he was against the brutal disposition of his own fathers son he could not help being moved at the integrity and tenderness of his sister of whose inclinations towards him he had been hitherto kept in ignorance he thanked the gentleman for his honourable dealing and expressed a desire of being better acquainted with his virtues told him that now he was cautioned he hoped there would be no necessity for giving him any further trouble and wrote by him a letter of acknowledgment to his sister for whom he expressed the utmost love and regard beseeching her to favour him with an interview before his departure that he might indulge his fraternal fondness and be blessed with the company and countenance of one at least belonging to his own family having imparted this discovery to his friend hatchway they came to a resolution of countermining the plan of their enemies as they did not choose to expose themselves to the insinuations of slander which would have exerted itself at their expense had they even in defending themselves employed any harsh means of retaliation they invented a method of disappointing and disgracing their foes and immediately set pipes at work to forward the preparations miss pickle having described the spot which the assassins had pitched upon for the scene of their vengeance our triumvirate intended to have placed a sentinel among the corn who should come and give them intelligence when the ambuscade was laid and in consequence of that information they would steal softly towards the place attended by three or four of the domestics and draw a large net over the conspirators who being entangled in the toil should be disarmed fettered heartily scourged and suspended between two trees in the snare as a spectacle to all passengers that should chance to travel that way the plan being thus digested and the commodore acquainted with the whole affair the spy was sent upon duty and everybody withindoors prepared to go forth upon the first notice one whole evening did they spend in the most impatient expectation but on the second the scout crept into the garrison and assured them that he had perceived three men skulking behind the hedge on the road that led to the publichouse from which peregrine and the lieutenant used every night to return about that hour upon this intelligence the confederates set out immediately with all their implements approaching the scene with as little noise as possible they heard the sound of blows and though the night was dark perceived a sort of tumultuous conflict on the very spot which the conspirators had possessed surprised at this occurrence the meaning of which he could not comprehend peregrine ordered his myrmidons to halt and reconnoitre and immediately his ears were saluted with an exclamation of you shant scape me rascal the voice being quite familiar to him he at once divined the cause of that confusion which they had observed and running up to the assistance of the exclaimer found a fellow on his knees begging his life of mr gauntlet who stood over him with a naked hanger in his hand pickle instantly made himself known to his friend who told him that having left his horse at tunleys he was in his way to the garrison set upon by three ruffians one of whom being the very individual person now in his power had come behind him and struck with a bludgeon at his head which however he missed and the instrument descended on his left shoulder that upon drawing his hanger and laying about him in the dark the other two fled leaving their companion whom he had disabled in the lurch peregrine congratulated him on his safety and having ordered pipes to secure the prisoner conducted mr gauntlet to the garrison where he met with a very hearty reception from the commodore to whom he was introduced as his nephews intimate friend not but that in all likelihood he would have abated somewhat of his hospitality had he known that he was the brother of perrys mistress but her name the old gentleman had never thought of asking when he inquired into the particulars of his godsons amour the captive being examined in presence of trunnion and all his adherents touching the ambuscade owned that being in the service of gam pickle he had been prevailed upon by the solicitations of his master and the curate to accompany them in their expedition and undertake the part which he had acted against the stranger whom he and his employers mistook for peregrine in consideration of this frank acknowledgment and a severe wound he had received in his right arm they resolved to inflict no other punishment on this malefactor than to detain him all night in the garrison and next morning carry him before a justice of the peace to whom he repeated all he had said overnight and with his own hand subscribed his confession copies of which were handed about the neighbourhood to the unspeakable confusion and disgrace of the curate and his promising pupil meanwhile trunnion treated the young soldier with uncommon marks of respect being prepossessed in his favour by this adventure which he had so gallantly achieved as well as by the encomiums that peregrine bestowed upon his valour and generosity he liked his countenance which was bold and hardy admired his herculean limbs and delighted in asking questions concerning the service he had seen the day after his arrival while the conversation turned on this last subject the commodore taking the pipe out of his month ill tell ye what brother said he fiveandforty years ago when i was third lieutenant of the warwick manofwar there was a very stout young fellow on board a subaltern officer of marines his name was not unlike your own dye see being guntlet with a g i remember he and i could not abide one another at first because dye see i was a sailor and he a landsman till we fell in with a frenchman whom we engaged for eight glasses and at length boarded and took i was the first man that stood on the enemys deck and should have come scurvily off dye see if guntlet had not jumped to my assistance but we soon cleared ship and drove them to close quarters so that they were obliged to strike and from that day guntlet and i were sworn brothers as long as he remained on board he was exchanged into a marching regiment and what became of him afterwards lord in heaven knows but this ill say of him whether he be dead or alive he feared no man that ever wore a head and was moreover a very hearty messmate the strangers breast glowed at this eulogium which was no sooner pronounced than he eagerly asked if the french ship was not the diligence the commodore replied with a stare the very same my lad then said gauntlet the person of whom you are pleased to make such honourable mention was my own father the devil he was cried trunnion shaking him by the hand i am rejoiced to see a son of ned guntlet in my house this discovery introduced a thousand questions in the course of which the old gentleman learned the situation of his friends family and discharged innumerable execrations upon the ingratitude and injustice of the ministry which had failed to provide for the son of such a brave soldier nor was his friendship confined to such ineffectual expressions he that same evening signified to peregrine a desire of doing something for his friend this inclination was so much praised encouraged and promoted by his godson and even supported by his councilor hatchway that our hero was empowered to present him with a sum of money sufficient to purchase a commission though nothing could be more agreeable to pickle than this permission he was afraid that godfreys scrupulous disposition would hinder him from subjecting himself to any such obligation and therefore proposed that he should be decoyed into his own interest by a feigned story in consequence of which he would be prevailed upon to accept of the money as a debt which the commodore had contracted of his father at sea trunnion made wry faces at this expedient the necessity of which he could not conceive without calling in question the common sense of gauntlet as he took it for granted that such offers as those were not to be rejected on any consideration whatever besides he could not digest an artifice by which he himself must own that he had lived so many years without manifesting the least intention of doing justice to his creditor all these objections however were removed by the zeal and rhetoric of peregrine who represented that it would be impossible to befriend him on any other terms that his silence hitherto would be imputed to his want of information touching the circumstances and condition of his friend and that his remembering and insisting upon discharging the obligation after such an interval of time when the whole affair was in oblivion would be the greatest compliment he could pay to his own honour and integrity thus persuaded he took an opportunity of gauntlets being alone with him to broach the affair telling the young man that his father had advanced a sum of money for him when they sailed together on account of the mess as well as to stop the mouth of a clamorous creditor at portsmouth and that the said sum with interest amounted to about four hundred pounds which he would now with great thankfulness repay godfrey was amazed at this declaration and after a considerable pause replied that he had never heard his parents mention any such debt that no memorandum or voucher of it was found among his fathers papers and that in all probability it must have been discharged long ago although the commodore in such a long course of time and hurry of occupation might have forgotten the repayment he therefore desired to be excused from accepting what in his own conscience he believed was not his due and complemented the old gentleman upon his being so scrupulously just and honourable the soldiers refusal which was matter of astonishment to trunnion increased his inclination to assist him and on pretence of acquitting his own character he urged his beneficence with such obstinacy that gauntlet afraid of disobliging him was in a manner compelled to receive a draft for the money for which he subscribed an ample discharge and immediately transmitted the order to his mother whom at the same time he informed of the circumstances by which they had so unexpectedly gained this accession of fortune such a piece of news could not fail of being agreeable to mrs gauntlet who by the first post wrote a polite letter of acknowledgment to the commodore another to her own son importing that she had already sent the draft to a friend in london with directions to deposit it in the hands of a certain banker for the purchase of the first ensigncy to be sold and she took the liberty of sending a third to peregrine couched in very affectionate terms with a kind postscript signed by miss sophy and his charming emily this affair being transacted to the satisfaction of all concerned preparations were set on foot for the departure of our hero on whom his uncle settled an annuity of eight hundred pounds being little less than one half of his whole income by this time indeed the old gentleman could easily afford to alienate such a part of his fortune because he entertained little or no company kept few servants and was remarkably plain and frugal in his housekeeping mrs trunnion being now some years on the wrong side of fifty her infirmities began to increase and though her pride had suffered no diminution her vanity was altogether subdued by her avarice a swiss valetdechambre who had already made the tour of europe was hired for the care of peregrines own person pipes being ignorant of the french language as well as otherwise unfit for the office of a fashionable attendant it was resolved that he should remain in garrison and his place was immediately supplied by a parisian lacquey engaged at london for that purpose pipes did not seem to relish this disposition of things and though he made no verbal objections to it looked remarkably sour at his successor upon his first arrival but this sullen fit seemed gradually to wear off and long before his masters departure he had recovered his natural tranquility and unconcern chapter xxxi the two young gentlemen display their talents for gallantry in the course of which they are involved in a ludicrous circumstance of distress and afterwards take vengeance on the author of their mishap meanwhile our hero and his new friend together with honest jack hatchway made daily excursions into the country visited the gentlemen in the neighbourhood and frequently accompanied them to the chase all three being exceedingly caressed on account of their talents which could accommodate themselves with great facility to the tempers and turns of their entertainers the lieutenant was a droll in his way peregrine possessed a great fund of sprightliness and goodhumour and godfrey among his other qualifications already recited sang a most excellent song so that the company of this triumvirate was courted in all parties whether male or female and if the hearts of our young gentlemen had not been preengaged they would have met with opportunities in abundance of displaying their address in the art of love not but that they gave loose to their gallantry without much interesting their affections and amused themselves with little intrigues which in the opinion of a man of pleasure do not affect his fidelity to the acknowledged sovereign of his soul in the midst of these amusements our hero received an intimation from his sister that she should be overjoyed to meet him next day at five oclock in the afternoon at the house of her nurse who lived in a cottage hard by her fathers habitation she being debarred from all opportunity of seeing him in any other place by the severity of her mother who suspected her inclination he accordingly obeyed the summons and went at the time appointed to the place of rendezvous where be met this affectionate young lady who when he entered the room ran towards him with all the eagerness of transport flung her arms about his neck and shed a flood of tears in his bosom before she could utter one word except a repetition of my dear dear brother he embraced her with all the piety of fraternal tenderness wept over her in his turn assured her that this was one of the happiest moments of his life and kindly thanked her for having resisted the example and disobeyed the injunctions of his mothers unnatural aversion he was ravished to find by her conversation that she possessed a great share of sensibility and prudent reflection for she lamented the infatuation of her parents with the most filial regret and expressed such abhorrence and concern at the villainous disposition of her younger brother as a humane sister may be supposed to have entertained he made her acquainted with all the circumstances of his own fortune and as he supposed she spent her time very disagreeably at home among characters which must be shockingly interesting professed a desire of removing her into some other sphere where she could live with more tranquility and satisfaction she objected to this proposal as an expedient that would infallibly subject her to the implacable resentment of her mother whose favour and affection she at present enjoyed but in a very inconsiderable degree and they had canvassed divers schemes of corresponding for the future when the voice of mrs pickle was heard at the door miss julia that was the young ladys name finding herself betrayed was seized with a violent agitation of fear and peregrine scarce had time to encourage her with a promise of protection before the door of the apartment being flung open this irreconcilable parent rushed in and with a furious aspect flew directly at her trembling daughter when the son interposing received the first discharge of her fury her eyes gleamed with all the rage of indignation which choked up her utterance and seemed to convulse her whole frame she twisted her left hand in his hair and with the other buffeted him about the face till the blood gushed from his nostrils and mouth while he defended his sister from the cruelty of gam who assaulted her from another quarter seeing his brother engaged this attack lasted several minutes with great violence till at length peregrine finding himself in danger of being overpowered if he should remain any longer on the defensive laid his brother on his back then he disentangled his mothers hand from his own hair and having pushed her gently out of the room bolted the door on the inside finally turning to gam he threw him out at the window among a parcel of hogs that fed under it by this time julia was almost quite distracted with terror she knew she bad offended beyond all hope of forgiveness and from that moment considered herself as an exile from her fathers house in vain did her brother strive to console her with fresh protestations of love and protection she counted herself extremely miserable in being obliged to endure the eternal resentment of a parent with whom she had hitherto lived and dreaded the censure of the world which from her mothers misrepresentation she was sensible would condemn her unheard that she might not however neglect any means in her power of averting this storm she resolved to appease if possible her mothers wrath with humiliation and even appeal to the influence of her father weak as it was before she would despair of being forgiven but the good lady spared her this unnecessary application by telling her through the keyhole that she must never expect to come within her fathers door again for from that hour she renounced her as unworthy of her affection and regard julia weeping bitterly endeavoured to soften the rigour of this sentence by the most submissive and reasonable remonstrances but as in her vindication she of necessity espoused her elder brothers cause her endeavours instead of soothing served only to exasperate her mother to a higher pitch of indignation which discharged itself in invectives against peregrine whom she reviled with the epithets of a worthless abandoned reprobate the youth hearing these unjust aspersions trembled with resentment through every limb assuring the upbraider that he considered her as an object of compassion for without all doubt said he your diabolical rancour must be severely punished by the thorns of your own conscience which this very instant taxes you with the malice and falsehood of your reproaches as for my sister i bless god that you have not been able to infect her with your unnatural prejudice which because she is too just too virtuous too humane to imbibe you reject her as an alien to your blood and turn her out unprovided into a barbarous world but even there your vicious purpose shall be defeated that same providence that screened me from the cruelty of your hate shall extend its protection to her until i shall find it convenient to assert by law that right of maintenance which nature it seems hath bestowed upon us in vain in the mean time you will enjoy the satisfaction of paying an undivided attention to that darling son whose amiable qualities have so long engaged and engrossed your love and esteem this freedom of expostulation exalted his mothers ire to mere frenzy she cursed him with the bitterest imprecations and raved like a bedlamite at the door which she attempted to burst open her efforts were seconded by her favourite son who denounced vengeance against peregrine and made furious assaults against the lock which resisted all their applications until our hero espying his friends gauntlet and pipes stepping over a stile that stood about a furlong from the window called them to his assistance giving them to understand how he was besieged he desired they would keep off his mother that he might the more easily secure his sister julias retreat the young soldier entered accordingly and posting himself between mrs pickle and the door gave the signal to his friend who lifting up his sister in his arms carried her safe without the clutches of this shedragon while pipes with his cudgel kept young master at bay the mother being thus deprived of her prey sprang upon gauntlet like a lioness robbed of her whelps and he must have suffered sorely in the flesh had he not prevented her mischievous intent by seizing both her wrists and so keeping her at due distance in attempting to disengage herself from his grasp she struggled with such exertion and suffered such agony of passion at the same time that she actually fell into a severe fit during which she was put to bed and the confederates retired without further molestation in the mean time peregrine was not a little perplexed about the disposal of his sister whom he had rescued he could not endure the thoughts of saddling the commodore with a new expense and he was afraid of undertaking the charge of julia without his benefactors advice and direction for the present however he carried her to the house of a gentleman in the neighbourhood whose lady was her godmother where she was received with great tenderness and condolence and he purposed to inquire for some creditable house where she might be genteelly boarded in his absence resolving to maintain her from the savings of his own allowance which he thought might very well bear such reduction but this intention was frustrated by the publication of the whole affair which was divulged next day and soon reached the ears of trunnion who chid his godson for having concealed the adventure and with the approbation of his wife ordered him to bring julia forthwith to the garrison the young gentleman with tears of gratitude in his eyes explained his design of maintaining her at his own expense and earnestly begged that he might not be deprived of that satisfaction but his uncle was deaf to all his entreaties and insisted upon her living in the garrison though for no other reason than that of being company to her aunt who he observed was lost for want of conversation julia was accordingly brought home and settled under the tuition of mrs trunnion who whatever face she might put on the matter could have dispensed with the society of her niece though she was not without hope of gratifying her pique to mrs pickle by the intelligence she would receive from the daughter of that ladys economy and domestic behaviour the mother herself seemed conscious of this advantage which her sisterinlaw had now gained over her being as much chagrined at the news of julias reception in the garrison as if she had heard of her own husbands death she even tortured her invention to propagate calumnies against the reputation of her own daughter whom she slandered in all companies she exclaimed against the commodore as an old ruffian who spirited up rebellion among her children and imputed the hospitality of his wife in countenancing them to nothing else but her inveterate enmity to their mother whom they had disobliged she now insisted in the most peremptory terms upon her husbands renouncing all commerce with the old lad of the castle and his adherents and mr gamaliel having by this time contracted other friendships readily submitted to her will nay even refused to communicate with the commodore one night when they happened to meet by accident at the publichouse chapter xxxii the commodore sends a challenge to gamaliel and is imposed upon by a waggish invention of the lieutenant peregrine and gauntlet this affront trunnion could by no means digest he advised with the lieutenant upon the subject and the result of their consultation was a defiance which the old commander sent to pickle demanding that he would meet him at such a place on horseback with a brace of pistols and give satisfaction for the slight he had put upon him nothing could have afforded more pleasure to jack than the acceptance of this challenge which he delivered verbally to mr gamaliel who was called out from the club at tunleys for that purpose the nature of this message had an instantaneous effect upon the constitution of the pacific pickle whose bowels yearned with apprehension and underwent such violent agitation on the spot that one would have thought the operation proceeded from some severe joke of the apothecary which he had swallowed in his beer the messenger despairing of a satisfactory answer left him in this woeful condition and being loath to lose any opportunity of raising the laugh against the commodore went immediately and communicated the whole affair to the young gentlemen entreating them for the love of god to concert some means of bringing old hannibal into the field the two friends relished the proposal and after some deliberation it was resolved that hatchway should tell trunnion his invitation was accepted by gamaliel who would meet him at the place appointed with his second tomorrow in the twilight because if either should fall the other would have the chance of escaping in the dark that godfrey should personate old pickles friend and peregrine represent his own father while the lieutenant should take care in loading the pistols to keep out the shot so that no damage might be done in the rencounter these circumstances being adjusted the lieutenant returned to his principal with a most thundering reply from his antagonist whose courageous behaviour though it could not intimidate did not fail to astonish the commodore who ascribed it to the spirit of his wife which had inspired him trunnion that instant desired his counsellor to prepare his cartridgebox and order the quietest horse in the stable to be kept ready saddled for the occasion his eye seemed to lighten with alacrity and pleasure at the prospect of smelling gunpowder once more before his death and when jack advised him to make his will in case of accident he rejected his counsel with disdain saying what dost thou think that hawser trunnion who has stood the fire of so many floating batteries runs any risk from the lousy pops of a landman thou shalt see thou shalt see how ill make him lower his topsails next day peregrine and the soldier provided themselves with horses at the publichouse from whence at the destined hour they rode to the field of battle each of them being muffed in a great coat which with the dimness of the light effectually shielded them from the knowledge of the oneeyed commander who having taken horse on pretence of enjoying the fresh air soon appeared with hatchway in his rear when they came within sight of each other the seconds advanced in order to divide the ground and regulate the measures of the combat when it was determined by mutual consent that two pistols should be discharged on each side and that if neither should prove decisive recourse must be had to the broadswords in order to ascertain the victory these articles being settled the opponents rode forward to their respective stations when peregrine cocking his pistol and presenting counterfeited his fathers voice bidding trunnion take care of his remaining eye the commodore took his advice being unwilling to hazard his daylight and very deliberately opposed the patched side of his face to the muzzle of his antagonists piece desiring him to do his duty without farther jaw the young man accordingly fired and the distance being small the wad of his pistol took place with a smart stroke on the forehead of trunnion mistaking it for a ball which he thought lodged in his brain spurred up his steed in a state of desperation towards his antagonist and holding his piece within two yards of his body let it off without any regard to the laws of battle surprised and enraged to see it had made no impression he halloed in a terrible tone o dye you have your netting stuffed i see and advancing he discharged his second pistol so near his godsons head that had he not been defended by his great coat the powder must have scorched his face having thus thrown away his fire he remained at the mercy of peregrine who clapping the piece he had in reserve to his head commanded him to beg his life and ask pardon for his presumption the commodore made no reply to this imperious injunction but dropping his pistol and unsheathing his broadsword in an instant attacked our hero with such incredible agility that if he had not made shift to ward off the stroke with his piece the adventure in all likelihood would have turned out a very tragical joke peregrine finding it would be in vain for him to think of drawing his weapon or of standing on the defensive against this furious aggressor very fairly clapped spurs to his nag and sought his safety in flight trunnion pursued him with infinite eagerness and his steed being the better of the two would have overtaken the fugitive to his peril had he not been unfortunately encountered by the boughs of a tree that happened to stand on his blind side and incommoded him so much that he was fain to quit his sword and lay hold on the mane in order to maintain his seat perry perceiving his disaster wheeled about and now finding leisure to produce his weapon returned upon his disarmed foe brandishing his ferrara threatening to make him shorter by the head if he would not immediately crave quarter and yield there was nothing farther from the intention of the old gentleman than such submission which he flatly refused to pay alleging that he had already compelled his enemy to clap on all sails and that his own present misfortune was owing to accident all one as if a ship should be attacked after she had been obliged to heave her guns overboard in a storm before peregrine had time to answer this remonstrance the lieutenant interposed and taking cognizance of the case established a truce until he and the other second should discuss and decide upon the merits of the case they accordingly retired to a small distance and after having conferred a few minutes hatchway returned and pronounced the commodore vanquished by the chance of war never was rage more than that which took possession of old hannibal when he heard the sentence it was some time before he could utter aught except the reproachful expression you lie which he repeated more than twenty times in a sort of delirious insensibility when he recovered the further use of speech he abused the arbitrators with such bitter invectives renouncing their sentence and appealing to another trial that the confederates began to repent of having carried the joke so far and peregrine in order to appease his choler owned himself overcome this acknowledgment calmed the tumult of his wrath though he could not for some days forgive the lieutenant and the two young gentlemen rode back to tunleys while hatchway taking the commodores horse by the bridle reconducted him to his mansion growling all the way to jack for his unjust and unfriendly decree though he could not help observing as how he had made his words good in making his adversary to strike his topsails and yet said he before god i think the fellows head is made of a woodpack for my shot rebounded from his face like a wad of spunyarn from the walls of a ship but if so be that son of a b of a tree hadnt come athwart my weatherbow dye see ill be d d if i hadnt snapt his mainyard in the slings and mayhap let out his bulgewater into the bargain he seemed particularly vain of this exploit which dwelt upon his imagination and was cherished as the child of his old age for though he could not with decency rehearse it to the young men and his wife at supper he gave hints of his own manhood even at these years and attested hatchway as a voucher for his mettle while the triumvirate diverted by his vanity enjoyed in secret the success of their imposition chapter xxxiii peregrine takes leave of his aunt and sister sets out from the garrisonparts with his uncle and hatchway on the road and with his governor arrives in safety at dover this however was the last effort of invention which they practised upon him and everything being now prepared for the departure of his godson that hopeful youth in two days took leave of all his friends in the neighbourhood he was closeted two whole hours with his aunt who enriched him with many pious advices recapitulated all the benefits which through her means had been conferred upon him since his infancy cautioned him against the temptations of lewd women who bring many a man to a morsel of bread laid strict injunctions upon him to live in the fear of the lord and the true protestant faith to eschew quarrels and contention to treat mr jolter with reverence and regard and above all things to abstain from the beastly sin of drunkenness which exposes a man to the scorn and contempt of his fellowcreatures and by divesting him of reason and reflection renders him fit for all manner of vice and debauchery she recommended to him economy and the care of his health bade him remember the honour of his family and in all the circumstances of his behaviour assured him that he might always depend upon the friendship and generosity of the commodore finally presenting him with her own picture set in gold and a hundred guineas from her privy purse she embraced him affectionately and wished him all manner of happiness and prosperity being thus kindly dismissed by mrs trunnion he locked himself up with his sister julia whom he admonished to cultivate her aunt with the most complaisant and respectful attention without stooping to any circumstance of submission that she should judge unworthy of her practice he protested that his chief study should be to make her amends for the privilege she had forfeited by her affection for him entreated her to enter into no engagement without his knowledge and approbation put into her hand the purse which he had received from his aunt to defray her pocket expenses in his absence and parted from her not without tears after she had for some minutes hung about his neck kissing him and weeping in the most pathetic silence having performed these duties of affection and consanguinity overnight he went to bed and was by his own direction called at four oclock in the morning when he found the postchaise coach and ridinghorses ready at the gate his friends gauntlet and hatchway on foot the commodore himself almost dressed and every servant in the garrison assembled in he yard to wish him a good journey our hero shook each of these humble friends by the hand tipping them at the same time with marks of his bounty and was very much surprised when he could not perceive his old attendant pipes among the number when he expressed his wonder at this disrespectful omission of tom some of those present ran to his chamber in order to give him a call but his hammock and room were both deserted and they soon returned with an account of his having eloped peregrine was disturbed at this information believing that the fellow had taken some desperate course in consequence of his being dismissed from his service and began to wish that he had indulged his inclination by retaining him still about his person however as there was now no other remedy he recommended him strenuously to the particular favour and distinction of his uncle and hatchway in case he should appear again and as he went out of the gate was saluted with three cheers by all the domestics in the family the commodore gauntlet lieutenant peregrine and jolter went into the coach together that they might enjoy each others conversation as much as possible resolving to breakfast at an inn upon the road where trunnion and hatchway intended to bid our adventurer farewell the valetdechambre got into the postchaise the french lacquey rode one horse and led another one of the valets of the garrison mounted at the back of the coach and thus the cavalcade set out on the road to dover as the commodore could not bear the fatigue of jolting they travelled at an easy pace during the fist stage so that the old gentleman had an opportunity of communicating his exhortations to his godson with regard to his conduct abroad he advised him now that he was going into foreign parts to be upon his guard against the fair weather of the french politesse which was no more to be trusted than a whirlpool at sea he observed that many young men had gone to paris with good cargoes of sense and returned with a great deal of canvas and no ballast at all whereby they became crank all the days of their lives and sometimes carried their keels above water he desired mr jolter to keep his pupil out of the clutches of those sharking priests who lie in wait to make converts of all young strangers and in a particular manner cautioned the youth against carnal conversation with the parisian dames who he understood were no better than gaudy fireships ready primed with death and destruction peregrine listened with great respect thanking him for his kind admonitions which he faithfully promised to observe the halted and breakfasted at the end of the stage where jolter provided himself with a horse and the commodore settled the method of corresponding with his nephew the minute of parting being arrived the old commander wrung his godson by the hand saying i wish thee a prosperous voyage and good cheer my lad my timbers are now a little crazy dye see and god knows if i shall keep afloat till such time as i see thee again but howsomever hap what will thou wilt find thyself in a condition to keep in the line with the rest of thy fellows he then reminded gauntlet of his promise to call at the garrison in his return from dover and imparted something in a whisper to the governor while jack hatchway unable to speak pulled his hat over his eyes and squeezing peregrine by the hand gave him a pistol of curious workmanship as a memorial of his friendship our youth who was not unmoved on this occasion received the pledge which he acknowledged with the present of a tobaccobox bought for this purpose and the two lads of the castle getting into the coach were driven homewards in a state of silent dejection godfrey and peregrine seated themselves in the postchaise and jolter the valetdechambre and lacquey bestriding their beasts they proceeded for the place of their destination at which they arrived in safety that same night and bespoke a passage in the packetboat which was to sail next day chapter xxxiv he adjusts the method of his correspondence with gauntlet meets by accident with an italian charlatan and a certain apothecary who proves to be a noted character there the two friends adjusted the articles of a future correspondence and peregrine having written a letter to his mistress wherein he renewed his former vows of eternal fidelity it was intrusted to the care of her brother while mr jolter at the desire of his pupil provided an elegant supper and some excellent burgundy that they might spend this eve of his departure with the greater enjoyment things being thus disposed and a servant employed in laying the cloth their ears were of a sudden invaded by a strange tumultuous noise in the next room occasioned by the overthrow of tables chairs and glasses with odd unintelligible exclamations in broken french and a jargon of threats in the welsh dialect our young gentlemen ran immediately into the apartment from whence this clamour seemed to proceed and found a thin meagre swarthy figure gasping in all the agony of fear under the hands of a squat thick hardfeatured man who collared him with great demonstrations of wrath saying if you was as mighty a magician as owen glendower or the witch of entor look you ay ay or as paul beor himself i will meke pold by the assistance of got and in his majestys name to seize and secure and confine and confront you until such time as you suffer and endure and undergo the pains and penalties of the law for your diabolical practices shentlements added he turning to our adventurers i take you to witness that i protest and assert and avow that this person is as pig a necromancer as you would desire to behold and i supplicate and beseech and entreat of you that he may be prought pefore his petters and compelled to give an account of his compact and commerce with the imps of darkness look you for as i am a christian soul and hope for joyful resurrection i have this plessed evening seen him perform such things as could not be done without the aid and instruction and connivance of the tevil gauntlet seemed to enter into the sentiments of this welsh reformer and actually laid hold on the delinquents shoulder crying d n the rascal ill lay any wager that hes a jesuit for none of his order travel without a familiar but peregrine who looked upon the affair in another point of view interposed in behalf of the stranger whom he freed from his aggressors observing that there was no occasion to use violence and asked in french what he had done to incur the censure of the informer the poor foreigner more dead than alive answered that he was an italian charlatan who had practised with some reputation in padua until he had the misfortune to attract the notice of the inquisition by exhibiting certain wonderful performances by his skill in natural knowledge which that tribunal considered as the effects of sorcery and persecuted him accordingly so that he had been fain to make a precipitate retreat into france where not finding his account in his talents he was now arrived in england with a view of practising his art in london and that in consequence of a specimen which he had given to a company below the choleric gentleman had followed him upstairs to his own apartment and assaulted him in that inhospitable manner he therefore earnestly begged that our hero would take him under his protection and if he entertained the least suspicion of his employing preternatural means in the operations of his art he would freely communicate all the secrets in his possession the youth dispelled his apprehension by assuring him that he was in no danger of suffering for his art in england where if ever he should he questioned by the zeal of superstitious individuals he had nothing to do but appeal to the justice of the peace who would immediately acquit him of the charge and punish his accusers for their impertinence and indiscretion he then told gauntlet and the welshman that the stranger had a good action against them for an assault by virtue of an act of parliament which makes it criminal for any person to accuse another of sorcery and witchcraft these idle notions being now justly exploded by all sensible men mr jolter who had by this time joined the company could not help signifying his dissent from this opinion of his pupil which he endeavoured to invalidate by the authority of scripture quotations from the fathers and the confession of many wretches who suffered death for having carried on correspondence with evil spirits together with the evidence of satans invisible world and moretons history of witchcraft the soldier corroborated these testimonies by facts that had happened within the sphere of his own knowledge and in particular mentioned the case of an old woman of the parish in which he was born who used to transform herself into the shapes of sundry animals and was at last killed by small shot in the character of a hare the welshman thus supported expressed his surprise at hearing that the legislature had shown such tenderness for criminals of so dark a hue and offered to prove by undeniable instances that there was not a mountain in wales which had not been in his memory the scene of necromancy and witchcraft wherefore said he i am assuredly more than above astonished and confounded and concerned that the parliament of great britain should in their great wisdoms and their prudence and their penetration give countenance and encouragement look you to the works of darkness and the empire of pelzepup ofer and apove the evidence of holy writ and those writers who have been quoted by that aggurate and learned shentleman we are informed by profane history of the pribbles and pranks of the old serpent in the bortents and oragles of antiquity as you will find in that most excellent historian bolypius and titus lifius ay and moreofer in the commentaries of julius caesar himself who as the ole world knows was a most famous and a most faliant and a most wise and a most prudent and a most fortunate chieftain and a most renowned orator ay and a most elegant writer to boot peregrine did not think proper to enter the lists of dispute with three such obstinate antagonists but contented himself with saying that he believed it would be no difficult matter to impugn the arguments they had advanced though he did not find himself at all disposed to undertake the task which must of course break in upon the evenings entertainment he therefore invited the italian to supper and asked the same favour of his accuser who seemed to have something curious and characteristic in his manner and disposition resolving to make himself an eyewitness of those surprising feats which had given offence to the choleric briton this scrupulous gentleman thanked our hero for his courtesy but declined communicating with the stranger until his character should be further explained upon which his inviter after some conversation with the charlatan assured him that he would himself undertake for the innocence of his art and then he was prevailed upon to favour them with his company in the course of the conversation peregrine learned that the welshman was a surgeon of canterbury who had been called in to a consultation at dover and understanding that his name was morgan took the liberty of asking if he was not the person so respectfully mentioned in the adventures of roderick random mr morgan assumed a look of gravity and importance at this interrogation and screwing up his mouth answered mr rantum my good sir i believe upon my conscience and salfation is my very goot frient and wellwisher and he and i have been companions and messmates and fellowsufferers look you but nevertheless for all that peradventure he hath not pehaved with so much complaisance and affability and respect as i might have expected from him pecause he hath revealed and tivulged and buplished our private affairs without my knowledge and privity and consent but as got is my safiour i think he had no evil intention in his pelly and though there be certain persons look you who as i am told take upon them to laugh at his descriptions of my person deportment and conversation i do affirm and maintain and insist with my heart and my plood and my soul that those persons are no petter than ignorant asses and that they know not how to discern and distinguish and define true ridicule or as aristotle calls it the to geloion no more look you than a herd of mountain goats for i will make pold to observe and i hope this goot company will be of the same opinion that there is nothing said of me in that performance which is unworthy of a christian and a shentleman our young gentleman and his friends acquiesced in the justness of his observation peregrine particularly assured him that from reading the book he had conceived the utmost regard and veneration for his character and that he thought himself extremely fortunate in having this opportunity of enjoying his conversation morgan not a little proud of such advances from a person of peregrines appearance returned the compliment with a profusion of civility and in the warmth of acknowledgment expressed a desire of seeing him and his company at his house in canterbury i will not pretend or presume kind sir said he to entertain you according to your merits and deserts but you shall be as welcome to my poor cottage and my wife and family as the prince of wales himself and it shall go hard if one way or other i do not find ways and means of making you confess that there

wine and no tradesman can peard me with a bill he was congratulated on his happy situation and assured that our youth would visit him on his return from france provided he should take canterbury in his route as peregrine manifested an inclination of being acquainted with the state of his affairs he very complaisantly satisfied his curiosity by giving him to know that his spouse had left off breeding after having blessed him with two boys and a girl who were still alive and well that he lived in good esteem with his neighbors and by his practice which was considerably extended immediately after the publication of roderick random had saved some thousand pounds he had begun to think of retiring among his own relations in glamorganshire though his wife had made objection to this proposal and opposed the execution of it with such obstinacy that he had been at infinite pains in asserting his own prerogative by convincing her both from reason and example that he was king and priest in his own family and that she owed the most implicit submission to his will he likewise informed the company that he had lately seen his friend roderick who had come from london on purpose to visit him after having gained his lawsuit with mr topeball who was obliged to pay narcissas fortune that mr random in all appearance led a very happy life in the conversation of his father and bedfellow by whom he enjoyed a son and daughter and that morgan had received in a present from him a piece of very fine linen of his wifes own making several kits of salmon and two casks of pickled pork the most delicate he had ever tasted together with a barrel of excellent herrings for salmagundy which he knew to be his favourite dish this topic of conversation being discussed the italian was desired to exhibit a specimen of his art and in a few minutes he conducted the company into the next room where to their great astonishment and affright they beheld a thousand serpents winding along the ceiling morgan struck with this phenomenon which he had not seen before began to utter exorcisms with great devotion mr jolter ran of the room gauntlet drew his hanger and peregrine himself was disconcerted the operator perceiving their confusion desired them to retire and calling them back in an instant there was not a viper to be seen he raised their admiration by sundry other performances and the welshmans former opinion and abhorrence of his character began to recur when in consideration of the civility with which he had been treated this italian imparted to them all the methods by which he had acted such wonders that were no other than the effects of natural causes curiously combined so that morgan became a convert to his skill asked pardon for the suspicion he had entertained and invited the stranger to pass a few days with him at canterbury the scruples of godfrey and jolter were removed at the same time and peregrine testified his satisfaction by a handsome gratuity which he bestowed upon their entertainer the evening being spent in this sociable manner every man retired to his respective chamber and next morning they breakfasted together when morgan declared he would stay till he should see our hero fairly embarked that he might have the pleasure of mr gauntlets company to his own habitation meanwhile by the skippers advice the servants were ordered to carry a store of wine and provision on board in case of accident and as the packetboat could not sail before one oclock the company walked up hill to visit the castle where they saw the sword of julius caesar and queen elizabeths pocket pistol repeated shakespeares description while they surveyed the chalky cliffs on each side and cast their eyes towards the city of calais that was obscured by a thick cloud which did not much regale their eyesight because it seemed to portend foul weather having viewed everything remarkable in this place they returned to the pier where after the compliments of parting and an affectionate embrace between the two young gentlemen peregrine and his governor stepped aboard the sails were hoisted and they went to sea with a fair wind while godfrey morgan and the conjurer walked back to the inn from whence they set out for canterbury before dinner chapter xxxv he embarks for france is overtaken by a storm is surprised with the appearance of pipes lands at calais and has an affray with the officers at the customhouse scarce had the vessel proceeded two leagues on the passage when the wind shifting blew directly in her teeth so that they were obliged to haul upon a wind and alter their course the sea running pretty high at the same time our hero who was below in his cabin began to be squeamish and in consequence of the skippers advice went upon deck for the comfort of his stomach while the governor experienced in these disasters slipped into bed where he lay at his ease amusing himself with a treatise on the cycloid with algebraical demonstrations which never failed to engage his imagination in the most agreeable manner in the mean time the wind increased to a very hard gale the vessel pitched with great violence the sea washed over the deck the master was alarmed the crew were confounded the passengers were overwhelmed with sickness and fear and universal distraction ensued in the midst of this uproar peregrine holding fast by the taffrail and looking ruefully ahead the countenance of pipes presented itself to his astonished view rising as it were from the hold of the ship at first he imagined it was a fearformed shadow of his own brain though he did not long remain in this error but plainly perceived that it was no other than the real person of thomas who jumping on the quarterdeck took charge of the helm and dictated to the sailors with as much authority as if he had been commander of the ship the skipper looked upon him as an angel sent to his assistance and the crew soon discovered him to be a thoroughbred seaman notwithstanding his liveryfrock obeyed his orders with such alacrity that in a little time the confusion vanished and every necessary step was taken to weather the gale our young gentleman immediately conceived the meaning of toms appearance on board and when the tumult was a little subsided went up and encouraged him to exert himself for the preservation of the ship promising to take him again into his service from which he should never be dismissed except at his own desire this assurance had a surprising effect upon pipes who though he made no manner of reply thrust the helm into the masters hands saying here you old bumboatwoman take hold of the tiller and keep her thus boy thus and skipped about the vessel trimming the sails and managing the ropes with such agility and skill that everybody on deck stood amazed at his dexterity mr jolter was far from being unconcerned at the uncommon motion of the vessel the singing of the wind and the uproar which he heard about him he looked towards the cabindoor with the most fearful expectation in hope of seeing some person who could give some account of the weather and what was doing upon deck but not a soul appeared and he was too well acquainted with the disposition of his own bowels to make the least alteration in his attitude when he bad lain a good while in all the agony of suspense the boy tumbled headlong into his apartment with such noise that he believed the mast had gone by the board and starting upright in his bed asked with all the symptoms of horror what was the cause of that disturbance the boy halfstunned by his fall answered in a dolorous tone im come to put up the deadlights at the mention of deadlights the meaning of which he did not understand the poor governors heart died within him he shivered with despair his recollection forsaking him he fell upon his knees in the bed and fixing his eyes upon the book which was in his hand began to pronounce aloud with great fervour the time of a complete oscillation in the cycloid is to the time in which a body would fall through the axis of the cycloid dv as the circumference of a circle to its diameter he would in all likelihood have proceeded with the demonstration of this proposition had he not been seized with such a qualm as compelled him to drop the book and accommodate himself to the emergency of his distemper he therefore stretched himself at full length and putting up ejaculations to heaven began to prepare himself for his latter end when all of a sudden the noise above was intermitted and as he could not conceive the cause of this tremendous silence he imagined that either the men were washed overboard or that despairing of safety they had ceased to oppose the tempest while he was harrowed by this miserable uncertainty which however was not altogether unenlightened by some scattered rays of hope the master entered the cabin then he asked with a voice halfextinguished by fear how matters went upon deck and the skipper with a large bottle of brandy applied to his mouth answered in a hollow tone alls over now master upon which mr jolter giving himself over for lost exclaimed with the utmost horror lord have mercy upon us christ have mercy upon us and repeated this supplication as it were mechanically until the master undeceived him by explaining the meaning of what he had said and assuring him that the squall was over such a sudden transition from fear to joy occasioned a violent agitation both in his mind and body and it was a full quarter of an hour before he recovered the right use of his organs by this time the weather cleared up the wind began to blow again from the right corner and the spires of calais appeared at the distance of five leagues so that the countenances of all on board were lighted up with joyous expectation and peregrine venturing to go down into the cabin comforted his governor with an account of the happy turn of their affairs jolter transported with the thought of a speedy landing began to launch out in praise of that country for which they were bound he observed that france was the land of politeness and hospitality which were conspicuous in the behaviour of all ranks and degrees from the peer to the peasant that a gentleman and a foreigner far from being insulted and imposed upon by the lower class of people as in england was treated with the utmost reverence candour and respect and their fields were fertile their climate pure healthy their farmers rich and industrious the subjects in general the happiest of men he would have prosecuted this favourite theme still farther had not his pupil been obliged to run upon deck in consequence of certain warnings he received from his stomach the skipper seeing his condition very honestly reminded him of the cold ham and fowls with a basket of wine which he had ordered to be sent on board and asked if he would have the cloth laid below he could not have chosen a more seasonable opportunity of manifesting his own disinterestedness peregrine made wry faces at the mention of food bidding him for heavens sake talk no more on that subject he then descended into the cabin and put the same question to mr jolter who he knew entertained the same abhorrence for his proposal and meeting with the like reception from him went between decks and repeated his courteous proffer to the valetdechambre and lacquey who lay sprawling in all the pangs of a double evacuation and rejected his civility with the most horrible loathing thus baffled in all his kind endeavours he ordered the boy to secure the provision in one of his own lockers according to the custom of the ship it being low water when they arrived on the french coast the vessel could not enter the harbour and they were obliged to bring to and wait for a boat which in less than halfanhour came alongside from the shore mr jolter now came upon deck and snuffing up the french air with symptoms of infinite satisfaction asked of the boatmen with the friendly appellation of mes enfants what they demanded for transporting him and his pupil with their baggage to the pier but how was he disconcerted when those polite candid reasonable watermen demanded a louis dor for that service peregrine with a sarcastic sneer observed that he already began to perceive the justice of his encomiums on the french and the disappointed governor could say nothing in his own vindication but that they were debauched by their intercourse with the inhabitants of dover his pupil however was so much offended at their extortion that he absolutely refused to employ them even when they abated one half in their demand and swore he would stay on board till the packet should be able to enter the harbour rather than encourage such imposition the master who in all probability had some sort of fellowfeeling with the boatmen in vain represented that he could not with safety lieto or anchor upon a leeshore our hero having consulted pipes answered that he had hired his vessel to transport him to calais and that he would oblige him to perform what he had undertaken the skipper very much mortified at this peremptory reply which was not over and above agreeable to mr jolter dismissed the boat notwithstanding the solicitations and condescension of the watermen running a little farther in shore they came to an anchor and waited till there was water enough to float them over the bar then they stood into the harbour and our gentleman with his attendants and baggage were landed on the pier by the sailors whom he liberally rewarded for their trouble he was immediately plied by a great number of porters who like so many hungry wolves laid hold on his baggage and began to carry it off piecemeal without his order or direction incensed at this officious insolence he commanded them to desist with many oaths and opprobrious terms that his anger suggested and perceiving that one of them did not seem to pay any regard to what he said but marched off with his burthen he snatched a cudgel out of his lacqueys hand and overtaking the fellow in a twinkling brought him to the ground with one blow he was instantly surrounded by the whole congregation of this canaille who resented the injury which their brother had sustained and would have taken immediate satisfaction on the aggressor had not pipes seeing his master involved brought the whole crew to his assistance and exerted himself so manfully that the enemy were obliged to retreat with many marks of defeat and menaces of interesting the commandant in their quarrel jolter who knew and dreaded the power of the french governor began to shake with apprehension when he heard their repeated threats but they durst not apply to this magistrate who upon a fair representation of the case would have punished them severely for their rapacious and insolent behaviour peregrine without further molestation availed himself of his own attendants who shouldered his baggage and followed him to the gate where they were stopped by the sentinels until their names should be registered mr jolter who had undergone this examination before resolved to profit by his experience and cunningly represented his pupil as a young english lord this intimation supported by the appearance of his equipage was no sooner communicated to the officer than he turned out the guard and ordered his soldiers to rest upon their arms while his lordship passed in great state to the lion dargent where he took up his lodging for the night resolving to set out for paris next morning in a postchaise the governor triumphed greatly in this piece of complaisance and respect with which they had been honoured and resumed his beloved topic of discourse in applauding the method and subordination of the french government which was better calculated for maintaining order and protecting the people than any constitution upon earth of their courteous attention to strangers there needed no other proof than the compliment which had been paid to them together with the governors connivance at peregrines employing his own servants in carrying the baggage to the inn contrary to the privilege of the inhabitants while he expatiated with a remarkable degree of selfindulgence on this subject the valetdechambre coming into the room interrupted his harangue by telling his master that their trunks and portmanteaus must be carried to the customhouse in order to be searched and sealed with lead which must remain untouched until their arrival at paris peregrine made no objection to this practice which was in itself reasonable enough but when he understood that the gate was besieged by another multitude of porters who insisted upon their right of carrying the goods and also of fixing their own price he absolutely refused to comply with their demand nay he chastised some of the most clamorous among them with his foot and told them that if their customhouse officers had a mind to examine his baggage they might come to the inn for that purpose the valetdechambre was abashed at this boldness of his masters behaviour which the lacquey shrugging up his shoulders observed was bien a langlaise while the governor represented it as an indignity to the whole nation and endeavoured to persuade his pupil to comply with the custom of the place but peregrines natural haughtiness of disposition hindered him from giving ear to jolters wholesome advice and in less than halfanhour they observed a file of musketeers marching up to the gate at sight of this detachment the tutor trembled the valet grew pale and the lacquey crossed himself but our hero without exhibiting any other symptoms than those of indignation met them on the threshold and with a ferocious air demanded their business the corporal who commanded the file answered with great deliberation that he had orders to convey his baggage to the customhouse and seeing the trunks standing in the entry placed his men between them and the owner while the porters that followed took them up and proceeded to the douane without opposition pickle was not mad enough to dispute the authority of this message but in order to gall and specify his contempt for those who brought it he called aloud to his valet desiring him in french to accompany his things and see that none of his linen and effects should be stolen by the searchers the corporal mortified at this satirical insinuation darted a look of resentment at the author as if he had been interested for the glory of his nation and told him that he could perceive he was a stranger in france or else he would have saved himself the trouble of such a needless precaution chapter xxxvi he makes a fruitless attempt in gallantry departs for boulogne where he spends the evening with certain english exiles having thus yielded to the hand of power he inquired if there was any other english company in the house when understanding that a gentleman and lady lodged in the next apartment and had bespoke a postchaise for paris he ordered pipes to ingratiate himself with their footman and if possible learn their names and condition while he and mr jolter attended by the lacquey took a turn round the ramparts and viewed the particulars of the fortification tom was so very successful in his inquiry that when his master returned he was able to give him a very satisfactory account of his fellowlodgers in consequence of having treated his brother with a bottle of wine the people in question were a gentleman and his lady lately arrived from england in their way to paris the husband was a man of good fortune who had been a libertine in his youth and a professed declaimer against matrimony he wanted neither sense nor experience and piqued himself in particular upon his art of avoiding the snares of the female sex in which he pretended to be deeply versed but notwithstanding all his caution and skill he had lately fallen a sacrifice to the attractions of an oysterwench who had found means to decoy him into the bands of wedlock and in order to evade the compliments and congratulations of his friends and acquaintance he had come so far on a tour to paris where he intended to initiate his spouse in the beau monde in the mean time he chose to live upon the reserve because her natural talents had as yet received but little cultivation and he had not the most implicit confidence in her virtue and discretion which it seems had like to have yielded to the addresses of an officer at canterbury who had made shift to insinuate himself into her acquaintance and favour peregrines curiosity being inflamed by this information he lounged about the yard in hopes of seeing the dulcinea who had captivated the old bachelor and at length observing her at a window took the liberty of bowing to her with great respect she returned the compliment with a curtsy and appeared so decent in her dress and manner that unless he had been previously informed of her former life and conversation he never would have dreamt that her education was different from that of other ladies of fashion so easy is it to acquire that external deportment on which people of condition value themselves so much not but that mr pickle pretended to distinguish a certain vulgar audacity in her countenance which in a lady of birth and fortune would have passed for an agreeable vivacity that enlivens the aspect and gives poignancy to every feature but as she possessed a pair of fine eyes and a clear complexion overspread with a glow of health which never fails of recommending the owner he could not help gazing at her with desire and forming the design of making a conquest of her heart with this view he sent his compliments to her husband whose name was hornbeck with an intimation that he proposed to set out the next day for paris and as he understood that he was resolved upon the same journey he should be extremely glad of his company on the road if he was not better engaged hornbeck who in all probability did not choose to accommodate his wife with a squire of our heros appearance sent a civil answer to his message professing infinite mortification at his being unable to embrace the favour of this kind offer by reason of the indisposition of his wife who he was afraid would not be in a condition for some days to bear the fatigue of travelling this rebuff which peregrine ascribed to the husbands jealousy stifled his project in embryo he ordered his french servant to take a place for himself in the diligence where all his luggage was stowed except a small trunk with some linen and other necessaries that was fixed upon the postchaise which they hired of the landlord and early next morning he and mr jolter departed from calais attended by his valetdechambre and pipes on horseback they proceeded without any accident as far as boulogne where they breakfasted and visited old father graham a scottish gentleman of the governors acquaintance who had lived as a capuchin in that place for the space of threescore years and during that period conformed to all the austerities of the order with the most rigorous exactness being equally remarkable for the frankness of his conversation the humanity of his disposition and the simplicity of his manners from boulogne they took their departure about noon and as they proposed to sleep that night at abbeville commanded the postilion to drive with extra ordinary speed perhaps it was well for his cattle that the axletree gave way and the chaise of course overturned before they had travelled onethird part of the stage this accident compelled them to return to the place from whence they had set out and as they could not procure another conveyance they found themselves under the necessity of staying till their chaise could be refitted understanding that this operation would detain them a whole day our young gentleman had recourse to his patience and demanded to know what they could have for dinner the garcon or waiter thus questioned vanished in a moment and immediately they were surprised with the appearance of a strange figure which from the extravagance of its dress and gesticulation peregrine mistook for a madman of the growth of france this phantom which by the bye happened to be no other than the cook was a tall longlegged meagre swarthy fellow that stooped very much his cheekbones were remarkably raised his nose bent into the shape and size of a powderhorn and the sockets of his eyes as raw round the edges as if the skin had been pared off on his head he wore a handkerchief which had once been white and now served to cover the upper part of a black periwig to which was attached a bag at least a foot square with a solitaire and rose that stuck upon each side of his ear so that he looked like a criminal on the pillory his back was accommodated with a linen waistcoat his hands adorned with long ruffles of the same piece his middle was girded by an apron tucked up that it might not conceal his white silk stockings rolled and at his entrance he brandished a bloody weapon full three feet in length peregrine when he first saw him approach in this menacing attitude put himself upon his guard but being informed of his quality perused his bill of fare and having bespoken three or four things for dinner walked out with mr jolter to view both towns which they had not leisure to consider minutely before in their return from the harbour they met with four or five gentlemen all of whom seemed to look with an air of dejection and perceiving our hero and his governor to be english by their dress bowed with great respect as they passed pickle who was naturally compassionate felt an emotion of sympathy and seeing a person who by his habit he judged to be one of their servants accosted him in english and asked who the gentlemen were the lacquey gave him to understand that they were his own countrymen called from their native homes in consequence of their adherence to an unfortunate and ruined cause and that they were gone to the seaside according to their daily practice in order to indulge their longing eyes with a prospect of the white cliffs of albion which they must never more approach though our young gentleman differed widely from them in point of political principles he was not one of those enthusiasts who look upon every schism from the established articles of faith as damnable and exclude the sceptic from every benefit of humanity and christian forgiveness he could easily comprehend how a man of the most unblemished morals might by the prejudice of education or indispensable attachments be engaged in such a blameworthy and pernicious undertaking and thought that they had already suffered severely for their imprudence he was affected with the account of their diurnal pilgrimage to the seaside which he considered as a pathetic proof of their affliction and invested mr jolter with the agreeable office of going to them with a compliment in his name and begging the honour of drinking a glass with them in the evening they accepted the proposal with great satisfaction and respectful acknowledgment and in the afternoon waited upon the kind inviter who treated them with coffee and would have detained them to supper but they entreated the favour of his company at the house which they frequented so earnestly that he yielded to their solicitations and with his governor was conducted by them to the place where they had provided an elegant repast and regaled them with some of the best claret in france it was easy for them to perceive that their principal guest was no favourer of their state maxims and therefore they industriously avoided every subject of conversation which could give the least offence not but they lamented their own situation which cut them off from all their dearest connections and doomed them to perpetual banishment from their families and friends but they did not even by the most distant hint impeach the justice of that sentence by which they were condemned although one among them who seemed to be about the age of thirty wept bitterly over his misfortune which had involved a beloved wife and three children in misery and distress and in the impatience of his grief cursed his own fate with frantic imprecations his companions with a view of beguiling his sorrow and manifesting their own hospitality at the same time changed the topic of discourse and circulated the bumpers with great assiduity so that all their cares were overwhelmed and forgotten several french drinking catches were sung and mirth and goodfellowship prevailed in the midst of this elevation which commonly unlocks the most hidden sentiment and dispels every consideration of caution and constraint one of the entertainers being more intoxicated than his fellows proposed a toast to which peregrine with some warmth excepted as an unmannerly insult the other maintained his proposition with indecent heat and the dispute beginning to grow very serious the company interposed and gave judgment against their friend who was so keenly reproached and rebuked for his impolite behaviour that he retired in high dudgeon threatening to relinquish their society and branding them with the appellation apostates from the common cause mortified at the behaviour of their companion those that remained were earnest in their apologies to their guests whom they besought to forgive his intemperance assuring them with great confidence that he would upon the recovery of his reflection wait upon them in person and ask pardon for the umbrage he had given pickle was satisfied with their remonstrances resumed his good humour and the night being pretty far advanced resisted all their importunities with which he was entreated to see another bottle go round and was escorted to his own lodgings more than halfseas over next morning about eight oclock he was waked by his valetdechambre who told him that two of the gentlemen with whom he had spent the evening were in the house and desired the favour of being admitted into his chamber he could not conceive the meaning of this extraordinary visit and ordering his man to show them enter into his apartment beheld the person who had affronted him enter with the gentleman who had reprehended his rudeness he who had given the offence after having made an apology for disturbing mr pickle told him that his friend there present had been with him early that morning and proposed the alternative of either fighting with him immediately or coming to beg pardon for his unmannerly deportment overnight that though he had courage enough to face any man in the field in a righteous cause he was not so brutal as to disobey the dictates of his own duty and reflection in consequence of which and not out of any regard to the others menaces which he despised he had now taken the liberty of interrupting his repose that he might as soon as possible atone for the injury he had done him which he protested was the effect of intoxication alone and begged his forgiveness accordingly our hero accepted of this acknowledgment very graciously thanked the other gentleman for the gallant part he had acted in his behalf and perceiving that his companion was a little irritated at his officious interposition effected a reconciliation by convincing him that what he had done was for the honour of the company he then kept them to his breakfast expressed a desire of seeing their situation altered for the better and the chaise being repaired took his leave of his entertainers who came to wish him a good journey and with his attendants left boulogne for the second time chapter xxxvii proceeds for the capital takes up his lodging at bernay where he is overtaken by mr hornbeck whose head he longs to fortify during this days expedition mr jolter took an opportunity of imparting to his pupil the remarks he had made upon the industry of the french as an undeniable proof of which he bade him cast his eyes around and observe with what care every spot of ground was cultivated and from the fertility of that province which is reckoned the poorest in france conceive the wealth and affluence of the nation in general peregrine amazed as well as disgusted at this infatuation answered that what he ascribed to industry was the effect of mere wretchedness the miserable peasants being obliged to plough up every inch of ground to satisfy their oppressive landlords while they themselves and their cattle looked like so many images of famine that their extreme poverty was evident from the face of the country on which there was not one inclosure to be seen or any other object except scanty crops of barley and oats which could never reward the toil of the husbandman that their habitations were no better than paltry huts that in twenty miles of extent not one gentlemans house appeared that nothing was more abject and forlorn than the attire of their country people that the equipage of their travelling chaises was infinitely inferior to that of a dungcart in england and that the postilion who then drove their carriage had neither stockings to his legs nor a shirt to his back the governor finding his charge so intractable resolved to leave him in the midst of his own ignorance and prejudice and reserve his observations for those who would pay more deference to his opinion and indeed this resolution he had often made and as often broken in the transports of his zeal that frequently hurried him out of the plan of conduct which in his cooler moments he had laid down they halted for refreshment at montreuil and about seven in the evening arrived at a village called bernay where while they waited for fresh horses they were informed by the landlord that the gates of abbeville were shut every night punctually at eight oclock so that it would be impossible for them to get admittance he said there was not another place of entertainment on the road where they could pass the night and therefore as a friend he advised them to stay at his house where they would find the best of accommodation and proceed upon their journey betimes in the morning mr jolter though he had travelled on that road before could not recollect whether or not mine host spoke truth but his remonstrance being very plausible our hero determined to follow his advice and being conducted into an apartment asked what they could have for supper the landlord mentioned everything that was eatable in the house and the whole being engrossed for the use of him and his attendants he amused himself till such time as it should be dressed in strolling about the house which stands in a very rural situation while he thus loitered away the time that hung heavy on his hands another chaise arrived at the inn and upon inquiry he found that the newcomers were mr hornbeck and his lady the landlord conscious of his inability to entertain this second company came and begged with great humiliation that mr pickle would spare them some part of the victuals he had bespoken but he refused to part with so much as the wing of a partridge though at the same time he sent his compliments to the strangers and giving them to understand how ill the house was provided for their reception invited them to partake of his supper mr hornbeck who was not deficient in point of politeness and extremely well disposed for a relishing meal which he had reason to expect from the savoury steam that issued from the kitchen could not resist this second instance of our young gentlemans civility which he acknowledged in a message importing that he and his wife would do themselves the pleasure of profiting by his courteous offer peregrines cheeks glowed when he found himself on the eve of being acquainted with mrs hornbeck of whose heart he had already made a conquest in imagination and he forthwith set his invention at work to contrive some means of defeating her husbands vigilance when supper was ready he in person gave notice to his guests and leading the lady into his apartment seated her in an elbowchair at the upper end of the table squeezing her hand and darting a most insidious glance at the same time this abrupt behaviour he practised on the presumption that a lady of her breeding was not to be addressed with the tedious forms that must be observed in ones advances to a person of birth and genteel education in all probability his calculation was just for mrs hornbeck gave no signs of discontent at this sort of treatment but on the contrary seemed to consider it as a proof of the young gentlemans regard and though she did not venture to open her mouth three times during the whole repast she showed herself particularly well satisfied with her entertainer by sundry sly and significant looks while her husbands eyes were directed another way and divers loud peals of laughter signifying her approbation of the sallies which he uttered in the course of their conversation her spouse began to be very uneasy at the frank demeanour of his yokefellow whom he endeavoured to check in her vivacity by assuming a severity of aspect but whether she obeyed the dictates of her own disposition which perhaps was merry and unreserved or wanted to punish mr hornbeck for his jealousy of temper certain it is her gaiety increased to such a degree that her husband was grievously alarmed and incensed at her conduct and resolved to make her sensible of his displeasure by treading in secret upon her toes he was however so disconcerted by his indignation that he mistook his mark and applied the sharp heel of his shoe to the side of mr jolters foot comprehending his little toe that was studded with an angry corn which he invaded with such a sudden jerk that the governor unable to endure the torture in silence started up and dancing on the floor roared hideously with repeated bellowings to the enjoyment of peregrine and the lady who laughed themselves almost into convulsions at the joke hornbeck confounded at the mistake he had committed begged pardon of the injured tutor with great contrition protesting that the blow he had so unfortunately received was intended for an ugly cur which he thought had posted himself under the table it was lucky for him that there was actually a dog in the room to justify this excuse which jolter admitted with the tears running over his cheeks and the economy of the table was recomposed as soon however as the strangers could with decency withdraw this suspicious husband took his leave of the youth on pretence of being fatigued with his journey after having by way of compliment proposed that they should travel together next day and peregrine handed the lady to her chamber where he wished her good night with another warm squeeze which she returned this favourable hint made his heart bound with a transport of joy he lay in wait for an opportunity of declaring himself and seeing the husband go down into the yard with a candle glided softly into his apartment where he found her almost undressed impelled by the impetuosity of his passion which was still more inflamed by her present luscious appearance and encouraged by the approbation she had already expressed he ran towards her with eagerness crying zounds madam your charms are irresistible and without further ceremony would have clasped her in his arms had she not begged him for the love of god to retire for should mr hornbeck return and find him there she would be undone for ever he was not so blinded by his passion but that he saw the reasonableness of her fear and as he could not pretend to crown his wishes at that interview he avowed himself her lover assured her that he would exhaust his whole invention in finding a proper opportunity for throwing himself at her feet and in the mean time he ravished sundry small favours which she in the hurry of her fright could not withhold from his impudence of address having thus settled the preliminaries he withdrew to his own chamber and spent the whole night in contriving stratagems to elude the jealous caution of his fellowtraveller chapter xxxviii they set out in company breakfast at abbeville dine at amiens and about eleven oclock arrive at chantilly where peregrine executes a plan which he had concerted upon hornbeck the whole company by agreement rose and departed before day and breakfasted at abbeville where they became acquainted with the finesse of their bernay landlord who had imposed upon them in affirming that they would not have been admitted after the gates were shut from thence they proceeded to amiens where they dined and were pestered by begging friars and the roads being deep it was eleven oclock at night before they reached chantilly where they found supper already dressed in consequence of having despatched the valetdechambre before them on horseback the constitution of hornbeck being very much impaired by a life of irregularity he found himself so fatigued with his days journey which amounted to upwards of a hundred miles that when he sat down at table he could scarce sit upright and in less than three minutes began to nod in his chair peregrine who had foreseen and provided for this occasion advised him to exhilarate his spirits with a glass of wine and the proposal being embraced tipped his valetdechambre the wink who according to the instructions he had received qualified the burgundy with thirty drops of laudanum which this unfortunate husband swallowed in one glass the dose cooperating with his former drowsiness lulled him so fast to sleep as it were instantaneously that it was found necessary to convey him to his own chamber where his footman undressed and put him to bed nor was jolter naturally of a sluggish disposition able to resist his propensity to sleep without suffering divers dreadful yawns which encouraged his pupil to administer the same dose to him which had operated so successfully upon the other argus this cordial had not such gentle effect upon the rugged organs of jolter as upon the more delicate nerves of hornbeck but discovered itself in certain involuntary startings and convulsive motions in the muscles of his face and when his nature at length yielded to the power of this medicine he sounded the trumpet so loud through his nostrils that our adventurer was afraid the noise would wake his other patient and consequently the accomplishment of his aim the governor was therefore committed to the care of pipes who lugged him into the next room and having stripped off his clothes tumbled him into his nest while the two lovers remained at full liberty to indulge their mutual passion peregrine in the impatience of his inclination would have finished the fate of hornbeck immediately but his inamorata disapproved of his intention and represented that their being together by themselves for any length of time would be observed by her servant who was kept as a spy upon her actions so that they had recourse to another scheme which was executed in this manner he conducted her into her own apartment in presence of her footman who lighted them thither and wishing her good rest returned to his own chamber where he waited till everything was quiet in the house then stealing softly to her door which had been left open for his admission in the dark he found the husband still secure in the embraces of sleep and the lady in a loose gown ready to seal his happiness he conveyed her to his own chamber but his guilty passion was not gratified the opium which had been given to jolter together with the wine he had drunk produced such a perturbation in his fancy that he was visited with horrible dreams and among other miserable situations imagined himself in danger of perishing in the flames which he thought had taken hold on his apartment this vision made such an impression upon his faculties that he alarmed the whole house with repeated cries of fire fire and even leaped out of his bed though he still continued fast asleep the lovers were very disagreeably disturbed by this dreadful exclamation and mrs hornbeck running in great confusion to the door had the mortification to see the footman with a light in his hand enter her husbands chamber in order to give him notice of this accident she knew that she would be instantly missed and could easily divine the consequence unless her invention could immediately trump up some plausible excuse for her absence women are naturally fruitful of expedients in cases of such emergency she employed but a few seconds in recollection and rushing directly towards the apartment of the governor who still continued to hallo in the same note exclaimed in a screaming tone lord have mercy upon us where where by this time all the servants were assembled in strange attire peregrine burst into jolters room and seeing him stalking in his shirt with his eyes shut bestowed such a slap upon his back as in a moment dissolved his dream and restored him to the use of his senses he was astonished and ashamed at being discovered in such an indecent attitude and taking refuge under the clothes asked pardon of all present for the disturbance he had occasioned soliciting with great humility the forgiveness of the lady who to a miracle counterfeited the utmost agitation of terror and surprise meanwhile hornbeck being awaked by the repeated efforts of his man no sooner understood that his wife was missing than all the chimeras of jealousy taking possession of his imagination he started up in a sort of frenzy and snatching his sword flew straight to peregrines chamber where though he found not that which he looked for he unluckily perceived an underpetticoat which his wife had forgot in the hurry of her retreat this discovery added fuel to the flame of his resentment he seized the fatal proof of his dishonour and meeting his spouse in her return to bed presented it to her view with a most expressive countenance madam you have dropped your underpetticoat in the next room mrs hornbeck who inherited from nature a most admirable presence of mind looked earnestly at the object in question and with incredible serenity of countenance affirmed that the petticoat must belong to the house for she had none such in her possession peregrine who walked behind her hearing this asseveration immediately interposed and pulling hornbeck by the sleeve into his chamber gadszooks said he what business had you with that petticoat cant you let a young fellow enjoy a little amour with an innkeepers daughter without exposing his infirmities to your wife pshaw thats so malicious because you have quitted these adventures yourself to spoil the sport of other people the poor husband was so confounded at the effrontery of his wife and this cavalier declaration of the young man that his faith began to waver he distrusted his own conscious diffidence of temper which that he might not expose he expressed no doubts of peregrines veracity but asking pardon for the mistake he had committed retired he was not yet satisfied with the behaviour of his ingenious helpmate but on the contrary determined to inquire more minutely into the circumstances of this adventure which turned out so little to his satisfaction that he ordered his servant to get everything ready for his departure by break of day and when our adventurer rose next morning he found that his fellowtravellers were gone above three hours though they had agreed to stay all the forenoon with a view of seeing the prince of condes palace and to proceed all together for paris in the afternoon peregrine was a little chagrined when he understood that he was so suddenly deprived of this untasted morsel and jolter could not conceive the meaning of their abrupt and uncivil disappearance which after many profound conjectures he accounted for by supposing that hornbeck was some sharper who had run away with an heiress whom he found it necessary to conceal from the inquiry of her friends the pupil who was well assured of the true motive allowed his governor to enjoy the triumph of his own penetration and consoled himself with the hope of seeing his dulcinea again at some of the public places in paris which he proposed to frequent thus comforted he visited the magnificent stables and palace of chantilly and immediately after dinner set out for paris where they arrived in the evening and hired apartments at an hotel in the faubourg st germaine not far from the playhouse chapter xxxix he is involved in an adventure at paris and taken prisoner by the city guard becomes acquainted with a french nobleman who introduces him in the beau monde they were no sooner settled in these lodgings than our hero wrote to his uncle an account of their safe arrival and sent another letter to his friend gauntlet with a very tender billet inclosed for his dear emilia to whom he repeated all his former vows of constancy and love the next care that engrossed him was that of bespeaking several suits of clothes suitable to the french mode and in the mean time he never appeared abroad except in the english coffeehouse where he soon became acquainted with some of his own countrymen who were at paris on the same footing with himself the third evening after his journey he was engaged in a party of those young sparks at the house of a noted traiteur whose wife was remarkably handsome and otherwise extremely well qualified for alluring customers to her house to this lady our young gentleman was introduced as a stranger fresh from england and he was charmed with her personal accomplishments as well as with the freedom and gaiety of her conversation her frank deportment persuaded him that she was one of those kind creatures who granted favours to the best bidder on this supposition he began to be so importunate in his addresses that the fair bourgeoise was compelled to cry aloud in defence of her own virtue her husband ran immediately to her assistance and finding her in a very alarming situation flew upon her ravisher with such fury that he was fain to quit his prey and turn against the exasperated traiteur whom he punished without mercy for his impudent intrusion the lady seeing her yokefellow treated with so little respect espoused his cause and fixing her nails in his antagonists face sacrificed all one side of his nose the noise of this encounter brought all the servants of the house to the rescue of their master and peregrines company opposing them a general battle ensued in which the french were totally routed the wife insulted and the husband kicked downstairs the publican enraged at the indignity which had been offered to him and his family went out into the street and implored the protection of the guet or city guard which having heard his complaint fixed their bayonets and surrounded the door to the number of twelve or fourteen the young gentlemen flushed with their success and considering the soldiers as so many london watchmen whom they had often put to flight drew their swords and sallied out with peregrine at their head whether the guard respected them as foreigners or inexperienced youths intoxicated with liquor they opened to right and left and gave them room to pass without opposition this complaisance which was the effect of compassion being misinterpreted by the english leader he out of mere wantonness attempted to trip up the heels of the soldier that stood next him but failed in the execution and received a blow on his breast with the buttend of a fusil that made him stagger several paces backward incensed at this audacious application the whole company charged the detachment sword in hand and after an obstinate engagement in which divers wounds were given and received every soul of them was taken and conveyed to the mainguard the commanding officer being made acquainted with the circumstances of the quarrel in consideration of their youth and national ferocity for which the french make large allowances set them all at liberty after having gently rebuked them for the irregularity and insolence of their conduct so that all our hero acquired by his gallantry and courage was a number of scandalous marks upon his visage that confined him a whole week to his chamber it was impossible to conceal this disaster from mr jolter who having obtained intelligence of the particulars did not fail to remonstrate against the rashness of the adventure which he observed must have been fatal to them had their enemies been other than frenchmen who of all people under the sun most rigorously observe the laws of hospitality as the governors acquaintance lay chiefly among irish and english priests and a set of low people who live by making themselves necessary to strangers either in teaching the french language or executing small commissions with which they are intrusted he was not the most proper person in the world for regulating the taste of a young gentleman who travelled for improvement in expectation of making a figure one day in his own country being conscious of his own incapacity he contented himself with the office of a steward and kept a faithful account of all the money that was disbursed in the course of their family expense not but that he was acquainted with all the places which were visited by strangers on their first arrival at paris and he knew to a liard what was commonly given to the swiss of each remarkable hotel though with respect to the curious painting and statuary that everywhere abounded in that metropolis he was more ignorant than the domestic that attends for a livre a day in short mr jolter could give a very good account of the stages on the road and save the expense of antoninis detail of the curiosities in paris he was a connoisseur in ordinaries from twelve to fiveandthirty livres knew all the rates of fiacre and remise could dispute with a tailleur or a traiteur upon the articles of his bill and scold the servants in tolerable french but the laws customs and genius of the people the characters of individuals and scenes of polished life were subjects which he had neither opportunities to observe inclination to consider nor discernment to distinguish all his maxims were the suggestions of pedantry and prejudice so that his perception was obscured his judgment biased his address awkward and his conversation absurd and unentertaining yet such as i have represented this tutor are the greatest part of those animals who lead raw boys about the world under the denomination of travelling governors peregrine therefore being perfectly well acquainted with the extent of mr jolters abilities never dreamt of consulting him in the disposition of his conduct but parcelled out his time to the dictates of his own reflection and the information and direction of his companions who had lived longer in france and consequently were better acquainted with the pleasures of the place as soon as he was in a condition to appear a la francaise he hired a genteel chariot by the month made the tour of the luxembourg gallery palais royal all the remarkable hotels churches and celebrated places in paris visited st cloud marli versailles trianon st germaine and fountainebleau enjoyed the opera italian and french comedy and seldom failed of appearing in the public walks in hopes of meeting with mrs hornbeck or some adventure suited to his romantic disposition he never doubted that his person would attract the notice of some distinguished inamorata and was vain enough to believe that few female hearts were able to resist the artillery of his accomplishments should he once find an opportunity of planting it to advantage he presented himself however at all the spectacles for many weeks without reaping the fruits of his expectation and began to entertain a very indifferent idea of the french discernment which had overlooked him so long when one day in his way to the opera his chariot was stopped by an embarrass in the street occasioned by two peasants who having driven their carts against each other quarrelled and went to loggerheads on the spot such a rencounter is so uncommon in france that the people shut up their shops and from their windows threw cold water upon the combatants with a view of putting an end to the battle which was maintained with great fury and very little skill until one of them receiving an accidental fall the other took the advantage of this misfortune and fastening upon him as he lay began to thump the pavement with his head our heros equipage being detained close by the field of this contention pipes could not bear to see the laws of boxing so scandalously transgressed and leaping from his station pulled the offender from his antagonist whom he raised up and in the english language encouraged to a second essay instructing him at the same time by clenching his fists according to art and putting himself in a proper attitude thus confirmed the enraged carman sprang upon his foe and in all appearance would have effectually revenged the injury he had sustained if he had not been prevented by the interposition of a lacquey belonging to a nobleman whose coach was obliged to halt in consequence of the dispute this footman who was distinguished by a cane descending from his post without the least ceremony or expostulation began to employ his weapon upon the head and shoulders of the peasant who had been patronized by pipes upon which thomas resenting such ungenerous behaviour bestowed such a stomacher upon the officious intermeddler as discomposed the whole economy of his entrails and obliged him to discharge the interjection ah with demonstrations of great anguish and amazement the other two footmen who stood behind the coach seeing their fellowservant so insolently assaulted flew to his assistance and rallied a most disagreeable shower upon the head of his aggressor who had no means of diversion or defence peregrine though he did not approve of toms conduct could not bear to see him so roughly handled especially as he thought his own honour concerned in the fray and therefore quitting his machine came to the rescue of his attendant and charged his adversaries sword in hand two of them no sooner perceived this reinforcement than they betook themselves to flight and pipes having twisted the cane out of the hands of the third belaboured him so unmercifully that our hero thought proper to interpose his authority in his behalf the common people stood aghast at this unprecedented boldness of pickle who understanding that the person whose servants he had disciplined was a general and prince of the blood went up to the coach and asked pardon for what he had done imputing his own behaviour to his ignorance of the others quality the old nobleman accepted of his apology with great politeness thanking him for the trouble he bad taken to reform the manners of his domestics and guessing from our youths appearance that he was some stranger of condition very courteously invited him into the coach on the supposition that they were both going to the opera pickle gladly embraced this opportunity of becoming acquainted with a person of such rank and ordering his own chariot to follow accompanied the count to his loge where he conversed with him during the whole entertainment he soon perceived that peregrine was not deficient in spirit or sense and seemed particularly pleased with his engaging manner and easy deportment qualifications for which the english nation is by no means remarkable in france and therefore the more conspicuous and agreeable in the character of our hero whom the nobleman carried home that same evening and introduced to his lady and several persons of fashion who supped at his house peregrine was quite captivated by their affable behaviour and the vivacity of their discourse and after having been honoured with particular marks of consideration took his leave fully determined to cultivate such a valuable acquaintance his vanity suggested that now the time was come when he should profit by his talents among the fair sex on whom he resolved to employ his utmost art and address with this view he assiduously engaged in all parties to which he had access by means of his noble friend who let slip no opportunity of gratifying his ambition he for some time shared in all his amusements and was entertained in many of the best families of france but he did not long enjoy that elevation of hope which had flattered his imagination he soon perceived that it would be impossible to maintain the honourable connections he had made without engaging every day at quadrille or in other words losing his money for every person of rank whether male or female was a professed gamester who knew and practised all the finesse of the art of which he was entirely ignorant besides he began to find himself a mere novice in french gallantry which is supported by an amazing volubility of tongue and obsequious and incredible attention to trifles a surprising faculty of laughing out of pure complaisance and a nothingness of conversation which he could never attain in short our hero who among his own countrymen would have passed for a sprightly entertaining fellow was considered in the brilliant assemblies of france as a youth of a very phlegmatic disposition no wonder then that his pride was mortified at his own want of importance which he did not fail to ascribe to their defect in point of judgment and taste he conceived a disgust at the mercenary conduct as well as the shallow intellects of the ladies and after he had spent some months and a round sum of money in fruitless attendance and addresses he fairly quitted the pursuit and consoled himself with the conversation of a merry fille de joie whose good graces he acquired by an allowance of twenty louis per month that he might the more easily afford this expense he dismissed his chariot and french lacquey at the same time he then entered himself in a noted academy in order to finish his exercises and contracted an acquaintance with a few sensible people whom he distinguished at the coffeehouse and ordinary to which he resorted and who contributed not a little to the improvement of his knowledge and taste for prejudice apart it must be owned that france abounds with men of consummate honour profound sagacity and the most liberal education from the conversation of such he obtained a distinct idea of their government and constitution and though he could not help admiring the excellent order and economy of their police the result of all his inquiries was selfcongratulation on his title to the privileges of a british subject indeed this invaluable birthright was rendered conspicuous by such flagrant occurrences which fell every day almost under his observation that nothing but the grossest prejudice could dispute its existence chapter xl acquires a distinct idea of the french government quarrels with a mousquetaire whom he afterwards fights and vanquishes after having punished him for interfering in his amorous recreations among many other instances of the same nature i believe it will not be amiss to exhibit a few specimens of their administration which happened during his abode at paris that those who have not the opportunity of observing for themselves or are in danger of being influenced by misrepresentation may compare their own condition with that of their neighbours and do justice to the constitution under which they live a lady of distinguished character having been lampooned by some obscure scribbler who could not be discovered the ministry in consequence of her complaint ordered no fewer than fiveandtwenty abbes to be apprehended and sent to the bastille on the maxim of herod when he commanded the innocents to be murdered hoping that the principal object of his cruelty would not escape in the general calamity and the friends of those unhappy prisoners durst not even complain of the unjust persecution but shrugged up their shoulders and in silence deplored their misfortune uncertain whether or not they should ever set eyes on them again about the same time a gentleman of family who had been oppressed by a certain powerful duke that lived in the neighbourhood found means to be introduced to the king who receiving his petition very graciously asked in what regiment he served and when the memorialist answered that he had not the honour of being in the service returned the paper unopened and refused to hear one circumstance of his complaint so that far from being redressed he remained more than ever exposed to the tyranny of his oppressors nay so notorious is the discouragement of all those who presume to live independent of court favour and connections that one of the gentlemen whose friendship peregrine cultivated frankly owned he was in possession of a most romantic place in one of the provinces and deeply enamoured of a country life and yet he durst not reside upon his own estate lest by slackening in his attendance upon the great who honoured him with their protection he should fall a prey to some rapacious intendant as for the common people they are so much inured to the scourge and insolence of power that every shabby subaltern every beggarly cadet of the noblesse every low retainer to the court insults and injures them with impunity a certain ecuyer or horsedealer belonging to the king being one day under the hands of a barber who happened to cut the head of a pimple on his face he started up and drawing his sword wounded him desperately in the shoulder the poor tradesman hurt as he was made an effort to retire and was followed by this barbarous assassin who not contented with the vengeance he had taken plunged his sword a second time into his body and killed him on the spot having performed this inhuman exploit he dressed himself with great deliberation and going to versailles immediately obtained a pardon for what he had done triumphing in his brutality with such insolence that the very next time he had occasion to be shaved he sat with his sword ready drawn in order to repeat the murder in case the barber should commit the same mistake yet so tamed are those poor people to subjection that when peregrine mentioned this assassination to his own trimmer with expressions of horror and detestation the infatuated wretch replied that without all doubt it was a misfortune but it proceeded from the gentlemans passion and observed by way of encomium on the government that such vivacity is never punished in france a few days after this outrage was committed our youth who was a professed enemy to all oppression being in one of the first loges at the comedy was eyewitness of an adventure which filled him with indignation a tall ferocious fellow in the parterre without the least provocation but prompted by the mere wantonness of pride took hold of the hat of a very decent young man who happened to stand before him and twirled it round upon his head the party thus offended turned to his aggressor and civilly asked the reason of such treatment but he received no answer and when he looked the other way the insult was repeated upon which he expressed his resentment as became a man of spirit and desired the offender to walk out with him no sooner did he thus signify his intention than his adversary swelling with rage cocked his hat fiercely in his face and fixing his hands in his sides pronounced with the most imperious tone hark ye mr round periwig you must know that i am a mousquetaire scarce had this awful word escaped from his lips when the blood forsook the lips of the poor challenger who with the most abject submission begged pardon for his presumption and with difficulty obtained it on condition that he should immediately quit the place having thus exercised his authority he turned to one of his companions and with an air of disdainful ridicule told him he was like to have had an affair with a bourgeois adding by way of heightening the irony egad i believe he is a physician our hero was so much shocked and irritated at this licentious behaviour that he could not suppress his resentment which he manifested by saying to this hector sir a physician may be a man of honour to this remonstrance which was delivered with a very significant countenance the mousquetaire made no other reply but that of echoing his assertion with a loud laugh in which he was joined by his confederates peregrine glowing with resentment called him a fanfaron and withdrew in expectation of being followed into the street the other understood the hint and a rencounter must have ensued had not the officer of the guard who overheard what passed prevented their meeting by putting the mousquetaire immediately under arrest our young gentleman waited at the door of the parterre until he was informed of this interposition and then went home very much chagrined at his disappointment for he was an utter stranger to fear and diffidence on those occasions and had set his heart upon chastising the insolence of this bully who had treated him with such disrespect this adventure was not so private but that it reached the ears of mr jolter by the canal of some english gentlemen who were present when it happened and the governor who entertained a most dreadful idea of the mousquetaires being alarmed at a quarrel the consequence of which might be fatal to his charge waited on the british ambassador and begged he would take peregrine under his immediate protection his excellency having heard the circumstances of the dispute sent one of his gentlemen to invite the youth to dinner and after having assured him that he might depend upon his countenance and regard represented the rashness and impetuosity of his conduct so much to his conviction that he promised to act more circumspectly for the future and drop all thoughts of the mousquetaire from that moment a few days after he had taken this laudable resolution pipes who had carried a billet to his mistress informed him that he had perceived a laced hat lying upon a marble slab in her apartment and that when she came out of her own chamber to receive the letter she appeared in manifest disorder from these hints of intelligence our young gentleman suspected or rather made no doubt of her infidelity and being by this time well nigh cloyed with possession was not sorry to find she had given him cause to renounce her correspondence that he might therefore detect her in the very breach of duty and at the same time punish the gallant who had the presumption to invade his territories he concerted with himself a plan which was executed in this manner during his next interview with his dulcinea far from discovering the least sign of jealousy or discontent he affected the appearance of extraordinary fondness and after having spent the afternoon with the show of uncommon satisfaction told her he was engaged in a party for fountainebleau and would set out from paris that same evening so that he should not have the pleasure of seeing her again for some days the lady who was very well versed in the arts of her occupation pretended to receive this piece of news with great affliction and conjured him with such marks of real tenderness to return as soon as possible to her longing arms that he went away almost convinced of her sincerity determined however to prosecute his scheme he actually departed from paris with two or three gentlemen of his acquaintance who had hired a remise for a jaunt to versailles and having accompanied them as far as the village of passe he returned in the dusk of the evening on foot he waited impatiently till midnight and then arming himself with a brace of pocketpistols and attended by trusty tom with a cudgel in his hand repaired to the lodgings of his suspected inamorata having given pipes his cue he knocked gently at the door which was no sooner opened by the lacquey than he bolted in before the fellow could recollect himself from the confusion occasioned by his unexpected appearance and leaving tom to guard the door ordered the trembling valet to light him upstairs into his ladys apartment the first object that presented itself to his view when he entered the antechamber was a sword upon the table which he immediately seized exclaiming in a loud and menacing voice that his mistress was false and then in bed with another gallant whom he would instantly put to death this declaration confirmed by many terrible oaths he calculated for the hearing of his rival who understanding his sanguinary purpose started up in great trepidation and naked as he was dropped from the balcony into the street while peregrine thundered at the door for admittance and guessing his design gave him an opportunity of making this precipitate retreat pipes who stood sentinel at the door observing the fugitive descend attacked him with his cudgel and sweating him from one end of the street to the other at last committed him to the guet by whom he was conveyed to the officer on duty in a most disgraceful and deplorable condition meanwhile peregrine having burst open the chamber door found the lady in the utmost dread and consternation and the spoils of her favourite scattered about the room but his resentment was doubly gratified when he learned upon inquiry that the person who had been so disagreeably interrupted was no other than that individual mousquetaire with whom he had quarrelled at the comedy he upbraided the nymph with her perfidy and ingratitude and telling her that she must not expect the continuance of his regard or the appointments which she had hitherto enjoyed from his bounty went home to his own lodgings overjoyed at the issue of the adventure the soldier exasperated at the disgrace he had undergone as well as the outrageous insult of the english valet whom he believed his master had tutored for that purpose no sooner extricated himself from the opprobrious situation he had incurred than breathing vengeance against the author of the affront he came to peregrines apartment and demanded satisfaction upon the ramparts next morning before sunrise our hero assured him he would not fail to pay his respects to him at the time and place appointed and foreseeing that he might be prevented from keeping this engagement by the officious care of his governor who saw the mousquetaire come in he told mr jolter that the frenchman had visited him in consequence of an order he had received from his superiors to make an apology for his rude behaviour to him in the playhouse and that they had parted very good friends this assurance together with pickles tranquil and unconcerned behaviour through the day quieted the terrors which had begun to take possession of his tutors imagination so that the youth had an opportunity of giving him the slip at night when he betook himself to the lodgings of a friend whom he engaged as his second and with whom he immediately took the field in order to avoid the search which jolter upon missing him might set on foot this was a necessary precaution for as he did not appear at supper and pipes who usually attended him in his excursions could give no account of his motions the governor was dreadfully alarmed at his absence and ordered his man to run in quest of his master to all the places which he used to frequent while he himself went to the commissaire and communicating his suspicions was accommodated with a party of the horseguards who patrolled round all the environs of the city with a view of preventing the rencounter pipes might have directed them to the lady by whose information they could have learned the name and lodgings of the mousquetaire and if he had been apprehended the duel would not have happened but he did not choose to run the risk of disobliging his master by intermeddling in the affair and was moreover very desirous that the frenchman should be humbled for he never doubted that peregrine was more than a match for any two men in france in this confidence therefore he sought his master with great diligence not with a view of disappointing his intention but in order to attend him to the battle that he might stand by him and see justice done while this inquiry was carried on our hero and his companion concealed themselves among some weeds that grew on the edge of the parapet a few yards from the spot where he had agreed to meet the mousquetaire and scarce had the morning rendered objects distinguishable when they perceived their men advancing boldly to the place peregrine seeing them approach sprang forward to the ground that he might have the glory of anticipating his antagonist and swords being drawn all four were engaged in a twinkling pickles eagerness had well nigh cost him his life for without minding his footing he flew directly to his opposite and stumbling over a stone was wounded on one side of his head before he could recover his attitude far from being dispirited at this check it served only to animate him the more being endowed with uncommon agility he retrieved his posture in a moment and having parried a second thrust returned the lunge with such incredible speed that the soldier had not time to resume his guard but was immediately run through the bend of his right arm and the sword dropping out of his hand our heros victory was complete having despatched his own business and received the acknowledgment of his adversary who with a look of infinite mortification answered that his was the fortune of the day he ran to part the seconds just as the weapon was twisted out of his companions hand upon which he took his place and in all likelihood an obstinate dispute would have ensued had they not been interrupted by the guard at sight of whom the two frenchmen scampered off our young gentleman and his friend allowed themselves to be taken prisoners by the detachment which had been sent out for that purpose and were carried before the magistrate who having sharply reprimanded them for presuming to act in contempt of the laws set them at liberty in consideration of their being strangers cautioning them at the same time to beware of such exploits for the future when peregrine returned to his own lodgings pipes seeing the blood trickling down upon his masters neckcloth and solitaire gave evident tokens of surprise and concern not for the consequences of the wound which he did no suppose dangerous but for the glory of old england which he was afraid had suffered in the engagement for he could not help saying with an air of chagrin as he followed the youth into his chamber i do suppose as how you gave that lubberly frenchman as good as he brought chapter xli mr jolter threatens to leave him on account of his misconduct which he promises to rectify but his resolution is defeated by the impetuosity of his passions he meets accidentally with mrs hornbeck who elopes with him from her husband but is restored by the interposition of the british ambassador though mr jolter was extremely well pleased at the safety of his pupil he could not forgive him for the terror and anxiety he had undergone on his account and roundly told him that notwithstanding the inclination and attachment he had to his person he would immediately depart for england if ever he should hear of his being involved in such another adventure for it could not be expected that he would sacrifice his own quiet to an unrequited regard for one who seemed determined to keep him in continual uneasiness and apprehension to this declaration pickle made answer that mr jolter by this time ought to be convinced of the attention he had always paid to his ease and satisfaction since he well knew that he had ever looked upon him in the light of a friend rather than as a counsellor or tutor and desired his company in france with a view of promoting his interest not for any emolument he could expect from his instruction this being the case he was at liberty to consult his own inclinations with regard to going or staying though he could not help owning himself obliged by the concern he expressed for his safety and would endeavour for his own sake to avoid giving him any cause of disturbance in time to come no man was more capable of moralizing upon peregrines misconduct than himself his reflections were extremely just and sagacious and attended with no other disadvantage but that of occurring too late he projected a thousand salutary schemes of deportment but like other projectors he never had interest enough with the ministry of his passions to bring any of them to bear he had in the heyday of his gallantry received a letter from his friend gauntlet with a kind postscript from his charming emilia but it arrived at a very unseasonable juncture when his imagination was engrossed by conquests that more agreeably flattered his ambition so that he could not find leisure and inclination from that day to honour the correspondence which he himself had solicited his vanity had by the time disapproved of the engagement he had contracted in the rawness and inexperience of youth suggesting that he was born to such an important figure in life as ought to raise his ideas above the consideration of any such middling connections and fix his attention upon objects of the most sublime attraction these dictates of ridiculous pride had almost effaced the remembrance of his amiable mistress or at least so far warped his morals and integrity that he actually began to conceive hopes of her altogether unworthy of his own character and her deserts meanwhile being destitute of a toy for the dalliance of his idle hours he employed several spies and almost every day made a tour of the public places in person with a view of procuring intelligence of mr hornbeck with whose wife he longed to have another interview in this course of expectation had he exercised himself a whole fortnight when chancing to be at the hospital of the invalids with a gentleman lately arrived from england he no sooner entered the church than he perceived his lady attended by her spouse who at sight of our hero changed colour and looked another way in order to discourage any communication between them but the young man who was not so easily repulsed advanced with great assurance to his fellowtraveller and taking him by the hand expressed his satisfaction at this unexpected meeting kindly upbraiding him for his precipitate retreat from chantilly before hornbeck could make any reply he went up to his wife whom he complimented in the same manner assuring her with some significant glances he ass extremely mortified that she had put it out of his power to pay his respects to her on his first arrival at paris and then turning to her husband who thought proper to keep close to him in this conference begged to know where he could have the honour of waiting upon him observing at the same time that he himself lived a lacademie de palfrenier mr hornbeck without making any apology for his elopement on the road thanked mr pickle for his complaisance in a very cool and disobliging manner saying that as he intended to shift his lodgings in a day or two he could not expect the pleasure of seeing him until he should he settled when he would call at the academy and conduct him to his new habitation pickle who was not unacquainted with the sentiments of this jealous gentleman did not put much confidence in his promise and therefore made divers efforts to enjoy a little private conversation with his wife but he was baffled in all his attempts by the indefatigable vigilance of her keeper and reaped no other immediate pleasure from this accidental meeting than that of a kind squeeze while he handed her into the coach however as he had been witness to some instances of her invention and was no stranger to the favourable disposition of her heart he entertained some faint hopes of profiting by her understanding and was not deceived in his expectation for the very next forenoon a savoyard called at the academy and put the following billet in his hand coind sur heaving the playsure of meating with you at the osspital of awilheads i take this lubbertea of latin you know that i lotch at the hottail de may cong dangle rouy doghouseten with two postis at the gait naytheir of um very hole ware i shall be at the windore if in kais you will

me leed a hell upon urth being all from deer sur your most umbell servan wile deborah hornbeck our young gentleman was ravished at the receipt of this elegant epistle which was directed a monsr monsr pickhell a la gaddamme de paul freny and did not fail to obey the summons at the hour of assignation when the lady true to her appointment beckoned him upstairs and he had the good fortune to be admitted unseen after the first transports of their mutual joy at meeting she told him that her husband had been very surly and cross ever since the adventure at chantilly which he had not yet digested that he had laid severe injunctions upon her to avoid all commerce with pickle and even threatened to shut her up in a convent for life if ever she should discover the least inclination to renew that acquaintance that she had been cooped up in her chamber since her arrival at paris without being permitted to see the place or indeed any company except that of her landlady whose language she did not understand so that her spirit being broken and her health impaired he was prevailed upon some days ago to indulge her in a few airings during which she had seen the gardens of the luxembourg the tuileries and palais royal though at those times when there was no company in the walks and that it was in one of those excursions she had the happiness of meeting with him finally she gave him to understand that rather than continue longer in such confinement with the man whom she could not love she would instantly give him the slip and put herself under the protection of her lover rash and unthinking as this declaration might be the young gentleman was so much of a gallant that he would not balk the ladys inclinations and too infatuated by his passion to foresee the consequences of such a dangerous step he therefore without hesitation embraced the proposal and the coast being clear they sallied out into the street where peregrine calling a fiacre ordered the coachman to drive them to a tavern but knowing it would not be in his power to conceal her from the search of the lieutenant de police if she should remain within the walls of paris he hired a remise and carried her that same evening to villejuif about four leagues from town where he stayed with her all night and having boarded her on a genteel pension and settled the economy of his future visits returned next day to his own lodgings while he thus enjoyed his success her husband endured the tortures of the damned when he returned from the coffeehouse and understood that his wife had eloped without being perceived by any person in the family he began to rave and foam with rage and jealousy and in the fury of distraction accused the landlady of being an accomplice in her escape threatening to complain of her to the commissaire the woman could not conceive how mrs hornbeck who she knew was an utter stranger to the french language and kept no sort of company could elude the caution of her husband and find any refuge in a place where she had no acquaintance and began to suspect the lodgers emotion was no other than an affected passion to conceal his own practices upon his wife who had perhaps fallen a sacrifice to his jealous disposition she therefore spared him the trouble of putting his menaces into execution by going to the magistrate without any further deliberation and giving an account of what she knew concerning this mysterious affair with certain insinuations against hornbecks character which she represented as peevish and capricious to the last degree while she thus anticipated the purpose of the plaintiff her information was interrupted by the arrival of the party himself who exhibited his complaint with such evident marks of perturbation anger and impatience that the commissaire could easily perceive that he had no share in the disappearance of his wife and directed him to the lieutenant de police whose province it is to take cognizance of such occurrences this gentleman who presides over the city of paris having heard the particulars of hornbecks misfortune asked if he suspected any individual person as the seducer of his yokefellow and when he mentioned peregrine as the object of his suspicion granted a warrant and a detachment of soldiers to search for and retrieve the fugitive the husband conducted them immediately to the academy where our hero lodged and having rummaged the whole place to the astonishment of mr jolter without finding either his wife or the supposed ravisher accompanied them to all the publichouses in the faubourg which having examined also without success he returned to the magistrate in a state of despair and obtained a promise of his making such an effectual inquiry that in three days he should have an account of her provided she was alive and within the walls of paris our adventurer who had foreseen all this disturbance was not at all surprised when his governor told him what had happened and conjured him to restore the woman to the right owner with many pathetic remonstrances touching the heinous sin of adultery the distraction of the unfortunate husband and the danger of incurring the resentment of an arbitrary government which upon application being made would not fail of espousing the cause of the injured he denied with great effrontery that he had the least concern in the matter pretended to resent the deportment of hornbeck whom he threatened to chastise for his scandalous suspicion and expressed his displeasure at the credulity of jolter who seemed to doubt the veracity of his asseveration notwithstanding this confident behaviour jolter could not help entertaining doubts of his sincerity and visiting the disconsolate swain begged he would for the honour of his country as well as for the sake of his own reputation discontinue his addresses to the lieutenant de police and apply to the british ambassador who by dint of friendly admonitions would certainly prevail upon mr pickle to do him all the justice in his power if he was really the author of the injury he had sustained the governor urged this advice with the appearance of so much sympathy and concern promising to cooperate within his influence in his behalf that hornbeck embraced the proposal communicated his purpose to the magistrate who commended the resolution as the most decent and desirable expedient he could use and then waited upon his excellency who readily espoused his cause and sending for the young gentleman that same evening read him such a lecture in private as extorted a confession of the whole affair not that he assailed him with sour and supercilious maxims or severe rebuke because he had penetration enough to discern that peregrines disposition was impregnable to all such attacks but he first of all rallied him on his intriguing genius then in a humorous manner described the distraction of the poor cuckold who he owned was justly punished for the absurdity of his conduct and lastly upon the supposition that it would be no great effort in pickle to part with such a conquest especially after it had been for some time possessed represented the necessity and expediency of restoring her not only out of regard to his own character and that of his nation but also with a view to his ease which would in a little time be very much invaded by such an incumbrance that in all probability would involve him in a thousand difficulties and disgusts besides he assured him that he was already by order of the lieutenant de police surrounded with spies who would watch all his motions and immediately discover the retreat in which he had disposed his prize these arguments and the frank familiar manner in which they were delivered but above all the last consideration induced the young gentleman to disclose the whole of his proceedings to the ambassador and he promised to be governed by his direction provided the lady should not suffer for the step she had taken but be received by her husband with due reverence and respect these stipulations being agreed to he undertook to produce her in eightandforty hours and taking coach immediately drove to the place of her residence where he spent a whole day and night in convincing her of the impossibility of their enjoying each other in that manner then returning to paris he delivered her into the hands of the ambassador who having assured her that she might depend upon his friendship and protection in case she should find herself aggrieved by the jealous temper of mr hornbeck restored her to her legitimate lord whom he counselled to exempt her from that restraint which in all probability had been the cause of her elopement and endeavour to conciliate her affection by tender and respectful usage the husband behaved with great humility and compliance protesting that his chief study should be to contrive parties for her pleasure and satisfaction but no sooner did he regain possession of his stray sheep than he locked her up more closely than ever and after having revolved various schemes for her reformation determined to board her in a convent under the inspection of a prudent abbess who should superintend her morals and recall her to the paths of virtue which she had forsaken with this view he consulted an english priest of his acquaintance who advised him to settle her in a monastery at lisle that she might be as far as possible from the machinations of her lover and gave him a letter of recommendation to the superior of a certain convent in that place for which mr hornbeck set out in a few days with his troublesome charge chapter xlii peregrine resolves to return to england is diverted with the odd characters of two of his countrymen with whom he contracts an acquaintance in the apartments of the palais royal in the mean time our hero received a letter from his aunt importing that the commodore was in a very declining way and longed much to see him at the garrison and at the same time he heard from his sister who gave him to understand that the young gentleman who had for some time made his addresses to her was become very pressing in his solicitations so that she wanted to know in what manner she should answer his repeated entreaties those two considerations determined the young gentleman to retain to his native country a resolution that was far from being disagreeable to jolter who knew that the incumbent on a living which was in the gift of trunnion was extremely old and that it would be his interest to be upon the spot at the said incumbents decease peregrine who had resided about fifteen months in france thought he was now sufficiently qualified for eclipsing most of his contemporaries in england and therefore prepared for his departure with infinite alacrity being moreover inflamed with the most ardent desire of revisiting his friends and renewing his connections particularly with emilia whose heart he by this time thought he was able to reduce on his own terms as he proposed to make the tour of flanders and holland in his return to england he resolved to stay at paris a week or two after his affairs were settled in hope of finding some companion disposed for the same journey and in order to refresh his memory made a second circuit round all the places in that capital where any curious production of art is to be seen in the course of this second examination he chanced to enter the palais royal just as two gentlemen alighted from a fiacre at the gate and all three being admitted at the same time he soon perceived that the strangers were of his own country one of them was a young man in whose air and countenance appeared all the uncouth gravity and supercilious selfconceit of a physician pipinghot from his studies while the other to whom his companion spoke by the appellation of mr pallet displayed at first sight a strange composition of levity and assurance indeed their characters dress and address were strongly contrasted the doctor wore a suit of black and a huge tiewig neither suitable to his own age nor the fashion of the country where he then lived whereas the other though seemingly turned of fifty strutted in a gay summer dress of the parisian cut with a bag to his own grey hair and a red feather in his hat which he carried under his arm as these figures seemed to promise something entertaining pickle entered into conversation with them immediately and soon discovered that the old gentleman was a painter from london who had stolen a fortnight from his occupation in order to visit the remarkable paintings of france and flanders and that the doctor had taken the opportunity of accompanying him in his tour being extremely talkative he not only communicated these particulars to our hero in a very few minutes after their meeting but also took occasion to whisper in his ear that his fellowtraveller was a man of vast learning and beyond all doubt the greatest poet of the age as for himself he was under no necessity of making his own eulogium for he soon gave such specimens of his taste and talents as left pickle no room to doubt of his capacity while they stood considering the pictures in one of the first apartments which are by no means the most masterly compositions the swiss who set up for a connoisseur looking at a certain piece pronounced the word with a note of admiration upon which mr pallet who was not at all a critic in the french language replied with great vivacity manufac you mean and a very indifferent piece of manufacture it is pray gentlemen take notice there is no keeping in those heads upon the background and no relief in the principal figure then youll observe the shadings are harsh to the last degree and come a little closer this way dont you perceive that the foreshortening of that arm is monstrous egad sir the is an absolute fracture in the limb doctor you understand anatomy dont you think that muscle evidently misplaced hark ye mr whatdyecallum turning to the attendant what is the name of the dauber who painted that miserable performance the swiss imagining that he was all this time expressing his satisfaction sanctioned his supposed commendation by exclaiming sans prix right cried pallet i could not recollect his name though his manner is quite familiar to me we have a few pieces in england done by that same sangpree but there they are in no estimation we have more taste among us than to relish the productions of such a miserable gout ant he an ignorant coxcomb doctor the physician ashamed of his companions blunder thought it was necessary for the honour of his wan character to take notice of it before the stranger and therefore answered his question by repeating this line from horace mutato nomine de te fabula narratur the painter who was rather more ignorant of latin than of french taking it for granted that this quotation of his friend conveyed an assent to his opinion very true said he potato domine date this piece is not worth a single potato peregrine was astonished at this surprising perversion of the words and meaning of a latin line which at first he could not help thinking was a premeditated joke but upon second thoughts he saw no reason to doubt that it was the extemporaneous effect of sheer pertness and ignorance at which he broke out into an immoderate fit of laughter pallet believing that the gentlemans mirth was occasioned by his arch animadversion upon the work of sangpree underwent the same emotion in a much louder strain and endeavoured to heighten the jest by more observations of the same nature while the doctor confounded at his impudence and want of knowledge reprimanded him in these words of homer siga me tis allos achaion touton akouse muthon this rebuke the reader will easily perceive was not calculated for the meridian of his friends intellects but uttered with a view of raising his own character in the opinion of mr pickle who retorted this parade of learning in three verses from the same author being part of the speech of polydamas to hector importing that it is impossible for one man to excel in everything the selfsufficient physician who did not expect such a repartee from a youth of peregrines appearance looked upon his reply as a fair challenge and instantly rehearsed forty or fifty lines of the iliad in a breath observing that the stranger made no effort to match this effusion he interpreted his silence into submission then in order to ascertain his victory insulted him with divers fragments of authors whom his supposed competitor did not even know by name while mr pallet stared with admiration at the profound scholarship of his companion our young gentleman far from repining at this superiority laughed within himself at the ridiculous ambition of the pedantic doctor he rated him in his own mind as a mere indexhunter who held the eel of science by the tail and foresaw an infinite fund of diversion in his solemnity and pride if properly extracted by means of his fellowtravellers vanity and assurance prompted by these considerations he resolved to cultivate their acquaintance and if possible amuse himself at their expense in his journey through flanders understanding that they were determined upon the same route in this view he treated them with extraordinary attention and seemed to pay particular deference to the remarks of the painter who with great intrepidity pronounced judgment upon every picture in the palace or in other words exposed his own nakedness in every sentence that proceeded from his mouth when they came to consider the murder of the innocents by le brun the swiss observed that it was un beau morceau and mr pallet replied yes yes one may see with half an eye that it can be the production of no other for bomorsos style both in colouring and drapery is altogether peculiar then his design is tame and his expression antic and unnatural doctor you have seen my judgment of solomon i think i may without presumption but i dont choose to make comparisons i leave that odious task to other people and let my works speak for themselves france to be sure is rich in the arts but what is the reason the king encourages men of genius with honour and rewards whereas in england we are obliged to stand on our own feet and combat the envy and malice of our brethren egad i have a good mind to come and settle here in paris i should like to have an apartment in the louvre with a snug pension of so many thousand livres in this manner did pallet proceed with an eternal rotation of tongue floundering from one mistake to another until it was the turn of poussins seven sacraments to be examined here again the swiss out of the abundance of his zeal expressed his admiration by saying these pieces were impayable when the painter turning to him with an air of exultation pardon me friend there you happen to be mistaken these are none of impayables but done by nicholas pouseen i have seen prints of them in england so that none of your tricks upon travellers mr swiss or swash or whats your name he was much elated by this imaginary triumph of his understanding which animated him to persevere in his curious observations upon all the other pieces of that celebrated collection but perceiving that the doctor manifested no signs of pleasure and satisfaction but rather beheld them with a silent air of disdain he could not digest his indifference and asked with a waggish sneer if ever he had seen such a number of masterpieces before the physician eyeing him with a look of compassion mingled with contempt observed that there was nothing there which deserved the attention of any person acquainted with the ideas of the ancients and that the author of the finest piece now in being was unworthy to clean the brushes of one of those great masters who are celebrated by the greek and roman writers o lad o lad exclaimed the painter with a loud laugh you have fairly brought yourself into a dilemma at last dear doctor for it is well known that your ancient greek and roman artists knew nothing at all of the matter in comparison with our modern masters for this good reason because they had but three or four colours and knew not how to paint with oil besides which of all your old fusty grecians would you put upon a footing with the divine raphael the most excellent michael angelo bona roti the graceful guido the bewitching titian and above all others the sublime rubens the he would have proceeded with a long catalogue of names which he had got by heart for the purpose without retaining the least idea of their several qualifications had not he been interrupted by his friend whose indignation being kindled by the irreverence with which he mentioned the greeks he called him blasphemer goth boeotian and in his turn asked with great vehemence which of those puny moderns could match with panaenus of athens and his brother phidias polycletus of sicyon polygnotus the thracian parrhasius of ephesus surnamed abrodiaitos or the beau and apelles the prince of painters he challenged him to show any portrait of these days that could vie with the helen of zeuxis the heraclean or any composition equal to the sacrifice of iphigenia by timanthes the sicyonian not to mention the twelve gods of asclepiodorus the athenian for which mnason tyrant of elatea gave him about three hundred pounds apiece or homers hell by nicias who refused sixty talents amounting to upwards of eleven thousand pounds and generously made a present of it to his own country he desired him to produce a collection equal to that in the temple of delphos mentioned in the ion of euripides where hercules and his companion iolaus are represented in the act of killing the lernaean hydra with golden sickles kruseais harpais where bellerophon appears on his winged steed vanquishing the firebreathing chimera tan puripneousan and the war of the giants is described here jupiter stands wielding the redhot thunderbolts keraunon amphipuron there pallas dreadful to the view gorgopon brandishes her spear against the huge euceladus and bacchus with slender ivy rods defeats and slays the ges teknon or the mighty son of earth the painter was astonished and confounded at this rhapsody of names and instances which was uttered with surprising eagerness and rapidity suspecting at first that the whole was the creation of his own brain but when pickle with a view of flattering the doctors selfconceit espoused his side of the question and confirmed the truth of everything he advanced mr pallet changed his opinion and in emphatic silence adored the immensity of his friends understanding in short peregrine easily perceived that they were false enthusiasts without the smallest pretensions to taste and sensibility and pretended to be in raptures with they knew not what the one thinking it was incumbent upon him to express transports on seeing the works of those who had been most eminent in their profession whether they did or did not really raise his admiration and the other as a scholar deeming it his duty to magnify the ancients above all competition with an affected fervour which the knowledge of their excellencies never inspired indeed our young gentleman so successfully accommodated himself to the disposition of each that long before their review was finished he was become a particular favourite with both from the palais royal he accompanied them to the cloisters of the carthusians where they considered the history of st bruno by le sueur whose name being utterly unknown to the painter he gave judgment against the whole composition as pitiful and paltry though in the opinion of all good judges it is a most masterly performance having satisfied their curiosity in this place peregrine asked them to favour him with their company at dinner but whether out of caution against the insinuations of one whose character they did not know or by reason of a prior engagement they declined his invitation on pretence of having an appointment at a certain ordinary though they expressed a desire of being further acquainted with him and mr pallet took the freedom of asking his name which he not only declared but promised as they were strangers in paris to wait upon them next day in the forenoon in order to conduct them to the hotel de toulouse and the houses of several other noblemen remarkable for painting or curious furniture they thankfully embraced his proposal and that same day made inquiry among the english gentlemen about the character of our hero which they found so much to their satisfaction that upon their second meeting they courted his good graces without reserve and as they had heard of his intended departure begged earnestly to have the honour of accompanying him through the low countries he assured them that nothing could be more agreeable to him than the prospect of having such fellowtravellers and they immediately appointed a day for setting out on that tour chapter xliii he introduces his new friends to mr jolter with whom the doctor enters into a dispute upon government which had well nigh terminated in open war meanwhile he not only made them acquainted with everything worth seeing in town but attended them in their excursions to all the kings houses within a days journey of paris and in the course of these parties treated them with an elegant dinner at his own apartments where a dispute arose between the doctor and mr jolter which had well nigh terminated in an irreconcilable animosity these gentlemen with an equal share of pride pedantry and saturnine disposition were by the accidents of education and company diametrically opposite in political maxims the one as we have already observed being a bigoted highchurchman and the other a rank republican it was an article of the governors creed that the people could not be happy nor the earth yield its fruits in abundance under a restricted clergy and limited government whereas in the doctors opinion it was an eternal truth that no constitution was so perfect as the democracy and that no country could flourish but under the administration of the mob these considerations being premised no wonder that they happened to disagree in the freedom of an unreserved conversation especially as their entertainer took all opportunities of encouraging and inflaming the contention the first source of their difference was an unlucky remark of the painter who observed that the partridge of which he was then eating had the finest relish of any he had ever tasted his friend owned that the birds were the best of the kind he had seen in france but affirmed that they were neither so plump nor delicious as those that were caught in england the governor considering this observation as the effect of prejudice and inexperience said with a sarcastic smile i believe sir you are very well disposed to find everything here inferior to the productions of your own country true sir answered the physician with a certain solemnity of aspect and not without good reason i hope and pray resumed the tutor why may not the partridges of france be as good as those of england for a very plain reason replied the other because they are not so well fed the iron hand of oppression is extended to all animals within the french dominions even to the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air kunessin oionoisi te pasi egad cried the painter that is a truth not to be controverted for my own part i am none of your titbits one would think but yet there is a freshness in the english complexion a ginseekye i think you call it so inviting to a hungry frenchman that i have caught several in the very act of viewing me with an eye of extreme appetite as i passed and as for their curs or rather their wolves whenever i set eyes on one of em ah your humble servant mr son of a b i am upon my guard in an instant the doctor can testify that their very horses or more properly their live carrion that drew our chaise used to reach back their long necks and smell at us as a couple of delicious morsels this sally of mr pallet which was received with a general laugh of approbation would in all probability have stifled the dispute in embryo had not mr jolter with a selfapplauding simper ironically complimented the strangers on their talking like true englishmen the doctor affronted at the insinuation told him with some warmth that he was mistaken in his conjecture his affections and ideas being confined to no particular country for he considered himself as a citizen of the world he owned himself more attached to england than to any other kingdom but this preference was the effect of reflection and not of prejudice the british constitution approached nearer than any other to that perfection of government the democracy of athens he hoped one day to see revived he mentioned the death of charles the first and the expulsion of his son with raptures of applause inveighed with great acrimony against the kingly name and in order to strengthen his opinion repeated forty or fifty lines from one of the philippics of demosthenes jolter hearing him speak so disrespectfully of the higher powers glowed with indignation he said his doctrines were detestable and destructive of all right order and society that monarchy was of divine institution therefore indefeasible by any human power and of consequence those events in the english history which he had so liberally commended were no other than flagrant instances of sacrilege perfidy and sedition that the democracy of athens was a most absurd constitution productive of anarchy and mischief which must always happen when the government of a nation depends upon the caprice of the ignorant hairbrained vulgar that it was in the power of the most profligate member of the commonwealth provided he was endowed with eloquence to ruin the most deserving by a desperate exertion of his talents upon the populace who had been often persuaded to act in the most ungrateful and imprudent manner against the greatest patriots that their country had produced and finally he averred that the liberal arts and sciences had never flourished so much in a republic as under the encouragement and protection of absolute power witness the augustan age and the reign of louis the fourteenth nor was it to be supposed that genius and merit could ever be so amply recompensed by the individuals or distracted councils of a commonwealth as by the generosity and magnificence of one who had the whole treasury at his own command peregrine who was pleased to find the contest grow warm observed that there seemed to be a good deal of truth in what mr jolter advanced and the painter whose opinion began to waver looked with a face of expectation at his friend who modelling his features into an expression of exulting disdain asked of his antagonist if he did not think that very power of rewarding merit enabled an absolute prince to indulge himself in the most arbitrary license over the lives and fortunes of his people before the governor had time to answer this question pallet broke forth into an exclamation of by the lord that is certainly fact egad that was a homethrust doctor when mr jolter chastising this shallow intruder with a contemptuous look affirmed that though supreme power furnished a good prince with the means of exerting his virtues it would not support a tyrant in the exercise of cruelty and oppression because in all nations the genius of the people must be consulted by their governors and the burthen proportioned to the shoulders on which it is laid else what follows said the physician the consequence is plain replied the governor insurrection revolt and his own destruction for it is not to be supposed that the subjects of any nation would be so abject and pusillanimous as to neglect the means which heaven hath put in their power for their own preservation gadzooks youre in the right sir cried pallet that i grant you must be confessed doctor im afraid we have got into the wrong box this son of paean however far from being of his friends opinion observed with an air of triumph that he would not only demonstrate the sophistry of the gentlemans last allegation by argument and facts but even confute him with his own words jolters eyes kindling at this presumptuous declaration he told his antagonist while his lip quivered with resentment that if his arguments were no better than his breeding he was sure he would make very few converts to his opinion and the doctor with all the insolence of triumph advised him to beware of disputes for the future until he should have made himself more master of his subject peregrine both wished and hoped to see the disputants proceed to arguments of more weight and conviction and the painter dreading the same issue interposed with the usual exclamation of for gods sake gentlemen when the governor rose from table in great dudgeon and left the room muttering some ejaculation of which the word coxcomb only could be distinctly heard the physician being thus left master of the field of battle was complimented on his victory by peregrine and so elevated by his success that he declaimed a full hour on the absurdity of jolters proposition and the beauty of the democratic administration canvassed the whole scheme of platos republic with many quotations from that ideal author touching the to kalon from thence he made a transition to the moral sense of shaftesbury and concluded his harangue with the greatest part of that frothy writers rhapsody which he repeated with all the violence of enthusiastic agitation to the unspeakable satisfaction of his entertainer and the unutterable admiration of pallet who looked upon him as something supernatural and divine so intoxicated was this vain young man with the ironical praises of pickle that he forthwith shook off all reserve and having professed a friendship for our hero whose taste and learning he did not fail to extol intimated in plain terms that he was the only person in these latter ages who possessed that genius that portion of the divinity or ti theion which immortalized the grecian poets that as pythagoras affirmed the spirit of euphorbus had transmigrated into his body he the doctor strangely possessed with the opinion that he himself was inspired by the soul of pindar because making allowance for the difference of languages in which they wrote there was a surprising affinity between his own works and those of that celebrated theban and as a confirmation of this truth he immediately produced a sample of each which though in spirit and versification as different as the odes of horace and our present poetlaureat peregrine did not scruple to pronounce altogether congenial notwithstanding the violence he by this sentence offered to his own conscience and a certain alarm to his pride that was weak enough to be disturbed by the physicians ridiculous vanity and presumption which not contented with displaying his importance in the world of taste and polite literature manifested itself in arrogating certain material discoveries in the province of physic which could not fail to advance him to the highest pinnacle of that profession considering the recommendation of his other talents together with a liberal fortune which he inherited from his father chapter xliv the doctor prepares an entertainment in the manner of the ancients which is attended with divers ridiculous circumstances in a word our young gentleman by his insinuating behaviour acquired the full confidence of the doctor who invited him to an entertainment which he intended to prepare in the manner of the ancients pickle struck with this idea eagerly embraced the proposal which he honoured with many encomiums as a plan in all respects worthy of his genius and apprehension and the day was appointed at some distance of time that the treater might have leisure to compose certain pickles and confections which were not to be found among the culinary preparations of these degenerate days with a view of rendering the physicians taste more conspicuous and extracting from it the more diversion peregrine proposed that some foreigners should partake of the banquet and the task being left to his care and discretion he actually bespoke the company of a french marquis an italian count and a german baron whom he knew to be egregious coxcombs and therefore more likely to enhance the joy of the entertainment accordingly the hour being arrived he conducted them to the hotel where the physician lodged after having regaled their expectations with an elegant meal in the genuine old roman taste and they were received by mr pallet who did the honours of the house while his friend superintended the cook below by this communicative painter the guests understood that the doctor had met with numerous difficulties in the execution of his design that no fewer than five cooks had been dismissed because they could not prevail upon their own consciences to obey his directions in things that were contrary to the present practice of their art and that although he had at last engaged a person by an extraordinary premium to comply with his orders the fellow was so astonished mortified and incensed at the commands he had received that his hair stood on end and he begged on his knees to be released from the agreement he had made but finding that his employer insisted upon the performance of his contract and threatened to introduce him to the commissaire if he should flinch from the bargain he had in the discharge of his office wept sang cursed and capered for two whole hours without intermission while the company listened to this odd information by which they were prepossessed with strange notions of the dinner their ears were invaded by a voice that exclaimed in french for the love of god dear sir for the passion of jesus christ spare me the mortification of the honey and oil their ears still vibrated with the sound when the doctor entering was by peregrine made acquainted with the strangers to whom he in the transports of his wrath could not help complaining of the want of complaisance he had found in the parisian vulgar by which his plan had been almost entirely ruined and set aside the french marquis who thought the honour of his nation was concerned at this declaration professed his sorrow for what had happened so contrary to the established character of the people and undertook to see the delinquents severely punished provided he could be informed of their names or places of abode the mutual compliments that passed on this occasion were scarce finished when a servant coming into the room announced dinner and the entertainer led the way into another apartment where they found a long table or rather two boards joined together and furnished with a variety of dishes the steams of which had such evident effect upon the nerves of the company that the marquis made frightful grimaces under pretence of taking snuff the italians eyes watered the germans visage underwent several distortions of features our hero found means to exclude the odour from his sense of smelling by breathing only through his mouth and the poor painter running into another room plugged his nostrils with tobacco the doctor himself who was the only person present whose organs were not discomposed pointing to a couple of couches placed on each side of the table told his guests that he was sorry he could not procure the exact triclinia of the ancients which were somewhat different from these conveniences and desired they would have the goodness to repose themselves without ceremony each in his respective couchette while he and his friend mr pallet would place themselves upright at the ends that they might have the pleasure of serving those that lay along this disposition of which the strangers had no previous idea disconcerted and perplexed them in a most ridiculous manner the marquis and baron stood bowing to each other on pretence of disputing the lower seat but in reality with a view of profiting by the example of one another for neither of them understood the manner in which they were to loll and peregrine who enjoyed their confusion handed the count to the other side where with the most mischievous politeness he insisted upon his taking possession of the upper place in this disagreeable and ludicrous suspense they continue acting a pantomime of gesticulations until the doctor earnestly entreated them to waive all compliment and form lest the dinner should be spoiled before the ceremonial could be adjusted thus conjured peregrine took the lower couch on the lefthandside laying himself gently down with his face towards the table the marquis in imitation of this pattern though he would have much rather fasted three days than run the risk of discomposing his dress by such an attitude stretched himself upon the opposite place reclining upon his elbow in a most painful and awkward situation with his head raised above the end of the couch that the economy of his hair might not suffer by the projection of his body the italian being a thin limber creature planted himself next to pickle without sustaining any misfortune but that of his stocking being torn by a ragged nail of the seat as he raised his legs on a level with the rest of his limbs but the baron who was neither so wieldy nor supple in his joints as his companions flounced himself down with such precipitation that his feet suddenly tilting up came in furious contact with the head of the marquis and demolished every curl in a twinkling while his own skull at the same instant descended upon the side of his couch with such violence that his periwig was struck off and the whole room filled with pulvilio the drollery of distress that attended this disaster entirely vanquished the affected gravity of our young gentleman who was obliged to suppress his laughter by cramming his handkerchief in his mouth for the bareheaded german asked pardon with such ridiculous confusion and the marquis admitted his apology with such rueful complaisance as were sufficient to awake the mirth of a quietist this misfortune being repaired as well as the circumstances of the occasion would permit and every one settled according to the arrangement already described the doctor graciously undertook to give some account of the dishes as they occurred that the company might be directed in their choice and with an air of infinite satisfaction thus began this here gentlemen is a boiled goose served up in a sauce composed of pepper lovage coriander mint rue anchovies i wish for your sakes gentlemen it was one of the geese of ferrara so much celebrated among the ancients for the magnitude of their livers one of which is said to have weighed upwards of two pounds with this food exquisite as it was did the tyrant heliogabalus regale his hounds but i beg pardon i had almost forgot the soup which i hear is so necessary an article at all tables in france at each end there are dishes of the salacacabia of the romans one is made of parsley pennyroyal cheese pinetops honey brine eggs cucumbers onions and hen livers the other is much the same as the soupmaigre of this country then there is a loin of veal boiled with fennel and carawayseed on a pottage composed of pickle oil honey and flour and a curious hachis of the lights liver and blood of a hare together with a dish of roasted pigeons monsieur le baron shall i help you to a plate of this soup the german who did not at all disapprove of the ingredients assented to the proposal and seemed to relish the composition while the marquis being asked by the painter which of the sillykickabys he chose was in consequence of his desire accommodated with a portion of the soupmaigre and the count in lieu of spoonmeat of which he said he was no great admirer supplied himself with a pigeon therein conforming to the choice of our young gentleman whose example he determined to follow through the whole course of the entertainment the frenchman having swallowed the first spoonful made a full pause his throat swelled as if an egg had stuck in his gullet his eyes rolled and his mouth underwent a series of involuntary contractions and dilatations pallet who looked steadfastly at this connoisseur with a view of consulting his taste before he himself would venture upon the soup began to be disturbed at these motions and observed with some concern that the poor gentleman seemed to be going into a fit when peregrine assured him that these were symptoms of ecstasy and for further confirmation asked the marquis how he found the soup it was with infinite difficulty that his complaisance could so far master his disgust as to enable him to answer altogether excellent upon my honour and the painter being certified of his approbation lifted the spoon to his mouth without scruple but far from justifying the eulogium of his taster when this precious composition diffused itself upon his palate he seemed to be deprived of all sense and motion and sat like the leaden statue of some river god with the liquor flowing out at both sides of his mouth the doctor alarmed at this indecent phenomenon earnestly inquired into the cause of it and when pallet recovered his recollection and swore that he would rather swallow porridge made of burning brimstone than such an infernal mess as that which he had tasted the physician in his own vindication assured the company that except the usual ingredients he had mixed nothing in the soup but some sal ammoniac instead of the ancient nitrum which could not now be procured and appealed to the marquis whether such a succedaneum was not an improvement on the whole the unfortunate petitmaitre driven to the extremity of his condescension acknowledged it to be a masterly refinement and deeming himself obliged in point of honour to evince his sentiments by his practice forced a few more mouthfuls of this disagreeable potion down his throat till his stomach was so much offended that he was compelled to start up of a sudden and in the hurry of his elevation overturned his plate into the bosom of the baron the emergency of this occasion would not permit him to stay and make apologies for his abrupt behaviour so that he flew into another apartment where pickle found him puking and crossing himself with great devotion and a chair at his desire being brought to the door he slipped into it more dead than alive conjuring his friend pickle to make his peace with the company and in particular excuse him to the baron on account of the violent fit of illness with which he had been seized it was not without reason that he employed a mediator for when our hero returned to the diningroom the german got up and was under the hands of his own lacquey who wiped the grease from a rich embroidered waistcoat while he almost frantic with his misfortune stamped upon the ground and in high dutch cursed the unlucky banquet and the impertinent entertainer who all this time with great deliberation consoled him for the disaster by assuring him that the damage done might be repaired with some oil of turpentine and a hot iron peregrine who could scarce refrain from laughing in his face appeased his indignation by telling him how much the whole company and especially the marquis was mortified at the accident and the unhappy salacacabia being removed the places were filled with two pies one of dormice liquored with syrup of white poppies which the doctor had substituted in the room of toasted poppyseed formerly eaten with honey as a dessert and the other composed of a hock of pork baked in honey pallet hearing the first of these dishes described lifted up his hands and eyes and with signs of loathing and amazement pronounced a pie made of dormice and syrup of poppies lord in heaven what beastly fellows those romans were his friend checked him for his irreverent exclamation with a severe look and recommended the veal of which he himself cheerfully ate with such encomiums to the company that the baron resolved to imitate his example after having called for a bumper of burgundy which the physician for his sake wished to have been the true wine of falernum the painter seeing nothing else upon the table which he would venture to touch made a merit of necessity and had recourse to the veal also although he could not help saying that he would not give one slice of the roast beef of old england for all the dainties of a roman emperors table but all the doctors invitations and assurances could not prevail upon his guests to honour the hachis and the goose and that course was succeeded by another in which he told them were divers of those dishes which among the ancients had obtained the appellation of politeles or magnificent that which smokes in the middle said he is a sows stomach filled with a composition of minced pork hogs brains eggs pepper cloves garlic aniseed rue ginger oil wine and pickle on the righthand side are the teats and belly of a sow just farrowed fried with sweet wine oil flour lovage and pepper on the left is a fricassee of snails fed or rather purged with milk at that end next mr pallet are fritters of pompions lovage origanum and oil and here are a couple of pullets roasted and stuffed in the manner of apicius the painter who had by wry faces testified his abhorrence of the sows stomach which he compared to a bagpipe and the snails which had undergone purgation he no sooner heard him mention the roasted pullets than he eagerly solicited a wing of the fowl upon which the doctor desired he would take the trouble of cutting them up and accordingly sent them round while pallet tucked the tablecloth under his chin and brandished his knife and fork with singular address but scarce were they set down before him when the tears ran down his cheeks and he called aloud in a manifest disorder zounds this is the essence of a whole bed of garlic that he might not however disappoint or disgrace the entertainer he applied his instruments to one of the birds and when he opened up the cavity was assaulted by such an irruption of intolerable smells that without staying to disengage himself from the cloth he sprang away with an exclamation of lord jesus and involved the whole table in havoc ruin and confusion before pickle could accomplish his escape he was sauced with the syrup of the dormouse pie which went to pieces in the general wreck and as for the italian count he was overwhelmed by the sows stomach which bursting in the fall discharged its contents upon his leg and thigh and scalded him so miserably that he shrieked with anguish and grinned with a most ghastly and horrible aspect the baron who sat secure without the vortex of this tumult was not at all displeased at seeing his companions involved in such a calamity as that which he had already shared but the doctor was confounded with shame and vexation after having prescribed an application of oil to the counts leg he expressed his sorrow for the misadventure which he openly ascribed to want of taste and prudence in the painter who did not think proper to return and make an apology in person and protested that there was nothing in the fowls which could give offence to a sensible nose the stuffing being a mixture of pepper lovage and assafoetida and the sauce consisting of wine and herringpickle which he had used instead of the celebrated garum of the romans that famous pickle having been prepared sometimes of the scombri which were a sort of tunnyfish and sometimes of the silurus or shadfish nay he observed that there was a third kind called garum haemation made of the guts gills and blood of the thynnus the physician finding it would be impracticable to reestablish the order of the banquet by presenting again the dishes which had been discomposed ordered everything to be removed a clean cloth to be laid and the dessert to be brought in meanwhile he regretted his incapacity to give them a specimen of the aliens or fish meals of the ancients such as the jus diabaton the congereel which in galens opinion is hard of digestion the cornuta or gurnard described by pliny in his natural history who says the horns of many of them were a foot and a half in length the mullet and lamprey that were in the highest estimation of old of which last julius caesar borrowed six thousand for one triumphal supper he observed that the manner of dressing them was described by horace in the account he gives of the entertainment to which maecenas was invited by the epicure nasidienus affertur squillas inter muraena natantes etc and told them that they were commonly eaten with the thus syriacum a certain anodyne and astringent seed which qualified the purgative nature of the fish this learned physician gave them to understand that though this was reckoned a luxurious fish in the zenith of the roman taste it was by no means comparable in point of expense to some preparations in vogue about the time of that absurd voluptuary heliogabalus who ordered the brains of six hundred ostriches to be compounded in one illness by this time the dessert appeared and the company were not a little rejoiced to see plain olives in salt and water butt what the master of the feast valued himself upon was a sort of jelly which he affirmed to be preferable to the hypotrimma of hesychius being a mixture of vinegar pickle and honey boiled to proper consistence and candied assafoetida which he asserted in contradiction to aumelbergius and lister was no other than the laser syriacum so precious as to be sold among the ancients to the weight of a silver penny the gentlemen took his word for the excellency of this gum but contented themselves with the olives which gave such an agreeable relish to the wine that they seemed very well disposed to console themselves for the disgraces they had endured and pickle unwilling to lose the least circumstance of entertainment that could be enjoyed in their company went in quest of the painter who remained in his penitentials in another apartment and could not be persuaded to reenter the banqueting room until peregrine undertook to procure his pardon from those whom he had injured having assured him of this indulgence our young gentleman led him in like a criminal bowing on all hands with all air of humility and contrition and particularly addressing himself to the count to whom he swore in english as god was his saviour he had no intent to affront man woman or child but was fain to make the best of his way that he might not give the honourable company cause of offence by obeying the dictates of nature in their presence when pickle interpreted this apology to the italian pallet was forgiven in very polite terms and even received into favour by his friend the doctor in consequence of our heros intercession so that all the guests forgot their chagrin and paid their respects so piously to the bottle that in a short time the champagne produced very evident effects in the behaviour of all present chapter xlv the painter is persuaded to accompany pickle to a masquerade in womans apparel is engaged in a troublesome adventure and with his companion conveyed to the bastille the painter at the request of pickle who had a design upon the counts sense of hearing favoured the company with the song of bumper squire jones which yielded infinite satisfaction to the baron but affected the delicate ears of the italian in such a manner that his features expressed astonishment and disquiet and by his sudden and repeated journeys to the door it plainly appeared that he was in the same predicament with those who as shakespeare observes when the bagpipe sings in the nose cannot contain their urine for affection with a view therefore of vindicating music from such a barbarous taste mr pallet had no sooner performed his task than the count honoured his friends with some favourite airs of his own country which he warbled with infinite grace and expression though he had not energy sufficient to engage the attention of the german who fell fast asleep upon his couch and snored so loud as to interrupt and totally annul this ravishing entertainment so that they were fain to have recourse again to the glass which made such innovation upon the brain of the physician that he sang divers odes of anacreon to a tune of his own composing and held forth upon the music and recitative of the ancients with great erudition while pallet having found means to make the italian acquainted with the nature of his profession harangued upon painting with wonderful volubility in a language which it was well for his own credit the stranger did not understand at length the doctor was seized with such a qualm that he begged peregrine to lead him to his chamber and the baron being waked retired with the count peregrine being rendered frolicsome with the wine he had drunk proposed that he and pallet should go to a masquerade which he recollected was to be given that night the painter did not want curiosity and inclination to accompany him but expressed his apprehension of losing him in the ball an accident which could not fail to be very disagreeable as he was an utter stranger to the language and the town to obviate this objection the landlady who was of their council advised him to appear in a womans dress which would lay his companion under the necessity of attending him with more care as he could not with decency detach himself from the lady whom he should introduce besides such a connection would hinder the ladies of pleasure from accosting and employing their seducing arts upon a person already engaged our young gentleman foreseeing the abundance of diversion in the execution of this project seconded the proposal with such importunity and address that the painter allowed himself to be habited in a suit belonging to the landlady who also procured for him a mask and domino while pickle provided himself with a spanish dress in this disguise which they put on about eleven oclock did they attended by pipes set out in a fiacre for the ballroom into which pickle led this supposititious female to the astonishment of the whole company who had never seen such an uncouth figure in the appearance of a woman after they had taken a view of all the remarkable masks and the painter had been treated with a of glass of liqueur his mischievous companion gave him the slip and vanishing in an instant returned with another mask and a domino over his habit that he might enjoy pallets perplexity and be at hand to protect him from insult the poor painter having lost his guide was almost distracted with anxiety and stalked about the room in quest of him with such huge strides and oddity of gesture that he was followed by a whole multitude who gazed at him as a preternatural phenomenon this attendance increased his uneasiness to such a degree that he could not help uttering a soliloquy aloud in which he cursed his fate for having depended upon the promise of such a wag and swore that if once he was clear of this scrape he would not bring himself into such a premunire again for the whole kingdom of france divers petitmaitres understanding the mask was a foreigner who in all probability could not speak french made up to him in their turns in order to display their wit and address and teased him with several arch questions to which he made no other reply than no parly francy d your chattering go about your business cant ye among the masks was a nobleman who began to be very free with the supposed lady and attempted to plunge his hand into her bosom hut the painter was too modest to suffer such indecent treatment and when the gallant repeated his efforts in a manner still more indelicate lent him such a box on the ear as made the lights dance before him and created such a suspicion of pallets sex that the frenchman swore he was either a male or a hermaphrodite and insisted upon a scrutiny for the sake of his own honour with such obstinacy of resentment that the nymph was in imminent danger not only of being exposed but also undergoing severe chastisement for having made so free with the princes ear when peregrine who saw and overheard everything that passed thought it was high time to interpose and accordingly asserted his pretensions to the insulted lady who was overjoyed at this proof of his protection the affronted gallant persevered in demanding to know who she was and our hero as strenuously refused to give him that satisfaction so that high words ensued and the prince threatening to punish his insolence the young gentleman who was not supposed to know his quality pointed to the place where his own sword used to hang and snapping his fingers in his face laid hold on the painters arm and led him to another part of the room leaving his antagonist to the meditations of his own revenge pallet having chid his conductor for his barbarous desertion made him acquainted with the difficulty in which he had been involved and flatly telling him he would not put it in his power to give him the slip again held fast by his arm during the remaining part of the entertainment to the no small diversion of the company whose attention was altogether engrossed in the contemplation of such an awkward ungainly stalking apparition at last pickle being tired of exhibiting this rareeshow complied with the repeated desires of his companion and handed her into the coach which he himself had no sooner entered than they were surrounded by a file of musqueteers commanded by an exempt who ordering the coachdoor to be opened took his place with great deliberation while one of his detachment mounted the box in order to direct the driver peregrine at once conceived the meaning of this arrest and it was well for him that he had no weapon wherewith to stand upon his defence for such was the impetuosity and rashness of his temper that had he been armed he would have run all risks rather than surrender himself to any odds whatever but pallet imagining that the officer was some gentleman who had mistaken their carriage for his own desired his friend to undeceive the stranger and when he was informed of the real state of their condition his knees began to shake his teeth to chatter and he uttered a most doleful lamentation importing his fear of being carried to some hideous dungeon of the bastille where he should spend the rest of his days in misery and horror and never see the light of gods sun nor the face of a friend but perish in a foreign land far removed from his family and connexions pickle d d him for his pusillanimity and the exempt hearing a lady bemoan herself so piteously expressed his mortification at being the instrument of giving her such pain and endeavoured to console them by representing the lenity of the french government and the singular generosity of the prince by whose order they were apprehended peregrine whose discretion seemed to forsake him on all such occasions exclaimed with great bitterness against the arbitrary administration of france and inveighed with many expressions of contempt against the character of the offended prince whose resentment far from being noble he mid was pitiful ungenerous and unjust to this remonstrance the officer made no reply but shrugged up his shoulders in silent astonishment at the hardiesse of the prisoner and the fiacre was just on the point of setting out when they heard the noise of a scuffle at the back of the coach and the voice of tom pipes pronouncing ill be d d if i do this trusty attendant had been desired by one of the guards to descend from his station in the rear but as he resolved to share his masters fate he took no notice of their entreaties until they were seconded by force and that he endeavoured to repeal with his heel which he applied with such energy to the jaws of the soldier who first came in contact with him that they emitted a crashing sound like a dried walnut between the grinders of a templar in the pit exasperated at this outrage the other saluted toms posteriors with his bayonet which incommoded him so much that he could no longer keep his post but leaping upon the ground gave his antagonist a chuck under the chin and laid him upon his back then skipping over him with infinite agility absconded among the crowd of coaches till he saw the guard mount before and behind upon his masters fiacre which no sooner set forward than he followed at a small distance to reconnoitre the place where peregrine should be confined after having proceeded slowly through many windings and turnings to a part of paris in which pipes was an utter stranger the coach stopped at a great gate with a wicket in the middle which being opened at the approach of the carriage the prisoners were admitted and the guard returning with the fiacre tom determined to watch in that place all night that in the morning he might make such observations as might be conducive to the enlargement of his master chapter xlvi by the fidelity of pipes jolter is informed of his pupils fate confers with the physician applies to the ambassador who with great difficulty obtains the discharge of the prisoners on certain conditions this plan he executed notwithstanding the pain of his wound and the questions of the cityguard both horse and foot to which he could make no other answer than anglais anglais and as soon as it was light taking an accurate survey of the castle for such it seemed to be into which peregrine and pallet had been conveyed together with its situation in respect to the river he went home to the lodgings and waking mr jolter gave him an account of the adventure the governor wrung his hands in the utmost grief and consternation when he heard this unfortunate piece of news he did not doubt that his pupil was imprisoned in the bastille for life and in the anguish of his apprehension cursed the day on which he had undertaken to superintend the conduct of such an imprudent young man who had by reiterated insults provoked the vengeance of such a mild forbearing administration that he might not however neglect any means in his power to extricate him from his present misfortune he despatched thomas to the doctor with an account of his companions fate that they might join their interest in behalf of the captives and the physician being informed of what had happened immediately dressed himself and repaired to jolter whom he accosted in these words now sir i hope you are convinced of your error in asserting that oppression can never be the effect of arbitrary power such a calamity as this could never have happened under the athenian democracy nay even when the tyrant pisistratus got possession of that commonwealth he durst not venture to rule with such absolute and unjust dominion you shall see now that mr pickle and my friend pallet will fall a sacrifice to the tyranny of lawless power and in my opinion we shall be accessory to the ruin of this poor enslaved people if we bestir ourselves in demanding or imploring the release of our unhappy countrymen as we may thereby prevent the commission of a flagrant crime which would fill up the vengeance of heaven against the perpetrators and perhaps be the means of restoring the whole nation to the unspeakable fruition of freedom for my own part i should rejoice to see the blood of my father spilt in such a glorious cause provided such a victim would furnish me with the opportunity of dissolving the chains of slavery and vindicating that liberty which is the birthright of man then would my name be immortalised among the patriot heroes of antiquity and my memory like that of harmodius and aristogiton be honoured by statues erected at the public expense this rhapsody which was delivered with great emphasis and agitation gave so much offence to jolter that without saying one word he retired in great wrath to his own chamber and the republican returned to his lodging in full hope of his prognostic being verified in the death and destruction of peregrine and the painter which must give rise to some renowned revolution wherein he himself would act a principal part but the governor whose imagination was not quite so warm and prolific went directly to the ambassador whom he informed of his pupils situation and besought to interpose with the french ministry that he and the other british subject might obtain their liberty his excellency asked if jolter could guess at the cause of his imprisonment that he might be the better prepared to vindicate or excuse his conduct but neither he nor pipes could give the smallest hint of intelligence on that subject though he furnished himself from toms own mouth with a circumstantial account of the manner in which his master had been arrested as well as of his own behaviour and the disaster he had received on that occasion his lordship never doubted that pickle had brought this calamity upon himself by some unlucky prank he had played at the masquerade when he understood that the young gentleman had drunk freely in the afternoon and been so whimsical as to go thither with a man in womans apparel and he that same day waited on the french minister in full confidence of obtaining his discharge but met with more difficulty than he expected the court of france being extremely punctilious in everything that concerns a prince of the blood the ambassador was therefore obliged to talk in very high terms and though the present circumstances of the french politics would not allow them to fall out with the british administration for trifles all the favour he could procure was to promise that pickle should l set at liberty provided he would ask pardon of the prince to whom he bad given offence his excellency thought this was but a reasonable condescension supposing peregrine to have been in the wrong and jolter was admitted to him in order to communicate and reinforce his lordships advice which was that he comply with the terms proposed the governor who did not enter this gloomy fortress without fear and trembling found his pupil in a dismal apartment void of all furniture but a stool and a trucklebed the moment he was admitted he perceived the youth whistling with great unconcern and working with his pencil at the bare wall on which he had delineated a ludicrous figure labelled with the name of the nobleman whom he had affronted and an english mastiff with his leg lifted up in the attitude of making water in his shoe he had been even so presumptuous as to explain the device with satirical inscriptions in the french language which when jolter perused his hair stood on end with affright the very turnkey was confounded and overawed by the boldness of his behaviour which he had never seen matched by any inhabitant of that place and actually joined his friend in persuading him to submit to the easy demand of the minister but our hero far from embracing the counsel of this advocate handed him to the door with great ceremony and dismissed him with a kick on the breeches and to all the supplications and even tears of jolter made no other reply than that he would stoop to no condescension because he had committed no crime but would leave his case to the cognisance and exertion of the british court whose duty it was to see justice done to its own subjects he desired however that pallet who was confined in another place might avail himself of his own disposition which was sufficiently pliable but when the governor desired to see his fellowprisoner the turnkey gave him to understand that he had received no orders relating to the lady and therefore could not admit him into her apartment though he was complaisant enough to tell him that she seemed very much mortified at her confinement and at certain times behaved as if her brain was not a little disordered jolter thus baffled in all his endeavours quitted the bastille with a heavy heart and reported his fruitless negotiation to the ambassador who could not help breaking forth into some acrimonious expressions against the obstinacy and insolence of the young man who he said deserved to suffer for his folly nevertheless he did not desist from his representations to the french ministry which he found so unyielding that he was obliged to threaten in plain terms to make it a national concern and not only wrote to his court for instructions but even advised the council to make reprisals and send some french gentleman in london to the tower this intimation had an effect upon the ministry at versailles who rather than run the risk of incensing a people whom it was neither their interest nor inclination to disoblige consented to discharge the offenders on condition that they should leave paris in three days after their enlargement this proposal was readily agreed to by peregrine who was now a little more tractable and heartily tired of being cooped up in such an uncomfortable abode for the space of three long days without any sort of communication or entertainment but that which his own imagination suggested chapter xlvii peregrine makes himself merry at the expense of the painter who curses his landlady and breaks with the doctor as he could easily conceive the situation of his companion in adversity he was unwilling to leave the place until he had reaped some diversion from his distress and with that view repaired to the dungeon of the afflicted painter to which he had by this time free access when he entered the first object that presented itself to his eye was so uncommonly ridiculous that he could scarce preserve that gravity of countenance which he had affected in order to execute the joke he had planned the forlorn pallet sat upright in his bed in a deshabille that was altogether extraordinary he had laid aside his monstrous hoop together with his stays gown and petticoat wrapped his lappets about his head by way of nightcap and wore his domino as a loose morningdress his grizzled locks hung down about his lacklustre eyes and tawny neck in all the disorder of negligence his gray beard bristled about halfaninch through the remains of the paint with which his visage had been bedaubed and every feature of his face was lengthened to the most ridiculous expression of grief and dismay seeing peregrine come in he started up in a sort of frantic ecstasy and running towards him with open arms no sooner perceived the woeful appearance into which our hero had modelled his physiognomy than he stopped short all of a sudden and the joy which had begun to take possession of his heart was in a moment dispelled by the most rueful presages so that he stood in a most ludicrous posture of dejection like a malefactor at the old bailey when sentence is about to be pronounced pickle taking him by the hand heaved a profound sigh and after having protested that he was extremely mortified at being pitched upon as the messenger of bad news told him with an air of sympathy and infinite concern that the french court having discovered his sex had resolved in consideration of the outrageous indignity he offered in public to a prince of the blood to detain him in the bastille a prisoner for life and that this sentence was a mitigation obtained by the importunities of the british ambassador the punishment ordained by law being no other than breaking alive upon the wheel these tidings aggravated the horrors of the painter to such a degree that he roared aloud and skipped about the room in all the extravagance of distraction taking god and man to witness that he would rather suffer immediate death than endure one years imprisonment in such a hideous place and cursing the hour of his birth and the moment on which he departed from his own country for my own part said his tormentor in a hypocritical tone i was obliged to swallow the bitter pill of making submission to the prince who as i had not presumed to strike him received acknowledgments in consequence of which i shall be this day set at liberty and there is even one expedient left for the recovery of your freedom it is i own a disagreeable remedy but one had better undergo a little mortification than be for ever wretched besides upon second thoughts i begin to imagine that you will not for such a trifle sacrifice yourself to the unceasing horrors of a dungeon especially as your condescension will in all probability be attended with advantages which you could not otherwise enjoy pallet interrupting him with great eagerness begged for the love of god that he would no longer keep him in the torture of suspense but mention that same remedy which he was resolved to follow let it be ever so unpalatable peregrine having thus played upon his passions of fear and hope answered that as the offence was committed in the habit of a woman which was a disguise unworthy of the other sex the french court was of opinion that the delinquent should be reduced to the neuter gender so that there was no alternative at his own option by which he had it in his power to regain immediate freedom what cried the painter in despair become a singer gadzooks and the devil and all that ill rather be still where i am and let myself be devoured by vermin then thrusting out his throat here is my windpipe said he be so good my dear friend as to give it a slice or two if you dont i shall one of these days be found dangling in my garters what an unfortunate rascal i am what a blockhead and a beast and a fool was i to trust myself among such a barbarous ruffian race lord forgive you mr pickle for having been the immediate cause of my disaster if you had stood by me from the beginning according to your promise i should not have been teased by that coxcomb who has brought me to this pass and why did i put on this d d unlucky dress lord curse that chattering jezebel of a landlady who advised such a preposterous disguise a disguise which has not only brought me to this pass but also rendered me abominable to myself and frightful to others for when i this morning signified to the turnkey that i wanted to be shaved he looked at my beard with astonishment and crossing himself muttered his pater noster believing me i suppose to be a witch or something worse and heaven confound that loathsome banquet of the ancients which provoked me to drink too freely that i might wash away the taste of that accursed sillikicaby our young gentleman having heard this lamentation to an end excused himself for his conduct by representing that he could not possibly foresee the disagreeable consequences that attended it and in the mean time strenuously counselled him to submit to the terms of his enlargement he observed that he was now arrived at that time of life when the lusts of the flesh should be entirely mortified within him and his greatest concern ought to be the of his soul to which nothing could more effectually contribute than the amputation which was proposed that his body as well as his mind would profit by the change because he would have no dangerous appetite to gratify and no carnal thoughts to divert him from the duties of his profession and his voice which was naturally sweet would improve to such a degree that he would captivate the ears of all the people of fashion and taste and in a little time be celebrated under the appellation of the english senesino these arguments did not fail to make impression upon the painter who nevertheless started two objections to his compliance namely the disgrace of the punishment and the dread of his wife pickle undertook to obviate these difficulties by assuring him that the sentence would be executed so privately as never to transpire and that his wife could not be so unconscionable after so many years of cohabitation as to take exceptions to an expedient by which she would not only enjoy the conversation of her husband but even the fruits of those talents which the knife would so remarkably refine pallet shook his hand at this last remonstrance as if he thought it would not be altogether convincing to his spouse but yielded to the proposal provided her consent could be obtained just as he signified this condescension the jailer entered and addressing himself to the supposed lady expressed his satisfaction in having the honour to tell her that she was no longer a prisoner as the painter did not understand one word of what he said peregrine undertook the office of interpreter and made his friend believe the jailers speech was no other than an intimation that the ministry had sent a surgeon to execute what was proposed and that the instruments and dressings were prepared in the next room alarmed and terrified at this sudden appointment he flew to the other end of the room and snatching up an earthen chamberpot which was the only offensive weapon in the place put himself in a posture of defence and with many oaths threatened to try the temper of the barbers skull if he should presume to set his nose within the apartment the jailer who little expected such a reception concluded that the poor gentlewoman had actually lost her wits and retreated with precipitation leaving the door open as he went out upon which pickle gathering up the particulars of his dress with great despatch crammed them into pallets arms and taking notice that now the coast was clear exhorted him to follow his footsteps to the gate where a hackneycoach stood for his reception there being no time for hesitation the painter took his advice and without quitting the utensil which in his hurry he forgot to lay down sallied out in the rear of our hero with all the wildness of terror and impatience which may be reasonably supposed to take possession of a man who flies from perpetual imprisonment such was the tumult of his agitation that his faculty of thinking was for the present utterly overwhelmed and he saw no object but his conductor whom he followed by a sort of instinctive impulse without regarding the keepers and sentinels who as he passed with his clothes under one arm and his chamberpot brandished above his head were confounded and even dismayed at the strange apparition during the whole course of this irruption he ceased nor to cry with great vociferation drive coachman drive in the name of god and the carriage had proceeded the length of a whole street before he manifested the least sign of reflection but stared like the gorgons head with his mouth wide open and each particular hair crawling and twining like an animated serpent at length however he began to recover the use of his senses and asked if peregrine thought him now out of all danger of being retaken this unrelenting wag not yet satisfied with the affliction he imposed upon the sufferer answered with an air of doubt and concern that he hoped they would not be overtaken and prayed to god they might not be retarded by a stop of carriages pallet fervently joined in this supplication and they advanced a few yards farther when the noise of a coach at full speed behind them invaded their ears and pickle having looked out of the window withdrew his head in seeming confusion and exclaimed lord have mercy upon us i wish that may not be a guard sent after us methinks i saw the muzzle of a fusil sticking out of the coach the painter hearing these tidings that instant thrust himself half out at the window with his helmet still in his hand bellowing to the coachman as loud as he could roar drive d ye dive to the gates of jericho and the ends of the earth drive you ragamuffin you rascallion you hellhound drive us to the pit of hell rather than we should be taken such a phantom could not pass without attracting the curiosity of the people who ran to their doors and windows in order to behold this object of admiration with the same view that coach which was supposed to be in pursuit of him stopped just as the windows of each happened to be opposite and pallet looking behind and seeing three men standing upon the footboard armed with canes which his fear converted into fusils never doubted that his friends suspicion was just but shaking his jordan at the imaginary guard swore he would sooner die than part with his precious ware the owner of the coach who was a nobleman of the first quality mistook him for some unhappy woman deprived of her senses and ordering his coachman to proceed convinced the fugitive to his infinite joy that this was no more than a false alarm he was not for all that freed from anxiety and trepidation but our young gentleman fearing his brain would not bear a repetition of the same joke permitted him to gain his own lodgings without further molestation his landlady meeting him on the stair was so affected at his appearance that she screamed aloud and betook herself to flight while he cursing her with greet bitterness rushed into the apartment to the doctor who instead of receiving him with cordial embraces and congratulating him upon his deliverance gave evident signs of umbrage and discontent and even plainly told him he hoped to have heard that he and mr pickle had acted the glorious part of cato an event which would have laid the foundation of such noble struggles as could not fail to end in happiness and freedom and that he had already made some progress in an ode that would have immortalised their names and inspired the flame of liberty in every honest breast there said he i would have proved that great talents and high sentiments of liberty do reciprocally produce and assist each other and illustrated my assertions with such notes and quotations from the greek writers as would have opened the eyes of the most blind and unthinking and touched the most callous and obdurate heart o fool to think the man whose ample mind must grasp whatever yonder stars survey pray mr pellet what is your opinion of that image of the minds grasping the whole universe for my own part i cant help thinking it the most happy conception that ever entered my imagination the painter who was not such a flaming enthusiast in the cause of liberty could not brook the doctors reflections which he thought savoured a little too much of indifference and deficiency in point of private friendship and therefore seized the present opportunity of mortifying his pride by observing that the image was without all doubt very grand and magnificent but that he had been obliged for the idea to mr bayes in the rehearsal who values himself upon the same figure conveyed in these words but all these clouds when by the eye of reason graspd etc upon any other occasion the painter would have triumphed greatly upon this detection but such was the flutter and confusion of his spirits under the apprehension of being retaken that without further communication he retreated to his own room in order to resume his own dress which he hoped would alter his appearance in such a manner as to baffle all search and examination while the physician remained ashamed and abashed to find himself convinced of bombast by a person of such contemptible talents he was offended at this proof of his memory and so much enraged at his presumption in exhibiting it that he could never forgive his want of reverence and took every opportunity of exposing his ignorance and folly in the sequel indeed the ties of private affection were too weak to engage the heart of this republican whose zeal for the community had entirely swallowed up his concern for individuals he looked upon particular friendship as a passion unworthy of his ample soul and was a professed admirer of l manlius junius brutus and those later patriots of the same name who shut their ears against the cries of nature and resisted all the dictates of gratitude and humanity chapter xlviii pallet conceives a hearty contempt for his fellowtraveller and attaches himself to pickle who nevertheless persecutes him with his mischievous talent upon the road to flanders in the mean time his companion having employed divers pailfuls of water in cleansing himself from the squalor of jail submitted his face to the barber tinged his eyebrows with a sable hue and being dressed in his own clothes ventured to visit peregrine who was still under the hands of his valetdechambre and who gave him to understand that his escape had been connived at and that the condition of their deliverance was their departure from paris in three days the painter was transported with joy when he learned that he ran no risk of being retaken and far from repining at the terms of his enlargement would have willingly set out on his return to england that same afternoon for the bastille had made such an impression upon him that he started at the sound of every coach and turned pale at the sight of a french soldier in the fulness of his heart he complained of the doctors indifference and related what had passed at their meeting with evident marks of resentment and disrespect which were not at all diminished when jolter informed him of the physicians behaviour when he sent for him to confer about the means of abridging their confinement pickle himself was incensed at his want of bowels and perceiving how much he had sank in the opinion of his fellowtraveller resolved to encourage these sentiments of disgust and occasionally foment the division to a downright quarrel which he foresaw would produce some diversion and perhaps expose the poets character in such a light as would effectually punish him for his arrogance and barbarity with this view he leveled several satirical jokes at the doctors pedantry and want of taste which had appeared so conspicuous in the quotation he had got by heart from ancient authors in his affected disdain of the best pictures of the world which had he been endowed with the least share of discernment he could not have beheld with such insensibility and lastly in his ridiculous banquet which none but an egregious coxcomb devoid of all elegance and sense would have prepared or presented to rational beings in a word our young gentleman played the artillery of his wit against him with such success that the painter seemed to wake from a dream and went home with the most hearty contempt for the person he had formerly adored instead of using the privilege of a friend to enter his apartment without ceremony he sent in his servant with a message importing that he intended to set out from paris the next day in company with mr pickle and desiring to know whether or not he was or would be prepared for the journey the doctor struck with the manner as well as the matter of this intimation went immediately to pallets room and demanded to know the cause of such a sudden determination without his privity or concurrence and when he understood the necessity of their affairs rather than travel by himself he ordered his baggage to be packed up and signified his readiness to conform to the emergency of the case though he was not at all pleased with the cavalier behaviour of pallet to whom he threw out some hints on his own importance and the immensity of his condescension in favouring him with such marks of regard but by this time these insinuations had lost their effect upon the painter who told him with an arch sneer that he did not at all question his learning and abilities and particularly his skill in cookery which he should never forget while his palate retained its function but nevertheless advised him for the sake of the degenerate eaters of these days to spare a little of his sal ammoniac in the next sillykicaby he should prepare and abate somewhat of the devils dung which he had so plentifully crammed into the roasted fowls unless he had a mind to convert his guests into patients with a view of licking himself whole for the expense of the entertainment the physician nettled at these sarcasms eyed him with a look of indignation and disdain and being unwilling to express himself in english lest in the course of the altercation pallet should be so much irritated as to depart without him he vented his anger in greek the painter though by the sound he supposed this quotation to be greek complimented his friend upon his knowledge in the welsh language and found means to rally him quite out of temper so that he retired to his own chamber in the utmost wrath and mortification and left his antagonist exulting over the victory he had won while these things passed between these originals peregrine waited upon the ambassador whom he thanked for his kind interposition acknowledging the indiscretion of his own conduct with such appearance of conviction and promises of reformation that his excellency freely forgave him for all the trouble he had been put to on his account fortified him with sensible advices and assuring him of his continual favour and friendship gave him at parting letters of introduction to several persons of quality belonging to the british court thus distinguished our young gentleman took leave of all his french acquaintance and spent the evening with some of those who had enjoyed the greatest share of his intimacy and confidence while jolter superintended his domestic concerns and with infinite joy bespoke a postchaise and horse in order to convey him from a place where he lived in continual apprehension of suffering by the dangerous disposition of his pupil everything being adjusted according to their plan they and their fellowtravellers next day dined together and about four in the afternoon took their departure in two chaises escorted by the valetdechambre pipes and the doctors lacquey on horseback well furnished with arms and ammunition in case of being attacked by robbers on the road it was about eleven oclock at night when they arrived at senlis which was the place at which they proposed to lodge and where they were obliged to knock up the people of the inn before they could have their supper prepared all the provision in the house was but barely sufficient to furnish one indifferent meal however the painter consoled himself for the quantity with the quality of the dishes one of which was a fricassee of rabbit a preparation that he valued above all the dainties that ever smoked upon the table of the sumptuous heliogabalus he had no sooner expressed himself to this effect than our hero who almost incessantly laying traps for diversion at his neighbours expense laid hold on the declaration and recollecting the story of scipio and the muleteer in gil blas resolved to perpetrate a joke upon the stomach of pallet which seemed well disposed to a hearty supper he accordingly digested his plan and the company being seated at table affected to stare with peculiar eagerness at the painter who had helped himself to a large portion of the fricassee and began to swallow it with infinite relish pallet notwithstanding the keenness of his appetite could not help taking notice of pickles demeanour and making a short pause in the exercise of his grinders you are surprised said he to see me make so much despatch but i was extremely hungry and this is one of the best fricassees i ever tasted the french are very expert in these dishes that i must allow and upon my conscience i would never desire to eat a more delicate rabbit than this that lies upon my plate peregrine made no other reply to this encomium than the repetition of the word rabbit with a note of admiration and such a significant shake of the head as effectually alarmed the other who instantly suspended the action of his jaws and with the morsel half chewed in his mouth stared round him with a certain stolidity of apprehension which is easier conceived than described until his eyes encountered the countenance of thomas pipes who being instructed and posted opposite to him for the occasion exhibited an arch grin that completed the painters disorder afraid of swallowing his mouthful and ashamed to dispose of it any other way he sat some time in a most distressed state of suspense and being questioned by mr jolter touching his calamity made a violent effort of the muscles of his gullet which with difficulty performed their office and then with great confusion and concern asked if mr pickle suspected the rabbits identity the young gentleman assuming a mysterious air pretended ignorance of the matter observing that he was apt to suspect all dishes of that kind since he had been informed of the tricks which were commonly played at inns in france italy and spain and recounted three passage in gil blas which we have hinted it above saying he did not pretend to be a connoisseur in animals but the legs of the creature which composed that diet which composed the fricassee did not in his opinion resemble those of the rabbits he had usually seen this observation had an evident effect upon the features of the painter who with certain signs of loathing and astonishment exclaimed lord jesus and appealed to pipes for the discovery of the truth by asking if he knew anything of the affair tom very gravely replied he did suppose the food was wholesome enough for he had seen the skin and feet of a special ramcat new flayed hanging upon the door of a small pantry adjoining to the kitchen before this sentence was uttered pallets belly seemed to move in contact with his backbone his colour changed no part but the whites of his eyes were to be seen he dropped his lower jaw and fixing his hands in his sides retched with such convulsive agonies as amazed and disconcerted the whole company and what augmented his disorder was the tenacious retention of the stomach which absolutely refused to part with its contents notwithstanding all the energy of his abhorrence which threw him into a cold sweat and almost into a swoon pickle alarmed at his condition assured him it was a genuine rabbit and that he had tutored pipes to say otherwise for the jokes sake but this confession he considered as a friendly artifice of pickles compassion and therefore it had little effect upon his constitution by the assistance however of a large bumper of brandy his spirits were recruited and his recollection so far recovered that he was able to declare with divers contortions of face that the dish had a rankness of taste which he had imparted partly to the nature of the french covey and partly to the composition of their sauces then he inveighed against the infamous practices of french publicans attributing such imposition to their oppressive government which kept them so necessitous that they were tempted to exercise all manner of knavery upon their unwary guests jolter who could not find in his heart to let slip any opportunity of speaking in favour of the french told him that he was a very great stranger to their police else he would know that if upon information to the magistrate it should appear that any traveller native or foreigner had been imposed upon or illtreated by a publican the offender would be immediately obliged to shut up his house and if his behaviour had been notorious he himself would be sent to the galleys without the least hesitation and as for the dish which has been made the occasion of your present disorder said he i will take upon me to affirm it was prepared of a genuine rabbit which was skinned in my presence and in confirmation of what i assert though such fricassees are not the favourites of my taste i will eat a part of this without scruple so saying he swallowed several mouthfuls of the questioned coney and pallet seemed to eye it again with inclination nay he even resumed his knife and fork and being just on the point of applying them was seized with another qualm of apprehension that broke out in an exclamation of after all mr jolter if it should be a real ramcat lord have mercy upon me here is one of the claws with these words he presented the tip of a toe of which pipes had snipped off five or six from a duck that was roasted and purposely scattered them in the fricassee and the governor could not behold this testimonial without symptoms of uneasiness and remorse so that he and the painter sat silenced and abashed and made faces at each other while the physician who hated them both exulted over their affliction bidding them be of good cheer and proceed with their meal for he was ready to demonstrate that the flesh of a cat was as nourishing and delicious as veal or mutton provided they could prove that the said cat was not of the boar kind and had fed chiefly on vegetable diet or even confined its carnivorous appetite to rats and mice which he affirmed to be dainties of exquisite taste and flavour he said it was a vulgar mistake to think that all fleshdevouring creatures were unfit to be eaten witness the consumption of swine and ducks animals that delight in carriage as well as fish and prey upon each other and feed on bait and carrion together with the demand for bear of which the best hams in the world are made he then observed that the negroes on the coast of guinea who are healthy and vigorous people prefer cats and dogs to all other fare and mentioned from history several sieges during which the inhabitants who were blocked up lived upon these animals and had recourse even to human flesh which to his certain knowledge was in all respects preferable to pork for in the course of his studies he had for the experiments sake eaten a steak cut from the buttock of a person who had been hanged this dissertation far from composing increased the disquiet in the stomachs of the governor and painter who hearing the last illustration turned their eyes upon the orator at the same instant with looks of horror and disgust and the one muttering the term cannibal and the other pronouncing the word abomination they rose from table in a great hurry and running towards another apartment jostled with such violence in the passage that both were overturned by the shock which also contributed to the effect of their nausea that mutually defiled them as they lay chapter xlix nor is the physician sacred from his ridicule they reach arras where our adventurer engages in play with two french officers who next morning give the landlord an interesting proof of their importance the doctor remained sullen and dejected during the whole journey not but that he attempted to recover his importance by haranguing upon the roman highways when mr jolter desired the company to take notice of the fine pavement upon which they travelled from paris into flanders but pallet who thought he had now gained the ascendency over the physician exerted himself in maintaining the superiority he had acquired by venting various sarcasms upon his selfconceit and affectation of learning and even tittering puns and conundrums upon the remarks which the republican retailed when he talked of the flaminian way the painter questioned if it was a better pavement than the fleminian way on which they travelled and the doctor having observed that this road was made for the convenience of drawing the french artillery into flanders which was often the seat of war his competitor in wit replied with infinite vivacity there are more great guns than the french king knows of drawn along this causeway doctor encouraged by the success of these efforts which tickled the imagination of jolter and drew smiles as he imagined of approbation from our hero he sported in many other equivoques of the same nature and at dinner told the physician that he was like the root of the tongue as being cursedly down in the mouth by this time such was the animosity subsisting between these quondam friends that they never conversed together except with a view of exposing each other to the ridicule or contempt of their fellowtravellers the doctor was at great pains to point out the folly and ignorance of pallet in private to peregrine who was often conjured in the same manner by the painter to take notice of the physicians want of manners and taste pickle pretended to acquiesce in the truth of their mutual severity which indeed was extremely just and by malicious insinuations blew up their contention with a view of bringing it to open hostility but both seemed so averse to deeds of mortal purpose that for a long time his arts were baffled and he could not spirit them up to any pitch of resentment higher than scurrilous repartee before they reached arras the city gates were shut so that they were obliged to take up their lodgings at an indifferent house in the suburbs where they found a couple of french officers who had also rode post from paris so far on their way to lisle these gentlemen were about the age of thirty and their deportment distinguished by such an air of insolence as disgusted our hero who nevertheless accosted them politely in the yard and proposed that they should sup together they thanked him for the honour of his invitation which however they declined upon pretence of having ordered something for themselves but promised to wait upon him and his company immediately after their repast this they accordingly performed and after having drunk a few glasses of burgundy one of them asked if the young gentleman would for pastime take a hand at quadrille peregrine easily divined the meaning of this proposal which was made with no other view than that of fleecing him and his fellowtravellers for he well knew to what shifts a subaltern in the french service is reduced in order to maintain the appearance of a gentleman and had reason to believe that most of them were sharpers from their youth but as he depended a good deal upon his own penetration and address he gratified the strangers desire and a party was instantly formed of the painter the physician the proposer and himself the other officer having professed himself utterly ignorant of the game in the course of the play he took his station at the back of pickles chair which was opposite to his friend on pretence of amusing himself with seeing his manner of conducting the cards the youth was not such a novice but that he perceived the design of this palpable piece of behaviour which notwithstanding he overlooked for the present with a view of flattering their hopes in the beginning that they might be the more effectually punished by their disappointment in the end the game was scarce begun when by the reflection of a glass he discerned the officer at his back making signs to his companion who by preconcerted gestures was perfectly informed of the contents of peregrines hand and of consequence fortunate in the course of play thus they were allowed to enjoy the fruits of their dexterity until their money amounted to some louis when our young gentleman thinking it high time to do himself justice signified in very polite terms to the gentleman who stood behind him that he could never play with ease and deliberation when he was overlooked by any bystander and begged that he would have the goodness to be seated as this was a remonstrance which the stranger could not with my show of breeding resist he asked pardon and retired to the chair of the physician who frankly told him that it was not the fashion of his country for one to submit his hand to the perusal of a spectator and when in consequence of this rebuff he wanted to quarter himself upon the painter he was refused by a wave of the hand and shake of the head with an exclamation of pardonnez moi which was repeated with such emphasis as discomposed this effrontery and he found himself obliged to sit down in a state of mortification the odds being thus removed fortune proceeded in her usual channel and though the frenchman deprived of his ally endeavoured to practise divers strokes of finesse the rest of the company observed him with such vigilance and caution as baffled all his attempts and in a very little time he was compelled to part with his winning but having engaged in the match with an intention of taking all advantages whether fair or unfair that his superior skill should give him over the englishman the money was not refunded without a thousand disputes in the course of which he essayed to intimidate his antagonist with high words which were retorted by our hero with such interest as convinced him that he had mistaken his man and persuaded him to make his retreat in quiet indeed it was not without cause that they repined at the bad success of their enterprise because in all likelihood they had nothing to depend upon for the present but their own industry and knew not how to defray their expenses on the road except by some acquisition of this kind next morning they rose at daybreak and resolving to anticipate their fellowlodgers bespoke posthorses as soon as they could be admitted into the city so that when our company appeared their beasts were ready in the yard and they only waited to discuss the bill which they had ordered to be made out the landlord of the inn presented his carte with fear and trembling to one of those ferocious cavaliers who no sooner cast his eye upon the sum total than he discharged a volley of dreadful oaths and asked if the kings officers were to be treated in that manner the poor publican protested with great humility that he had the utmost respect for his majesty and everything that belonged to him and that far from consulting his own interest all that he desired was to be barely indemnified for the expense of their lodging this condescension seemed to have no other effect than that of encouraging their arrogance they swore his extortion should be explained to the commandant of the town who would by making him a public example teach other innkeepers how to behave towards men of honour and threatened with such confidence of indignation that the wretched landlord dreading the consequence of their wrath implored pardon in the most abject manner begging with many supplications that he might have the pleasure of lodging them at his own charge this was a favour which he with great difficulty obtained they chid him severely for his imposition exhorted him to have more regard for his own conscience as well as to the convenience of his guests and cautioning him in particular touching his behaviour to the gentlemen of the army mounted their horses and rode off in great state leaving him very thankful for having so successfully appeased the choler of two officers who wanted either inclination or ability to pay their bill for experience had taught him to be apprehensive of all such travellers who commonly lay the landlord under contribution by way of atonement for the extravagance of his demands even after he has professed his willingness to entertain them on their own terms chapter l peregrine moralizes upon their behaviour which is condemned by the doctor and defended by the governor they arrive in safety at lisle dine at an ordinary visit the citadel the physician quarrels with a north briton who is put in arrest these honourable adventurers being gone peregrine who was present during the transaction informed himself of the particulars from the mouth of the innkeeper himself who took heaven and the saints to witness that he should have been a loser by their custom even if the bill had been paid because he was on his guard against their objections and had charged every article at an under price but such was the authority of officers in france that he durst not dispute the least circumstance of their will for had the case come under the cognizance of the magistrate he must in course have suffered by the maxims of their government which never fail to abet the oppression of the army and besides run the risk of incurring their future resentment which would be sufficient to ruin him from top to bottom our hero boiled with indignation at this instance of injustice and arbitrary power and turning to his governor asked if this too was a proof of the happiness enjoyed by the french people jolter replied that every human constitution must in some things be imperfect and owned that in this kingdom gentlemen were more countenanced than the vulgar because it was to be presumed that their own sentiments of honour and superior qualifications would entitle them to this preeminence which had also a retrospective view to the merit of their ancestors in consideration of which they were at first ennobled but he affirmed that the innkeeper had misrepresented the magistracy which in france never failed to punish flagrant outrages and abuse without respect of persons the painter approved of the wisdom of the french government in bridling the insolence of the mob by which he assured them he had often suffered in his own person having been often bespattered by hackneycoachmen jostled by draymen and porters and reviled in the most opprobrious terms by the watermen of london where he had once lost his bag and a considerable quantity of hair which had been cut off by some rascal in his passage through ludgate during the lord mayors procession on the other hand the doctor with great warmth alleged that those officers ought to suffer death or banishment at least for having plundered the people in this manner which was so impudent and barefaced as plainly to prove they were certain of escaping with impunity and that they were old offenders in the same degree of delinquency he said that the greatest man in athens would have been condemned to perpetual exile and seen his estate confiscated for public use had he dared in such a licentious manner to violate the rights of a fellowcitizen and as for the little affronts to which a man may be subject from the petulance of the multitude he looked upon them as glorious indications of liberty which ought not to be repressed and would at any time rejoice to find himself overthrown in a kennel by the insolence of a son of freedom even though the fall should cost him a limb adding by way of illustration that the greatest pleasure he ever enjoyed was in seeing a dustman wilfully overturn a gentlemans coach in which two ladies were bruised even to the danger of their lives pallet shocked at the extravagance of this declaration if that be the case said he i wish you may see every bone in your body broke by the first carman you meet in the streets of london this argument being discussed and the reckoning discharged without any deduction although the landlord in stating the articles had an eye to the loss he had sustained by his own countrymen they departed from arras and arrived in safety at lisle about two oclock in the afternoon they had scarce taken possession of their lodgings in a large hotel in the grande place when the innkeeper gave them to understand that he kept an ordinary below which was frequented by several english gentlemen who resided in town and that dinner was then set upon the table peregrine who seized all opportunities of observing new characters persuaded his company to dine in public and they were accordingly conducted to the place where they found a mixture of scotch and dutch officers who had come from holland to learn their exercises at the academy and some gentlemen in the french service who were upon garrison duty in the citadel among these last was a person about the age of fifty of a remarkably genteel air and polite address dignified with a maltese cross and distinguished by the particular veneration of all those who knew him when he understood that pickle and his friends were travellers he accosted the youth in english which he spoke tolerably well and as they were strangers offered to attend them in the afternoon to all the places worth seeing in lisle our hero thanked him for his excess of politeness which he said was peculiar to the french nation and struck with his engaging appearance industriously courted his conversation in the course of which he learned that this chevalier was a man of good sense and great experience that he was perfectly well acquainted with the greatest part of europe had lived some years in england and was no stranger to the constitution and genius of that people having dined and drunk to the healths of the english and french kings two fiacres were called in one of which the knight with one of his companions the governor and peregrine seated themselves the other being occupied by the physician pallet and two scottish officers who proposed to accompany them in their circuit the first place they visited was the citadel round the ramparts of which they walked under the conduct of the knight who explained with great accuracy the intention of every particular fortification belonging to that seemingly impregnable fortress and when they had satisfied their curiosity took coach again in order to view the arsenal which stands in another quarter of the town but just as pickles carriage had crossed the promenade he heard his own name bawled aloud by the painter and ordering the fiacre to stop saw pallet with one half of his body thrust out at the window of the other coach crying with a terrified look mr pickle mr pickle the for the love of god halt and prevent bloodshed else here will be carnage and cutting of throats peregrine surprised at this exclamation immediately alighted and advancing to the other vehicle found one of their military companions standing upon the ground at the farther side of the coach with his sword drawn and fury in his countenance and the physician with a quivering lip and haggard aspect struggling with the other who had interposed in the quarrel and detained him in his place our young gentleman upon inquiry found that this animosity had sprung from a dispute that happened upon the ramparts touching the strength of the fortification which the doctor according to custom undervalued because it was a modern work saying that by the help of the military engines used among the ancients and a few thousands of pioneers he would engage to take it in less than ten days after he should sit down before it the north briton who was as great a pedant as the physician having studied fortification and made himself master of caesars commentaries and polybius with the observations of folard affirmed that all the methods of besieging practised by the ancients would be utterly ineffectual against such a plan as that of the citadel of lisle and began to compare the vineae aggeres arietes scorpiones and catapultae of the romans with the trenches mines batteries and mortars used in the present art of war the republican finding himself attacked upon what he thought his strong side summoned all his learning to his aid and describing the famous siege of plateae happened to misquote a passage of thucydides in which he was corrected by the other who having been educated for the church was also a connoisseur in the greek language the doctor incensed at being detected in such a blunder in the presence of pallet who he knew would promulgate his shame told the officer with great arrogance that his objection was frivolous and that he must not pretend to dispute on these matters with one who had considered them with the utmost accuracy and care his antagonist piqued at this supercilious insinuation replied with great heat that for aught he knew the doctor might be a very expert apothecary but that in the art of war and knowledge of the greek tongue he was no other than an ignorant pretender this asseveration produced an answer full of virulence including a national reflection upon the soldiers country and the contention rose to mutual abuse when it was suppressed by the admonitions of the other two who begged they would not expose themselves in a strange place but behave themselves like fellowsubjects and friends they accordingly ceased reviling each other and the affair was seemingly forgot but after they had resumed their places in the coach the painter unfortunately asked the meaning of the word tortise which he had heard them mention among the roman implements of war this question was answered by the physician who described the nature of this expedient so little to the satisfaction of the officer that he contradicted him flatly in the midst of his explanation a circumstance which provoked the republican to such a degree that in the temerity of his passion he uttered the epithet impertinent scoundrel which vas no sooner pronounced than the caledonian made manual application to his nose and leaping out of the coach stood waiting for him on the plain while he the physician made feeble efforts to join him being easily retained by the other soldier and pallet dreading the consequence in which he himself might be involved bellowed aloud for prevention our hero endeavoured to quiet the commotion by representing to the scot that he had already taken satisfaction for the injury he had received and telling the doctor that he had deserved the chastisement which was inflicted upon him but the officer encouraged perhaps by the confusion of his antagonist insisted upon his asking pardon for what he had said and the doctor believing himself under the protection of his friend pickle far from agreeing to such concession breathed nothing but defiance and revenge so that the chevalier in order to prevent mischief put the soldier under arrest and sent him to his lodgings under the care of the other french gentleman and his own companion they being also accompanied by mr jolter who having formerly seen all the curiosities of lisle willingly surrendered his place to the physician chapter li pickle engages with a knight of malta in a conversation upon the english stage which is followed by a dissertation on the theatres of the ancients by the doctor the rest of the company proceeded to the arsenal which having viewed together with some remarkable churches they in their return went to the comedy and saw the cid of corneille tolerably well represented in consequence of this entertainment the discourse at supper turned upon dramatic performances and all the objections of monsieur scudery to the piece they had seen acted together with the decision of the french academy were canvassed and discussed the knight was a man of letters and taste and particularly well acquainted with the state of the english stage so that when the painter boldly pronounced sentence against the french manner of acting on the strength of having frequented a covent garden club of critics and been often admitted by virtue of an order into the pit a comparison immediately ensued not between the authors but the actors of both nations to whom the chevalier and peregrine were no strangers our hero like a good englishman made no scruple of giving the preference to the performers of his own country who he alleged obeyed the genuine impulses of nature in exhibiting the passions of the human mind and entered so warmly into the spirit of their several parts that they often fancied themselves the very heroes they represented whereas the action of the parisian players even in their most interesting characters was generally such an extravagance in voice and gesture as is nowhere to be observed but on the stage to illustrate this assertion he availed himself of his talent and mimicked the manner and voice of all the principal performers male and female belonging to the french comedy to the admiration of the chevalier who having complimented him upon this surprising modulation begged leave to dissent in some particulars from the opinion he had avowed that you have good actors in england said he it would be unjust and absurd in me to deny your theatre is adorned by one woman whose sensibility and sweetness of voice is such as i have never observed on any other stage she has besides an elegance of person and expression of features that wonderfully adapt her for the most engaging characters of your best plays and i must freely own that i have been as highly delighted and as deeply affected by a monimia and belvidera at london as ever i was by cornelia and cleopatra at paris your favourite actor is a surprising genius you can moreover boast of several comic actors who are perfect masters of buffoonery and grimace though to be free with you i think in these qualifications you are excelled by the players of amsterdam yet one of your graciosos i cannot admire in all the characters he assumes his utterance is a continual singsong like the chanting of vespers and his action resembles that of heaving ballast into the hold of a ship in his outward deportment he seems to have confounded the ideas of insolence and the dignity of mien acts the crafty cool designing crookback as a loud shallow blustering hector in the character of the mild patriot brutus loses all temper and decorum nay so ridiculous is the behaviour of him and cassius at their interview that setting foot to foot and grinning at each other with the aspect of two cobblers engaged they thrust their left sides together with repeated shoots that the hilts of their swords may clash for the entertainment of the audience as if they were a couple of merry andrews endeavouring to raise the laugh of the vulgar on some scaffold of bartholomew fair the despair of a great man who falls a victim to the infernal practices of a subtle traitor who enjoyed his confidence this english aesopus represents by beating his own forehead and beating like a bull and indeed in almost all his most interesting scenes performs such strange shakings of the head and other antic gesticulations that when i first saw him act i imagined the poor man laboured under the paralytical disorder which is known by the name of st vituss dance in short he seems to be a stranger to the more refined sensations of the soul consequently his expression is of the vulgar kind and he must often sink under the idea of the poet so that he has recourse to such violence of affected agitation as imposes upon the undiscerning spectator but to the eye of taste evinces him a mere player of that class whom your admired shakespeare justly compares to natures journeyman tearing a passion to rags yet this man in spite of all these absurdities is an admirable falstaff exhibits the character of the eighth henry to the life is reasonably applauded in the plain dealer excels in the part of sir john brute and would be equal to many humorous situations in low comedy which his pride will not allow him to undertake i should not have been so severe upon this actor had i not seen him extolled by his partisans with the most ridiculous and fulsome manifestations of praise even in those very circumstances wherein as i have observed he chiefly failed peregrine not a little piqued to hear the qualifications of such a celebrated actor in england treated with such freedom and disrespect answered with some asperity that the chevalier was a true critic more industrious in observing the blemishes than in acknowledging the excellence of those who fell under his examination it was not to be supposed that one actor could shine equally in all characters and though his observations were undoubtedly very judicious he himself could not help wondering that some of them had always escaped his notice though he had been an assiduous frequenter of the playhouse the player in question said he has in your own opinion considerable share of merit in the characters of comic life and as to the manners of the great personages in tragedy and the operation of the grand passions of the soul i apprehend they may be variously represented according to the various complexion and cultivation of different men a spaniard for example though impelled by the same passion will express it very differently from a frenchman and what is looked upon as graceful vivacity and address by the one would be considered as impertinence and foppery by the other nay so opposite is your common deportment from that of some other nations that one of our own countrymen in the relation of his travels observes that the persians even of this age when they see any man perform unnecessary gestures says he is either a fool or frenchman the standard of demeanour being thus unsettled a turk a moor an indian or inhabitant of my country whose customs and dress are widely different from ours may in his sentiments possess all the dignity of the human heart and be inspired by the noblest passion that animates the soul and yet excite the laughter rather than the respect of an european spectator when i first beheld your famous parisian stage heroine in one of her principal parts her attitudes seemed so violent and she tossed her arms around with such extravagance that she put me in mind of a windmill under the agitation of a hard gale while her voice and features exhibited the lively representation of an english scold the action of your favourite male performer was in my opinion equally unnatural he appeared with the affected airs of a dancingmaster at the most pathetic junctures of his fate he lifted up his hands above his head like a tumbler going to vault and spoke as if his throat had been obstructed by a hairbrush yet when i compared their manners with those of the people before whom they performed and made allowance for that exaggeration which obtains on all theatres i was insensibly reconciled to their method of performance and i could distinguish abundance of merit beneath that oddity of appearance the chevalier perceiving peregrine a little irritated at what he had said asked pardon for the liberty he had taken in censuring the english players assuring him that he had an infinite veneration for the british learning genius and taste which were so justly distinguished in the world of letters and that notwithstanding the severity of his criticism he thought the theatre of london much better supplied with actors than that of paris the young gentleman thanked him for his polite condescension at which pallet excited saying with a shake of the head i believe so too monsieur and the physician impatient of the dispute in which he had borne no share observed with a supercilious air that the modern stage was altogether beneath one who had an idea of ancient magnificence and execution that plays ought to be exhibited at the expense of the state as those of sophocles were by the athenians and that proper judges should be appointed for receiving or rejecting all such performances as are offered to the public he then described the theatre at rome which contained eighty thousand spectators gave them a learned disquisition into the nature of the persona or mask worn by the roman actors which he said was a machine that covered the whole head furnished on the inside with a brazen concavity that by reverberating the sound as it issued from the mouth raised the voice so as to render it audible to such an extended audience he explained the difference between the saltator and declamator one of whom acted while the other rehearsed the part and from thence took occasion to mention the perfection of their pantomimes who were so amazingly distinct in the exercise of their art that a certain prince of pontus being at the court of nero and seeing one of them represent a story begged him of the emperor in order to employ him as an interpreter among barbarous nations whose language he did not understand nay divers cynic philosophers who had condemned this entertainment unseen when they chanced to be eyewitnesses of their admirable dexterity expressed their sorrow for having so long debarred themselves of such national enjoyment he dissented however from the opinion of peregrine who as a proof of their excellence had advanced that some of the english actors fancied themselves the very thing they represented and recounted a story from lucian of a certain celebrated pantomime who in acting the part of ajax in his frenzy was transported into a real fit of delirium during which he tore to pieces the clothes of that actor who stalked before him beating the stage with iron shoes in order to increase the noise snatched an instrument from one of the musicians and broke it over the head of him who represented ulysses and running to the consular bench mistook a couple of senators for the sheep which were to be slain the audience applauded him to the skies but so conscious was the mimic of his own extravagance when he recovered the use of his reason that he actually fell sick with mortification and being afterwards desired to react the piece flatly refused to appear in any such character saying that the shortest follies were the best and that it was sufficient for him to have been a madman once in his life chapter lii an adventure happens to pipes in consequence of which he is dismissed from peregrines service the whole company set out for ghent in the diligence our hero is captivated by a lady in that carriage interests her spiritual director in his behalf the doctor being fairly engaged on the subject of the ancients would have proceeded the lord knows how far without hesitation had not he been interrupted by the arrival of mr jolter who in great confusion told them that pipes having affronted a soldier was then surrounded in the street and certainly would be put to death if some person of authority did not immediately interpose in his behalf peregrine no sooner learned the danger of his trusty squire than snatching up his sword he ran downstairs and was followed by the chevalier entreating him to leave the affair to his management within ten yards of the door they found tom with his back to a wall defending himself with a mopstick against the assault of three or four soldiers who at sight of the maltese cross desisted from the attack and were taken into custody by order of the knight one of the aggressors being an irishman begged to be heard with great importunity before he should be sent to the guard and by the mediation of pickle was accordingly brought into the hotel with his companions all three bearing upon their heads and faces evident marks of their adversarys prowess and dexterity the spokesman being confronted with pipes informed the company that having by accident met with mr pipes whom he considered as his countryman though fortune had disposed of them in different services he invited him to drink a glass of wine and accordingly carried him to a cabaret where he introduced him to his comrades but in the course of the conversation which turned upon the power and greatness of the kings of france and england mr pipes had been pleased to treat his most christian majesty with great disrespect and when he the entertainer expostulated with him in a friendly manner about his impolite behaviour observing that he being in the french service would be under the necessity of resenting his abuse if he did not put a stop to it before the other gentlemen of the cloth should comprehend his meaning he had set them all three at defiance dishonoured him in particular with the opprobrious epithet of rebel to his native king and country and even drunk in broken french to the perdition of louis and all his adherents that compelled by this outrageous conduct he as the person who had recommended him to their society had in vindication of his own character demanded of the delinquent who on pretence of fetching a sword had gone to his lodging from whence he all of a sudden sallied upon them with the mopstick which he employed in the annoyance of them all without distinction so that they were obliged to draw in their own defence pipes being questioned by his master with regard to the truth of this account owned that every circumstance was justly represented saying he did not value their cheesetoasters a pinch of oakum and that if the gentleman had not shot in betwixt them he would have trimmed them to such a tune that they should not have had a whole yard to square peregrine reprimanded him sharply for his unmannerly behaviour and insisted upon his asking pardon of those he had injured upon the spot but no consideration was efficacious enough to produce such concession to this command he was both deaf and dumb and the repeated threats of his master had no more effect than if they had been addressed to a marble statue at length our hero incensed at his obstinacy started up and would have chastised him with manual operation had not he been prevented by the chevalier who found means to moderate his indignation so far that he contented himself with dismissing the offender from his service and after having obtained the discharge of the prisoners gave them a louis to drink by way of recompense for the disgrace and damage they had sustained the knight perceiving our young gentleman very much ruffled at this accident and reflecting upon the extraordinary deportment and appearance of his valet whose hair had by this time adopted a grizzled hue imagined he was some favourite domestic who had grown gray in the service of his masters family and that of consequence he was uneasy at the sacrifice he had made swayed by this conjecture he earnestly solicited in his behalf but all he could obtain was a promise of readmitting him into favour on the terms already proposed or at least on condition that he should make his acknowledgment to the chevalier for his want of reverence and respect for the french monarch upon this condescension the culprit was called upstairs and made acquainted with the mitigation of his fate upon which he said he would down on his marrowbones to his own master but would be d d before he would ask pardon of eer a frenchman in christendom pickle exasperated at this blunt declaration ordered him out of his presence and charged him never to appear before his face again while the officer in vain employed all his influence and address to appease his resentment and about midnight took his leave with marks of mortification at his want of success next day the company agreed to travel through flanders in the diligence by the advice of peregrine who was not without hope of meeting with some adventure or amusement in that carriage and jolter took care to secure places for them all it being resolved that the valetdechambre and the doctors man should attend the vehicle on horseback and as for the forlorn pipes he was left to reap the fruits of his own stubborn disposition notwithstanding the united efforts of the whole triumvirate who endeavoured to procure his pardon every previous measure being thus taken they set out from lisle about six in the morning and found themselves in the company of a female adventurer a very handsome young lady a capuchin and a rotterdam jew our young gentleman being the first of this society that entered surveyed the stranger with an attentive eye and seated himself immediately behind the beautiful unknown who at once attracted his attention pallet seeing another lady unengaged in imitation of his friend took possession of her neighbourhood the physician paired with the priest and jolter sat down by the jew the machine had not proceeded many furlongs when pickle accosting the fair incognita congratulated himself upon his happiness in being the fellowtraveller of so charming a lady she without the least reserve or affectation thanked him for his compliment and replied with a sprightly air that now they were embarked in one common bottom they must club their endeavours to make one another as happy as the nature of their situation would permit them to be encouraged by this frank intimation and captivated by her fine black eyes and easy behaviour he attached himself to her from that moment and in a little time the conversation became so particular that the capuchin thought proper to interfere in the discourse in such a manner as gave the youth to understand that he was there on purpose to superintend her conduct he was doubly rejoiced at this discovery in consequence of which he hoped to profit in his addresses not only by the young ladys restraint that never fails to operate in behalf of the lover but also by the corruptibility of her guardian whom he did not doubt of rendering propitious to his cause flushed with these expectations he behaved with uncommon complacency to the father who was charmed with the affability of his carriage and on the faith of his generosity abated of his vigilance so much that our hero carried on his suit without further molestation while the painter in signs and loud bursts of laughter conversed with his dulcinea who was perfectly well versed in these simple expressions of satisfaction and had already found means to make a dangerous invasion upon his heart nor were the governor and physician unemployed while their friends interested themselves in this agreeable manner jolter no sooner perceived the hollander was a jew than he entered into an investigation of the hebrew tongue in which he was a connoisseur and the doctor at the same time attacked the mendicant on the ridiculous maxims of his order together with the impositions of priestcraft in general which he observed prevailed so much among those who profess the roman catholic religion thus coupled each committee enjoyed their own conversation apart without any danger of encroachment and all were so intent upon their several topics that they scarce allowed themselves a small interval in viewing the desolation of menin as they passed through that ruined frontier about twelve oclock they arrived at courtray where the horses are always changed and the company halt an hour for refreshment here peregrine handed his charmer into an apartment where she was joined by the other lady and on pretence of seeing some of the churches in town put himself under the direction of the capuchin from whom he learned that the lady was wife to a french gentleman to whom she had been married about a year and that she was now on her journey to visit her mother who lived in brussels and was at that time laboured under a lingering distemper which in all probability would soon put a period to her life he then launched out in praise of her daughters virtue and conjugal affection and lastly told him that he was her fatherconfessor and pitched upon to be her conductor through flanders by her husband as well as his wife placed the utmost confidence in his prudence and integrity pickle easily comprehended the meaning of this insinuation and took the hint accordingly he tickled the priests vanity with extraordinary encomiums upon the disinterested principles of his order which were detached from all worldly pursuits and altogether devoted to the eternal salvation of mankind he applauded their patience humility and learning and lavished a world of praise upon their talent in preaching which he said had more than once operated so powerfully upon him that had he not been restrained by certain considerations which he could not possibly waive he should have embraced their tenets and begged admission into their fraternity but as the circumstances of his fate would not permit him to take such a salutary measure for the present he entreated the good father to accept a small token of his love and respect for the benefit of that convent to which he belonged so saying he pulled out a purse of ten guineas which the capuchin observing turned his head another way and lifting up his arm displayed a pocket almost as high as his collarbone in which he deposited the money this proof of affection for the order produced a sudden and surprising effect upon the friar in the transport of his zeal he wrung this semiconverts hand showered a thousand benedictions upon his head and exhorted him with the tears flowing from his eyes to perfect the great work which the finger of god had begun in his heart and as an instance of his concern for the welfare of his precious soul the holy brother promised to recommend him strenuously to the pious admonitions of the young woman under his care who was a perfect saint upon earth and endowed with a peculiar gift of mollifying the hearts of obdurate sinners father cried the hypocritical projector who by this time perceived that his money was not thrown away if i could be favoured but for one half hour with the private instruction of that inspired devotee my mind presages that i should be a strayed sheep brought back into the fold and that i should find easy entrance at the gates of heaven there is something supernatural in her aspect i gaze upon her with the most pious fervour and my whole soul is agitated with tumults of hope and despair having pronounced this rhapsody with transport half natural and half affected the priest assured him that these were the operations of the spirit which must not be repressed and comforted him with the hope of enjoying the blessed interview which he desired protesting that as far as his influence extended his wish should be that very evening indulged the gracious pupil thanked him for his benevolent concern which he swore should not be squandered upon an ungrateful object and the rest of the company interrupting the conversation they returned in a body to the inn where they dined all together and the ladies were persuaded to be our heros guests as the subjects on which they had been engaged before dinner were not exhausted each brace resumed their former theme when they were replaced in the diligence the painters mistress finished her conquest by exerting her skill in the art of ogling accompanied by frequent bewitching sighs and some tender french songs that she sang with such pathetic expression as quite melted the resolution of pallet and utterly subdued his affection and he to convince her of the importance of her victory gave a specimen of his own talents by entertaining her with that celebrated english ditty the burden of which begins with the pigs they lie with their a s bare chapter liii he makes some progress in her affections is interrupted by a dispute between jolter and the jew appeases the wrath of the capuchin who procures for him an interview with his fair enslaver in which he finds himself deceived peregrine meanwhile employed all his insinuation and address in practising upon the heart of the capuchins fair charge he had long ago declared his passion not in the superficial manner of a french gallant but with all the ardour of an enthusiast he had languished vowed flattered kissed her hand by stealth and had no reason to complain of his reception though by a man of a less sanguine disposition her particular complaisance would have been deemed equivocal and perhaps nothing more than the effects of french breeding and constitutional vivacity he gave his own qualifications credit for the whole and with these sentiments carried on the attack with such unabating vigour that she was actually prevailed upon to accept a ring which he presented as a token of his esteem and everything proceeded in a most prosperous train when they were disturbed by the governor israelite who in the heat of disputation raised their voices and poured forth such effusions of gutturals as set our lovers teeth on edge as they spoke in a language unknown to every one in the carriage but themselves and looked at each other with mutual animosity and rancour peregrine desired to know the cause of their contention upon which jolter exclaimed in a furious tone this learned levite forsooth has the impudence to tell me that i dont understand hebrew and affirms that the word benoni signifies child of joy whereas i can prove and have already said enough to convince any reasonable man that in the septuagint it is rightly translated into son of my sorrow having thus explained himself to his pupil he turned to the priest with intention to appeal to his determination but the jew pulled him by the sleeve with great eagerness saying for the love of god be quiet the capuchin will discover who we are joker offended at this conjunction echoed who we are with great emphasis and repeating nos poma natamus asked ironically to which of the tribes the jew thought he belonged the levite affronted at his comparing him to a ball of horsedung replied with a most significant grin to the tribe of issachar his antagonist taking the advantage of his unwillingness to be known by the friar and prompted by revenge for the freedom he had used answered in the french language that the judgment of god was still manifest upon their whole race not only in their being in the state of exiles from their native land but also in the spite of their hearts and pravity of their dispositions which demonstrate them to be the genuine offspring of those who crucified the saviour of the world his expectation was however defeated the priest himself was too deeply engaged to attend to the debates of other people the physician in the pride and insolence of his learning had undertaken to display the absurdity of the christian faith having already as he thought confuted the capuchin touching the points of belief in which the roman catholics differ from the rest of the world but not cemented with the imagined victory he bed gained he began to strike at the fundamentals of religion and the father with incredible forbearance suffered him to make very free with the doctrine of the trinity but when he leveled the shafts of his ridicule at the immaculate conception of the blessed virgin the good mans patience forsook him his eyes seemed to kindle with indignation he trembled in every joint and uttered with a loud voice you are an abominable i will not call thee heretic for thou art worse if possible than a jew you deserve to be inclosed in a furnace seven times heated and i have a good mind to lodge an information against you with the governor of ghent that you may be apprehended and punished as an impious blasphemer this menace operated like a charm upon all present the doctor was confounded the governor dismayed the levites teeth chattered the painter astonished at the general confusion the cause of which he could not comprehend and pickle himself not a little alarmed was obliged to use all his interest and assiduity in appeasing this son of the church who at length in consideration of the friendship he professed for the young gentleman consented to forgive what had passed but absolutely refused to sit in contact with such a profane wretch whom he looked upon as a fiend of darkness sent by the enemy of mankind to poison the minds of weak people so that after having crossed himself and uttered certain exorcisms he insisted upon the doctors changing places with the jew who approached the offended ecclesiastic in an agony of fear matters being thus compromised the conversation flowed in a more general channel and without the intervention of any other accident or bone of contention the carriage arrived at the city of ghent about seven in the evening supper being bespoken for the whole company our adventurer and his friends went out to take a superficial view of the place leaving his new mistress to the pious exhortations of her confessor whom as we have already observed he had secured in his interest this zealous mediator spoke so warmly in his commendation and interested her conscience so much in the affair that she could not refuse her helping hand to the great work of his conversion and promised to grant the interview he desired this agreeable piece of intelligence which the capuchin communicated to peregrine at his return elevated his spirits to such a degree that he shone at supper with uncommon brilliance in a thousand sallies of wit and pleasantry to the delight of all present especially of his fair fleming who seemed quite captivated by his person and behaviour the evening being thus spent to the satisfaction of all parties the company broke up and retired to their several apartments where our lover to his unspeakable mortification learned that the two ladies were obliged to be in the same room all the other chambers of the inn being preoccupied when he imparted this difficulty to the priest that charitable father who was very fruitful in expedients assured him that his spiritual concerns should not be obstructed by such a slender impediment and accordingly availed himself of his prerogative by going into his daughters chamber when she was almost undressed and leading her into his own on pretence of administering salutary food for her soul having brought the two votaries together he prayed for success to the operations of grace and left them to their mutual meditations after having conjured them in the most solemn manner to let no impure sentiments or temptations of the flesh interfere with the hallowed design of their meeting the reverend intercessor being gone and the door fastened on the inside the pseudoconvert transported with his passion threw himself at his amandas feet and begging she would spare him the tedious form of addresses which the nature of their interview would not permit him to observe began with all the impetuosity of love to make the most of the occasion but whether she was displeased by the intrepidity and assurance of his behaviour thinking herself entitled to more courtship and respect or was really better fortified with chastity than he or his procurer had supposed her to be certain it is she expressed resentment and surprise at his boldness and presumption and upbraided him with having imposed upon the charity of the friar the young gentleman was really as much astonished at this rebuff as she pretended to be at his declaration and earnestly entreated her to consider how precious the moments were and for once sacrifice superfluous ceremony to the happiness of one who adored her with such a flame as could not fail to consume his vitals if she would not deign to bless him with her favour notwithstanding all his tears vows and supplications his personal accomplishments and the tempting opportunity all that he could obtain was an acknowledgment of his having made an impression upon her heart which she hoped the dictates of her duty would enable her to erase this confession he considered as a delicate consent and obeying the impulse of his love snatched her up in his arms with an intention of seizing that which she declined to give when this french lucretia unable to defend her virtue any other way screamed aloud and the capuchin setting his shoulder to the door forced it open and entered in an affected ecstasy of amazement he lifted up his hands and eyes and pretended to be thunderstruck at the discovery he had made then in broken exclamations professed his horror at the wicked intention of our hero who had covered such a damnable scheme with the mask of religion in short he performed his cue with such dexterity that the lady believing him to be in earnest begged he would forgive the stranger on account of his youth and education which had been tainted by the errors of heresy and he was on these considerations content to accept the submission of our hero who far from renouncing his expectations notwithstanding this mortifying repulse confided so much in his own talents and the confession which his mistress had made that he resolved to make another effort to which nothing could have prompted him but the utmost turbulence of unruly desire chapter liv he makes another effort to towards the accomplishment of his wish which is postponed by a strange accident he directed his valetdechambre who was a thoroughpaced pimp to kindle some straw in the yard and then pass by the door of her apartment crying with a loud voice that the house was on fire this alarm brought both ladies out of their chamber in a moment and peregrine taking the advantage of their running to the street door entered the room concealed himself under a large table that stood in an unobserved corner the nymphs as soon as they understood the cause of his mercurys supposed affright returned to their apartment and having said their prayers undressed themselves and went to bed this scene which fell under the observation of pickle did not at all contribute to the cooling of his concupiscence but on the contrary inflamed him to such a degree that he could scarce restrain his impatience until by her breathing deep he concluded the fellowlodger of his amanda was asleep this welcome note no sooner saluted his ears than he crept to his charmers bedside and placing himself on his knees gently laid hold on her white hand and pressed it to his lips she had just begun to close her eyes and enjoy the agreeable oppression of slumber when she was roused by this rape at which she started pronouncing in a tone of surprise and dismay my god whos that the lover with the most insinuating humility besought her to hear him vowing that his intention in approaching her thus was not to violate the laws of decency or that indelible esteem which she had engraved on his heart but to manifest his sorrow and contrition for the umbrage he had given to pour forth the overflowings of his soul and tell her that he neither could nor would survive her displeasure these and many more pathetic protestations accompanied with sighs and tears and other expressions of grief which our hero had at command could not fail to melt the tender heart of the fleming already prepossessed in favour of his qualifications she sympathized so much with his affliction as to weep in her turn when she represented the impossibility of her rewarding his passion and he seizing the moment reinforced his solicitations with such irresistible transports that her resolution gave way she began to breathe quick expressed her fear of being overheard by the other lady with an ejaculation of o heavens im undone suffered him after a faint struggle to make a lodgment upon the covered way of her bed her honour however was secured for the present by a strange sort of knocking upon the wainscot at the other end of the room hard by the bed in which the female adventurer lay surprised at this circumstance the lady begged him for heavens sake to retreat or her reputation would be ruined for ever but when he represented to her that her character would run a much greater risk if he should be detected in withdrawing she consented with great trepidation to his stay and they listened in silence to the sequel of the noise that alarmed them this was no other than an expedient of the painter to awaken his dulcinea with whom he had made an assignation or at least interchanged such signals as he thought amounted to a firm appointment his nymph being disturbed in her first sleep immediately understood the sound and true to the agreement rose and unbolting the door as softly as possible gave him admittance leaving it open for his more commodious retreat while this happy gallant was employed in disengaging himself from the deshabille in which he had entered the capuchin suspecting that peregrine would make another attempt upon his charge had crept silently to the apartment in order to reconnoitre lest the adventure should be achieved without his knowledge a circumstance that would deprive him of the profits he might expect from his privity and concurrence finding the door unlatched his suspicion was confirmed and he made no scruple of creeping into the chamber on all four so that the painter having stripped himself to the shirt in groping about for his dulcineas bed chanced to lay his hand upon the shaven crown of the fathers head which by a circular motion the priest began to turn round in his grasp like a ball in a socket to the surprise and consternation of poor pallet who neither having penetration to comprehend the case nor resolution to withdraw his fingers from this strange object of his touch stood sweating in the dark and venting ejaculations with great devotion the friar tired with this exercise and the painful posture in which he stooped raised himself gradually upon his feet heaving up at the same time the hand of the painter whose terror and amazement increased to such a degree at this unaccountable elevation that his faculties began to fail and his palm in the confusion of his fright sliding over the priests forehead one of his fingers happened to slip into his mouth and was immediately secured between the capuchins teeth with as firm a fixture as if it had been screwed in a blacksmiths vice the painter was so much disordered by this sudden snap which tortured him to the bone that forgetting all other considerations he roared aloud murder a fire a trap a trap help christians for the love of god help our hero confounded by these exclamation which he knew would soon fill the room with spectators and incensed at his own mortifying disappointment was obliged to quit the untasted banquet and approaching the cause of his misfortune just as his tormentor had thought proper to release his finger discharged such a hearty slap between his shoulders as brought him to the ground with hideous bellowing then retiring unperceived to his own chamber was one of the first who returned with a light on pretence of having been alarmed with his cries the capuchin had taken the same precaution and followed peregrine into the room pronouncing benedicite and crossing himself with many marks of astonishment the physician and jolter appearing at the same time the unfortunate painter was found lying naked on the floor in all the agony of horror and dismay blowing upon his left hand that hung dangling from the elbow the circumstance of his being found in that apartment and the attitude of his affliction which was extremely ridiculous provoked the doctor to a smile and produced a small relaxation in the severity of the governors countenance while pickle testifying his surprise and concern lifted him from the ground and inquired into the cause of his present situation having after some recollection and fruitless endeavours to speak recovered the use of his tongue he told them that the house was certainly haunted by evil spirits by which he had been conveyed he knew not how into that apartment and afflicted with all the tortures of hell that one of them had made itself sensible to his feeling in the shape of a round ball of smooth flesh which turned round under his hand like an astronomers globe and then rising up to a surprising height was converted into a machine that laid hold on his finger by a snap and having pinned him to the spot he continued for some moments in unspeakable agony at last he said the engine seemed to melt away from his finger and he received a sudden thwack upon his shoulders as if discharged by the arm of a giant which overthrew him in an instant upon the floor the priest hearing this strange account pulled out of one of his pouches a piece of consecrated candle which he lighted immediately and muttered certain mysterious conjurations jolter imagining that pallet was drunk shook his head saying he believed the spirit was nowhere but in his own brain the physician for once condescended to be a wag and looking towards one of the beds observed that in his opinion the painter had been misled by the flesh and not by the spirit the fair fleming lay in silent astonishment and affright and her fellow in order to acquit herself of all suspicion exclaimed with incredible volubility against the author of this uproar who she did not doubt had concealed himself in the apartment with a view of perpetuating some wicked attempt upon her precious virtue and was punished and prevented by the immediate interposition of heaven at her desire therefore and at the earnest solicitation of the other lady he was conducted to his own bed and the chamber being evacuated they locked their door fully resolved to admit no more visitants for that night while peregrine mad with seeing the delicious morsel snatched as it were from his very lip stalked through the passage like a ghost in hope of finding some opportunity of reentering till the day beginning to break he was obliged to retire cursing the idiotical conduct of the painter which had so unluckily interfered with his delight chapter lv they depart from ghent our hero engages in a political dispute with his mistress whom he offends and pacifies with submission he practises an expedient to detain the carriage at alost and confirms the priest in his interest next day about one oclock after having seen everything remarkable in town and been present at the execution of two youths who were hanged for ravishing a w they took their departure from ghent in the same carriage which had brought them thither and the conversation turning upon the punishment they had seen inflicted the flemish beauty expressed great sympathy and compassion for the unhappy sufferers who as she had been informed had fallen victims to the malice of the accuser her sentiments were espoused by all the company except the french lady of pleasure who thinking the credit of the sisterhood concerned in the affair bitterly inveighed against the profligacy of the age and particularly the base and villainous attempts of man upon the chastity of the weaker sex saying with a look of indignation directed to the painter that for her own part she should never be able to manifest the acknowledgment she owed to providence for having protected her last night from the wicked aims of unbridled lust this observation introduced a series of jokes at the expense of pallet who hung his ears and sat with a silent air of dejection fearing that through the malevolence of the physician his adventure might reach the ears of his wife indeed though we have made shift to explain the whole transaction to the reader it was an inextricable mystery to every individual in the diligence because the part which was acted by the capuchin was known to himself alone and even he was utterly ignorant of pickles being concerned in the affair so that the greatest share of the painters sufferings were supposed to be the exaggerations of his own extravagant imagination in the midst of their discourse on this extraordinary subject the driver told them that they were now on the very spot where a detachment of the allied army had been intercepted and cut off by the french and stopping the vehicle entertained them with a local description of the battle of melle upon this occasion the flemish lady who since her marriage had become a keen partisan for the french gave a minute detail of all the circumstances as they had been represented to her by her husbands brother who was in the action this account which sunk the number of the french to sixteen and raised that of the allies to twenty thousand men was so disagreeable to truth as well as to the laudable partiality of peregrine that he ventured to contradict her assertions and a fierce dispute commenced that not only regarded the present question but also comprehended all the battles in which the duke of marlborough had commanded against louis the fourteenth in the course of these debates she divested the great general of all the glory he had acquired by affirming that every victory he gained was purposely lost by the french in order to bring the schemes of madame de maintenon into discredit and as a particular instance alledged that while the citadel of lisle was besieged louis said in presence of the dauphin that if the allies should be obliged to raise the siege he would immediately declare his marriage with that lady upon which the son sent private orders to marshal boufflers to surrender the place this strange allegation was supported by the asseveration of the priest and the courtesan and admitted as truth by the governor who pretended to have heard it from good authority while the doctor sat neutral as one who thought it scandalous to know the history of such modern events the israelite being a true dutchman himself under the banners of our hero who in attempting to demonstrate the absurdity and improbability of what they had advanced raised such a hue and cry against himself and being insensibly heated in the altercation irritated his amanda to such a degree that her charming eyes kindled with fury and he saw great reason to think that if he did not fall upon some method to deprecate her wrath she would in a twinkling sacrifice all her esteem for him to her own zeal for the glory of the french nation moved by this apprehension his ardour cooled by degrees and he insensibly detached himself from the argument leaving the whole care of supporting it to the jew who finding himself deserted was fain to yield at discretion so that the french remained masters of the field and their young heroine resumed her good humour our hero having prudently submitted to the superior intelligence of his fair enslaver began to be harassed with the fears of losing her for ever and set his invention at work to contrive some means of indemnifying himself for his assiduities presents and the disappointment he had already undergone on pretence of enjoying a free air he mounted the box and employed his elocution and generosity with such success that the driver undertook to disable the diligence from proceeding beyond the town of alost for that day and in consequence of his promise gently overturned it when they were but a mile short of that baitingplace he had taken his measures so discreetly that this accident was attended with no other inconvenience than a fit of fear that took possession of the ladies and the necessity to which they were reduced by the declaration of the coachman who upon examining the carriage assured the company that the axletree had given way and advised them to walk forward to the inn while he would jog after them at a slow pace and do his endeavour the damage should be immediately repaired peregrine pretended to be very much concerned at what had happened and even cursed the driver for his inadvertency expressing infinite impatience to be at brussels and wishing that this misfortune might not detain them another night upon the road but when his understrapper according to his instructions came afterwards to the inn and gave them to understand that the workman he had employed could not possibly refit the machine in less then six hours the crafty youth affected to lose all temper stormed at his emissary whom he reviled in the most opprobrious terms and threatened to cane for his misconduct the fellow protested with great humility that their being overturned was owing to the failure of the axletree and not to his want of care or dexterity in driving though rather than be thought the cause of incommoding him he would inquire for a postchaise in which he might depart for brussels immediately this expedient pickle rejected unless the whole company could be accommodated in the same manner and he had been previously informed by the driver that the town could not furnish more than one vehicle of that sort his governor who was quite ignorant of his scheme represented that one night would soon be passed and exhorted him to bear this small disappointment with a good grace especially as the house seemed to be well provided for their entertainment and the company so much disposed to be sociable the capuchin who had found his account in cultivating the acquaintance of the young stranger was not illpleased at this event which might by protracting the term of their intercourse yield him some opportunity of profiting still farther by his liberality he therefore joined mr jolter in his admonitions congratulating himself upon the prospect of enjoying his conversation a little longer than he had expected our young gentleman received a compliment to the same purpose from the hebrew who had that day exercised his gallantry upon the french coquette and was not without hope of reaping the fruit of his attention his rival the painter being quite disgraced and dejected by the adventure of last night as for the doctor he was too much engrossed in the contemplation of his own importance to interest himself in the affair or its consequences further than by observing that the european powers ought to establish public games like those that were celebrated of old in greece in which case every state would be supplied with such dexterous charioteers as would drive a machine at full speed within a hairs breadth of a precipice without any danger of its being overturned peregrine could not help yielding to their remonstrances and united complaisance for which he thanked them in very polite terms and his passion seeming to subside proposed that they should amuse themselves in walking round the ramparts he hoped to enjoy some private conversation with his admired fleming who had the whole day behaved with remarkable reserve the proposal being embraced he as usual handed her into the street and took all opportunities of promoting his suit but they were attended so closely by her fatherconfessor that he foresaw it would be impracticable to accomplish his aim without the connivance of that ecclesiastic this he was obliged to purchase with another purse which he offered and was accepted as a charitable atonement for his criminal behaviour during the interview which the friar had procured for the good of his soul the benefaction was no sooner made than the mendicant edged off by little and little till he joined the rest of the company leaving his generous patron at full liberty to prosecute his purpose it is not to be doubted that our adventurer made a good use of this occasion he practised a thousand flowers of rhetoric and actually exhausted his whole address in persuading her to have compassion upon his misery and indulge him with another private audience without which he should run distracted and be guilty of extravagancies which in the humanity of her disposition she would weep to see but instead of complying with his request she chid him severely for his presumption in persecuting her with his vicious addresses she assured him that although she had secured a chamber for herself in this place because she had no ambition to be better acquainted with the other lady he would be in the wrong to disturb her with another nocturnal visit for she was determined to deny him admittance the lover was comforted by this hint which he understood in the true acceptation and his passion being inflamed by the obstacles he had met with his heart beat high with the prospect of possession these raptures of expectation produced an inquietude which disabled him from bearing that share of the conversation for which he used to be distinguished his behaviour at supper was a vicissitude of startings and reveries the capuchin imputing the disorder to a second repulse from his charge began to be invaded with the apprehension of being obliged to refund and in a whisper forbade our hero to despair chapter lvi the french coquette entraps the heart of the jew against whom pallet enters into a conspiracy by which peregrine is again disappointed and the hebrews incontinence exposed meanwhile the french siren balked in her design upon her english cully who was so easily disheartened and hung his ears in manifest despondence rather than rather than run the risk of making a voyage that should be altogether unprofitable resolved to practise her charms upon the dutch merchant she had already made such innovation upon his heart that he cultivated her with peculiar complacency gazed upon her with a most libidinous stare and unbended his aspect into a grin that was truly israelitish the painter saw and was offended at this correspondence which he considered as an insult upon his misfortune as well as an evident preference of his rival and conscious of his own timidity swallowed an extraordinary glass that his invention might be stimulated and his resolution raised to the contrivance and execution of some scheme of revenge the wine failed in the expected effect and without inspiring him with the plan served only to quicken his desire of vengeance so that he communicated his purpose to his friend peregrine and begged his assistance but our young gentleman was too intent upon his own affair to mind the concerns of any other person and he declining to be engaged in the project pallet had recourse to the genius of pickles valetdechambre who readily embarked in the undertaking and invented a plan which was executed accordingly the evening being pretty far advanced and the company separated into their respective apartments pickle repaired in all the impatience of youth and desire to the chamber of his charmer and finding the door unbolted entered in a transport of joy by the light of the room which shone through the window he was conducted to her bed which he approached in the utmost agitation and perceiving her to all appearance asleep essayed to wake her with a gentle kiss but this method proved ineffectual because she was determined to save herself the confusion of being an accomplice in his guilt he repeated the application murmured a most passionate salutation in her ear and took such other gentle methods of signifying his presence as persuaded him that she was resolved to sleep in spite of all his endeavours flushed with this supposition he locked the door in order to prevent interruption and stealing himself under the clothes set fortune at defiance while he held the fair creature circled in his arms nevertheless near as he seemed to be to the happy accomplishment of his desire his hope was again frustrated with a fearful noise which in a moment awaked his amanda in a fright and for the present engaged all his attention his valetdechambre whom pallet had consulted as a confederate in his revenge against the lady of pleasure and her gallant had hired of certain bohemians who chanced to lodge at the inn a jackass adorned with bells which when everybody was retired to rest and the hebrew supposed to be bedded with his mistress they led upstairs into a long thoroughfare from which the chambers were detached on each side the painter perceiving the ladys door ajar according to his expectation mounted this animal with intention to ride into the room and disturb the lovers in the midst of their mutual endearments but the ass true to its kind finding himself bestrid by an unknown rider instead of advancing in obedience to his conductor retreated backward to the other end of the passage in spite of all the efforts of the painter who spurred and kicked and pummeled to no purpose it was the noise of this contention between pallet and the ass which invaded the ears of peregrine and his mistress neither of whom could form the least rational conjecture about the cause of such strange disturbance which increased as the animal approached their apartment at length the bourriques retrograde motion was obstructed by the door which it forced open in a twinkling with one kick and entered with such complication of sound as terrified the lady almost into a fit and threw her lover into the utmost perplexity and confusion the painter finding himself thus violently intruded into the bedchamber of he knew not whom and dreading the resentment of the possessor who might discharge a pistol at him as a robber who had broken into his apartment was overwhelmed with consternation and redoubled his exertion to accomplish a speedy retreat sweating all the time with fear and putting up petition to heaven for his safety but his obstinate companion regardless of his situation instead of submitting to his conduct began to turn round like a millstone the united sound of his feet and bells producing a most surprising concert the unfortunate rider whirling about in this manner would have quitted his seat and left the beast to his own amusement but the rotation was so rapid that the terror of a severe fall hindered him from attempting to dismount and in the desperation of his heart he seized one of his ears which he pinched so unmercifully that the creature set up his throat and brayed aloud this hideous exclamation was no sooner heard by the fair fleming already chilled with panic and prepared with superstition than believing herself visited by the devil who was permitted to punish her for her infidelity to the marriagebed she uttered a scream and began to repeat her pater noster with a loud voice her lover finding himself under the necessity of retiring started up and stung with the most violent pangs of rage and disappointment ran directly to the spot from whence this diabolical noise seemed to proceed there encountering the ass he discharged such a volley of blows at him and his rider that the creature carried him off at a round trot and they roared in unison all the way having thus cleared the room of such disagreeable company he went back to his mistress and assuring her that this was only some foolish prank of pallet took his leave with a promise of returning after the quiet of the inn should be reestablished in the mean time the noise of the bourrique the cries of the painter and the ladys scream had alarmed the whole house and the ass in the precipitation of his retreat seeing people with lights before him took shelter in the apartment for which he was at first designed just as the levite aroused at the uproar had quitted his dulcinea and was attempting to recover his own chamber unperceived seeing himself opposed by such an animal mounted by a tall meagre lanternjawed figure half naked with a white nightcap upon his head which added to the natural paleness of his complexion the jew was sorely troubled in mind and believing it to be an apparition of balaam and his ass flew backward with a nimble pace and crept under the bed where he lay concealed mr jolter and the priest who were the foremost of those who had been aroused by the noise were not unmoved when they saw such a spectacle rushing into the chamber whence the lady of pleasure began to shriek the governor made a full halt and the capuchin discovered no inclination to proceed they were however by the pressure of the crowd that followed them thrust forward to the door through which the vision entered and there jolter with great ceremony complimented his reverence with the pas beseeching him to walk in the mendicant was too courteous and humble to accept this preeminence and a very earnest dispute ensued during which the ass in the course of his circuit showed himself and rider and in a trice decided the contest for struck with this second glimpse both at one instant sprang backward with such force as overturned their next men who communicated the impulse to those that stood behind them and these again to others so that the whole passage was strewed with a long file of people that lay in a line like the sequel and dependence of a pack of cards in the midst of this havoc our hero returned from his own room with an air of astonishment asking the cause of this uproar receiving such hints of intelligence as jolters consternation would permit him to give he snatched the candle out of his hand and advanced into the haunted chamber without hesitation being followed by all present who broke forth into a long and loud peal of laughter when they perceived the ludicrous source of their disquiet the painter himself made an effort to join their mirth but he had been so harrowed by fear and smarted so much with the pain of the discipline he had received from pickle that be could not with all his endeavours vanquish the ruefulness of his countenance his attempt served only to increase the awkwardness of his situation which was not at all mended by the behaviour of the coquette who furious with her disappointment slipped on a petticoat and bedgown and springing upon him like mother hecuba with her nails deprived all one side of his nose of the skin and would not have left him an eye to see through if some of the company had not rescued him from her unmerciful talons provoked at this outrage as well as by her behaviour to him in the diligence he publicly explained his intention in entering her chamber in this equipage and missing the hebrew among the spectators assured them that he must have absconded somewhere in the apartment in pursuance of this intimation the room was immediately searched and the mortified levite pulled up by the heels from his lurkingplace so that pallet had the good fortune at last to transfer the laugh from himself to his rival and the french inamorata who accordingly underwent the ridicule of the whole audience chapter lvii pallet endeavouring to unravel the mystery of the treatment he had received falls out of the fryingpan into the fire nevertheless pallet was still confounded and chagrined by one consideration which was no other than that of his having been so roughly handled in the chamber belonging as he found upon inquiry to the handsome young lady who was under the capuchins direction he recollected that the door was fast locked when his beast burst it open and he had no reason to believe that any person followed him in his inruption on the other hand he could not imagine that such a gentle creature would either attempt to commit or be able to execute such a desperate assault as that which his body had sustained and her demeanour was so modest and circumspect that he durst not harbour the least suspicion of her virtue these reflections bewildered him in the labyrinth of thought he rummaged his whole imagination endeavouring to account for what had happened at length he concluded that either peregrine or the devil or both must have been at the bottom of the whole affair and determined for the satisfaction of his curiosity to watch our heros motions during the remaining part of the night so narrowly that his conduct mysterious as it was should not be able to elude his penetration with these sentiments he retired to his own room after the ass had been restored to the right owners and the priest had visited and comforted his fair ward who had been almost distracted with fear silence no sooner prevailed again than he crawled darkling towards her door and huddled himself up in an obscure corner from whence he might observe the ingress or egress of any human creature he had not long remained in this posture when fatigued with this adventure and that of the preceding night his faculties were gradually overpowered with slumber and falling fast asleep he began to snore like a whole congregation of presbyterians the flemish beauty hearing this discordant noise in the passage began to be afraid of some new alarm and very prudently bolted her door so that when her lover wanted to repeat his visit he was not only surprised and incensed at this disagreeable serenade the author of which he did not know but when compelled by his passion which was by this time wound to the highest pitch he ventured to approach the entrance he had the extreme mortification to find himself shut out he durst not knock or signify his presence in any other manner on account of the ladys reputation which would have greatly suffered had the snorer been waked by his endeavours had he known that the person who thus thwarted his views was the painter he would have taken some effectual step to remove him but he could not conceive what should induce pallet to take up his residence in that corner nor could he use the assistance of a light to distinguish him because there was not a candle burning in the house it is impossible to describe the rage and vexation of our hero while he continued thus tantalized upon the brink of bliss after his desire had been exasperated by the circumstances of his former disappointments he ejaculated a thousand execrations against his own fortune cursed all his fellowtravellers without exception vowed revenge against the painter who had twice confounded his most interesting scheme and was tempted to execute immediate vengeance upon the unknown cause of his present miscarriage in this agony of distraction did he sweat two whole hours in the passage though not without some faint hope of being delivered from his tormentor who he imagined upon waking would undoubtedly shift his quarters and leave the field free to his designs but when he heard the cock repeat his salutation to the morn which began to open on the rear of night he could no longer restrain his indignation going to his own chamber he filled a basin with cold water and standing at some distance discharged it full in the face of the gaping snorer who over and above the surprise occasioned by the application was almost suffocated by the liquor that entered his mouth and ran down into his windpipe while he gasped like a person halfdrowned without knowing the nature of his disaster or remembering the situation in which he fell asleep peregrine retired to his own door and to his no small astonishment from a long howl that invaded his ears learned that the patient was no other than pallet who had now for the third time balked his good fortune enraged at the complicated trespasses of this unfortunate offender he rushed from his apartment with a horsewhip and encountering the painter in his flight overturned him in the passage there he exercised the instrument of his wrath with great severity on pretence of mistaking him for some presumptuous cur which had disturbed the repose of the inn nay when he called aloud for mercy in a supplicating tone and his chastiser could no longer pretend to treat him as a quadruped such was the virulence of the young gentlemans indignation that he could not help declaring his satisfaction by telling pallet he had richly deserved the punishment he had undergone for his madness folly and impertinence in contriving and executing such idle schemes as had no other tendency than that of plaguing his neighbours pallet protested with great vehemence that he was innocent as the child unborn of an intention to give umbrage to any person whatever except the israelite and his doxy who he knew had incurred his displeasure but as god is my saviour said he i believe i am persecuted with witchcraft and begin to think that d d priest is an agent of the devil for he has been but two nights in our company during which i have not closed an eye but on the contrary have been tormented by all the fiends of hell pickle peevishly replied that his torments had been occasioned by his own foolish imagination and asked how he came to howl in that corner the painter who did not think proper to own the truth said that he had been transported thither by some preternatural conveyance and soused in water by an invisible hand the youth in hope of profiting by his absence advised him to retire immediately to his bed and by sleep strive to comfort his brain which seemed to be not a little disordered by the want of that refreshment pallet himself began to be very much of the same way of thinking and in compliance with such wholesome counsel betook himself to rest muttering prayers all the way for the recovery of his own understanding pickle attended him to his chamber and locking him up put the key in his own pocket that he might not have it in his power to interrupt him again but in his return he was met by mr jolter and the doctor who had been a second time alarmed by the painters cries and came to inquire about this new adventure halffrantic with such a series of disappointments he cursed them in his heart for their unseasonable appearance when they questioned him about pallet he told them he had found him stark staring mad howling in a corner and wet to the skin and conducted him to his room where he was now abed the physician hearing this circumstance made a merit of his vanity and under pretence of concern for the patients welfare desired he might have an opportunity of examining the symptoms of his disorder without loss of time alleging that many diseases might have been stifled in the birth which afterwards baffled all the endeavours of the medical art the young gentleman accordingly delivered the key and once more withdrew into his own chamber with a view of seizing the first occasion that should present itself of renewing his application to his amandas door while the doctor in his way to pellets apartment hinted to the governor his suspicion that the patient laboured under that dreadful symptom called the hydrophobia which he observed had sometimes appeared in persons who were not previously bit by a mad dog this conjecture he founded upon the howl he uttered when he was soused with water and began to recollect certain circumstances of the painters behaviour for some days past which now he could plainly perceive had prognosticated some such calamity he then ascribed the distemper to the violent frights he had lately undergone affirming that the affair of the bastille had made such a violent encroachment upon his understanding that his manner of thinking and speaking was entirely altered by a theory of his own invention he explained the effects of fear upon a loose system of nerves and demonstrated the modus in which the animal spirits operate upon the ideas and power of imagination this disquisition which was communicated at the painters door might have lasted till breakfast had not jolter reminded him of his own maxim venienti occurrite morbo upon which he put the key to immediate use and they walked softly towards the bed where the patient lay extended at full length in the arms of sleep the physician took notice of his breathing hard and his mouth being open and from these diagnostics declared that the liquidum nervosum was intimately affected and the saliva impregnated with the spiculated particles of the virus howsoever contracted this sentence was still farther confirmed by the state of his pulse which being full and slow indicated an oppressed circulation from a loss of elasticity in the propelling arteries he proposed that he should immediately suffer a second aspersion of water which would not only contribute to the cure but also certify them beyond all possibility of doubt with regard to the state of the disease for it would evidently appear from the manner in which he would bear the application whether or not his horror of water amounted to a confirmed hydrophobia mr jolter in compliance with his proposal began to empty a bottle of water which he found in the room in a basin when he was interrupted by the prescriber who advised him to use the contents of the chamberpot which being impregnated with salt would operate more effectually than pure element thus directed the governor lifted up the vessel which was replete with medicine and with one turn of his hand discharged the whole healing inundation upon the illomened patient who waking in the utmost distraction of horror yelled most hideously just at the time when peregrine had brought his mistress to a parley and entertained hopes of being admitted into her chamber terrified at this exclamation she instantly broke off the treaty beseeching him to retire from the door that her honour might receive no injury from his being found in that place and he had just enough of recollection left to see the necessity of obeying the order in conformity to which he retreated well nigh deprived of his senses and almost persuaded that so many unaccountable disappointments must have proceeded from some supernatural cause of which the idiot pallet was no more than the involuntary instrument meanwhile the doctor having ascertained the malady of the patient whose cries interrupted by frequent sobs and sighs he interpreted into the barking of a dog and having no more saltwater at hand resolved to renew the bath with such materials as chance would afford he actually laid hold of the bottle and basin but by this time the painter had recovered the use of his senses so well as to perceive his drift and starting up like a frantic bedlamite ran directly to his sword swearing with many horrid imprecations that he would murder them both immediately if he should be hanged before dinner they did not choose to wait the issue of his threat but retired with such precipitation that the physician had almost dislocated his shoulder by running against one side of the entry jolter having pulled the door after him and turned the key betook himself to flight roaring aloud for assistance his colleague seeing the door secured valued himself upon his resolution and exhorted him to return declaring that for his own part he was more afraid of the madmans teeth than of his weapon and admonishing the governor to reenter and execute what they had left undone go in said he without fear or apprehension and if any accident shall happen to you either from his slaver or his sword i will assist you with my advice which from this station i can more coolly and distinctly administer than i should be able to supply if my ideas were disturbed or my attention engaged in any personal concern jolter who could make no objection to the justness of the conclusion frankly owned that he had no inclination to try the experiment observing that selfpreservation was the first law of nature that his connections with the unhappy lunatic were but slight and that it could not be reasonably expected that he would run such risks for his service as were declined by one who had set out with him from england on the footing of a companion this insinuation introduced a dispute upon the nature of benevolence and the moral sense which the republican argued existed independent of any private consideration and could never be affected by any contingent circumstance of time and fortune while the other who abhorred his principles asserted the duties and excellence of private friendship with infinite rancour of altercation during the hottest of the argument they were joined by the capuchin who being astonished to see them thus virulently engaged at the door and to hear the painter bellowing within the chamber conjured them in the name of god to tell him the cause of that confusion which had kept the whole house in continual alarm during the best part of the night and seemed to be the immediate work of the devil and his angels when the governor gave him to understand that pallet was visited with an evil spirit he muttered a prayer of st antonio de padua and undertook to cure the painter provided he could be secured so as that he might without danger to himself burn part of a certain relic under his nose which he assured them was equal to the miraculous power of eleazars ring they expressed great curiosity to know what this treasure was and the priest was prevailed upon to tell them in confidence that it was a collection of the parings of the nails belonging to those two madmen whom jesus purged of the legion of devils that afterwards entered the swine so saying he pulled from one of his pockets a small box containing about an ounce of the parings of a horses hoof at sight of which the governor could not help smiling on account of the grossness of the imposition the doctor asked with a supercilious smile whether those maniacs whom jesus cured were of the sorrel complexion or dapplegray for from the texture of these parings he could prove that the original owners were of the quadruped order and even distinguish that their feet had been fortified with shoes of iron the mendicant who bore an inveterate grudge against this son of esculapius ever since he had made so free with the catholic religion replied with great bitterness that he was a wretch with whom no christian ought to communicate that the vengeance of heaven would one day overtake him on account of his profanity and that his heart was shod with a metal much harder than iron which nothing but hell fire would be able to melt it was now broad day and all the servants of the inn were afoot peregrine seeing it would be impossible to obtain any sort of indemnification for the time he had lost and the perturbation of his spirits hindering him from enjoying repose which was moreover obstructed by the noise of pallet and his attendants put on his clothes at once and in exceeding illhumour arrived at the spot where this triumvirate stood debating about the means of overpowering the furious painter who still continued his song of oaths and execrations and made sundry efforts to break open the door chagrined as our hero was he could not help laughing when he heard how the patient had been treated and his indignation changing into compassion he called to him through the keyhole desiring to know the reason of his distracted behaviour pallet no sooner recognized his voice than lowering his own to a whimpering tone my dear friend said he i have at last detected the ruffians who have persecuted me so much i caught them in the fact of suffocating me with cold water and by the lord i will be revenged or may i never live to finish my cleopatra for the love of god open the door and i will make that conceited pagan that pretender to taste that false devotee of the ancients who poisons people with sillykicabies and devils dung i say i will make him a monument of my wrath and an example to all the cheats and impostors of the faculty and as for that thickheaded insolent pedant his confederate who emptied my own jordan upon me while i slept he had better have been in his beloved paris botching schemes for his friend the pretender than incur the effects of my resentment gadsbodikins i wont leave him a windpipe for the hangman to stop at the end of another rebellion pickle told him his conduct had been so extravagant as to confirm the whole company in the belief that he was actually deprived of his senses on which supposition mr jolter and the doctor had acted the part of friends in doing that which they thought most conducive to his recovery so that their concern merited his thankful acknowledgment instead of his frantic menaces that for his own part he would be the first to condemn him as one utterly bereft of his wits and give orders for his being secured as a madman unless he would immediately give a proof of his sanity by laying aside his sword composing his spirits and thanking his injured friends for their care of his person this alternative quieted his transports in a moment he was terrified at the apprehension of being treated like a bedlamite being dubious of the state of his own brain and on the other hand had conceived such a horror and antipathy for his tormentors that far from believing himself obliged by what they had done he could not even think of them without the utmost rage and detestation he therefore in the most tranquil voice he could assume protested that he never was less out of his senses than at present though he did not know how long he might retain them if he should be considered in the light of a lunatic that in order to prove his being compos mentis he was willing to sacrifice the resentment he so justly harboured against those who by their malice had brought him to this pass but as he apprehended it would be the greatest sign of madness he could exhibit to thank them for the mischiefs they had brought upon him he desired to be excused from making any such concession and swore he would endure everything rather than be guilty of such mean absurdity peregrine held a consultation upon this reply when the governor and physician strenuously argued against any capitulation with a maniac and proposed that some method might be taken to seize fetter and convey him into a dark room where he might be treated according to the rules of art but the capuchin understanding the circumstances of the case undertook to restore him to his former state without having recourse to such violent measures pickle who was a better judge of the affair than any person present opened the door without further hesitation and displayed the poor painter standing with a woeful countenance shivering in his shirt which was as wet as if he had been dragged through the dender a spectacle which gave such offence to the chaste eyes of the hebrews mistress who was by this time one of the spectators that she turned her head another way and withdrew to her own room exclaiming against the indecent practices of men pallet seeing the young gentleman enter ran to him and taking him by the hands called him his best friend and said he had rescued him from those who had a design against his life the priest would have produced his parings and applied them to his nose but was hindered by pickle who advised the patient to shift himself and put on his clothes this being done with great order and deliberation mr jolter who with the doctor had kept a wary distance in expectation of seeing some storage effects of his distraction began to believe that he had been guilty of a mistake and accused the physician of having misled him by his false diagnostic the doctor still insisted upon his former declaration assuring him that although pallet enjoyed a short interval for the present the delirium would soon recur unless they would profit by this momentary calm and order him to be blooded blistered and purged with all imaginable despatch the governor however notwithstanding this caution advanced to the injured party and begged pardon for the share he had in giving him such disturbance he declared in the most solemn manner that he had no other intention than that of contributing towards his welfare and that his behaviour was the result of the physicians prescription which he affirmed was absolutely necessary for the recovery of his health the painter who had very little gall in his disposition was satisfied with this apology but his resentment which was before divided now glowed with double fire against his first fellowtraveller whom he looked upon as the author of all the mischances he had undergone and marked out for his vengeance accordingly yet the doors of reconciliation were not shut against the doctor who with great justice might have transferred this load of offence from himself to peregrine who was without doubt the source of the painters misfortune but in that case he must have owned himself mistaken in his medical capacity and he did not think the friendship of pallet important enough to be retrieved by such condescension so that he resolved to neglect him entirely and gradually forget the former correspondence he had maintained with a person whom he deemed so unworthy of his notice chapter lviii peregrine almost distracted with his disappointment conjures the fair fleming to permit his visits at brussels she withdraws from his pursuit things being thus adjusted and all the company dressed they went to breakfast about five in the morning and in less than an hour after were seated in the diligence where a profound silence prevailed peregrine who used to be the life of the society was extremely pensive and melancholy on account of his mishap the israelite and his dulcinea dejected in consequence of their disgrace the poet absorbed in lofty meditation the painter in schemes of revenge while jolter rocked by the motion of the carriage made himself amends for the want of rest he had sustained and the mendicant with his fair charge were infected by the cloudy aspect of our youth in whose disappointment each of them for different reasons bore no inconsiderable share this general languor and recess from all bodily exercise disposed them all to receive the gentle yoke of slumber and in halfanhour after they had embarked there was not one of them awake except our hero and his mistress unless the capuchin was pleased to counterfeit sleep in order to indulge our young gentleman with an opportunity of enjoying some private conversation with his beauteous ward peregrine did not neglect the occasion but on the contrary seized the first minute and in gentle murmurs lamented his hard hap in being thus the sport of fortune he assured her and that with great sincerity that all the cross accidents of his life had not cost him one half of the vexation and keenness of chagrin which he had suffered last night and that now he was on the brink of parting from her he should be overwhelmed with the blackest despair if she would not extend her compassion so far as to give him an opportunity of sighing at her feet in brussels during the few days his affairs would permit him to spend in that city this young lady with an air of mortification expressed her sorrow for being the innocent cause of his anxiety said she hoped last nights adventure would be a salutary warning to both their souls for she was persuaded that her virtue was protected by the intervention of heaven that whatever impression it might have made upon him she was enabled by it to adhere to that duty from which her passion had begun to swerve and beseeching him to forget her for his own peace gave him to understand that neither the plan she had laid down for her own conduct nor the dictates of her honour would allow her to receive his visits or carry on any other correspondence with him while she was restricted by the articles of her marriagevow this explanation produced such a violent effect upon her admirer that he was for some minutes deprived of the faculty of speech which he no sooner recovered than he gave vent to the most unbridled transports of passion he taxed her with barbarity and indifference told her that she had robbed him of his reason and internal peace that he would follow her to the ends of the earth and cease to live sooner than cease to love her that he would sacrifice the innocent fool who had been the occasion of all this disquiet and murder every man whom he considered as an obstruction to his views in a word his passions which had continued so long in a state of the highest fermentation together with the want of that repose which calms and quiets the perturbation of the spirits had wrought him up to a pitch of real distraction while he uttered these delirious expressions the tears ran down his cheeks and he underwent such agitation that the tender heart of the fair fleming was affected with his condition and while her own face was bedewed with the streams of sympathy she begged him for heavens sake to be composed and promised for his satisfaction to abate somewhat of the rigour of her purpose consoled by this kind declaration he recollected himself and taking out his pencil gave her his address when she had assured him that he should hear from her in fourandtwenty hours at farthest after their separation thus soothed he regained the empire of himself and by degrees recovered his serenity but this was not the case with his amanda who from this sample of his disposition dreaded the impetuosity of his youth and was effectually deterred from entering into any engagements that might subject her peace and reputation to the rash effects of such a violent spirit though she was captivated by his person and accomplishments she had reflection enough to foresee that the longer she countenanced his passion her own heart would be more and more irretrievably engaged and the quiet of her life the more exposed to continual interruption she therefore profited by these considerations and a sense of religious honour which helped her to withstand the suggestions of inclination and resolved to amuse her lover with false hopes until she should have it in her power to relinquish his conversation without running any risk of suffering by the inconsiderate sallies of his love it was with this view that she desired he would not insist upon attending her to her mothers house when they arrived at brussels and he cajoled by her artifice took a formal leave of her together with the other strangers fixing his habitation at the inn to which he and his fellowtravellers had been directed in the impatient expectation of receiving a kind summons from her within the limited time meanwhile in order to divert his imagination he went to see the stadthouse park and arsenal took a superficial view of the booksellers cabinet of curiosities and spent the evening at the italian opera which was at that time exhibited for the entertainment of prince charles of lorraine then governor of the low countries in short the stated period was almost lapsed when peregrine received a letter to this purport sir if you knew what violence i do my own heart in declaring that i have withdrawn myself for ever from your addresses you would surely applaud the sacrifice i make to virtue and strive to imitate this example of selfdenial yes sir heaven hath lent me grace to struggle with my guilty passion and henceforth to avoid the dangerous sight of him who inspired it i therefore conjure you by the regard you ought to have to the eternal welfare of us both as well as by the esteem and affection you profess to war with your unruly inclination and desist from all attempts of frustrating the laudable resolution i have made seek not to invade the peace of one who loves you to disturb the quiet of a family that never did you wrong and to alienate the thoughts of a weak woman from a deserving man who by the most sacred claim ought to have the full possession of her heart this billet without either date or subscription banished all remains of discretion from the mind of our hero who ran instantly to the landlord in all the ecstasy of madness and demanded to see the messenger who brought the letter on pain of putting his whole family to the sword the innkeeper terrified by his looks and menaces fell upon his knees protesting in the face of heaven that he was utterly ignorant and innocent of anything that could give him offence and that the billet was brought by a person whom he did not know and who retired immediately saying it required no answer he then gave utterance to his fury in a thousand imprecations and invectives against the writer whom he dishonoured with the appellations of a coquette a jilt an adventurer who by means of a pimping priest had defrauded him of his money he denounced vengeance against the mendicant whom he swore he would destroy if ever he should set eyes on him again the painter unluckily appearing during this paroxysm of rage he seized him by the throat saying he was ruined by his accursed folly and in all likelihood poor pallet would have been strangled had not jolter interposed in his behalf beseeching his pupil to have mercy upon the sufferer and with infinite anxiety desiring to know the cause of this violent assault he received no answer but a string of incoherent curses when the painter with unspeakable astonishment took god to witness that he bad done nothing to disoblige him the governor began to think in sad earnest that peregrines vivacity had at length risen to the transports of actual madness and was himself almost distracted with this supposition that he might the better judge what remedy ought to be applied he used his whole influence and practised all his eloquence upon the youth in order to learn the immediate cause of his delirium he employed the most pathetic entreaties and even shed tears in the course of his supplication so that pickle the first violence of the hurricane being blown over was ashamed of his own imprudence and retired to his chamber in order to recollect his dissipated thoughts there he shut himself up and for the second time perusing the fatal epistle began to waver in his opinion of the authors character and intention he sometimes considered her as one of those nymphs who under the mask of innocence and simplicity practise upon the hearts and purses of unwary and inexperienced youths this was the suggestion of his wrath inflamed by disappointment but when he reflected upon the circumstances of her behaviour and recalled her particular charms to his imagination the severity of his censure gave way and his heart declared in favour of her sincerity yet even this consideration aggravated the sense of his loss and he was in danger of relapsing into his former distraction when his passion was a little becalmed by the hope of seeing her again either by accident or in the course of a diligent and minute inquiry which he forthwith resolved to set on foot he had reason to believe that her own heart would espouse his cause in spite of her virtues determination and did not despair of meeting with the capuchin whose good offices he knew he could at any time command comforted with these reflections the tempest of his soul subsided in less than two hours he joined his company with an air of composure and asked the painters forgiveness for the freedom he had taken the cause of which he promised hereafter to explain pallet was glad of being reconciled on any terms to one whose countenance supported him in equilibrio with his antagonist the doctor and mr jolter was rejoiced beyond measure at his pupils recovery chapter lix peregrine meets with mrs hornbeck and is consoled for his loss his valetdechambre is embroiled with her duenna whom however he finds means to appease everything having thus resumed its natural channel they dined together in great tranquility in the afternoon peregrine on pretence of staying at home to write letters while his companions were at the coffeehouse ordered a coach to be called and with his valetdechambre who was the only person acquainted with the present state of his thoughts set out for the promenade to which all the ladies of fashion resort in the evening during the summer season in hopes of seeing his fugitive among the rest having made a circuit round the walk and narrowly observed every female in the place he perceived at some distance the livery of hornbeck upon a lacquey that stood at the back of a coach upon which he ordered his man to reconnoitre the said carriage while he pulled up his glasses that he might not be discovered before he should have received some intelligence by which he might conduct himself on this unexpected occasion that already began to interfere with the purpose of his coming thither though it could not dispute his attention with the idea of his charming unknown his mercury having made his observations reported that there was nobody in the coach but mrs hornbeck and an elderly woman who had all the air of a duenna and that the servant was not the same footman who had attended them in france encouraged by this information our hero ordered himself to be driven close up to that side of their convenience on which his old mistress sat and accosted her with the usual salutation this lady no sooner beheld her gallant than her cheeks reddened with a double glow and she exclaimed dear brother i am overjoyed to see you pray come into our coach he took the hint immediately and complying with her request embraced this new sister with great affection perceiving that her attendant was very much surprised and alarmed at this unexpected meeting she in order to banish her suspicion and at the same time give her lover his cue told him that his brother meaning her husband was gone to the spa for a few weeks by the advice of physicians on account of his ill state of health and that from his last letter she had the pleasure to tell him he was in a fair way of doing well the young gentleman expressed his satisfaction at this piece of news observing with an air of fraternal concern that if his brother had not made too free with his constitution his friends in england would have had no occasion to repine at his absence and want of health by which he was banished from his own country and connections he then asked with an affectation of surprise why she had not accompanied her spouse and was given to understand that his tenderness of affection would not suffer him to expose her to the fatigues of the journey which lay among rocks that were almost inaccessible the duennas doubts being eased by this preamble of conversation he changed the subject to the pleasures of the place and among other such questions inquired if she had as yet visited versailles this is a publichouse situated upon the canal at the distance of about two miles from town and accommodated with tolerable gardens for the entertainment of company when she replied in the negative he proposed to accompany her thither immediately but the governante who had hitherto sat silent objected to this proposal telling them in broken english that as the lady was under her care she could not answer to mr hornbeck for allowing her to visit such a suspicious place as for that matter madam said the confident gallant give yourself no trouble the consequences shall be at my peril and i will undertake to insure you against my brothers resentment so saying he directed the coachman to the place and ordered his own to follow under the auspices of his valetdechambre while the old gentlewoman overruled by his assurance quietly submitted to his authority being arrived at the place he handed the ladies from the coach and then for the first time observed that the duenna was lame a circumstance of which he did not scruple to take the advantage for they had scarce alighted and drunk a glass of wine when he advised his sister to enjoy a walk in the garden and although the attendant made shift to keep them almost always in view they enjoyed a detached conversation in which peregrine learned that the true cause of her being left behind at brussels whilst her husband proceeded to spa was his dread of the company and familiarities of that place to which his jealousy durst not expose her and that she had lived three weeks in a convent at lisle from which she was delivered by his own free motion because indeed he could no longer exist without her company and lastly our lover understood that her governante was a mere dragon who had been recommended to him by a spanish merchant whose wife she attended to her dying day but she very much questioned whether or not her fidelity was proof enough against money and strong waters peregrine assured her the experiment should be tried before parting and they agreed to pass the night at versailles provided his endeavours should succeed having exercised themselves in this manner until his duennas spirits were pretty much exhausted that she might be the be the better disposed to recruit them with a glass of liqueur they returned to their apartment and the cordial was recommended and received in a bumper but as it did not produce such a visible alteration as the sanguine hopes of pickle had made him expect and the old gentlewoman observed that it began to be late and that the gates would be shut in a little time he filled up a parting glass and pledged her in equal quantity her blood was too much chilled to be warmed even by this extraordinary dose which made immediate innovation in the brain of our youth who in the gaiety of his imagination overwhelmed this sheargus with such profusion of gallantry that she was more intoxicated with his expressions than with the spirits she had drunk when in the course of toying he dropped a purse into her bosom she seemed to forget how the night wore and with the approbation of her charge assented to his proposal of having something for supper this was a great point which our adventurer had gained and yet he plainly perceived that the governante mistook his meaning by giving herself credit for all the passion he had professed as this error could be rectified by no other means than those of plying her with the bottle until her distinguishing faculties should be overpowered he promoted a quick circulation she did him justice without any manifest signs of inebriation so long that his own eyes began to reel in the sockets and he found that before his scheme could be accomplished he should be effectually unfitted for all the purposes of love he therefore had recourse to his valetdechambre who understood the hint as soon as it was given and readily undertook to perform the part of which his master had played the prelude this affair being settled to his satisfaction and the night at odds with morning he took an opportunity of imparting to the ear of this aged dulcinea a kind whisper importing a promise of visiting her when his sister should be retired to her own chamber and an earnest desire of leaving her door unlocked this agreeable intimation being communicated he conveyed a caution of the same nature to mrs hornbeck as he led her to her apartment and darkness and silence no sooner prevailed in the house than he and his trusted squire set out on their different voyages everything would have succeeded according to their wish had not the valetdechambre suffered himself to fall asleep at the side of his inamorata and in the agitation of a violent dream exclaimed in a voice so unlike that of her supposed adorer that she distinguished the difference at once waking him with a pinch and a loud shriek she threatened to prosecute him for a rape and reviled him with all the epithets her rage and disappointment could suggest the frenchman finding himself detected behaved with great temper and address be begged she would compose herself on account of her own reputation which was extremely dear to him protesting that he had a most inviolable esteem for her person his representations had weight with the duenna who upon recollection comprehended the whole affair and thought it would be her interest to bring matters to an accommodation she therefore admitted the apologies of her bedfellow provided he would promise to atone by marriage for the injury she had sustained and in this particular he set her heart at ease by repeated vows which he uttered with surprising volubility though without any intention to perform the least title of their contents peregrine who had been alarmed by her exclamation and ran to the door with a view of interposing according to the emergency of the case overhearing the affair thus compromised returned to his mistress who was highly entertained with an account of what had passed foreseeing that for the future she should be under no difficulty or restriction from the severity of her guard chapter lx hornbeck is informed of his wifes adventure with peregrine for whom he prepares a stratagem which is rendered ineffectual by the information of pipes the husband is ducked for his intention and our hero apprehended by the patrol there was another person however still ungained and that was no other than her footman whose secrecy our hero attempted to secure in the morning by a handsome present which he received with many professions of gratitude and devotion to his service yet this complaisance was nothing but a cloak used to disguise the design he harboured of making his master acquainted with the whole transaction indeed this lacquey had been hired not only as a spy upon his mistress but also as a check on the conduct of the governante with promise of ample reward if ever he should discover any sinister or suspicious practices in the course of her behaviour as for the footman whom they had brought from england he was retained in attendance upon the person of his master whose confidence he had lost by advising him to gentle methods of reclaiming his lady when her irregularities had subjected her to his wrath the flemish valet in consequence of the office he had undertaken wrote to hornbeck by the first post giving an exact detail of the adventure at versailles with such a description of the pretended brother as left the husband no room to think he could be any other person than his first dishonourer and exasperated him to such a degree that he resolved to lay an ambush for this invader and at once disqualify him from disturbing his repose by maintaining further correspondence with his wife meanwhile the lovers enjoyed themselves without restraint and peregrines plan of inquiry after his dear unknown was for the present postponed his fellowtravellers were confounded at his mysterious motions which filled the heart of jolter with anxiety and terror this careful conductor was fraught with such experience of his pupils disposition that he trembled with the apprehension of some sudden accident and lived in continual alarm like a man that walks under the wall of a nodding tower nor did he enjoy any alleviations of his fears when upon telling the young gentleman that the rest of the company were desirous of departing for antwerp he answered they were at liberty to consult their own inclinations but for his own part he was resolved to stay in brussels a few days longer by this declaration the governor was confirmed in the opinion of his having some intrigue upon the anvil in the bitterness of his vexation he took the liberty of signifying his suspicion and reminding him of the dangerous dilemmas to which he had been reduced by his former precipitation peregrine took his caution in good part and promised to behave with such circumspection as would screen him from any troublesome consequences for the future but nevertheless behaved that same evening in such a manner as plainly showed that his prudence was nothing else than vain speculation he had made an appointment to spend the night as usual with mrs hornbeck and about nine oclock hastened to her lodgings when he was accosted in the street by his old discarded friend thomas pipes who without any other preamble told him that for all he had turned him adrift he did not choose to see him run full sail into his enemys harbour without giving him timely notice of the danger ill tell you what said he mayhap you think i want to curry favour that i may be taken in tow again if you do you have made a mistake in your reckoning i am old enough to be laid up and have to keep my planks from the weather but this here is the affair i have known you since you were no higher than a marlinspike and shouldnt care to see you deprived of your rigging at these years whereby i am informed by hornbecks man whom i this afternoon fell in with by chance as how his master has got intelligence of your boarding his wife and has steered privately into this port with a large complement of hands in order dye see to secure you while you are under the hatches now if so be as how you have a mind to give him a salt eel for his supper here am i without hope of fee or reward ready to stand by you as long as my timbers will stick together and if i expect any recompense may i be bound to eat oakum and drink bilgewater for life startled at this information peregrine examined him upon the particulars of his discourse with the lacquey and when he understood that hornbecks intelligence flowed from the canal of his flemish footman he believed every circumstance of toms report thanked him for his warning and after having reprimanded him for his misbehaviour at lisle assured him that it should be his own fault if ever they should part again he then deliberated with himself whether or not he should retort the purpose upon his adversary but when he considered that hornbeck was not the aggressor and made that unhappy husbands case his own he could not help quitting his intention of revenge though in his opinion it ought to have been executed in a more honourable manner and therefore he determined to chastise him for his want of spirit nothing surely can be more insolent and unjust than this determination which induced him to punish a person for his want of courage to redress the injury which he himself had done to his reputation and peace and yet this barbarity of decision is authorised by the opinion and practice of mankind with these sentiments he returned to the inn and putting a pair of pistols in his pocket ordered his valetdechambre and pipes to follow him at a small distance so as that they should be within call in case of necessity and then posted himself within thirty yards of his dulcineas door there he had not been above half an hour when he perceived four men take their station on the other side with a view as he guessed to watch for his going in that he might be taken unaware but when they had tarried a considerable time in that corner without reaping the fruits of their expectation their leader persuaded that the gallant had gained admittance by some secret means approached the door with his followers who according to the instructions they had received no sooner saw it opened than they rushed in leaving their employer in the street where he thought his person would be least endangered our adventurer seeing him all alone advanced with speed and clapping a pistol to his breast commanded him to follow his footsteps without noise on pain of immediate death terrified at this sudden apparition hornbeck obeyed in silence and in a few minutes they arrived at the quay where pickle halting gave him to understand that he was no stranger to his villainous design told him that if he conceived himself injured by any circumstance of his conduct he would now give him an opportunity of resenting the wrong in a manner becoming a man of honour you have a sword about you said he or if you dont choose to put the affair on that issue here is a brace of pistols take which you please such an address could not fail to disconcert a man of his character after some hesitation he in a faltering accent denied that his design was to mutilate mr pickle but that he thought himself entitled to the benefit of the law by which he would have obtained a divorce if he could have procured evidence of his wifes infidelity and with that view he had employed people to take advantage of the information he had received with regard to this alternative he declined it entirely because he could not see what satisfaction he should enjoy in being shot through the head or run through the lungs by a person who had already wronged him in an irreparable manner lastly his fear made him propose that the affair should be left to the arbitration of two creditable men altogether unconcerned in the dispute to these remonstrances peregrine replied in the style of a hotheaded young man conscious of his own unjustifiable behaviour that every gentleman ought to be a judge of his own honour and therefore he would submit to the decision of no umpire whatsoever that he would forgive his want of courage which might be a natural infirmity but his mean dissimulation he could not pardon that as he was certified of the rascally intent of his ambuscade by undoubted intelligence he would treat him not with a retaliation of his own treachery but with such indignity as a scoundrel deserves to suffer unless he would make one effort to maintain the character he assumed in life so saying he again presented his pistols which being rejected as before he called his two ministers and ordered them to duck him in the canal this command was pronounced and executed almost in the same breath to the unspeakable terror and disorder of the poor shivering patient who having undergone the immersion ran about like a drowned rat squeaking for assistance and revenge his cries were overheard by the patrol who chancing to pass that way took him under their protection and in consequence of his complaint and information went in pursuit of our adventurer and his attendants who were soon overtaken and surrounded rash and inconsiderate as the young gentleman was he did not pretend to stand upon the defensive against a file of musketeers although pipes had drawn his cutlass at their approach but surrendered himself without opposition and was conveyed to the main guard where the commanding officer engaged by his appearance and address treated him with all imaginable respect hearing the particulars of his adventure he assured him that the prince would consider the whole as a tour de jeunesse and order him to be released without delay next morning when this gentleman gave in his report he made such a favourable representation of the prisoner that our hero was on the point of being discharged when hornbeck preferred a complaint accusing him of a purposed assassination and praying that such punishment should be inflicted upon him as his highness should think adequate to the nature of the crime the prince perplexed with this petition in consequence of which he foresaw that he must disoblige a british subject sent for the plaintiff of whom he had some knowledge and in person exhorted him to drop the prosecution which would only serve to propagate his own shame but hornbeck was too much incensed to listen to any proposal of that kind and peremptorily demanded justice against the prisoner whom he represented as an obscure adventurer who had made repeated attempts upon his honour and his life prince charles told him that what he had advised was in the capacity of a friend but since he insisted upon his acting as a magistrate the affair should be examined and determined according to the dictates of justice and truth the petitioner being dismissed with this promise the defendant was in his turn brought before the judge whose prepossession in his favour was in a great measure weakened by what his antagonist had said to the prejudice of his birth and reputation chapter lxi peregrine is released jolter confounded at his mysterious conduct a contest happens between the poet and painter who are reconciled by the mediation of their fellowtravellers our hero understanding from some expressions which escaped the prince that he was considered in the light of a sharper and assassin begged that he might have the liberty of sending for some vouchers that would probably vindicate his character from the malicious aspersions of his adversary this permission being granted he wrote a letter to his governor desiring that he would bring to him the letters of recommendation which he had received from the british ambassador at paris and such other papers as he thought conducive to evince the importance of his situation the billet was given in charge to one of the subaltern officers on duty who carried it to the inn and demanded to speak with mr jolter pallet who happened to be at the door when this messenger arrived and heard him inquire for the tutor ran directly to that gentlemans apartment and in manifest disorder told him that a huge fellow of a soldier with a monstrous pair of whiskers and fur cap as big as a bushel was asking for him at the door the poor governor began to shake at this intimation though he was not conscious of having committed anything that could attract the attention of the state when the officer appeared at his chamber door his confusion increased to such a degree that his perception seemed to vanish and the subaltern repeated the purport of his errand three times before he could comprehend his meaning or venture to receive the letter which he presented at length he summoned all his fortitude and having perused the epistle his terror sank into anxiety his ingenuous fear immediately suggested that peregrine was confined in a dungeon for some outrage he had committed he ran with great agitation to a trunk and taking out a bundle of papers followed his conductor being attended by the painter to whom he had hinted his apprehension when they passed through the guard which was under arms the hearts of both died within them and when they came into the presence there was such an expression of awful horror on the countenance of jolter that the prince observing his dismay was pleased to encourage him with an assurance that he had nothing to fear thus comforted he recollected himself so well as to understand his pupil when he desired him to produce the ambassadors letters some of which being open were immediately read by his highness who was personally acquainted with the writer and knew several of the noblemen to whom they were addressed these recommendations were so warm and represented the young gentleman in such an advantageous light that the prince convinced of the injustice his character had suffered by the misrepresentation of hornbeck took our hero by the hand asked pardon for the doubts he had entertained of his honour declared him from that moment at liberty ordered his domestics to be enlarged and offered him his countenance and protection as long as he should remain in the austrian netherlands at the same time he cautioned him against indiscretion in the course of his gallantries and took his word of honour that he should drop all measures of resentment against the person of hornbeck during his residence in that place the delinquent thus honourably acquitted thanked the prince in the most respectful manner for his generosity and candour and retired with his two friends who were amazed and bewildered in their thoughts at what they had seen and heard the whole adventure still remaining without the sphere of their comprehension which was not at all enlarged by the unaccountable appearance of pipes who with the valetdechambre joined them at the castle gate had jolter been a man of a luxuriant imagination his brain would undoubtedly have suffered in the investigation of his pupils mysterious conduct which he strove in vain to unravel but his intellects were too solid to be affected by the miscarriage of his invention and as peregrine did not think proper to make him acquainted with the cause of his being apprehended he contented himself with supposing that there was a lady in the case the painter whose imagination was of a more flimsy texture formed a thousand chimerical conjectures which he communicated to pickle in imperfect insinuations hoping by his answers and behaviour to discover the truth but the youth in order to tantalise him eluded all his inquiries with such appearance of industry and art as heightened his curiosity while it disappointed his aim and inflamed him to such a degree of impatience that his wits began to be unsettled then peregrine was fain to recompose his brain by telling him in confidence that he had been arrested as a spy this secret he found more intolerable than his former uncertainty he ran from one apartment to another like a goose in the agonies of egglaying with intention of disburdening this important load but jolter being engaged with the pupil and all the people of the house ignorant of the only language he could speak he was compelled with infinite reluctance to address himself to the doctor who was at that time shut up in his own chamber having knocked at the door to no purpose he peeped through the keyhole and saw the physician sitting at a table with a pen in one hand and paper before him his head reclined upon his other hand and his eyes fixed upon the ceiling as if he had been entranced pallet concluding that he was under the power of some convulsion endeavoured to force the door open and the noise of his efforts recalled the doctor from his reverie this poetical republican being so disagreeably disturbed started up in a passion and opening the door no sooner perceived who had interrupted him than he flung it in his face with great fury and cursed him for his impertinent intrusion which had deprived him of the most delightful vision that ever regaled the human fancy he imagined as he afterwards imparted to peregrine that as he enjoyed himself in walking through the flowery plain that borders on parnassus he was met by a venerable sage whom by a certain divine vivacity that lightened from his eyes he instantly knew to be the immortal pindar he was immediately struck with reverence and awe and prostrated himself before the apparition which taking him by the hand lifted him gently from the ground and with words more sweet than the honey of the hybla bees told him that of all the moderns he alone was visited by that celestial impulse by which he himself had been inspired when he produced his most applauded odes so saying he led him up the sacred hill persuaded him to drink a copious draught of the waters of the hippocrene and then presented him to the harmonious nine who crowned his temples with a laurel wreath no wonder that he was enraged to find himself cut off from such sublime society he raved in greek against the invader who was so big with his own purpose that unmindful of the disgrace he had sustained and disregarding all the symptoms of the physicians displeasure he applied his mouth to the door in an eager tone ill hold you any wager said he that i guess the true cause of mr pickles imprisonment to this challenge he received no reply and therefore repeated it adding i suppose you imagine he was taken up for fighting a duel or affronting a nobleman or lying with some mans wife or some such matter but egad you was never more mistaken in your life and ill lay my cleopatra against your homers head that in fourandtwenty hours you shant light on the true reason the favourite of the muses exasperated at this vexatious perseverance of the painter who he imagined had come to tease and insult him i would said he sacrifice a cock to esculapius were i assured that any person had been taken up for extirpating such a troublesome goth as you are from the face of the earth as for your boasted cleopatra which you say was drawn from your own wife i believe the copy has as much of the to kalon as the original but were it mine it should be hung up in the temple of cloacina as the picture of that goddess for any other apartment would be disgraced by its appearance hark ye sir replied pallet enraged in his turn at the contemptuous mention of his darling performance you may make as free with my wife as you think proper but ware my works those are the children of my fancy conceived by the glowing imagination and formed by the art of my own hands and you yourself are a goth and a turk and a tartar and an impudent pretending jackanapes to treat with such disrespect a production which in the opinion of all the connoisseurs of the age will when finished be a masterpiece in its kind and do honour to human genius and skill so i say again and again and i care not though your friend playtor heard me that you have no more taste than a draymans horse and that those foolish notions of the ancients ought to be drubbed out of you with a pod cudgel that you might learn to treat men of parts with more veneration perhaps you may not always be in the company of one who will halloo for assistance when you are on the brink of being chastised for your insolence as i did when you brought upon yourself the resentment of that scot who by the lord would have paid you both scot and lot as falstaff says if the french officer had not put him in arrest the physician to this declamation which was conveyed through the keyhole answered that he the painter was a fellow so infinitely below his consideration that his conscience upbraided him with no action of his life except that of choosing such a wretch for his companion and fellowtraveller that he had viewed his character through the medium of goodnature and compassion which had prompted him to give pallet an opportunity of acquiring some new ideas under his immediate instruction but he had abused his goodness and condescension in such a flagrant manner that he was now determined to discard him entirely from his acquaintance and desired him for the present to take himself away on pain of being kicked for his presumption pallet was too much incensed to be intimidated by this threat which he retorted with great virulence defying him to come forth that it might appear which of them was best skilled in that pedestrian exercise which he immediately began to practise against the door with such thundering application as reached the ears of pickle and his governor who coming out into the passage and seeing him thus employed asked if he had forgot the chamberpots of alost that he ventured to behave in such a manner as entitled him to a second prescription of the same nature the doctor understanding that there was company at hand opened the door in a twinkling and springing upon his antagonist like a tiger a fierce contention would have ensued to the infinite satisfaction of our hero had not jolter to the manifest peril of his own person interposed and partly by force and partly by exhortations put a stop to the engagement before it was fairly begun after having demonstrated the indecency of such a vulgar rencontre betwixt two fellowcitizens in a foreign land he begged to know the cause of their dissension and offered his good offices towards an accommodation peregrine also seeing the fray was finished expressed himself to the same purpose and the painter for obvious reasons declining an explanation his antagonist told the youth what a mortifying interruption he had suffered by the impertinent intrusion of pallet and gave him a detail of the particulars of his vision as above recited the arbiter owned the provocation was not to be endured and decreed that the offender should make some atonement for his transgression upon which the painter observed that however he might have been disposed to make acknowledgments if the physician had signified his displeasure like a gentleman the complainant had now forfeited all claim to any such concessions by the vulgar manner in which he had reviled him and his productions observing that if he the painter had been inclined to retort his slanderous insinuations the republicans own works would have afforded ample subject for his ridicule and censure after divers disputes and representations peace was at length concluded on condition that for the future the doctor should never mention cleopatra unless he could say something in her praise and that pallet in consideration of his having been the first aggressor should make a sketch of the physicians vision to be engraved and prefixed to the next edition of his odes chapter lxii the travellers depart for antwerp at which place the painter gives a loose to his enthusiasm our adventurer baffled in all his efforts to retrieve his lost amanda yielded at length to the remonstrances of his governor and fellowtravellers who out of pure complaisance to him had exceeded their intended stay by six days at least and a couple of postchaises with three ridinghorses being hired they departed from brussels in the morning dined at mechlin and arrived about eight in the evening at the venerable city of antwerp during this days journey pallet was elevated to an uncommon flow of spirits with the prospect of seeing the birthplace of rubens for whom he professed an enthusiastic admiration he swore that the pleasure he felt was equal to that of a mussulman on the last day of his pilgrimage to mecca and that he already considered himself a native of antwerp being so intimately acquainted with their so justly boasted citizen from whom at certain junctures he could not help believing himself derived because his own pencil adopted the manner of that great man with surprising facility and his face wanted nothing but a pair of whiskers and a beard to exhibit the express image of the flemings countenance he told them he was so proud of this resemblance that in order to render it more striking he had at one time of his life resolved to keep his face sacred from the razor and in that purpose had persevered notwithstanding the continual reprehensions of mrs pallet who being then with child said his aspect was so hideous that she dreaded a miscarriage every hour until she threatened in plain terms to dispute the sanity of his intellects and apply to the chancellor for a committee the doctor on this occasion observed that a man who is not proof against the solicitations of a woman can never expect to make a great figure in life that painters and poets ought to cultivate no wives but the muses or if they are by the accidents of fortune encumbered with families they should carefully guard against that pernicious weakness falsely honoured with the appellation of natural affection and pay no manner of regard to the impertinent customs of the world granting that you had been for a short time deemed a lunatic said he you might have acquitted yourself honourably of that imputation by some performance that would have raised your character above all censure sophocles himself that celebrated tragic poet who for the sweetness of his versification was styled melitta or the bee in his old age suffered the same accusation from his own children who seeing him neglect his family affairs and devote himself entirely to poetry carried him before the magistrate as a man whose intellects were so much impaired by the infirmities of age that he was no longer fit to manage his domestic concerns upon which the reverend bard produced his tragedy of oidipus epi kolono as a work he had just finished which being perused instead of being declared unsound of understanding he was dismissed with admiration and applause i wish your beard and whiskers had been sanctioned by the like authority though i am afraid you would have been in the predicament of those disciples of a certain philosopher who drank decoctions of cummin seeds that their faces might adopt the paleness of their masters complexion hoping that in being as wan they would be as learned as their teacher the painter stung by this sarcasm replied or like those virtuosi who by repeating greek eating sillikicaby and pretending to see visions think they equal the ancients in taste and genius the physician retorted pallet rejoined and the altercation continued until they entered the gates of antwerp when the admirer of rubens broke forth into a rapturous exclamation which put an end to the dispute and attracted the notice of the inhabitants many of whom by shrugging up their shoulders and pointing to their foreheads gave shrewd indications that they believed him a poor gentleman disordered in his brain they had no sooner alighted at the inn than this pseudoenthusiast proposed to visit the great church in which he had been informed some of his masters pieces were to be seen and was remarkably chagrined when he understood that he could not be admitted till next day he rose next morning by daybreak and disturbed his fellowtravellers in such a noisy and clamorous manner that peregrine determined to punish him with some new infliction and while he put on his clothes actually formed the plan of promoting a duel between him and the doctor in the management of which he promised himself store of entertainment from the behaviour of both being provided with one of those domestics who are always in waiting to offer their services to strangers on their first arrival they were conducted to the house of a gentleman who had an excellent collection of pictures and though the greatest part of them were painted by his favourite artist pallet condemned them all by the lump because pickle had told him beforehand that there was not one performance of rubens among the number the next place they visited was what is called the academy of painting furnished with a number of paltry pieces in which our painter recognised the style of peter paul with many expressions of admiration on the same sort of previous intelligence from this repository they went to the great church and being led to the tomb of rubens the whimsical painter fell upon his knees and worshipped with such appearance of devotion that the attendant scandalized at his superstition pulled him up observing with great warmth that the person buried in that place was no saint but as great a sinner as himself and that if he was spiritually disposed there was a chapel of the blessed virgin at the distance of three yards on the right hand to which he might retire he thought it was incumbent upon him to manifest some extraordinary inspiration while he resided on the spot where rubens was born and therefore his whole behaviour was an affectation of rapture expressed in distracted exclamations convulsive starts and uncouth gesticulations in the midst of this frantic behaviour he saw an old capuchin with a white beard mount the pulpit and hold forth to the congregation with such violence of emphasis and gesture as captivated his fancy and bawling aloud zounds what an excellent paul preaching at athens he pulled a pencil and a small memorandum book from his pocket and began to take a sketch of the orator with great eagerness and agitation saying egad friend raphael we shall see whether you or i have got the best knack at trumping up an apostle this appearance of disrespect gave offence to the audience who began to murmur against this heretic libertine when one of the priests belonging to the choir in order to prevent any ill consequence from their displeasure came and told him in the french language that such liberties were not permitted in their religion and advised him to lay aside his implements lest the people should take umbrage at his design and be provoked to punish him as a profane scoffer at their worship the painter seeing himself addressed by a friar who while he spoke bowed with great complaisance imagined that he was a begging brother come to supplicate his charity and his attention being quite engrossed by the design he was making he patted the priests shaven crown with his hand saying oter tems oter tems and then resumed his pencil with great earnestness the ecclesiastic perceiving that the stranger did not comprehend his meaning pulled him by the sleeve and explained himself in the latin tongue upon which pallet provoked at his intrusion cursed him aloud for an impudent beggarly son of a w and taking out a shilling flung it upon the pavement with manifest signs of indignation some of the common people enraged to see their religion contemned and their priests insulted at the very altar rose from their seats and surrounding the astonished painter one of the number snatched his book from his hand and tore it into a thousand pieces frightened as he was he could not help crying fire and fagots all my favourite ideas are gone to wreck and was in danger of being very roughly handled by the crowd had not peregrine stepped in and assured them that he was a poor unhappy gentleman who laboured under a transport of the brain those who understood the french language communicated this information to the rest so that he escaped without any other chastisement than being obliged to retire and as they could not see the famous descent from the cross till after the service was finished they were conducted by their domestic to the house of a painter where they found a beggar standing for his picture and the artist actually employed in representing a huge louse that crawled upon his shoulder pallet was wonderfully pleased with this circumstance which he said was altogether a new thought and an excellent hint of which he would make his advantage and in the course of his survey of this flemings performances perceiving a piece in which two flies were engaged upon the carcass of a dog half devoured he ran to his brother brush and swore he was worthy of being a fellowcitizen of the immortal rubens he then lamented with many expressions of grief and resentment that he had lost his commonplace book in which he had preserved a thousand conceptions of the same sort formed by the accidental objects of his senses and imagination and took an opportunity of telling his fellowtravellers that in execution he had equalled if not excelled the two ancient painters who had vied with each other in the representation of a curtain and a bunch of grapes for he had exhibited the image of a certain object so like to nature that the bare sight of it set a whole hogsty in an uproar when he had examined and applauded all the productions of this minute artist they returned to the great church and were entertained with the view of that celebrated masterpiece of rubens in which he has introduced the portraits of himself and his whole family the doors that conceal this capital performance were no sooner unfolded than our enthusiast debarred the use of speech by a previous covenant with his friend pickle lifted up his hands and eyes and putting himself in the attitude of hamlet when his fathers ghost appears adored in silent ecstasy and awe he even made a merit of necessity and when they had withdrawn from the place protested that his whole faculties were swallowed up in love and admiration he now professed himself more than ever enamoured of the flemish school raved in extravagant encomiums and proposed that the whole company should pay homage to the memory of the divine rubens by repairing forthwith to the house in which he lived and prostrating themselves on the floor of his paintingroom as there was nothing remarkable in the tenement which had been rebuilt more than once since the death of that great man peregrine excused himself from complying with the proposal on pretence of being fatigued with the circuit they had already performed jolter declined it for the same reason and the question being put to the doctor he refused his company with an air of disdain pallet piqued at his contemptuous manner asked if he would not go and see the habitation of pindoor provided he was in the city where that poet lived and when the physician observed that there was an infinite difference between the men that ill allow replied the painter for the devil a poet ever lived in greece or troy that was worthy to clean the pencils of our beloved rubens the physician could not with any degree of temper and forbearance hear this outrageous blasphemy for which he said pallets eyes ought to be picked out by owls and the dispute arose as usual to such scurrilities of language and indecency of behaviour that passengers began to take notice of their animosity and peregrine was obliged to interpose for his own credit chapter lxiii peregrine artfully foments a quarrel between pallet and the physician who fight a duel on the ramparts the painter betook himself to the house of the flemish raphael and the rest of the company went back to their lodgings where the young gentleman taking the advantage of being alone with the physician recapitulated all the affronts he had sustained from the painters petulance aggravating every circumstance of the disgrace and advising him in the capacity of a friend to take care of his honour which could not fail to suffer in the opinion of the world if he allowed himself to be insulted with impunity by one so much his inferior in every degree of consideration the physician assured him that pallet had hitherto escaped chastisement by being deemed an object unworthy his resentment and in consideration of the wretchs family for which his compassion was interested but that repeated injuries would inflame the most benevolent disposition and though he could find no precedent of duelling among the greeks and romans whom he considered as the patterns of demeanour pallet should no longer avail himself of his veneration for the ancients but be punished for the very next offence he should commit having thus spirited up the doctor to a resolution from which he could not decently swerve our adventurer acted the incendiary with the other party also giving him to understand that the physician treated his character with such contempt and behaved to him with such insolence as no gentleman ought to bear that for his own part he was every day put out of countenance by their mutual animosity which appeared in nothing but vulgar expressions more becoming shoeboys and oysterwomen than men of honour and education and therefore he should be obliged contrary to his inclination to break off all correspondence with them both if they would not fall upon some method to retrieve the dignity of their characters these representations would have had little effect upon the timidity of the painter who was likewise too much of a grecian to approve of single combat in any other way than that of boxing an exercise in which he was well skilled had they not been accompanied with an insinuation that his antagonist was no hector and that he might humble him into any concession without running the least personal risk animated by this assurance our second rubens set the trumpet of defiance to his mouth swore he valued not his life a rush when his honour was concerned and entreated mr pickle to be the bearer of a challenge which he would instantly commit to writing the mischievous fomenter highly applauded this manifestation of courage by which he was at liberty to cultivate his friendship and society but declined the office of carrying the billet that his tenderness of pallets reputation might not be misinterpreted into an officious desire of promoting quarrels at the same time he recommended tom pipes not only as a very proper messenger on this occasion but also as a trusty second in the field the magnanimous painter took his advice and retiring to his chamber penned a challenge in these terms sir when i am heartily provoked i fear not the devil himself much less i will not call you a pedantic coxcomb nor an unmannerly fellow because these are the hippethets of the vulgar but remember such as you are i nyther love you nor fear you but on the contrary expect satisfaction for your audacious behaviour to me on divers occasions and will this evening in the twilight meet you on the ramparts with sword and pistol where the lord have mercy on the soul of one of us for your body shall find no favour with your incensed defier till death layman pallet this resolute defiance after having been submitted to the perusal and honoured with the approbation of our youth was committed to the charge of pipes who according to his orders delivered it in the afternoon and brought for answer that the physician would attend him at the appointed time and place the challenger was evidently discomposed at the unexpected news of this acceptance and ran about the house in great disorder in quest of peregrine to beg his further advice and assistance but understanding that the youth was engaged in private with his adversary he began to suspect some collusion and cursed himself for his folly and precipitation he even entertained some thoughts of retracting his invitation and submitting to the triumph of his antagonist but before he would stoop to this opprobrious condescension he resolved to try another expedient which might be the means of saving both his character and person in this hope he visited mr jolter and very gravely desired he would be so good as to undertake the office of his second in a duel which he was to fight that evening with the physician the governor instead of answering his expectation in expressing fear and concern and breaking forth into exclamations of good god gentlemen what dye mean you shall not murder one another while it is in my power to prevent your purpose i will go directly to the governor of the place who shall interpose his authority i say instead of these and other friendly menaces of prevention jolter heard the proposal with the most phlegmatic tranquility and excused himself from accepting the honour he intended for him on account of his character and situation which would not permit him to be concerned in any such rencontres indeed this mortifying reception was owing to a previous hint from peregrine who dreading some sort of interruption from his governor had made him acquainted with his design and assured him that the affair should not be brought to any dangerous issue thus disappointed the dejected challenger was overwhelmed with perplexity and dismay and in the terrors of death or mutilation resolved to deprecate the wrath of his enemy and conform to any submission he should propose when he was accidentally encountered by our adventurer who with demonstrations of infinite satisfaction told him in confidence that the billet had thrown the doctor into an agony of consternation that his acceptance of his challenge was a mere effort of despair calculated to confound the ferocity of the sender and dispose him to listen to terms of accommodation that he had imparted the letter to him with fear and trembling on pretence of engaging him as a second but in reality with a view of obtaining his good offices in promoting a reconciliation but perceiving the situation of his mind added our hero i thought it would be more for your honour to baffle his expectation and therefore i readily undertook the task of attending him to the field in full assurance that he will there humble himself before you even to prostration in this security you may go and prepare your arms and bespeak the assistance of pipes who will squire you in the field while i keep myself up that our correspondence may not be suspected by the physician pallets spirits that were sunk to dejection rose at this encouragement to all the insolence of triumph he again declared his contempt of danger and his pistols being loaded and accommodated with new flints by his trusty armourbearer he waited without flinching for the hour of battle on the first approach of twilight somebody knocked at his door and pipes having opened it at his desire he heard the voice of his antagonist pronounce tell mr pallet that i am going to the place of appointment the painter was not a little surprised at this anticipation which so ill agreed with the information he had received from pickle and his concern beginning to recur he fortified himself with a large bumper of brandy which however did not overcome the anxiety of his thoughts nevertheless he set out on the expedition with his second betwixt whom and himself the following dialogue passed in their way to the ramparts mr pipes said the painter with disordered accent methinks the doctor was in a pestilent hurry with that message of his ey ey answered tom i do suppose he longs to be foul of you what replied the other dye think he thirsts after my blood to be sure a does said pipes thrusting a large quid of tobacco in his check with great deliberation if that be the case cried pallet beginning to shake he is no better than a cannibal and no christian ought to fight him on equal footing tom observing his emotion eyed him with a frown of indignation saying you ant afraid are you god forbid replied the challenger stammering with fear what should i be afraid of the worst he can do is to take my life and then hell be answerable both to god and man for the murder dont you think he will i think no such matter answered the second if so be as how he puts a brace of bullets through your bows and kills you fairly it is no more murder than if i was to bring down a noddy from the main topsail yard by this time pallets teeth chattered with such violence that he could scarce pronounce this reply mr thomas you seem to make very light of a mans life but i trust in the almighty i shall not be so easily brought down sure many a man has fought a duel without losing his life do you imagine that i run such a hazard of falling by the hand of my adversary you may or you may not said the unconcerned pipes just as it happens what then death is a debt that every man owes according to the song and if you set foot to foot i think one of you must go to pot foot to foot exclaimed the terrified painter thats downright butchery and ill be d before i fight any man on earth in such a barbarous way what dye take me to be a savage beast this declaration he made while they ascended the ramparts his attendant perceiving the physician and his second at the distance of a hundred paces before them gave him notice of their appearance and advised him to make ready and behave like a man pallet in vain endeavoured to conceal his panic which discovered itself in a universal trepidation of body and the lamentable tone in which he answered this exhortation of pipes saying i do behave like a man but you would have me act the part of a brute are they coming this way when tom told him that they had faced about and admonished him to advance the nerves of his arm refused their office he could not hold out his pistol and instead of going forward retreated with an insensibility of motion till pipes placing himself in the rear set his own back to that of his principal and swore he should not budge an inch farther in that direction while the valet thus tutored the painter his master enjoyed the terrors of the physician which were more ridiculous than those of pallet because he was more intent upon disguising them his declaration to pickle in the morning would not suffer him to start any objections when he received the challenge and finding that the young gentleman made no offer of mediating the affair but rather congratulated him on the occasion when he communicated the painters billet all his efforts consisted in oblique hints and general reflections upon the absurdity of duelling which was first introduced among civilised nations by the barbarous huns and longobards he likewise pretended to ridicule the use of firearms which confounded all the distinctions of skill and address and deprived a combatant of the opportunity of signalizing his personal prowess pickle assented to the justness of his observations but at the same time represented the necessity of complying with the customs of this world ridiculous as they were on which a mans honour and reputation depend so that seeing no hopes of profiting by that artifice the republicans agitation became more and more remarkable and he proposed in plain terms that they should contend in armour like the combatants of ancient days for it was but reasonable that they should practise the manner of fighting since they adopted the disposition of those iron times nothing could have afforded more diversion to our hero than the sight of two such duellists cased in iron and he wished that he had promoted the quarrel in brussels where he could have hired the armour of charles the fifth and the valiant duke of parma for their accommodation but as there was no possibility of furnishing them capapie at antwerp he persuaded him to conform to the modern use of the sword and meet the painter on his own terms and suspecting that his fear would supply him with other excuses for declining the combat he comforted him with some distant insinuations to the prejudice of his adversarys courage which would in all probability evaporate before any mischief could happen notwithstanding this encouragement he could not suppress the reluctance with which he went to the field and cast many a wishful look over his left shoulder to see whether or not his adversary was at his heels when by the advice of his second he took possession of the ground and turned about with his face to the enemy it was not so dark but that peregrine could perceive the unusual paleness of his countenance and the sweat standing in large drops upon his forehead nay there was a manifest disorder in his speech when he regretted his want of the pila and parma with which he would have made a rattling noise to astonish his foe in springing forward and singing the hymn to battle in the manner of the ancients in the meantime observing the hesitation of his antagonist who far from advancing seemed to recoil and even struggle with his second he guessed the situation of the painters thoughts and collecting all the manhood that he possessed seized the opportunity of profiting by his enemys consternation striking his sword and pistol together he advanced in a sort of trot raising a loud howl in which he repeated in lieu of the spartan song part of the strophe from one of pindars pythia beginning with ek theon gar makanoi pasai broteais aretais etc this imitation of the greeks had all the desired effect upon the painter who seeing the physician running towards him like a fury with a pistol in his right hand which was extended and hearing the dreadful yell he uttered and the outlandish words he pronounced was seized with a universal palsy of his limbs he would have dropped down upon the ground had not pipes supported and encouraged him to stand upon his defence the doctor contrary to his expectation finding that he had not flinched from the spot though he had now performed one half of his career put in practice his last effort by firing his pistol the noise of which no sooner reached the ears of the affrighted painter than he recommended his soul to god and roared for mercy with great vociferation the republican overjoyed at this exclamation commanded him to yield and surrender his arms on pain of immediate death upon which he threw away his pistols and sword in spite of all the admonitions and even threats of his second who left him to his fate and went up to his master stopping his nose with signs of loathing and abhorrence the victor having won the spolia opima granted him his life on condition that he would on his knees supplicate his pardon acknowledge himself inferior to his conqueror in every virtue and qualification and promise for the future to merit his favour by submission and respect these insolent terms were readily embraced by the unfortunate challenger who fairly owned that he was not at all calculated for the purposes of war and that henceforth he would contend with no weapon but his pencil he begged with great humility that mr pickle would not think the worse of his morals for this defect of courage which was a natural infirmity inherited from his father and suspend his opinion of his talents until he should have an opportunity of contemplating the charms of his cleopatra which would be finished in less than three months our hero observed with an affected air of displeasure that no man could be justly condemned for being subject to the impressions of fear and therefore his cowardice might easily be forgiven but there was something so presumptuous dishonest and disingenuous in arrogating a quality to which he knew he had not the smallest pretension that he could not forget his misbehaviour all at once though he would condescend to communicate with him as formerly in hopes of seeking a reformation in his conduct pallet protested that there was no dissimulation in the case for he was ignorant of his own weakness until his resolution was put to the trial he faithfully promised to demean himself during the remaining part of the tour with that conscious modesty and penitence which became a person in his condition and for the present implored the assistance of mr pipes in disembarrassing him from the disagreeable consequence of his fear chapter lxiv the doctor exults in his victory they set out for rotterdam where they are entertained by two dutch gentlemen in a yacht which is overturned in the maese to the manifest hazard of the painters life they spend the evening with their entertainers and next day visit a cabinet of curiosities tom was accordingly ordered to administer to his occasions and the conqueror elated with his success which he in a great measure attributed to his manner of attack and the hymn which he howled told peregrine that he was now convinced of the truth of what pindar sung in these words ossa de me pephileke zeus atuzontai boan pieridon aionta for he had no sooner begun to repeat the mellifluent strains of that divine poet than the wretch his antagonist was confounded and his nerves unstrung on their return to the inn he expatiated on the prudence and tranquility of his own behaviour and ascribed the consternation of pallet to the remembrance of some crime that lay heavy upon his conscience for in his opinion a man of virtue and common sense could not possibly be afraid of death which is not only the peaceful harbour that receives him shattered on the tempestuous sea of life but also the eternal seal of his fame and glory which it is no longer in his power to forfeit and forego he lamented his fate in being doomed to live in such degenerate days when war is become a mercenary trade and ardently wished that the day would come when he should have such an opportunity of signalizing his courage in the cause of liberty as that of marathon where a handful of athenians fighting for their freedom defeated the whole strength of the persian empire would to heaven said he my muse were blessed with an occasion to emulate that glorious testimony on the trophy in cyprus erected by cimon for two great victories gained on the same day over the persians by sea and land in which it is very remarkable that the greatness of the occasion has raised the manner of expression above the usual simplicity and modesty of all other ancient inscriptions he then repeated it with all the pomp of declamation and signified his hope that the french would one day invade us with such an army as that which xerxes led into greece that it might be in his power to devote himself like leonidas to the freedom of his country this memorable combat being thus determined and everything that was remarkable in antwerp surveyed they sent their baggage down the scheldt to rotterdam and set out for the same place in a postwaggon which that same evening brought them in safety to the banks of the maese they put up at an english house of entertainment remarkable for the modesty and moderation of the landlord and next morning the doctor went in person to deliver letters of recommendation to two dutch gentlemen from one of his acquaintance at paris neither of them happened to be at home when he called so that he left a message at their lodgings with his address and in the afternoon they waited upon the company and after many hospitable professions one of the two invited them to spend the evening at his house meanwhile they had provided a pleasure yacht in which they proposed to treat them with an excursion upon the maese this being almost the only diversion that place affords our young gentleman relished the proposal and notwithstanding the remonstrances of mr jolter who declined the voyage on account of the roughness of the weather they went on board without hesitation and found a collation prepared in the cabin while they tacked to and fro in the river under the impulse of a mackerel breeze the physician expressed his satisfaction and pallet was ravished with the entertainment but the wind increasing to the unspeakable joy of the dutchmen who had now an opportunity of showing their dexterity in the management of the vessel the guests found it inconvenient to stand upon deck and impossible to sit below on account of the clouds of tobacco smoke which rolled from the pipes of their entertainers in such volumes as annoyed them even to the hazard of suffocation this fumigation together with the extraordinary motion of the ship began to affect the head and stomach of the painter who begged earnestly to be set on shore but the dutch gentlemen who had no idea of his sufferings insisted with surprising obstinacy of regard upon his staying until he should see an instance of the skill of the mariners and bringing him on deck commanded the men to carry the vessels lee gunwale under water this nicety of navigation they instantly performed to the admiration of pickle the discomposure of the doctor and terror of pallet who blessed himself from the courtesy of a dutchman and prayed to heaven for his deliverance while the hollanders enjoyed the reputation of this feat and the distress of the painter at the same time the yacht was overtaken by a sudden squall that overset her in a moment and flung every man overboard into the maese before they could have the least warning of their fate much less time to provide against the accident peregrine who was an expert swimmer reached the shore in safety the physician in the agonies of despair laid fast hold on the trunkbreeches of one of the men who dragged him to the other side the entertainers landed at the bombkeys smoking their pipes all the way with great deliberation and the poor painter must have gone to the bottom had not he been encountered by the cable of a ship that lay at anchor near the scene of their disaster though his senses had forsaken him his hands fastened by instinct on this providential occurrence which he held with such a convulsive grasp that when a boat was sent out to bring him on shore it was with the utmost difficulty that his fingers were disengaged he was carried into a house deprived of the use of speech and bereft of all sensation and being suspended by the heels a vast quantity of water ran out of his mouth this evacuation being made he began to utter dreadful groans which gradually increased to a continued roar and after he had regained the use of his senses he underwent a delirium that lasted several hours as for the treaters they never dreamed of expressing the least concern to pickle or the physician for what had happened because it was an accident so common as to pass without notice leaving the care of their vessel to the seamen the company retired to their respective lodgings in order to shift their clothes and in the evening our travellers were conducted to the house of their new friend who with a view of making his invitation the more agreeable had assembled to the number of twenty or thirty englishmen of all ranks and degrees from the merchant to the periwigmakers prentice in the midst of this congregation stood a chafingdish with live coals for the convenience of lighting their pipes and every individual was accommodated with a spittingbox there was not a mouth in the apartment unfurnished with a tube so that they resembled a congregation of chimeras breathing fire and smoke and our gentlemen were fain to imitate their example in their own defence it is not to be supposed that the conversation was either very sprightly or polite that the whole entertainment was of the dutch cast frowzy and phlegmatic and our adventurer as he returned to his lodging tortured with the headache and disgusted with every circumstance of his treatment cursed the hour in which the doctor had saddled them with such troublesome companions next morning by eight oclock these polite hollanders returned the visit and after breakfast attended their english friends to the house of a person that possessed a very curious cabinet of curiosities to which they had secured our companys admission the owner of this collection was a cheesemonger who received them in a woollen nightcap with straps buttoned under his chin as he understood no language but his own he told them by the canal of one of their conductors that he did not make a practice of showing his curiosities but understanding that they were englishmen and recommended to his friends he was content to submit them to their perusal so saying he led them up a dark stair into a small room decorated with a few paltry figures in plaster of paris two or three miserable landscapes the skins of an otter seal and some fishes stuffed and in one corner stood a glass case furnished with newts frogs lizards and serpents preserved in spirits a human foetus a calf with two heads and about two dozen of butterflies pinned upon paper the virtuoso having exhibited these particulars eyed the strangers with a look soliciting admiration and applause and as he could not perceive any symptom of either in their gestures or countenances withdrew a curtain and displayed a wainscot chest of drawers in which he gave them to understand was something that would agreeably amuse the imagination our travellers regaled with this notice imagined that they would be entertained with the sight of some curious medals or other productions of antiquity but how were they disappointed when they saw nothing but a variety of shells disposed in whimsical figures in each drawer after he had detained them full two hours with a tedious commentary upon the shape size and colour of each department he with a supercilious simper desired that the english gentlemen would frankly and candidly declare whether his cabinet or that of mynheer sloane at london was the most valuable when this request was signified in english to the company the painter instantly exclaimed by the lard they are not to be named of a day and as for that matter i would not give one corner of salteros coffeehouse at chelsea for all the trash he hath shown peregrine unwilling to mortify any person who had done his endeavour to please him observed that what he had seen was very curious and entertaining but that no private collection in europe was equal to that of sir hans sloane which exclusive of presents had cost an hundred thousand pounds the two conductors were confounded at this asseveration which being communicated to the cheesemonger he shook his head with a significant grin and though he did not choose to express his incredulity in words gave our hero to understand that he did not much depend upon his veracity from the house of this dutch naturalist they were draggled all round the city by the painful civility of their attendants who did not quit them till the evening was well advanced and then not till after they had promised to be with them before ten oclock next day in order to conduct them to a country house situated in a pleasant village on the other side of the river pickle was already so much fatigued with their hospitality that for the first time of his life he suffered a dejection of spirits and resolved at any rate to avoid the threatened persecution of tomorrow with this view he ordered his servants to pack up some clothes and linen in a portmanteau and in the morning embarked with his governor in the treckskuyt for the hague whither he pretended to be called by some urgent occasion leaving his fellowtravellers to make his apology to their friends and assuring them that he would not proceed for amsterdam without their society he arrived at the hague in the forenoon and dined at an ordinary frequented by officers and people of fashion where being informed that the princess would see company in the evening he dressed himself in a rich suit of the parisian cut and went to court without any introduction a person of his appearance could not fail to attract the notice of such a small circle the prince himself understanding he was an englishman and a stranger went up to him without ceremony and having welcomed him to the place conversed with him for some minutes on the common topics of discourse chapter lxv they proceed to the hague from whence they depart for amsterdam where they see a dutch tragedy visit the musichouse in which peregrine quarrels with the captain of a manofwar they pass through haerlem in their way to leyden return to rotterdam where the company separates and our hero with his attendants arrive in safety at harwich being joined by their fellowtravellers in the morning they made a tour to all the remarkable places in this celebrated village saw the foundry the stadthouse the spinhuys vauxhall and count bentincks gardens and in the evening went to the french comedy which was directed by a noted harlequin who had found means to flatter the dutch taste so effectually that they extolled him as the greatest actor that ever appeared in the province of holland this famous company did not represent regular theatrical pieces but only a sort of impromptus in which this noted player always performed the greatest part of the entertainment among other sallies of wit that escaped him there was one circumstance so remarkably adapted to the disposition and genius of his audience that it were a pity to pass it over in silence a windmill being exhibited on the scene harlequin after having surveyed it with curiosity and admiration asks one of the millers the use of that machine and being told that it was a windmill observes with some concern that as there was not the least breath of wind he could not have the pleasure of seeing it turn round urged by this consideration he puts himself into the attitude of a person wrapt in profound meditation and having continued a few seconds in this posture runs to the miller with great eagerness and joy and telling him that he had found an expedient to make his mill work very fairly unbuttons his breeches then presenting his posteriors to the sails of the machine certain explosions are immediately heard and the arms of the mill begin to turn round to the infinite satisfaction of the spectators who approve the joke with loud peals of applause our travellers stayed a few days at the hague during which the young gentleman waited on the british ambassador to whom he was recommended by his excellency at paris and lost about thirty guineas at billiards to a french adventurer who decoyed him into the snare by keeping up his game then they departed in a postwaggon for amsterdam being provided with letters of introduction to an english merchant residing in that city under whose auspices they visited everything worth seeing and among other excursions went to see a dutch tragedy acted an entertainment which of all others had the strangest effect upon the organs of our hero the dress of their chief personages was so antic their manner so awkwardly absurd and their language so ridiculously unfit for conveying the sentiment of love and honour that peregrines nerves were diuretically affected with the complicated absurdity and he was compelled to withdraw twenty times before the catastrophe of the piece the subject of this performance was the famous story of scipios continence and virtue in restoring the fair captive to her lover the young roman hero was represented by a broadfaced batavian in a burgomasters gown and a fur cap sitting smoking his pipe at a table furnished with a can of beer a drinking glass and a plate of tobacco the lady was such a person as scipio might well be supposed to give away without any great effort of generosity and indeed the celtiberian prince seemed to be of that opinion for upon receiving her from the hand of the victor he discovered none of those transports of gratitude and joy which livy describes in recounting this event the dutch scipio however was complaisant enough in his way for he desired her to sit at his right hand by the appellation of ya frow and with his own fingers filling a clean pipe presented it to mynheer allucio the lover the rest of the economy of the piece was in the same taste which was so agreeable to the audience that they seemed to have shaken off their natural phlegm in order to applaud the performance from the play our company adjourned to the house of their friend where they spent the evening and the conversation turning upon poetry a dutchman who was present and understood the english language having listened very attentively to the discourse lifted up with both hands the greatest part of a cheshire cheese that lay upon the table saying i do know vat is boetre mine brotre be a great boet and ave vrought a book as dick as all dat pickle diverted with this method of estimating an author according to the quantity of his works inquired about the subjects of this bards writings but of these his brother could give no account or other information but that there was little market for the commodity which hung heavy upon his hands and induced him to wish he had applied himself to another trade the only remarkable scene in amsterdam which our company bad not seen was the spuyl or musichouses which by the connivance of the magistrates are maintained for the recreation of those who might attempt the chastity of creditable women if they were not provided with such conveniences to one of these nighthouses did our travellers repair under the conduct of the english merchant and were introduced into such another place as the evermemorable coffeehouse of moll king with this difference that the company here were not so riotous as the bucks of covent garden but formed themselves into a circle within which some of the number danced to the music of a scurvy organ and a few other instruments that uttered tunes very suitable to the disposition of the hearers while the whole apartment was shrouded with clouds of smoke impervious to the view when our gentlemen entered the floor was occupied by two females and their gallants who in the performance of their exercise lifted their legs like so many oxen at plough and the pipe of one of those hoppers happening to be exhausted in the midst of his saraband he very deliberately drew forth his tobaccobox filling and lighting it again without any interruption to the dance peregrine being unchecked by the presence of his governor who was too tender of his own reputation to attend them in this expedition made up to a sprightly french girl who sat in seeming expectation of a customer and prevailing upon her to be his partner led her into the circle and in his turn took the opportunity of dancing a minuet to the admiration of all present he intended to have exhibited another specimen of his ability in this art when a captain of a dutch manofwar chancing to come in and seeing a stranger engaged with the lady whom it seems he had bespoke for his bedfellow he advanced without any ceremony and seizing her by the arm pulled her to the other side of the room our adventurer who was not a man to put up with such a brutal affront followed the ravisher with indignation in his eyes and pushing him on one side retook the subject of their contest and led her back to the place from whence she had been dragged the dutchman enraged at the youths presumption obeyed the first dictates of his choler and lent his rival a hearty box on the ear which was immediately repaid with interest before our hero could recollect himself sufficiently to lay his hand upon his sword and beckon the aggressor to the door notwithstanding the confusion and disorder which this affair produced in the room and the endeavours of pickles company who interposed in order to prevent bloodshed the antagonists reached the street and peregrine drawing was surprised to see the captain advance against him with a long knife which he preferred to the sword that hung by his side the youth confounded at this preposterous behaviour desired him in the french tongue to lay aside that vulgar implement and approach like a gentleman but the hollander who neither understood the proposal nor would have complied with this demand had he been made acquainted with his meaning rushed forward like a desperado before his adversary could put himself on his guard and if the young gentleman had not been endued with surprising agility his nose would have fallen a sacrifice to the fury of the assailant finding himself in such imminent jeopardy he leaped to one side and the dutchman passing him in the force of his career he with one nimble kick made such application to his enemys heels that he flew like lightning into the canal where he had almost perished by pitching upon one of the posts with which it is faced peregrine having performed this exploit did not stay for the captains coming on shore but retreated with all despatch by the advice of his conductor and next day embarked with his companions in the skuyt for haerlem where they dined and in the evening arrived at the ancient city of leyden where they met with some english students who treated them with great hospitality not but that the harmony of the conversation was that same night interrupted by a dispute that arose between one of those young gentlemen and the physician about the cold and hot methods of prescription in the gout and rheumatism and proceeded to such a degree of mutual reviling that pickle ashamed and incensed at his fellowtravellers want of urbanity espoused the others cause and openly rebuked him for his unmannerly petulance which he said rendered him unfit for the purposes and unworthy of the benefit of society this unexpected declaration overwhelmed the doctor with amazement and confusion he was instantaneously deprived of his speech and during the remaining part of the party sat in silent mortification in all probability he deliberated with himself whether or not he should expostulate with the young gentleman on the freedom he had taken with his character in a company of strangers but as he knew he had not a pallet to deal with he very prudently suppressed that suggestion and in secret chewed the cud of resentment after they had visited the physicgarden the university the anatomical hall and every other thing that was recommended to their view they returned to rotterdam and held a consultation upon the method of transporting themselves to england the doctor whose grudge against peregrine was rather inflamed than allayed by our heros indifference and neglect had tampered with the simplicity of the painter who was proud of his advances towards a perfect reconciliation and now took the opportunity of parting with our adventurer by declaring that he and his friend mr pallet were resolved to take their passage in a trading sloop after he had heard peregrine object against that tedious disagreeable and uncertain method of conveyance pickle immediately saw his intention and without using the least argument to dissuade them from their design or expressing the smallest degree of concern at their separation very coolly wished them a prosperous voyage and ordered his baggage to be sent to helvoetsluys there he himself and his retinue went on board of the packet next day and by the favour of a fair wind in eighteen hours arrived at harwich chapter lxvi peregrine delivers his letters of recommendation at london and returns to the garrison to the unspeakable joy of the commodore and his whole family now that our hero found himself on english ground his heart dilated with the proud recollection of his own improvement since he left his native soil he began to recognise the interesting ideas of his tender years he enjoyed by anticipation the pleasure of seeing his friends in the garrison after an absence of eighteen months and the image of his charming emily which other less worthy considerations had depressed resumed the full possession of his breast he remembered with shame that he had neglected the correspondence with her brother which he himself had solicited and in consequence of which he had received a letter from that young gentleman while he lived at paris in spite of these conscientious reflections he was too selfsufficient to think he should find any difficulty in obtaining forgiveness for such sins of omission and began to imagine that his passion would be prejudicial to the dignity of his situation if it should not be gratified upon terms which formerly his imagination durst not conceive sorry i am that the task i have undertaken lays me under the necessity of divulging this degeneracy in the sentiment of our imperious youth who was now in the heyday of his blood flushed with the consciousness of his own qualifications vain of his fortune and elated on the wings of imaginary expectation though he was deeply enamoured of miss gauntlet he was far from proposing her heart as the ultimate aim of his gallantry which he did not doubt would triumph over the most illustrious females of the land and at once regale his appetite and ambition meanwhile being willing to make his appearance at the garrison equally surprising and agreeable he cautioned mr jolter against writing to the commodore who had not heard of them since their departure from paris and hired a postchaise and horses for london the governor going out to give orders about the carriage inadvertently left a paper book open upon the table and his pupil casting his eyes upon the page chanced to read these words sept arrived in safety by the blessing of god in this unhappy kingdom of england and thus concludes the journal of my last peregrination peregrines curiosity being inflamed by this extraordinary conclusion he turned to the beginning and perused several sheets of a diary such as is commonly kept by that class of people known by the denomination of travelling governors for the satisfaction of themselves and the parents or guardians of their pupils and for the edification and entertainment of their friends that the reader may have a clear idea of mr jolters performance we shall transcribe the transactions of one day as he had recorded them and that abstract will be a sufficient specimen of the whole plan and execution of the work may at eight oclock set out from boulogne in a postchaise the morning hazy and cold fortified my stomach with a cordial recommended ditto to mr p as an antidote against the fog mem he refused it the hither horse greased in the offpastern of the hind leg arrived at samers mem this last was a post

mistake discharge the bill which is not very reasonable dispute with mr p about giving money to the servant he insists upon my giving a twentyfour sols piece which is too much by twothirds in all conscience nb she was a pert baggage and did not deserve a liard our hero was so much disobliged with certain circumstances of this amusing and instructing journal that by way of punishing the author he interlined these words betwixt two paragraphs in a manner that exactly resembled the tutors handwriting mem had the pleasure of drinking myself into a sweet intoxication by toasting our lawful king and his royal family among some worthy english fathers of the society of jesus having taken this revenge he set out for london where he waited upon those noblemen to whom he had letters of recommendation from paris and was not only graciously received but even loaded with caresses and proffers of service because they understood he was a young gentleman of fortune who far from standing in need of their countenance or assistance would make a useful and creditable addition to the number of their adherents he had the honour of dining at their tables in consequence of pressing invitations and of spending several evenings with the ladies to whom he was particularly agreeable on account of his person address and bleeding freely at play being thus initiated in the beau monde he thought it was high time to pay his respects to his generous benefactor the commodore and accordingly departed one morning with his train for the garrison at which he arrived in safety the same night when he entered the gate which was opened by a new servant that did not know him he found his old friend hatchway stalking in the yard with a nightcap on his head and a pipe in his mouth and advancing to him took him by the hand before he had any intimation of his approach the lieutenant thus saluted by a stranger stared at him in silent astonishment till he recollected his features which were no sooner known than dashing his pipe upon the pavement he exclaimed smite my crosstrees thart welcome to port and hugged him in his arms with great affection he then by a cordial squeeze expressed his satisfaction at seeing his old shipmate tom who applying his whistle to his mouth the whole castle echoed with his performance the servants hearing the wellknown sound poured out in a tumult of joy and understanding that their young master was returned raised such a peal of acclamation as astonished the commodore and his lady and inspired julia with such an interesting presage that her heart began to throb with violence running out in the hurry and perturbation of her hope she was so much overwhelmed at sight of her brother that she actually fainted in his arms but from this trance she soon awaked and peregrine having testified his pleasure and affection went upstairs and presented himself before his godfather and aunt mrs trunnion rose and received him with a gracious embrace blessing god for his happy return from a land of impiety and vice in which she hoped his morals had not been corrupted nor his principles of religion altered or impaired the old gentleman being confined to his chair was struck dumb with pleasure at his appearance and having made divers ineffectual efforts to get up at length discharged a volley of curses against his own limbs and held out his hand to his godson who kissed it with great respect after he had finished his apostrophe to the gout which was the daily and hourly subject of his execrations well my lad said he i care not how soon i go to the bottom now i behold thee safe in harbour again and yet i tell a d d lie i would i could keep afloat until i should see a lusty boy of thy begetting odds my timbers i love thee so well that i believe thou art the spawn of my own body though i can give no account of thy being put upon the stocks then turning his eyes upon pipes who by this time had penetrated into his apartment and addressed him with the usual salutation of what cheer ahey cried he are you there you herringfaced son of a seacalf what a slippery trick you played your old commander but come you dog theres my fist i forgive you for the love you bear to my godson go man your tackle and hoist a cask of strong beer into the yard knock out the bung and put a pump in it for the use of all my servants and neighbours and dye hear let the patereroes be fired and the garrison illuminated as rejoicings for the safe arrival of your master by the lord if i had the use of these d d shambling shanks i would dance a hornpipe with the best of you the next object of his attention was mr jolter who was honoured with particular marks of distinction and the repeated promise of enjoying the living in his gift as an acknowledgment of the care and discretion with which he had superintended the education and morals of our hero the governor was so affected by the generosity of his patron that the tears ran down his cheeks while he expressed his gratitude and the infinite satisfaction he felt in contemplating the accomplishments of his pupil meanwhile pipes did not neglect the orders he had received the beer was produced the gates were thrown open for the admission of all comers the whole house was lighted up and the patereroes were discharged in repeated volleys such phenomena could not fail to attract the notice of the neighbourhood the club at tunleys were astonished at the report of the guns which produced various conjectures among the members of that sagacious society the landlord observed that in all likelihood the commodore was visited by hobgoblins and ordered the guns to be fired in token of distress as he had acted twenty years before when he was annoyed by the same grievance the exciseman with a waggish sneer expressed his apprehension of trunnions death in consequence of which the patereroes might be discharged with an equivocal intent either as signals of his ladys sorrow or rejoicing the attorney signified a suspicion of hatchways being married to miss pickle and that the firing and illuminations were in honour of the nuptials upon which gamaliel discovered some faint signs of emotion and taking the pipe from his mouth gave it as his opinion that his sister was brought to bed while they were thus bewildered in the maze of their own imaginations a company of countrymen who sat drinking in the kitchen and whose legs were more ready than their invention sallied out to know the meaning of these exhibitions understanding that there was a butt of strong beer abroach in the yard to which they were invited by the servants they saved themselves the trouble and expense of returning to spend the evening at the publichouse and listed themselves under the banner of tom pipes who presided as director of this festival the news of peregrines return being communicated to the parish the parson and three or four neighbouring gentlemen who were wellwishers to our hero immediately repaired to the garrison in order to pay their compliments on this happy event and were detained to supper an elegant entertainment was prepared by the direction of miss julia who was an excellent housewife and the commodore was so invigorated with joy that he seemed to have renewed his age among those who honoured the occasion with their presence was mr clover the young gentleman that made his addresses to peregrines sister his heart was so big with his passion that while the rest of the company were engrossed by their cups he seized an opportunity of our heros being detached from the conversation and in the impatience of his love conjured him to consent to his happiness protesting that he would comply with any terms of settlement that a man of his fortune could embrace in favour of a young lady who was absolute mistress of his affection our youth thanked him very politely for his favourable sentiments and honourable intention towards his sister and told him that at present he saw no reason to obstruct his desire that he would consult julias own inclinations and confer with him about the means of gratifying his wish but in the meantime begged to be excused from discussing any point of such importance to them both reminding him of the jovial purpose on which they were happily met he promoted such a quick circulation of the bottle that their mirth grew noisy and obstreperous they broke forth into repeated peals of laughter without any previous incitement except that of claret these explosions were succeeded by bacchanalian songs in which the old gentleman himself attempted to bear a share the sedate governor snapped time with his fingers and the parish priest assisted in the chorus with a most expressive nakedness of countenance before midnight they were almost all pinned to their chairs as if they had been fixed by the power of enchantment and what rendered the confinement still more unfortunate every servant in the house was in the same situation so that they were fain to take their repose as they sat and nodded at each other like a congregation of anabaptists next day peregrine communed with his sister on the subject of her match with mr clover who she told him had offered to settle a jointure of four hundred pounds and take her to wife without any expectation of a dowry she moreover gave him to understand that in his absence she had received several messages from her mother commanding her to return to her fathers house but that she had refused to obey these orders by the advice and injunction of her aunt and the commodore which were indeed seconded by her own inclination because she had all the reason in the world to believe that her mother only wanted an opportunity of treating her with severity and rancour the resentment of that lady had been carried to such indecent lengths that seeing her daughter at church one day she rose up before the parson entered and reviled her with great bitterness in the face of the whole congregation chapter lxvii sees his sister happily married visits emilia who receives him according to his deserts her brother being of opinion that mr clovers proposal was not to be neglected especially as julias heart was engaged in his favour communicated the affair to his uncle who with the approbation of mrs trunnion declared himself well satisfied with the young mans addresses and desired that they might be buckled with all expedition without the knowledge or concurrence of her parents to whom on account of their unnatural barbarity she was not bound to pay the least regard though our adventurer entertained the same sentiments of the matter and the lover dreading some obstruction earnestly begged the immediate condescension of his mistress she could not be prevailed upon to take such a material step without having first solicited the permission of her father resolved nevertheless to comply with the dictates of her own heart should his objections be frivolous or unjust urged by this determination her admirer waited upon mr gamaliel at the publichouse and with the appearance of great deference and respect made him acquainted with his affection for his daughter communicated the particulars of his fortune with the terms of settlement he was ready to make and in conclusion told him that he would marry her without a portion this last offer seemed to have some weight with the father who received it with civility and promised in a day or two to favour him with a final answer to his demand he accordingly that same evening consulted his wife who being exasperated at the prospect of her daughters independency argued with the most virulent expostulation against the match as an impudent scheme of her own planning with a view of insulting her parents towards whom she had already been guilty of the most vicious disobedience in short she used such remonstrances as not only averted this weak husbands inclination from the proposal which he had relished before but even instigated him to apply for a warrant to apprehend his daughter on the supposition that she was about to bestow herself in marriage without his privity or consent the justice of peace to whom this application was made though he could not refuse the order yet being no stranger to the malevolence of the mother which together with gamaliels simplicity was notorious in the county he sent an intimation of what had happened to the garrison upon which a couple of sentinels were placed on the gate and at the pressing solicitation of the lover as well as the desire of the commodore her brother and aunt julia was wedded without further delay the ceremony being performed by mr jolter because the parish priest prudently declined any occasion of giving offence and the curate was too much in the interest of their enemies to be employed in that office this domestic concern being settled to the satisfaction of our hero he escorted her next day to the house of her husband who immediately wrote a letter to her father declaring his reasons for having thus superseded his authority and mrs pickles mortification was unspeakable that the newmarried couple might be guarded against all insult our young gentleman and his friend hatchway with their adherents lodged in mr clovers house for some weeks during which they visited their acquaintance in the neighbourhood according to custom when the tranquility of their family was perfectly established and the contract of the marriage executed in the presence of the old commodore and his lady who gave her niece five hundred pounds to purchase jewels and clothes mr peregrine could no longer restrain his impatience to see his dear emily and told his uncle that next day he proposed to ride across the country in order to visit his friend gauntlet whom he had not heard of for a long time the old gentleman looking steadfastly in his face ah d n your cunning said he i find the anchor holds fast i did suppose as how you would have slipt your cable and changed your berth but i see when a young fellow is once brought up by a pretty wench he may man his capstans and viol block if he wool but hell as soon heave up the pike of teneriffe as bring his anchor aweigh odds heartlikins had i known the young woman was ned gauntlets daughter i shouldnt have thrown out signal for leaving off chase our adventurer was not a little surprised to hear the commodore talk in this style and immediately conjectured that his friend godfrey had informed him of the whole affair instead of listening to this approbation of his flame with those transports of joy which he would have felt had he retained his former sentiments he was chagrined at trunnions declaration and offended at the presumption of the young soldier in presuming to disclose the secret with which he had entrusted him reddening with these reflections he assured the commodore that he never had serious thoughts of matrimony so that if any person had told him he was under any engagement of that kind he had abused his ear for he protested that he would never contract such attachments without his knowledge and express permission trunnion commended him for his prudent resolution and observed that though no person mentioned to him what promises had passed betwixt him and his sweetheart it was very plain that he had made love to her and therefore it was to be supposed that his intentions were honourable for he could not believe he was such a rogue in his heart as to endeavour to debauch the daughter of a brave officer who had served his country with credit and reputation notwithstanding this remonstrance which pickle imputed to the commodores ignorance of the world he set out for the habitation of mrs gauntlet with the unjustifiable sentiments of a man of pleasure who sacrifices every consideration to the desire of his ruling appetite and as winchester lay in his way resolved to visit some of his friends who lived in that place it was in the house of one of these that he was informed of emilias being then in town with her mother upon which he excused himself from staying to drink tea and immediately repaired to their lodgings according to the directions he had received when he arrived at the door instead of undergoing that perturbation of spirits which a lover in his interesting situation might be supposed to feel he suffered no emotion but that of vanity and pride favoured with an opportunity of selfgratification and entered his emilias apartment with the air of a conceited petitmaitre rather than that of the respectful admirer when he visits the object of his passion after an absence of seventeen months the young lady having been very much disobliged at his mortifying neglect of her brothers letter had summoned all her own pride and resolution to her aid and by means of a happy disposition so far overcame her chagrin at his indifference that she was able to behave in his presence with apparent tranquility and ease she was even pleased to find he had by accident chosen a time for his visit when she was surrounded by two or three young gentlemen who professed themselves her admirers our gallant was no sooner announced than she collected all her coquetry put on the gayest air she could assume and contrived to giggle just as he appeared at the room door the compliments of salutation being performed she welcomed him to england in a careless manner asked the news of paris and before he could make any reply desired one of the other gentlemen to proceed with the sequel of that comical adventure in the relation of which he had been interrupted peregrine smiled within himself at this behaviour which without all doubt he believed she had affected to punish him for his unkind silence while he was abroad being fully persuaded that her heart was absolutely at his devotion on this supposition he practised his parisian improvements on the art of conversation and uttered a thousand prettinesses in the way of compliment with such incredible rotation of tongue that his rivals were struck dumb with astonishment and emilia fretted out of all temper at seeing herself deprived of the prerogative of the sex he persisted however in this surprising loquacity until the rest of the company thought proper to withdraw and then contracted his discourse into the focus of love which now put on a very different appearance from that which it had formerly worn instead of awful veneration which her presence used to inspire that chastity of sentiment and delicacy of expression he now gazed upon her with the eyes of a libertine he glowed with the impatience of desire talked in a strain that barely kept within the bounds of decency and attempted to snatch such favours as she in the tenderness of mutual acknowledgments had once vouchsafed to bestow grieved and offended as she was at this palpable alteration in his carriage she disdained to remind him of his former deportment and with dissembled goodhumour rallied him on the progress he had made in gallantry and address but far from submitting to the liberties he would have taken she kept her person sacred from his touch and would not even suffer him to ravish a kiss of her fair hand so that he reaped no other advantage from the exercise of his talents during this interview which lasted a whole hour than that of knowing he had overrated his own importance and that emilys heart was not a garrison likely to surrender at discretion at length his addresses were interrupted by the arrival of the mother who had gone abroad to visit by herself and the conversation becoming more general he understood that godfrey was at london soliciting for a lieutenancy that had fallen vacant in the regiment to which he belonged and that miss sophy was at home with her father though our adventurer had not met with all the success he expected by his first visit he did not despair of reducing the fortress believing that in time there would be a mutiny in his favour and accordingly carried on the siege for several days without profiting by his perseverance till at length having attended the ladies to their own house in the country he began to look upon this adventure as time misspent and resolved to discontinue his attack in hopes of meeting with a more favourable occasion being in the meantime ambitious of displaying in a higher sphere those qualifications which his vanity told him were at present misapplied chapter lxviii he attends his uncle with great affection during a fit of illness sets out again for london meets with his friend godfrey who is prevailed upon to accompany him to bath on the road to which place they chance to dine with a person who entertains them with a curious account of a certain company of adventurers thus determined he took leave of emilia and her mother on pretence of going to london upon some urgent business and returned to the garrison leaving the good old lady very much concerned and the daughter incensed at his behaviour which was the more unexpected because godfrey had told them that the commodore approved of his nephews passion our adventurer found his uncle so ill of the gout which for the first time had taken possession of his stomach that his life was in imminent danger and the whole family in disorder he therefore took the reins of government in his own hands sent for all the physicians in the neighbourhood and attended him in person with the most affectionate care during the whole fit which lasted a fortnight and then retired before the strength of his constitution when the old gentleman recovered his health he was so penetrated with peregrines behaviour that he actually would have made over to him his whole fortune and depended upon him for his own subsistence had not our youth opposed the execution of the deed with all his influence and might and even persuaded him to make a will in which his friend hatchway and all his other adherents were liberally remembered and his aunt provided for on her own terms this material point being settled he with his uncles permission departed for london after having seen the family affairs established under the direction and administration of mr jolter and the lieutenant for by this time mrs trunnion was wholly occupied with her spiritual concern on his first arrival at london he sent a card to the lodgings of gauntlet in consequence of a direction from his mother and that young gentleman waited on him next morning though not with that alacrity of countenance and warmth of friendship which might have been expected from the intimacy of their former connection nor was peregrine himself actuated by the same unreserved affection for the soldier which he had formerly entertained godfrey over and above the offence he had taken at pickles omission in point of corresponding with him had been informed by a letter from his mother of the youths cavalier behaviour to emilia during his last residence at winchester and our young gentleman as we have already observed was disgusted at the supposed discovery which the soldier had made in his absence to the commodore they perceived their mutual umbrage at meeting and received each other with that civility of reserve which commonly happens between two persons whose friendship is in the wane gauntlet at once divined the cause of the others displeasure and in order to vindicate his own character after the first compliments were passed took the opportunity on inquiring after the health of the commodore to tell peregrine that while he tarried at the garrison on his return from dover the subject of the conversation one night happening to turn on our heros passion the old gentleman had expressed his concern about that affair and among other observations said he supposed the object of his love was some paltry hussy whom he had picked up when he was a boy at school upon which mr hatchway assured him that she was a young woman of as good a family as any in the county and after having prepossessed him in her favour ventured out of the zeal of his friendship to tell who she was wherefore the discovery was not to be imputed to any other cause and he hoped mr pickle would acquit him of ail share in the transaction peregrine was very well pleased to be thus undeceived his countenance immediately cleared up the formality of his behaviour relaxed into his usual familiarity he asked pardon for his unmannerly neglect of godfreys letter which he protested was not owing to any disregard or abatement of friendship but to a hurry of youthful engagements in consequence of which he bad procrastinated his answer from time to time until he was ready to return in person the young soldier was contented with this apology and as pickles intention with respect to his sister was still dubious and undeclared he did not think it was incumbent upon him as yet to express any resentment on that score but was wise enough to foresee that the renewal of his intimacy with our young gentleman might be the means of reviving that flame which had been dissipated by a variety of new ideas with those sentiments he laid aside all reserve and their communication resumed its former channel peregrine made him acquainted with all the adventures in which he had been engaged since their parting and he with the same confidence related the remarkable incidents of his own fate among other things giving him to understand that upon obtaining a commission in the army the father of his dear sophy without once inquiring about the occasion of his promotion had not only favoured him with his countenance in a much greater degree than heretofore but also contributed his interest and even promised the assistance of his purse in procuring for him a lieutenancy which he was then soliciting with all his power whereas if he had not been enabled by a most accidental piece of good fortune to lift himself into the sphere of an officer he had all the reason in the world to believe that this gentleman and all the rest of his wealthy relations would have suffered him to languish in obscurity and distress and by turning his misfortune into reproach made it a plea for their want of generosity and friendship peregrine understanding the situation of his friends affairs would have accommodated him upon the instant with a sum to accelerate the passage of his commission through the offices but being too well acquainted with his scrupulous disposition to manifest his benevolence in that manner he found means to introduce himself to one of the gentlemen of the war office who was so well satisfied with the arguments used in behalf of his friend that godfreys business was transacted in a very few days though he himself knew nothing of his interest being thus reinforced by this time the season at bath was begun and our hero panting with the desire of distinguishing himself at that resort of the fashionable world communicated his design of going thither to his friend godfrey whom he importuned to accompany him in the excursion and leave of absence from his regiment being obtained by the influence of peregrines new quality friends the two companions departed from london in a postchaise attended as usual by the valetdechambre and pipes who were become almost as necessary to our adventurer as any two of his own organs at the inn when they alighted for dinner godfrey perceived a person walking by himself in the yard with a very pensive air and upon observing him more narrowly recognised him to be a professed gamester whom he had formerly known at tunbridge on the strength of this acquaintance he accosted the peripatetic who knew him immediately and in the fulness of his grief and vexation told him that he was now on his return from bath where he had been stripped by a company of sharpers who resented that he should presume to trade upon his own bottom peregrine who was extremely curious in his inquiries imagining that he might learn some entertaining and useful anecdotes from this artist invited him to dinner and was accordingly fully informed of all the political systems at bath he understood that there was at london one great company of adventurers who employed agents in all the different branches of imposition throughout the whole kingdom of england allowing these ministers a certain proportion of the profits accruing from their industry and skill and reserving the greatest share for the benefit of the common stock which was chargeable with the expense of fitting out individuals in their various pursuits as well as with the loss sustained in the course of their adventures some whose persons and qualifications are by the company judged adequate to the task exert their talents in making love to ladies of fortune being accommodated with money and accoutrements for that purpose after having given their bonds payable to one or other of the directors on the day of marriage for certain sums proportioned to the dowries they are to receive others versed in the doctrine of chances and certain secret expediences frequent all those places where games of hazard are allowed and such as are masters in the arts of billiards tennis and bowls are continually lying in wait in all the scenes of these diversions for the ignorant and unwary a fourth class attend horseraces being skilled in those mysterious practices by which the knowing ones are taken in nor is this community unfurnished with those who lay wanton wives and old rich widows under contribution and extort money by prostituting themselves to the embraces of their own sex and then threatening their admirers with prosecution but their most important returns are made by that body of their undertakers who exercise their understandings in the innumerable stratagems of the card table at which no sharper can be too infamous to be received and even caressed by persons of the highest rank and distinction among other articles of intelligence our young gentleman learned that those agents by whom their guest was broke and expelled from bath had constituted a bank against all sporters and monopolized the advantage in all sorts of play he then told gauntlet that if he would put himself under his direction he would return with them and lay such a scheme as would infallibly ruin the whole society at billiards as he knew that godfrey excelled them all in his knowledge of that game the soldier excused himself from engaging in any party of that kind and after dinner the travellers parted but as the conversation between the two friends turned upon the information they had received peregrine projected a plan for punishing those villainous pests of society who prey upon their fellowcreatures and it was put in execution by gauntlet in the following manner chapter lxix godfrey executes a scheme at bath by which a whole company of sharpers is ruined on the evening after their arrival at bath godfrey who had kept himself up all day for that purpose went in boots to the billiard table and two gentlemen being at play began to bet with so little appearance of judgment that one of the adventurers then present was inflamed with a desire of profiting by his inexperience and when the table was vacant invited him to take a game for amusement the soldier assuming the air of a selfconceited dupe answered that he did not choose to throw away his time for nothing but if he pleased would piddle for a crown a game this declaration was very agreeable to the other who wanted to be further confirmed in the opinion he had conceived of the stranger before he would play for anything of consequence the party being accepted gauntlet put off his coat and beginning with seeming eagerness won the first game because his antagonist kept up his play with a view of encouraging him to wager a greater sum the soldier purposely bit at the hook the stakes were doubled and he was again victorious by the permission of his competitor he now began to yawn and observing that it was not worth his while to proceed in such a childish manner the other swore in an affected passion that he would play him for twenty guineas the proposal being embraced through the connivance of godfrey the money was won by the sharper who exerted his dexterity to the utmost fearing that otherwise his adversary would decline continuing the game godfrey thus conquered pretended to lose his temper cursed his own illluck swore that the table had a cast and that the balls did not run true changed his mast and with great warmth challenged his enemy to double the sum the gamester who feigned reluctance complied with his desire and having got the two first hazards offered to lay one hundred guineas to fifty on the game the odds were taken and godfrey having allowed himself to be overcome began to rage with great violence broke the mast to pieces threw the balls out of the window and in the fury of his indignation defied his antagonist to meet him tomorrow when he should be refreshed from the fatigue of travelling this was a very welcome invitation to the gamester who imagining that the soldier would turn out a most beneficial prize assured him that he would not fail to be there next forenoon in order to give him his revenge gauntlet went home to his lodgings fully certified of his own superiority and took his measures with peregrine touching the prosecution of their scheme while his opponent made a report of his success to the brethren of the gang who resolved to be present at the decision of the match with a view of taking advantage of the strangers passionate disposition affairs being thus concerted on both sides the players met according to appointment and the room was immediately filled with spectators who either came thither by accident curiosity or design the match was fixed for one hundred pounds a game the principals chose their instruments and laid aside their coats and one of the knights of the order proffered to lay another hundred on the head of his associate godfrey took him upon the instant a second worthy of the same class seeing him so eager challenged him to treble the sum and his proposal met with the same reception to the astonishment of the company whose expectation was raised to a very interesting pitch the game was begun and the soldier having lost the first hazard the odds were offered by the confederacy with great vociferation but nobody would run such a risk in favour of a person who was utterly unknown the sharper having gained the second also the noise increased to a surprising clamour not only of the gang but likewise of almost all the spectators who desired to lay two to one against the brother of emilia peregrine who was present perceiving the cupidity of the association sufficiently inflamed all of a sudden opened his mouth and answered their bets to the amount of twelve hundred pounds which were immediately deposited on both sides in money and notes so that this was perhaps the most important game that ever was played at billiards gauntlet seeing the agreement settled struck his antagonists ball into the pocket in a twinkling though it was in one of those situations which are supposed to be against the striker the betters were a little discomposed at this event for which however they consoled themselves by imputing the success to accident but when at the very next stroke he sprung it over the table their countenances underwent an instantaneous distraction of feature and they waited in the most dreadful suspense for the next hazard which being likewise taken with infinite ease by the soldier the blood forsook their cheeks and the interjection zounds pronounced with a look of consternation and in a tone of despair proceeded from every mouth at the same instant of time they were overwhelmed with horror and astonishment at seeing three hazards taken in as many strokes from a person of their friends dexterity and shrewdly suspected that the whole was a scheme preconcerted for their destruction on this supposition they changed the note and attempted to hedge for their own indemnification by proposing to lay the odds in favour of gauntlet but so much was the opinion of the company altered by that young gentlemans success that no one would venture to espouse the cause of his competitor who chancing to improve his game by the addition of another lucky hit diminished the concern and revived the hopes of his adherents but this gleam of fortune did not long continue godfrey collected his whole art and capacity and augmenting his score to number ten indulged himself with a view of the whole fraternity the visages of these professors had adopted different shades of complexion at every hazard he had taken from their natural colour they had shifted into a sallow hue from thence into pale from pale into yellow which degenerated into a mahogany tint and now they saw seventeen hundred pounds of their stock depending upon a single stroke they stood like so many swarthy moors jaundiced with terror and vexation the fire which naturally glowed in the cheeks and nose of the player seemed utterly extinct and his carbuncles exhibited a livid appearance as if a gangrene had already made some progress in his face his hand began to shake and his whole frame was seized with such trepidation that he was fain to swallow a bumper of brandy in order to reestablish the tranquility of his nerves this expedient however did not produce the desired effect for he aimed the ball at the lead with such discomposure that it struck on the wrong side and came off at an angle which directed it full in the middle hole this fatal accident was attended with a universal groan as if the whole universe had gone to wreck and notwithstanding that tranquility for which adventurers are so remarkable this loss made such an impression upon them all that each in particular manifested his chagrin by the most violent emotions one turned up his eyes to heaven and bit his nether lip another gnawed his fingers while he stalked across the room a third blasphemed with horrid imprecations and he who played the party sneaked off grinding his teeth together with a look that baffles all description and as he crossed the threshold exclaiming a d d bite by g the victors after having insulted them by asking if they were disposed for another chance carried off their winning with the appearance of great composure though in their hearts they were transported with unspeakable joy not so much on account of the booty they had gained as in consideration of having so effectually destroyed such a nest of pernicious miscreants peregrine believing that now he had found an opportunity of serving his friend without giving offence to the delicacy of his honour told him upon their arrival at their lodgings that fortune had at length enabled him to become in a manner independent or at least make himself easy in his circumstances by purchasing a company with the money he had won so saying he put his share of the success in gauntlets hand as a sum that of right belonged to him and promised to write in his behalf to a nobleman who had interest enough to promote such a quick rise in the service godfrey thanked him for his obliging intention but absolutely refused with great loftiness of demeanour to appropriate to his own use any part of the money which pickle had gained and seemed affronted at the others entertaining a sentiment so unworthy of his character he would not even accept in the way of loan such an addition to his own stock as would amount to the price of a company of foot but expressed great confidence in the future exertion of that talent which had been blessed with such a prosperous beginning our hero finding him thus obstinately deaf to the voice of his own interest resolved to govern himself in his next endeavours of friendship by his experience of this ticklish punctilio and in the meantime gave a handsome benefaction to the hospital out of these first fruits of the success in play and reserved two hundred pounds for a set of diamond earrings and solitaire which he intended for a present to miss emily chapter lxx the two friends eclipse all their competitors in gallantry and practise a pleasant project of revenge upon the physicians of the place the fame of their exploit against the sharpers was immediately diffused through all the companies at bath so that when our adventurers appeared in public they were pointed out by an hundred extended fingers and considered as consummate artists in all the different species of finesse which they would not fail to practise with the first opportunity nor was this opinion of their characters any obstacle to their reception into the fashionable parties in the place but on the contrary such a recommendation which as i have already hinted never fails to operate for the advantage of the possessor this first adventure therefore served them as an introduction to the company at bath who were not a little surprised to find their expectations baffled by the conduct of the two companions because far from engaging deeply at play they rather shunned all occasions of gaming and directed their attention to gallantry in which our hero shone unrivalled his external qualifications exclusive of any other merit were strong enough to captivate the common run of the female sex and these reinforced with a sprightliness of conversation and a most insinuating address became irresistible even by those who were fortified with pride caution or indifference but among all the nymphs of this gay place he did not meet with one object that disputed the empire of his heart with emilia and therefore he divided his attachment according to the suggestions of vanity and whim so that before he had resided a fortnight at bath he had set all the ladies by the ears and furnished all the hundred tongues of scandal with full employment the splendour of his appearance excited the inquiries of envy which instead of discovering any circumstances to his prejudice was cursed with the information of his being a young gentleman of a good family and heir to an immense fortune the countenance of some of his quality friends who arrived at bath confirmed this piece of intelligence upon which his acquaintance was courted and cultivated with great assiduity and he met with such advances from some of the fair sex as rendered him extremely fortunate in his amours nor was his friend godfrey a stranger to favours of the same kind his accomplishments were exactly calculated for the meridian of female taste and with certain individuals of that sex his muscular frame and the robust connection of his limbs were more attractive than the delicate proportions of his companion he accordingly reigned paramount among those inamoratas who were turned of thirty without being under the necessity of proceeding by tedious addresses and was thought to have cooperated with the waters in removing the sterility of certain ladies who had long undergone the reproach and disgust of their husbands while peregrine set up his throne among those who laboured under the disease of celibacy from the pert miss of fifteen who with a fluttering heart tosses her head bridles up and giggles involuntarily at sight of a handsome young man to the staid maid of twentyeight who with a demure aspect moralizes on the vanity of beauty the folly of youth and simplicity of woman and expatiates on friendship benevolence and good sense in the style of a platonic philosopher in such a diversity of dispositions his conquests were attended with all the heartburnings animosities and turmoils of jealousy and spite the younger class took all opportunities of mortifying their seniors in public by treating them with that indignity which contrary to the general privilege of age is by the consent and connivance of mankind leveled against those who have the misfortune to come under the denomination of old maids and these last retorted their hostilities in the private machinations of slander supported by experience and subtilty of invention not one day passed in which some new story did not circulate to the prejudice of one or other of those rivals if our hero in the longroom chanced to quit one of the moralists with whom he had been engaged in conversation he was immediately accosted by a number of the opposite faction who with ironical smiles upbraided him with cruelty to the poor lady he had left exhorted him to have compassion on her sufferings and turning their eyes towards the object of their intercession broke forth into a universal peal of laughter on the other hand when peregrine in consequence of having danced with one of the minors overnight visited her in the morning the platonists immediately laid hold on the occasion tasked their imaginations associated ideas and with sage insinuations retailed a thousand circumstances of the interview which never had any foundation in truth they observed that if girls are determined to behave with such indiscretion they must lay their accounts with incurring the censure of the world that she in question was old enough to act more circumspectly and wondered that her mother would permit any young fellow to approach the chamber while her daughter was naked in bed as for the servants peeping through the keyhole to be sure it was an unlucky accident but people ought to be upon their guard against such curiosity and give their domestics no cause to employ their penetration these and other such reflections were occasionally whispered as secrets among those who were known to be communicative so that in a few hours it became the general topic of discourse and as it had been divulged under injunctions of secrecy it was almost impossible to trace the scandal to its origin because every person concerned must have promulgated her own breach of trust in discovering her author of the report peregrine instead of allaying rather exasperated this contention by an artful distribution of his attention among the competitors well knowing that should his regard be converged into one point he would soon forfeit the pleasure he enjoyed in seeing them at variance for both parties would join against the common enemy and his favourite would be persecuted by the whole coalition he perceived that among the secret agents of scandal none were so busy as the physicians a class of animals who live in this place like so many ravens hovering about a carcase and even ply for employment like scullers at hungerfordstairs the greatest part of them have correspondents in london who make it their business to inquire into the history character and distemper of every one that repairs to bath for the benefit of the waters and if they cannot procure interest to recommend their medical friends to these patients before they set out they at least furnish them with a previous account of what they could collect that their correspondents may use this intelligence for their own advantage by these means and the assistance of flattery and assurance they often insinuate themselves into the acquaintance of strangers and by consulting their dispositions become necessary and subservient to their prevailing passions by their connection with apothecaries and nurses they are informed of all the private occurrences in each family and therefore enabled to gratify the rancour of malice amuse the spleen of peevish indisposition and entertain the eagerness of impertinent curiosity in the course of these occupations which frequently affected the reputation of our two adventurers this whole body fell under the displeasure of our hero who after divers consultations with his friend concerted a stratagem which was practised upon the faculty in this manner among those who frequented the pumproom was an old officer whose temper naturally impatient was by repeated attacks of the gout which had almost deprived him of the use of his limbs sublimated into a remarkable degree of virulence and perverseness he imputed the inveteracy of his distemper to the malpractice of a surgeon who had administered to him while he laboured under the consequences of an unfortunate amour and this supposition had inspired him with an insurmountable antipathy to all the professors of the medical art which was more and more confirmed by the information of a friend at london who had told him that it was the common practice among the physicians at bath to dissuade their patients from drinking the water that the cure and in consequence their attendance might be longer protracted thus prepossessed he had come to bath and conformable to a few general instructions he had received used the waters without any farther direction taking all occasions of manifesting his hatred and contempt of the sons of esculapius both by speech and gesticulations and even by pursuing a regimen quite contrary to that which he knew they prescribed to others who seemed to be exactly in his condition but he did not find his account in this method how successful soever it may have been in other cases his complaints instead of vanishing were every day more and more enraged and at length he was confined to his bed where he lay blaspheming from morn to night and from night to morn though still more determined than ever to adhere to his former maxims in the midst of his torture which was become the common joke of the town being circulated through the industry of the physicians who triumphed in his disaster peregrine by means of mr pipes employed a country fellow who had come to market to run with great haste early one morning to the lodgings of all the doctors in town and desire them to attend the colonel with all imaginable despatch in consequence of this summons the whole faculty put themselves in motion and three of the foremost arriving at the same instant of time far from complimenting one another with the door each separately essayed to enter and the whole triumvirate stuck in the passage while they remained thus wedged together they descried two of their brethren posting towards the same goal with all the speed that god had enabled them to exert upon which they came to a parley and agreed to stand by one another this covenant being made they disentangled themselves and inquiring about the patient were told by the servant that he had just fallen asleep having received this intelligence they took possession of his antechamber and shut the door while the rest of the tribe posted themselves on the outside as they arrived so that the whole passage was filled from the top of the staircase to the streetdoor and the people of the house together with the colonels servant struck dumb with astonishment the three leaders of this learned gang had no sooner made their lodgment good than they began to consult about the patients malady which every one of them pretended to have considered with great care and assiduity the first who gave his opinion said the distemper was an obstinate arthritis the second affirmed that it was no other than a confirmed pox and the third swore it was an inveterate scurvy this diversity of opinions was supported by a variety of quotations from medical authors ancient as well as modern but these were not of sufficient authority or at least not explicit enough to decide the dispute for there are many schisms in medicine as well as in religion and each sect can quote the fathers in support of the tenets they profess in short the contention rose to such a pitch of clamour as not only alarmed the brethren on the stair but also awaked the patient from the first nap he had enjoyed in the space of ten whole days had it been simply waking he would have been obliged to them for the noise that disturbed him for in that case he would have been relieved from the tortures of hell fire to which in his dreams he fancied himself exposed but this dreadful vision had been the result of that impression which was made upon his brain by the intolerable anguish of his joints so that when he awaked the pain instead of being allayed was rather aggravated by a great acuteness of sensation and the confused vociferation in the next room invading his ears at the same time he began to think his dream was realised and in the pangs of despair applied himself to a bell that stood by his bedside which he rung with great violence and perseverance this alarm put an immediate stop to the disputation of the three doctors who upon this notice of his being awake rushed into his chamber without ceremony and two of them seizing his arms the third made the like application to one of his temples before the patient could recollect himself from the amazement which had laid hold on him at this unexpected irruption the room was filled by the rest of the faculty who followed the servant that entered in obedience to his masters call and the bed was in a moment surrounded by these gaunt ministers of death the colonel seeing himself beset with such an assemblage of solemn visages and figures which he had always considered with the utmost detestation and abhorrence was incensed to a most inexpressible degree of indignation and so inspirited by his rage that though his tongue denied its office his other limbs performed their functions he disengaged himself from the triumvirate who had taken possession of his body sprung out of bed with incredible agility and seizing one of his crutches applied it so effectually to one of the three just as he stooped to examine the patients water that his tieperiwig dropped into the pot while he himself fell motionless on the floor this significant explanation disconcerted the whole fraternity every man turned his face as if it were by instinct towards the door and the retreat of the community being obstructed by the efforts of individuals confusion and tumultuous uproar ensued for the colonel far from limiting his prowess to the first exploit handled his weapon with astonishing vigour and dexterity without respect of persons so that few or none of them had escaped without marks of his displeasure when his spirits failed and he sank down again quite exhausted on his bed favoured by this respite the discomfited faculty collected their hats and wigs which had fallen off in the fray and perceiving the assailant too much enfeebled to renew the attack set up their throats together and loudly threatened to prosecute him severely for such an outrageous assault by this time the landlord had interposed and inquiring into the cause of the disturbance was informed of what had happened by the complainants who at the same time giving him to understand that they had been severally summoned to attend the colonel that morning he assured them that they had been imposed upon by some wag for his lodger had never dreamed of consulting any one of their profession thunderstruck at this declaration the general clamour instantaneously ceased and each in particular at once comprehending the nature of the joke they sneaked silently off with the loss they had sustained in unutterable shame and mortification while peregrine and his friend who took care to be passing that way by accident made a full stop at sight of such an extraordinary efflux and enjoyed the countenance and condition of every one as he appeared nay even made up to some of those who seemed most affected with their situation and mischievously tormented them with questions touching this unusual congregation then in consequence of the information they received from the landlord and the colonels valet subjected the sufferers to the ridicule of all the company in town as it would have been impossible for the authors of this farce to keep themselves concealed from the indefatigable inquiries of the physicians they made no secret of their having directed the whole though they took care to own it in such an ambiguous manner as afforded no handle of prosecution chapter lxxi peregrine humbles a noted hector and meets with a strange character at the house of a certain lady among those who never failed to reside at bath during the season was a certain person who from the most abject misery had by his industry and art at play amassed about fifteen thousand pounds and though his character was notorious insinuated himself so far into the favour of what is called the best company that very few private parties of pleasure took place in which he was not principally concerned he was of a gigantic stature a most intrepid countenance and his disposition naturally overbearing had in the course of his adventures and success acquired a most intolerable degree of insolence and vanity by the ferocity of his features and audacity of his behaviour he had obtained a reputation for the most undaunted courage which had been confirmed by divers adventures in which he had humbled the most assuming heroes of his own fraternity so that he now reigned chief hector of the place with unquestioned authority with this son of fortune was peregrine one evening engaged at play and so successful that he could not help informing his friend of his good luck godfrey hearing the description of the loser immediately recognized the person whom he had known at tunbridge and assuring pickle that he was a sharper of the first water cautioned him against any further connection with such a dangerous companion who he affirmed had suffered him to win a small sum that he might be encouraged to lose a much greater sum upon some other occasion our young gentleman treasured up this advice and though he did not scruple to give the gamester an opportunity of retrieving his loss when he next day demanded his revenge he absolutely refused to proceed after he had refunded his winning the other who considered him as a hotheaded unthinking youth endeavoured to inflame his pride to a continuance of the game by treating his skill with scorn and contempt and among other sarcastic expressions advised him to go to school again before he pretended to engage with masters of the art our hero incensed at his arrogance replied with great warmth that he knew himself sufficiently qualified for playing with men of honour who deal upon the square and hoped he should always deem it infamous either to learn or practise the tricks of a professed gamester blood and thunder meaning me sir cried this artist raising his voice and curling his visage into a most intimidating frown zounds ill cut the throat of any scoundrel who has the presumption to suppose that i dont play as honourably as eer a nobleman in the kingdom and i insist upon an explanation from you sir or by hell and brimstone i shall expect other sort of satisfaction peregrine whose blood by this time boiled within him answered without hesitation far from thinking your demand unreasonable i will immediately explain myself without reserve and tell you that upon unquestionable authority i believe you to be an impudent rascal and common cheat the hector was so amazed and confounded at the freedom of this declaration which he thought no man on earth would venture to make in his presence that for some minutes he could not recollect himself but at length whispered a challenge in the ear of our hero which was accordingly accepted when they arrived next morning upon the field the gamester arming his countenance with all its terrors advanced with a sword of a monstrous length and putting himself in a posture called out aloud in a most terrific voice draw d n ye draw i will this instant send you to your fathers the youth was not slow in complying with his desire his weapon was unsheathed in a moment and he began the attack with such unexpected spirit and address that his adversary having made shift with great difficulty to parry the first pass retreated a few paces and demanded a parley in which he endeavoured to persuade the young man that to lay a man of his character under the necessity of chastising his insolence was the most rash and inconsiderate step that he could possibly have taken but that he had compassion upon his youth and was willing to spare him if he would surrender his sword and promise to ask pardon in public for the offence he had given pickle was so much exasperated at this unparalleled effrontery that without deigning to make the least reply he flung his own hat in the proposers face and renewed the charge with such undaunted agility that the gamester finding himself in manifest hazard of his life betook himself to his heels and fled homewards with incredible speed being closely pursued by peregrine who having sheathed his sword pelted him with stones as he ran and compelled him to go that same day into banishment from bath where he had domineered so long by this achievement which was the subject of astonishment to all the company who had looked upon the fugitive as a person of heroic courage our adventurers reputation was rendered formidable in all its circumstances although he thereby disobliged a good many people of fashion who had contracted an intimacy of friendship with the exile and who resented his disgrace as if it had been the misfortune of a worthy man these generous patrons however bore a very small proportion to those who were pleased with the event of the duel because in the course of their residence at bath they had either been insulted or defrauded by the challenger nor was this instance of our heros courage unacceptable to the ladies few of whom could now resist the united force of such accomplishments indeed neither he nor his friend godfrey would have found much difficulty in picking up an agreeable companion for life but gauntlets heart was preengaged to sophy and pickle exclusive of his attachment to emily which was stronger than he himself imagined possessed such a share of ambition as could not be satisfied with the conquest of any female he beheld at bath his visits were therefore promiscuous without any other view than that of amusement and though his pride was flattered by the advances of the fair whom he had captivated he never harboured one thought of proceeding beyond the limits of common gallantry and carefully avoided all particular explanations but what above all other enjoyments yielded him the most agreeable entertainment was the secret history of characters which he learned from a very extraordinary person with whom he became acquainted in this manner being at the house of a certain lady on a visiting day he was struck with the appearance of an old man who no sooner entered the room than the mistress of the house very kindly desired one of the wits present to roast the old put this petitmaitre proud of the employment went up to the senior who had something extremely peculiar and significant in his countenance and saluting him with divers fashionable congees accosted him in these words your servant you old rascal i hope to have the honour of seeing you hanged i vow to gad you look extremely shocking with these gummy eyes lanthorn jaws and toothless chaps what you squint at the ladies you old rotten medlar yes yes we understand your ogling but you must content yourself with a cookmaid sink me i see you want to sit these withered shanks of yours tremble under their burden but you must have a little patience old hirco indeed you must i intend to mortify you a little longer curse me the company was so tickled with this address which was delivered with much grimace and gesticulation that they burst out into a loud fit of laughter which they fathered upon a monkey that was chained in the room and when the peal was over the wit renewed the attack in these words i suppose you are fool enough to think this mirth was occasioned by pug ay there he is you had best survey him he is of your own family switch me but the laugh was at your expense and you ought to thank heaven for making you so ridiculous while he uttered these ingenious ejaculations the old gentleman bowed alternately to him and the monkey that seemed to grin and chatter in imitation of the beau and with an arch solemnity of visage pronounced gentlemen as i have not the honour to understand your compliments they will be much better bestowed on each other so saying he seated himself and had the satisfaction to see the laugh returned upon the aggressor who remained confounded and abashed and in a few minutes left the room muttering as he retired the old fellow grows scurrilous stap my breath while peregrine wondered in silence at this extraordinary scene the lady of the house perceiving his surprise gave him to understand that the ancient visitant was utterly bereft of the sense of hearing that his name was cadwallader crabtree his disposition altogether misanthropical and that he was admitted into company on account of entertainment he afforded by his sarcastic observations and the pleasant mistakes to which he was subject from his infirmity nor did our hero wait a long time for an illustration of this odd character every sentence he spoke was replete with gall nor did his satire consist in general reflections but a series of remarks which had been made through the medium of a most whimsical peculiarity of opinion among those who were present at this assembly was a young officer who having by dint of interest obtained a seat in the lower house thought it incumbent upon him to talk of affairs of state and accordingly regaled the company with an account of a secret expedition which the french were busied in preparing assuring them that he had it from the mouth of the minister to whom it had been transmitted by one of his agents abroad in descanting upon the particulars of the armament he observed that they had twenty ships of the line ready manned and victualled at brest which were destined for toulon where they would be joined by as many more and from thence proceed to the execution of their scheme which he imparted as a secret not fit to be divulged this piece of intelligence being communicated to all the company except mr crabtree who suffered by his loss of hearing that cynic was soon after accosted by a lady who by means of an artificial alphabet formed by a certain conjunction and disposition of the fingers asked if he had heard any extraordinary news of late cadwallader with his usual complaisance replied that he supposed she took him for a courier or spy by teasing him eternally with that question he then expatiated upon the foolish curiosity of mankind which he said must either proceed from idleness or want of ideas and repeated almost verbatim the officers information a vague ridiculous report invented by some ignorant coxcomb who wanted to give himself airs of importance and believed only by those who were utterly unacquainted with the politics and strength of the french nation in confirmation of what he had advanced he endeavoured to demonstrate how impossible it must be for that people to fit out even the third part of such a navy so soon after the losses they had sustained during the war and confirmed his proof by asserting that to his certain knowledge the harbours of brest and toulon could not at that time produce a squadron of eight ships of the line the member who was an utter stranger to this misanthrope hearing his own asseverations treated with such contempt glowed with confusion and resentment and raising his voice began to defend his own veracity with great eagerness and trepidation mingling with his arguments many blustering invectives against the insolence and ill manners of his supposed contradictor who sat with the most mortifying composure of countenance till the officers patience was quite exhausted and then to the manifest increase of his vexation he was informed that his antagonist was so deaf that in all probability the last trumpet would make no impression upon him without a previous renovation of his organs chapter lxxii he cultivates an acquaintance with the misanthrope who favours him with a short sketch of his own history peregrine was extremely well pleased with this occasional rebuke which occurred so seasonably that he could scarce believe it accidental he looked upon cadwallader as the greatest curiosity he had ever known and cultivated the old mans acquaintance with such insinuating address that in less than a fortnight he obtained his confidence as they one day walked into the fields together the manhater disclosed himself in these words though the term of our communication has been but short you must have perceived that i treat you with uncommon marks of regard which i assure you is not owing to your personal accomplishments nor the pains you take to oblige me for the first i overlook and the last i see through but there is something in your disposition which indicates a rooted contempt for the world and i understand you have made some successful efforts in exposing one part of it to the ridicule of the other it is upon this assurance that i offer you my advice and assistance in prosecuting other schemes of the same nature and to convince you that such an alliance is not to be rejected i will now give you a short sketch of my history which will be published after my death in fortyseven volumes of my own compiling i was born about forty miles from this place of parents who having a very old family name to support bestowed their whole fortune on my elder brother so that i inherited of my father little else than a large share of choler to which i am indebted for a great many adventures that did not always end to my satisfaction at the age of eighteen i was sent up to town with a recommendation to a certain peer who found means to amuse me with the promise of a commission for seven whole years and tis odds but i should have made my fortune by my perseverance had not i been arrested and thrown into the marshalsea by my landlord on whose credit i had subsisted three years after my father had renounced me as an idle vagabond there i remained six months among those prisoners who have no other support than chance charity and contracted a very valuable acquaintance which was of great service to me in the future emergencies of my life i was no sooner discharged in consequence of an act of parliament for the relief of insolvent debtors than i went to the house of my creditor whom i cudgelled without mercy and that i might leave nothing undone of those things which i ought to have done my next stage was to westminster hall where i waited until my patron came forth from the house and saluted him with a blow that laid him senseless on the pavement but my retreat was not so fortunate as i could have wished the chairman and lacqueys in waiting having surrounded and disarmed me in a trice i was committed to newgate and loaded with chains and a very sagacious gentleman who was afterwards hanged having sat in judgment upon my case pronounced me guilty of a capital crime and foretold my condemnation at the old bailey his prognostic however was disappointed for nobody appearing to prosecute me at the next session i was discharged by order of the court it would be impossible for me to recount in the compass of one days conversation all the particular exploits of which i bore considerable share suffice it to say i have been at different times prisoner in all the jails within the bills of mortality i have broken from every roundhouse on this side templebar no bailiff in the days of my youth and desperation durst execute a writ upon me without a dozen of followers and the justices themselves trembled when i was brought before them i was once maimed by a carman with whom i quarrelled because he ridiculed my leek on st davids day my skull was fractured by a butchers cleaver on the like occasion i have been run through the body five times and lost the tip of my left ear by a pistol bullet in a rencontre of this kind having left my antagonist for dead i was wise enough to make my retreat into france and a few days after my arrival at paris entering into conversation with some officers on the subject of politics a dispute arose in which i lost my temper and spoke so irreverently of the grand monarque that next morning i was sent to the bastille by virtue of a lettre de cachet there i remained for some months deprived of all intercourse with rational creatures a circumstance for which i was not sorry as i had the more time to project schemes of revenge against the tyrant who confined me and the wretch who had betrayed my private conversation but tired at length with these fruitless suggestions i was fain to unbend the severity of my thoughts by a correspondence with some industrious spiders who had hung my dungeon with their ingenious labours i considered their work with such attention that i soon became an adept in the mystery of weaving and furnished myself with as many useful observations and reflections on that art as will compose a very curious treatise which i intend to bequeath to the royal society for the benefit of our woollen manufacture and this with a view to perpetuate my own name rather than befriend my country for thank heaven i am weaned from all attachments of that kind and look upon myself as one very little obliged to any society whatsoever although i presided with absolute power over this longlegged community and distributed punishments and rewards to each according to his deserts i grew impatient of my situation and my natural disposition one day prevailing like a fire which had long been smothered i wreaked the fury of my indignation upon my innocent subjects and in a twinkling destroyed the whole race while i was employed in this general massacre the turnkey who brought me food opened the door and perceiving my transport shrugged up his shoulders and leaving my allowance went out pronouncing le pauvre diable la tete lui tourne my passion no sooner subsided than i resolved to profit by this opinion of the jailor and from that day counterfeited lunacy with such success that in less than three months i was delivered from the bastille and sent to the galleys in which they thought my bodily vigour might be of service although the faculties of my mind were decayed before i was chained to the oar i received three hundred stripes by way of welcome that i might thereby be rendered more tractable notwithstanding i used all the arguments in my power to persuade them i was only mad northnorthwest and when the wind was southerly knew a hawk from a handsaw in our second cruise we had the good fortune to be overtaken by a tempest during which the slaves were unbound that they might contribute the more to the preservation of the galley and have a chance for their lives in case of shipwreck we were no sooner at liberty than making ourselves masters of the vessel we robbed the officers and ran her on shore among rocks on the coast of portugal from whence i hastened to lisbon with a view of obtaining my passage in some ship bound for england where by this time i hoped my affair was forgotten but before this scheme could be accomplished my evil genius led me into company and being intoxicated i began to broach doctrines on the subject of religion at which some of the party were scandalized and incensed and i was next day dragged out of bed by the officers of the inquisition and conveyed to a cell in the prison belonging to that tribunal at my first examination my resentment was strong enough to support me under the torture which i endured without flinching but my resolution abated and my zeal immediately cooled when i understood from a fellowprisoner who groaned on the other side of the partition that in a short time there would be an auto da fe in consequence of which i should in all probability be doomed to the flames if i would not renounce my heretical errors and submit to such penance as the church should think fit to prescribe this miserable wretch was convicted of judaism which he had privately practised by connivance for many years until he had amassed a fortune sufficient to attract the regard of the church to this he fell a sacrifice and accordingly prepared himself for the stake while i not at all ambitious of the crown of martyrdom resolved to temporize so that when i was brought to the question the second time i made a solemn recantation as i had no worldly fortune to obstruct my salvation i was received into the bosom of the church and by way of penance enjoined to walk barefoot to rome in the habit of a pilgrim during my peregrination through spain i was detained as a spy until i could procure credentials from the inquisition at lisbon and behaved with such resolution and reserve that after being released i was deemed a proper person to be employed in quality of a secret intelligencer at a certain court this office i undertook without hesitation and being furnished with money and bills of credit crossed the pyrenees with intention to revenge myself upon the spaniards for the severities i had undergone during my captivity having therefore effectually disguised myself by a change of dress and a large patch on one eye i hired an equipage and appeared at bologna in quality of an itinerant physician in which capacity i succeeded tolerably well till my servants decamped in the night with my baggage and left me in the condition of adam in short i have travelled over the greatest part of europe as a beggar pilgrim priest soldier gamester and quack and felt the extremes of indigence and opulence with the inclemency of weather in all its vicissitudes i have learned that the characters of mankind are everywhere the same that common sense and honesty bear an infinitely small proportion to folly and vice and that life is at best a paltry province after having suffered innumerable hardships dangers and disgraces i returned to london where i lived some years in a garret and picked up a subsistence such as it was by vending purges in the streets from the back of a pied horse in which situation i used to harangue the mob in broken english under pretence of being an high german doctor at last an uncle died by whom i inherited an estate of three hundred pounds per annum though in his lifetime he would not have parted with a sixpence to save my soul and body from perdition i now appear in the world not as a member of any community or what is called a social creature but merely as a spectator who entertains himself with the grimaces of a jackpudding and banquets his spleen in beholding his enemies at loggerheads that i may enjoy this disposition abstracted from all interruption danger and participation i feign myself deaf an expedient by which i not only avoid all disputes and their consequences but also become master of a thousand little secrets which are every day whispered in my presence without any suspicion of their being overheard you saw how i handled that shallow politician at my lady plausibles the other day the same method i practise upon the crazed tory the bigot whig the sour supercilious pedant the petulant critic the blustering coward the fawning fool the pert imp sly sharper and every other species of knaves and fools with which this kingdom abounds in consequence of my rank and character i obtain free admission to the ladies among whom i have acquired the appellation of the scandalous chronicle as i am considered while silent in no other light than that of a footstool or elbowchair they divest their conversation of all restraint before me and gratify my sense of hearing with strange things which if i could prevail upon myself to give the world that satisfaction would compose a curious piece of secret history and exhibit a quite different idea of characters from what is commonly entertained by this time young gentleman you may perceive that i have it in my power to be a valuable correspondent and that it will be to your interest to deserve my confidence here the misanthrope left off speaking desirous to know the sentiments of our hero who embraced the proffered alliance in a transport of joy and surprise and the treaty was no sooner concluded than mr crabtree began to perform articles by imparting to him a thousand delicious secrets from the possession of which he promised himself innumerable scenes of mirth and enjoyment by means of this associate whom he considered as the ring of gyges he foresaw that he should be enabled to penetrate not only into the chambers but even to the inmost thoughts of the female sex in order to ward off suspicion they agreed to revile each other in public and meet at a certain private rendezvous to communicate their mutual discoveries and concert their future operations but soon after this agreement our adventurer was summoned to the garrison by an express from his friend hatchway representing that the commodore lay at the point of death and in less than an hour after the receipt of this melancholy piece of news he set out post for his uncles habitation having previously taken leave of crabtree who promised to meet him in two months in london and settled a correspondence with gauntlet who proposed to remain at bath during the rest of the season chapter lxxiii peregrine arrives at the garrison where he receives the last admonitions of commodore trunnion who next day resigns his breath and is buried according to his own directions some gentlemen in the country make a fruitless attempt to accommodate matters betwixt mr gamaliel pickle and his eldest son about four oclock in the morning our hero arrived at the garrison where he found his generous uncle in extremity supported in bed by julia on one side and lieutenant hatchway on the other while mr jolter administered spiritual consolation to his soul and between whiles comforted mrs trunnion who with her maid sat by the fire weeping with great decorum the physician having just taken his last fee and retired after pronouncing the fatal prognostic in which he anxiously wished he might be mistaken though the commodores speech was interrupted by a violent hiccup he still retained the use of his senses and when peregrine approached stretched out his hand with manifest signs of satisfaction the young gentleman whose heart overflowed with gratitude and affection could not behold such a spectacle unmoved he endeavoured to conceal his tenderness which in the wildness of his youth and the pride of his disposition he considered as a derogation from his manhood but in spite of all his endeavours the tears gushed from his eyes while he kissed the old mans hand and he was so utterly disconcerted by his grief that when he attempted to speak his tongue denied its office so that the commodore perceiving his disorder made a last effort of strength and consoled him in these words swab the spray from your bowsprit my good lad and coil up your spirits you must not let the toplifts of your heart give way because you see me ready to go down at these years many a better man has foundered before he has made half my way thof i trust by the mercy of god i shall be sure in port in a very few glasses and fast moored in a most blessed riding for my good friend jolter hath overhauled the journal of my sins and by the observation he hath taken of the state of my soul i hope i shall happily conclude my voyage and be brought up in the latitude of heaven here has been a doctor that wanted to stow me chock full of physic but when a mans hour is come what signifies his taking his departure with a pothecarys shop in his hold those fellows come alongside of dying men like the messengers of the admiralty with sailing orders but i told him as how i could slip my cable without his direction or assistance and so he hauled off in dudgeon this cursed hiccup makes such a rippling in the current of my speech that mayhap you dont understand what i say now while the sucker of my windpump will go i would willingly mention a few things which i hope you will set down in the logbook of your remembrance when i am stiff dye see theres your aunt sitting whimpering by the fire i desire you will keep her tight warm and easy in her old age shes an honest heart in her own way and thof she goes a little crank and humoursome by being often overstowed with nantz and religion she has been a faithful shipmate to me and i daresay she never turned in with another man since we first embarked in the same bottom jack hatchway you know the trim of her as well as eer a man in england and i believe she has a kindness for you whereby if you two will grapple in the way of matrimony when i am gone i do suppose that my godson for love of me will allow you to live in the garrison all the days of your life peregrine assured him he would with pleasure comply with any request he should make in behalf of two persons whom he esteemed so much the lieutenant with a waggish sneer which even the gravity of the situation could not prevent thanked them both for their goodwill telling the commodore he was obliged to him for his friendship in seeking to promote him to the command of a vessel which he himself had worn out in the service but that notwithstanding he should be content to take charge of her though he could not help being shy of coming after such an able navigator trunnion exhausted as he was smiled at this sally and after some pause resumed his admonitions in this manner i need not talk of pipes because i know youll do for him without any recommendation the fellow has sailed with me in many a hard gale and ill warrant him as stout a seaman as ever set face to the weather but i hope youll take care of the rest of my crew and not disrate them after i am dead in favour of new followers as for that young woman ned gauntlets daughter im informed as how shes an excellent wench and has a respect for you whereby if you run her on board in an unlawful way i leave my curse upon you and trust you will never prosper in the voyage of life but i believe you are more of an honest man than to behave so much like a pirate i beg of all love you wool take care of your constitution and beware of running foul of harlots who are no better than so many mermaids that sit upon rocks in the sea and hang out a fair face for the destruction of passengers thof i must say for my own part i never met with any of those sweet singers and yet i have gone to sea for the space of thirty years but howsomever steer your course clear of all such brimstone b s shun going to law as you would shun the devil and look upon all attorneys as devouring sharks or ravenous fish of prey as soon as the breath is out of my body let minute guns be fired till i am safe under ground i would also be buried in the red jacket i had on when i boarded and took the renummy let my pistols cutlass and pocketcompass be laid in the coffin along with me let me be carried to the grave by my own men rigged in the black caps and white shirts which my barges crew were wont to wear and they must keep a good look out that none of your pilfering rascallions may come and heave me up again for the lucre of what they can get until the carcase is belayed by a tombstone as for the motto or what you call it i leave that to you and mr jolter who are scholars but i do desire that it may not be engraved in the greek or latin lingos and much less in the french which i abominate but in plain english that when the angel comes to pipe all hands at the great day he may know that i am a british man and speak to me in my mother tongue and now i have no more to say but god in heaven have mercy upon my soul and send you all fair weather wheresoever you are bound so saying he regarded every individual around him with a look of complacency and closing his eye composed himself to rest while the whole audience pipes himself not excepted were melted with sorrow and mrs trunnion consented to quit the room that she might not be exposed to the unspeakable anguish of seeing him expire his last moments however were not so near as they imagined he began to doze and enjoyed small intervals of ease till next day in the afternoon during which remissions he was heard to pour forth many pious ejaculations expressing his hope that for all the heavy cargo of his sins he should be able to surmount the puttockshrouds of despair and get aloft to the crosstrees of gods good favour at last his voice sunk so low as not to be distinguished and having lain about an hour almost without any perceptible signs of life he gave up the ghost with a groan which announced his decease julia was no sooner certified of this melancholy event than she ran to her aunts chamber weeping aloud and immediately a very decent concert was performed by the good widow and her attendants peregrine and hatchway retired till the corpse should be laid out and pipes having surveyed the body with a face of rueful attention well fare thy soul old hawser trunnion said he man and boy i have known thee these fiveandthirty years and sure a truer heart never broke biscuit many a hard gale hast thou weathered but now thy spells are all over and thy hull fairly laid up a better commander id never desire to serve and who knows but i may help to set up thy standing rigging in another world all the servants of the house were affected with the loss of their old master and the poor people in the neighbourhood assembled at the gate and by repeated howlings expressed their sorrow for the death of their charitable benefactor peregrine though he felt everything which love and gratitude could inspire on this occasion was not so much overwhelmed with affliction as to be incapable of taking the management of the family into his own hands he gave directions about the funeral with great discretion after having paid the compliments of condolence to his aunt whom he consoled with the assurance of his inviolable esteem and affection he ordered a suit of mourning to be made for every person in the garrison and invited all the neighbouring gentlemen to the burial not even excepting his father and brother gam who did not however honour the ceremony with their presence nor was his mother humane enough to visit her sisterinlaw in her distress in the method of interment the commodores injunctions were obeyed to a title and at the same time our hero made a donation of fifty pounds to the poor of the parish as a benefaction which his uncle had forgot to bequeath having performed these obsequies with the most pious punctuality he examined the will to which there was no addition since it had first been executed adjusted the payment of all the legacies and being sole executor took an account of the estate to which he had succeeded which after all deductions amounted to thirty thousand pounds the possession of such a fortune of which he was absolute master did not at all contribute to the humiliation of his spirit but inspired him with new ideas of grandeur and magnificence and elevated his hope to the highest pinnacle of expectation his domestic affairs being settled he was visited by almost all the gentlemen of the county who came to pay their compliments of congratulation on his accession to the estate and some of them offered their good offices towards a reconciliation betwixt his father and him induced by the general detestation which was entertained for his brother gam who was by this time looked upon by his neighbours as a prodigy of insolence and malice our young squire thanked them for their kind proposal which he accepted and old gamaliel at their entreaties seemed very well disposed to any accommodation but as he would not venture to declare himself before he had consulted his wife his favourable disposition was rendered altogether ineffectual by the instigations of that implacable woman and our hero resigned all expectation of being reunited to his fathers house his brother as usual took all opportunities of injuring his character by false aspersions and stories misrepresented in order to prejudice his reputation nor was his sister julia suffered to enjoy her good fortune in peace had he undergone such persecution from an alien to his blood the world would have heard of his revenge but notwithstanding his indignation he was too much tinctured by the prejudices of consanguinity to lift his arm in judgment against the son of his own parents and this consideration abridged the term of his residence at the garrison where he had proposed to stay for some months volume ii chapter lxxiv the young gentleman having settled his domestic affairs arrives in london and sets up a gay equipage he meets with emilia and is introduced to her uncle his aunt at the earnest solicitations of julia and her husband took up her quarters at the house of that affectionate kinswoman who made it her chief study to comfort and cherish the disconsolate widow and jolter in expectation of the living which was not yet vacant remained in garrison in quality of landsteward upon our heros country estate as for the lieutenant our young gentleman communed with him in a serious manner about the commodores proposal of taking mrs trunnion to wife and jack being quite tired of the solitary situation of a bachelor which nothing but the company of his old commander could have enabled him to support so long far from discovering aversion from the match observed with an arch smile that it was not the first time he had commanded a vessel in the absence of captain trunnion and therefore if the widow was willing he would cheerfully stand by her helm and as he hoped the duty would not be of long continuance do his endeavour to steer her safe into port where the commodore might come on board and take charge of her again in consequence of this declaration it was determined that mr hatchway should make his addresses to mrs trunnion as soon as decency would permit her to receive them and mr clover and his wife promised to exert their influence on his behalf meanwhile jack was desired to live at the castle as usual and assured that it should be put wholly in his possession as soon as he should be able to accomplish this matrimonial scheme when peregrine had settled all these points to his own satisfaction he took leave of all his friends and repairing to the great city purchased a new chariot and horses put pipes and another lacquey into rich liveries took elegant lodgings in pall mall and made a most remarkable appearance among the people of fashion it was owing to this equipage and the gaiety of his personal deportment that common fame which is always a common liar represented him as a young gentleman who had just succeeded to an estate of five thousand pounds per annum by the death of an uncle that he was entitled to an equal fortune at the decease of his own father exclusive of two considerable jointures which would devolve upon him at the demise of his mother and aunt this report false and ridiculous as it was he could not find in his heart to contradict not but that he was sorry to find himself so misrepresented but his vanity would not allow him to take any step that might diminish his importance in the opinion of those who courted his acquaintance on the supposition that his circumstances were actually as affluent as they were said to be nay so much was he infatuated by this weakness that he resolved to encourage the deception by living up to the report and accordingly engaged in the most expensive parties of pleasure believing that before his present finances should be exhausted his fortune would be effectually made by the personal accomplishments he should have occasion to display to the beau monde in the course of his extravagance in a word vanity and pride were the ruling foibles of our adventurer who imagined himself sufficiently qualified to retrieve his fortune in various shapes long before he could have any idea of want or difficulty he thought he should have it in his power at any time to make a prize of a rich heiress or opulent widow his ambition had already aspired to the heart of a young handsome duchess dowager to whose acquaintance he had found means to be introduced or should matrimony chance to be unsuitable to his inclinations he never doubted that by the interest he might acquire among the nobility he should be favoured with some lucrative post that would amply recompense him for the liberality of his disposition there are many young men who entertain the same expectations with half the reason he had to be so presumptuous in the midst of these chimerical calculations his passion for emilia did not subside but on the contrary began to rage with such an inflammation of desire that her idea interfered with every other reflection and absolutely disabled him from prosecuting the other lofty schemes which his imagination had projected he therefore laid down the honest resolution of visiting her in all the splendour of his situation in order to practise upon her virtue with all his art and address to the utmost extent of his affluence and fortune nay so effectually had his guilty passion absorbed his principles of honour conscience humanity and regard for the commodores last words that he was base enough to rejoice at the absence of his friend godfrey who being then with his regiment in ireland could not dive into his purpose or take measures for frustrating his vicious design fraught with these heroic sentiments he determined to set out for sussex in his chariot and six attended by his valetdechambre and two footmen and as he was now sensible that in his last essay he had mistaken his cue he determined to change his battery and sap the fortress by the most submissive soft and insinuating behaviour on the evening that preceded this proposed expedition he went into one of the boxes at the playhouse as usual to show himself to the ladies and reconnoitring the company through a glass for no other reason but because it was fashionable to be purblind perceived his mistress very plainly dressed in one of the seats above the stage talking to another young woman of a very homely appearance though his heart beat the alarm with the utmost impatience at sight of his emilia he was for some minutes deterred from obeying the impulse of his love by the presence of some ladies of fashion who he feared would think the worse of him should they see him make his compliment in public to a person of her figure nor would the violence of his inclination have so far prevailed over his pride as to lead him thither had he not recollected that his quality friends would look upon her as some handsome abigail with whom he had an affair of gallantry and of consequence give him credit for the intrigue encouraged by this suggestion he complied with the dictates of love and flew to the place where his charmer sat his air and dress were so remarkable that it was almost impossible he should have escaped the eyes of a curious observer especially as he had chosen a time for coming in when his entrance could not fail to attract the notice of the spectators i mean when the whole house was hushed in attention to the performance on the stage emilia therefore perceived him at his first approach she found herself discovered by the direction of his glass and guessing his intention by his abrupt retreat from the box summoned all her fortitude to her aid and prepared for his reception he advanced to her with an air of eagerness and joy tempered with modesty and respect and expressed his satisfaction at seeing her with a seeming reverence of regard though she was extremely well pleased at this unexpected behaviour she suppressed the emotions of her heart and answered his compliments with affected ease and unconcern such as might denote the good humour of a person who meets by accident with an indifferent acquaintance after having certified himself of her own good health he very kindly inquired about her mother and miss sophy gave her to understand that he had lately been favoured with a letter from godfrey that he had actually intended to set out next morning on a visit to mrs gauntlet which now that he was so happy as to meet with her he would postpone until he should have the pleasure of attending her to the country after having thanked him for his polite intention she told him that her mother was expected in town in a few days and that she herself had come to london some weeks ago to give attendance upon her aunt who had been dangerously ill but was now pretty well recovered although the conversation of course turned upon general topics during the entertainment he took all opportunities of being particular with his eyes through which he conveyed a thousand tender protestations she saw and inwardly rejoiced at the humility of his looks but far from rewarding it with one approving glance she industriously avoided this ocular intercourse and rather coquetted with a young gentleman that ogled her from the opposite box peregrines penetration easily detected her sentiments and he was nettled at her dissimulation which served to confirm him in his unwarrantable designs upon her person he persisted in his assiduities with indefatigable perseverance when the play was concluded handed her and her companion into a hackneycoach and with difficulty was permitted to escort them to the house of emilias uncle to whom our hero was introduced by the young lady as an intimate friend of her brother godfrey the old gentleman who was no stranger to the nature of peregrines connection with his sisters family prevailed upon him to stay supper and seemed particularly well pleased with his conversation and deportment which by the help of his natural sagacity he wonderfully adapted to the humour of his entertainer after supper when the ladies were withdrawn and the citizen called for his pipe our sly adventurer followed his example though he abhorred the plant he smoked with an air of infinite satisfaction and expatiated upon the virtues of tobacco as if he had been deeply concerned in the virginia trade in the progress of the discourse he consulted the merchants disposition and the national debt coming upon the carpet held forth upon the funds like a professed broker when the alderman complained of the restrictions and discouragements of trade his guest inveighed against exorbitant duties with the nature of which he seemed as well acquainted as any commissioner of the customs so that the uncle was astonished at the extent of his knowledge and expressed his surprise that a gay young gentleman like him should have found either leisure or inclination to consider subjects so foreign to the fashionable amusements of youth pickle laid hold on this opportunity to tell him that he was descended from a race of merchants and that early in life he had made it his business to instruct himself in the different branches of trade which he not only studied as his family profession but also as the source of all our national riches and power he then launched out in praise of commerce and the promoters thereof and by way of contrast employed all his ridicule in drawing such ludicrous pictures of the manners and education of what is called high life that the traders sides were shaken by laughter even to the danger of his life and he looked upon our adventurer as a miracle of sobriety and good sense having thus ingratiated himself with the uncle peregrine took his leave and next day in the forenoon visited the niece in his chariot after she had been admonished by her kinsman to behave with circumspection and cautioned against neglecting or discouraging the addresses of such a valuable admirer chapter lxxv he prosecutes his design upon emilia with great art and perseverance our adventurer having by his hypocrisy obtained free access to his mistress began the siege by professing the most sincere contrition for his former levity and imploring her forgiveness with such earnest supplication that guarded as she was against his flattering arts she began to believe his protestations which were even accompanied with tears and abated a good deal of that severity and distance she had proposed to maintain during this interview she would not however favour him with the least acknowledgment of a mutual passion because in the midst of his vows of eternal constancy and truth he did not mention one syllable of wedlock though he was now entirely master of his own conduct and this consideration created a doubt which fortified her against all his attacks yet what her discretion would have concealed was discovered by her eyes which in spite of all her endeavours breathed forth complacency and love for her inclination was flattered by her own selfsufficiency which imputed her admirers silence in that particular to the hurry and perturbation of his spirits and persuaded her that he could not possibly regard her with any other than honourable intentions the insidious lover exulted in the tenderness of her looks from which he presaged a complete victory but that he might not overshoot himself by his own precipitation he would not run the risk of declaring himself until her heart should be so far entangled within his snares as that neither the suggestions of honour prudence nor pride should be able to disengage it armed with this resolution he restrained the impatience of his temper within the limits of the most delicate deportment after having solicited and obtained permission to attend her to the next opera he took her by the hand and pressing it to his lips in the most respectful manner went away leaving her in a most whimsical state of suspense chequered with an interesting vicissitude of hope and fear on the appointed day he appeared again about five oclock in the afternoon and found her native charms so much improved by the advantages of dress that he was transported with admiration and delight and while he conducted her to the haymarket could scarce bridle the impetuosity of his passion so as to observe the forbearing maxims he had adopted when she entered the pit he had abundance of food for the gratification of his vanity for in a moment she eclipsed all the female part of the audience each individual allowing in her own heart that the stranger was by far the handsomest woman there present except herself here it was that our hero enjoyed a double triumph he was vain of this opportunity to enhance his reputation for gallantry among the ladies of fashion who knew him and proud of an occasion to display his quality acquaintance to emilia that she might entertain the greater idea of the conquest she had made and pay the more deference to his importance in the sequel of his addresses that he might profit as much as possible by this situation he went up and accosted every person in the pit with whom he ever had least communication whispered and laughed with an affected air of familiarity and even bowed at a distance to some of the nobility on the slender foundation of having stood near them at court or presented them with a pinch of rappee at whites chocolatehouse this ridiculous ostentation though now practised with a view of promoting his design was a weakness that in some degree infected the whole of his behaviour for nothing gave him so much joy in conversation as an opportunity of giving the company to understand how well he was with persons of distinguished rank and character he would often for example observe as it were occasionally that the duke of g was one of the bestnatured men in the world and illustrate this assertion by some instance of his affability in which he himself was concerned then by an abrupt transition he would repeat some repartee of lady t and mention a certain bon mot of the earl of c which was uttered in his hearing abundance of young men in this manner make free with the names though they have never had access to the persons of the nobility but this was not the case with peregrine who in consideration of his appearance and supposed fortune together with the advantage of his introduction was by this time freely admitted to the tables of the great in his return with emilia from the opera though he still maintained the most scrupulous decorum in his behaviour he plied her with the most passionate expressions of love squeezed her hand with great fervency protested that his whole soul was engrossed by her idea and that he could not exist independent of her favour pleased as she was with his warm and pathetic addresses together with the respectful manner of his making love she yet had prudence and resolution sufficient to contain her tenderness which was ready to run over being fortified against his arts by reflecting that if his aim was honourable it was now his business to declare it on this consideration she refused to make any serious reply to his earnest expostulations but affected to receive them as the undetermined effusions of gallantry and good breeding this fictitious gaiety and goodhumour though it baffled his hope of extorting from her an acknowledgment of which he might have taken immediate advantage nevertheless encouraged him to observe as the chariot passed along the strand that the night was far advanced that supper would certainly be over before they could reach her uncles house and to propose that he should wait upon her to some place where they might be accommodated with a slight refreshment she was offended at the freedom of this proposal which however she treated as a joke thanking him for his courteous offer and assuring him that when she should be disposed for a tavern treat he alone would have the honour of bestowing it her kinsman being engaged with company abroad and her aunt retired to rest he had the good fortune to enjoy a teteatete with her during a whole hour which he employed with such consummate skill that her caution was almost overcome he not only assailed her with the artillery of sighs vows prayers and tears but even pawned his honour in behalf of his love he swore with many imprecations that although her heart was surrendered to him at discretion there was a principle within him which would never allow him to injure such innocence and beauty and the transports of his passion had upon this occasion so far overshot his purpose that if she had demanded an explanation while he was thus agitated he would have engaged himself to her wish by such ties as he could not break with any regard to his reputation but from such expostulation she was deterred partly by pride and partly by the dread of finding herself mistaken in such an interesting conjecture she therefore enjoyed the present flattering appearance of her fate was prevailed upon to accept the jewels which he purchased with part of his winning at bath and with the most enchanting condescension submitted to a warm embrace when he took his leave after having obtained permission to visit her as often as his inclination and convenience would permit in his return to his own lodgings he was buoyed up with his success to an extravagance of hope already congratulated himself upon his triumph over emilias virtue and began to project future conquests among the most dignified characters of the female sex but his attention was not at all dissipated by these vain reflections he resolved to concentrate the whole exertion of his soul upon the execution of his present plan desisted in the meantime from all other schemes of pleasure interest and ambition and took lodgings in the city for the more commodious accomplishment of his purpose while our lovers imagination was thus agreeably regaled his mistress did not enjoy her expectations without the intervention of doubts and anxiety his silence touching the final aim of his addresses was a mystery on which she was afraid of exercising her sagacity and her uncle tormented her with inquiries into the circumstances of peregrines professions and deportment rather than give this relation the least cause for suspicion which must have cut off all intercourse betwixt her and her admirer she said everything which she thought would satisfy his care and concern for her welfare and in consequence of such representation she enjoyed without reserve the company of our adventurer who prosecuted his plan with surprising eagerness and perseverance chapter lxxvi he prevails upon emilia to accompany him to a masquerade makes a treacherous attempt upon her affection and meets with a deserved repulse scarce a night elapsed in which he did not conduct her to some public entertainment when by the dint of his insidious carriage he thought himself in full possession of her confidence and affection he lay in wait for an opportunity and hearing her observe in conversation that she had never been at a masquerade begged leave to attend her to the next ball at the same time extending his invitation to the young lady in whose company he had found her at the play she being present when this subject of discourse was introduced he had flattered himself that this gentlewoman would decline the proposal as she was a person seemingly of a demure disposition who had been born and bred in the city where such diversions are looked upon as scenes of lewdness and debauchery for once however he reckoned without his host curiosity is as prevalent in the city as at the court end of the town emilia no sooner signified her assent to his proposal than her friend with an air of satisfaction agreed to make one of the party and he was obliged to thank her for that complaisance which laid him under infinite mortification he set his genius at work to invent some scheme for preventing her unseasonable intrusion had an opportunity offered he would have acted as her physician and administered a medicine that would have laid her under the necessity of staying at home but his acquaintance with her being too slight to furnish him with the means of executing this expedient he devised another which was practised with all imaginable success understanding that her grandmother had left her a sum of money independent of her parents he conveyed a letter to her mother intimating that her daughter on pretence of going to the masquerade intended to bestow herself in marriage to a certain person and that in a few days she would be informed of the circumstances of the whole intrigue provided she would keep this information secret and contrive some excuse for detaining the young lady at home without giving her cause to believe she was apprised of her intention this billet subscribed your wellwisher and unknown humble servant had the desired effect upon the careful matron who on the ball day feigned herself so extremely ill that miss could not with any decency quit her mammas apartment and therefore sent her apology to emilia in the afternoon immediately after the arrival of peregrine who pretended to be very much afflicted with the disappointment while his heart throbbed with a transport of joy about ten oclock the lovers set out for the haymarket he being dressed in the habit of pantaloon and she in that of columbine and they had scarce entered the house when the music struck up the curtain was withdrawn and the whole scene displayed at once to the admiration of emilia whose expectation was infinitely surpassed by this exhibition our gallant having conducted her through all the different apartments and described the economy of the place led her into the circle and in their turn they danced several minuets then going to the sideboard he prevailed upon her to eat some sweetmeats and drink a glass of champagne after a second review of the company they engaged in country dances at which exercise they continued until our adventurer concluded that his partners blood was sufficiently warm for the prosecution of his design on this supposition which was built upon her declaring that she was thirsty and fatigued he persuaded her to take a little refreshment and repose and for that purpose handed her downstairs into the eatingroom where having seated her on the floor he presented her with a glass of wine and water and as she complained of being faint enriched the draught with some drops of a certain elixir which he recommended as a most excellent restorative though it was no other than a stimulating tincture which he had treacherously provided for the occasion having swallowed this potion by which her spirits were manifestly exhilarated she ate a slice of ham with the wing of a cold pullet and concluded the meal with a glass of burgundy which she drank at the earnest entreaty of her admirer these extraordinary cordials cooperating with the ferment of her blood which was heated by violent motion could not fail to affect the constitution of a delicate young creature who was naturally sprightly and volatile her eyes began to sparkle with unusual fire and vivacity a thousand brilliant sallies of wit escaped her and every mask that accosted her underwent some smarting repartee peregrine overjoyed at the success of his administration proposed that they should resume their places at the country dances with a view to promote and assist the efficacy of his elixir and when he thought her disposition was properly adapted for the theme began to ply her with all the elocution of love in order to elevate his own spirits to that pitch of resolution which his scheme required he drank two whole bottles of burgundy which inflamed his passion to such a degree that he found himself capable of undertaking and perpetrating any scheme for the gratification of his desire emilia warmed by so many concurring incentives in favour of the man she loved abated considerably of her wonted reserve listened to his protestations with undissembled pleasure and in the confidence of her satisfaction even owned him absolute master of her affections ravished with this confession he now deemed himself on the brink of reaping the delicious fruits of his art and assiduity and the morning being already pretty far advanced assented with rapture to the first proposal she made of retiring to her lodgings the blinds of the chariot being pulled up he took advantage of the favourable situation of her thoughts and on pretence of being whimsical in consequence of the wine he had swallowed clasped her in his arms and imprinted a thousand kisses on her pouting lips a freedom which she pardoned as the privilege of intoxication while he thus indulged himself with impunity the carriage halted and pipes opening the door his master handed her into the passage before she perceived that it was not her uncles house at which they had alighted alarmed at this discovery she with some confusion desired to know his reason for conducting her to a strange place at these hours but he made no reply until he had led her into an apartment when he gave her to understand that as her uncles family must be disturbed by her going thither so late in the night and the streets near templebar were infested by a multitude of robbers and cutthroats he had ordered his coachman to halt at this house which was kept by a relation of his a mighty good sort of a gentlewoman who would be proud of an opportunity to accommodate a person for whom he was known to entertain such tenderness and esteem emilia had too much penetration to be imposed upon by this plausible pretext in spite of her partiality for peregrine which had never been inflamed to such a pitch of complacency before she comprehended his whole plan in a twinkling though her blood boiled with indignation she thanked him with an affected air of serenity for his kind concern and expressed her obligation to his cousin but at the same time insisted upon going home lest her absence should terrify her uncle and aunt who she knew would not retire to rest till her return he urged her with a thousand remonstrances to consult her own ease and safety promising to send pipes into the city for the satisfaction of her relations but finding her obstinately deaf to his entreaties he assured her that he would in a few minutes comply with her request and in the meantime begged she would fortify herself against the cold with a cordial which he poured out in her presence and which now that her suspicion was aroused she refused to taste notwithstanding all his importunities he then fell on his knees before her and the tears gushing from his eyes swore that his passion was wound up to such a pitch of impatience that he could no longer live upon the unsubstantial food of expectation and that if she would not vouchsafe to crown his happiness he would forthwith sacrifice himself to her disdain such an abrupt address accompanied with all the symptoms of frantic agitation could not fail to perplex and affright the gentle emilia who after some recollection replied with a resolute tone that she could not see what reason he had to complain of her reserve which she was not at liberty to lay entirely aside until he should have avowed his intentions in form and obtained the sanction of those whom it was her duty to obey divine creature cried he seizing her hand and pressing it to his lips it is from you alone i hope for that condescension which would overwhelm me with the transports of celestial bliss the sentiments of parents are sordid silly and confined i mean not then to subject my passion to such low restrictions as were calculated for the purposes of common life my love is too delicate and refined to wear those vulgar fetters which serve only to destroy the merit of voluntary affection and to upbraid a man incessantly with the articles of compulsion under which he lies my dear angel spare me the mortification of being compelled to love you and reign sole empress of my heart and fortune i will not affront you so much as to talk of settlements my all is at your disposal in this pocketbook are notes to the amount of two thousand pounds do me the pleasure to accept of them tomorrow i will lay ten thousand more in your lap in a word you shall be mistress of my whole estate and i shall think myself happy in living dependent on your bounty heavens what were the emotions of the virtuous the sensible the delicate the tender emilias heart when she heard this insolent declaration from the mouth of a man whom she had honoured with her affection and esteem it was not simply horror grief or indignation that she felt in consequence of this unworthy treatment but the united pangs of all together which produced a sort of hysteric laughter while she told him that she could not help admiring his generosity deceived by this convulsion and the ironical compliment that attended it the lover thought he had already made great progress in his operations and that it was now his business to storm the fort by a vigorous assault that he might spare her the confusion of yielding without resistance possessed by this vain suggestion he started up and folding her in his arms began to obey the furious dictates of his unruly and ungenerous desire with an air of cool determination she demanded a parley and when upon her repeated request he granted it addressed herself to him in these words while her eyes gleamed with all the dignity of the most awful resentment sir i scorn to upbraid you with a repetition of your former vows and protestations nor will i recapitulate the little arts you have practised to ensnare my heart because though by dint of the most perfidious dissimulation you have found means to deceive my opinion your utmost efforts have never been able to lull the vigilance of my conduct or to engage my affection beyond the power of discarding you without a tear whenever my honour should demand such a sacrifice sir you are unworthy of my concern or regret and the sigh that now struggles from my breast is the result of sorrow for my own want of discernment as for your present attempt upon my chastity i despise your power as i detest your intention though under the mask of the most delicate respect you have decoyed me from the immediate protection of my friends and contrived other impious stratagems to ruin my peace and reputation i confide too much in my own innocence and the authority of the law to admit one thought of fear much less to sink under the horror of this shocking situation into which i have been seduced sir your behaviour on this occasion is in all respects low and contemptible for ruffian as you are you durst not harbour the thought of executing your execrable scheme while you knew my brother was near enough to prevent or revenge the insult so that you must not only be a treacherous villain but also a most despicable coward having expressed herself in this manner with a most majestic severity of aspect she opened the door and walking downstairs with surprising resolution committed herself to the care of a watchman who accommodated her with a hackneychair in which she was safely conveyed to her uncles house meanwhile the lover was so confounded and overawed by these cutting reproaches and her animated behaviour that all his resolution forsook him and he found himself not only incapable of obstructing her retreat but even of uttering one syllable to deprecate her wrath or extenuate the guilt of his own conduct the nature of his disappointment and the keen remorse that seized him when he reflected upon the dishonourable footing on which his character stood with emilia raised such perturbation in his mind that his silence was succeeded by a violent fit of distraction during which he raved like a bedlamite and acted a thousand extravagancies which convinced the people of the house a certain bagnio that he had actually lost his wits pipes with great concern adopted the same opinion and being assisted by the waiters hindered him by main force from running out and pursuing the fair fugitive whom in his delirium he alternately cursed and commended with horrid imprecations and lavish applause his faithful valet having waited two whole hours in hopes of seeing this gust of passion overblown and perceiving that the paroxysm seemed rather to increase very prudently sent for a physician of his masters acquaintance who having considered the circumstances and symptoms of the disorder directed that he should be plentifully blooded without loss of time and prescribed a draught to compose the tumult of his spirits these orders being punctually performed he grew more calm and tractable recovered his reflection so far as to be ashamed of the ecstasy he had undergone and suffered himself quietly to be undressed and put to bed where the fatigue occasioned by his exercise at the masquerade cooperated with the present dissipation of his spirits to lull him into a profound sleep which greatly tended to the preservation of his intellects not that he found himself in a state of perfect tranquility when he waked about noon the remembrance of what had passed overwhelmed him with mortification emilias invectives still sounded in his ears and while he deeply resented her disdain he could not help admiring her spirit and his heart did homage to her charms chapter lxxvii he endeavours to reconcile himself to his mistress and expostulates with the uncle who forbids him the house in this state of division he went home to his own lodgings in a chair and while he deliberated with himself whether he should relinquish the pursuit and endeavour to banish her idea from his breast or go immediately and humble himself before his exasperated mistress and offer his hand as an atonement for his crime his servant put in his hand a packet which had been delivered by a ticket porter at the door he no sooner perceived that the superscription was in emilias handwriting than he guessed the nature of the contents and opening the seal with disordered eagerness found the jewels he had given to her enclosed in a billet couched in these words that i may have no cause to reproach myself with having retained the least memorial of a wretch whom i equally despise and abhor i take this opportunity of restoring these ineffectual instruments of his infamous design upon the honour of emilia his chagrin was so much galled and inflamed at the bitterness of this contemptuous message that he gnawed his fingers till the blood ran over his nails and even wept with vexation sometimes he vowed revenge against her haughty virtue and reviled himself for his precipitate declaration before his scheme was brought to maturity then he would consider her behaviour with reverence and regard and bow before the irresistible power of her attractions in short his breast was torn by conflicting passions love shame and remorse contended with vanity ambition and revenge and the superiority was still doubtful when headstrong desire interposed and decided in favour of an attempt towards a reconciliation with the offended fair impelled by this motive he set out in the afternoon for the house of her uncle not without hopes of that tender enjoyment which never fails to attend an accommodation betwixt two lovers of taste and sensibility though the consciousness of his trespass encumbered him with an air of awkward confusion he was too confident of his own qualifications and address to despair of forgiveness and by that time he arrived at the citizens gate he had conned a very artful and pathetic harangue which he proposed to utter in his own behalf laying the blame of his conduct on the impetuosity of his passion increased by the burgundy which he had too liberally drunk but he did not meet with an opportunity to avail himself of this preparation emilia suspecting that he would take some step of this kind to retrieve her favour had gone abroad on pretence of visiting after having signified to her kinsman her resolution to avoid the company of peregrine on account of some ambiguities which she said were last night remarkable in his demeanour at the masquerade she chose to insinuate her suspicion in these hints rather than give an explicit detail of the young mans dishonourable contrivance which might have kindled the resentment of the family to some dangerous pitch of animosity and revenge our adventurer finding himself baffled in his expectation of seeing her inquired for the old gentleman with whom he thought he had influence enough to make his apology good in case he should find him prepossessed by the young ladys information but here too he was disappointed the uncle having gone to dine in the country and his wife was indisposed so that he had no pretext for staying in the house till the return of his charmer being however fruitful of expedients he dismissed his chariot and took possession of a room in a tavern the windows of which fronted the merchants gate and there he proposed to watch until he should see her approach this scheme he put in practice with indefatigable patience though it was not attended with the expected success emilia whose caution was equally vigilant and commendable foreseeing that she might be exposed to the fertility of his invention came home by a private passage and entered by a postern which was altogether unknown to her admirer and her uncle did not arrive until it was so late that he could not with any decency demand a conference next morning he did not fail to present himself at the door and his mistress being denied by her own express direction insisted upon seeing the master of the house who received him with such coldness of civility as plainly gave him to understand that he was acquainted with the displeasure of his niece he therefore with an air of candour told the citizen he could easily perceive by his behaviour that he was the confidant of miss emily of whom he was come to ask pardon for the offence he had given and did not doubt if he could be admitted to her presence that he should be able to convince her that he had not erred intentionally or at least propose such reparation as would effectually atone for his fault to this remonstrance the merchant without any ceremony or circumlocution answered that though he was ignorant of the nature of his offence he was very certain that it must have been something very flagrant that could irritate his niece to such a degree against a person for whom she had formerly a most particular regard he owned she had declared her intention to renounce his acquaintance for ever and doubtless she had good reason for so doing neither would he undertake to promote an accommodation unless he would give him full power to treat on the score of matrimony which he supposed would be the only means of evincing his own sincerity and obtaining emilias forgiveness peregrines pride was kindled by this blunt declaration which he could not help considering as the result of a scheme concerted betwixt the young lady and her uncle in order to take advantage of his heat he therefore replied with manifest signs of disgust that he did not apprehend there was any occasion for a mediator to reconcile the difference betwixt emilia and him and that all he desired was an opportunity of pleading in his own behalf the citizen frankly told him that as his niece had expressed an earnest desire of avoiding his company he would not put the least constraint upon her inclination and in the meantime gave him to know that he was particularly engaged our hero glowing with indignation at this supercilious treatment i was in the wrong said he to look for good manners so far on this side of templebar but you must give me leave to tell you sir that unless i am favoured with an interview with miss gauntlet i shall conclude that you have actually laid a constraint upon her inclination for some sinister purposes of your own sir replied the old gentleman you are welcome to make what conclusions shall seem good unto your own imagination but pray be so good as to allow me the privilege of being master in my own house so saying he very complaisantly showed him to the door and our lover being diffident of his own temper as well as afraid of being used with greater indignity in a place where his personal prowess would only serve to heighten his disgrace quitted the house in a transport of rage which he could not wholly suppress telling the landlord that if his age did not protect him he would have chastised him for his insolent behaviour chapter lxxviii he projects a violent scheme in consequence of which he is involved in a most fatiguing adventure which greatly tends towards the augmentation of his chagrin thus debarred of personal communication with his mistress he essayed to retrieve her good graces by the most submissive and pathetic letters which he conveyed by divers artifices to her perusal but reaping no manner of benefit from these endeavours his passion acquired a degree of impatience little inferior to downright frenzy and he determined to run every risk of life fortune and reputation rather than desist from his unjustifiable pursuit indeed his resentment was now as deeply concerned as his love and each of these passions equally turbulent and loud in demanding gratification he kept sentinels continually in pay to give him notice of her outgoings in expectation of finding some opportunity to carry her off but her circumspection entirely frustrated this design for she suspected everything of that sort from a disposition like his and regulated her motions accordingly baffled by her prudence and penetration he altered his plan on pretence of being called to his country house by some affair of importance he departed from london and taking lodgings at a farmers house that stood near the road through which she must have necessarily passed in her return to her mother concealed himself from all intercourse except with his valetdechambre and pipes who had orders to scour the country and reconnoitre every horse coach or carriage that should appear on that highway with a view of intercepting his emilia in her passage he had waited in this ambuscade a whole week when his valet gave him notice that he and his fellowscout had discovered a chaiseandsix driving at full speed towards them upon which they had flapped their hats over their eyes so as they might not be known in case they should be seen and concealed themselves behind a hedge from whence they could perceive in the carriage as it passed a young man plainly dressed with a lady in a mask of the exact size shape and air of emilia and that pipes followed them at a distance while he rode back to communicate this piece of intelligence peregrine would scarce allow him time to conclude his information he ran down to the stable where his horse was kept ready saddled for the purpose and never doubting that the lady in question was his mistress attended by one of her uncles clerks mounted immediately and rode full gallop after the chaise which when he had proceeded about two miles he understood from pipes had put up at a neighbouring inn though his inclination prompted him to enter her apartment without further delay he suffered himself to be dissuaded from taking such a precipitate step by his privy counsellor who observed that it would be impracticable to execute his purpose of conveying her against her will from a public inn that stood in the midst of a populous village which would infallibly rise in her defence he advised him therefore to be in wait for the chaise in some remote and private part of the road where they might accomplish their aim without difficulty or danger in consequence of this admonition our adventurer ordered pipes to reconnoitre the inn that she might not escape another way while he and the valet in order to avoid being seen took a circuit by an unfrequented path and placed themselves in ambush on a spot which they chose for the scene of their achievement here they tarried a full hour without seeing the carriage or hearing from their sentinel so that the youth unable to exert his patience one moment longer left the foreigner in his station and rode back to his faithful lacquey who assured him that the travellers had not yet hove up their anchor or proceeded on their voyage notwithstanding this information pickle began to entertain such alarming suspicions that he could not refrain from advancing to the gate and inquire for the company which had lately arrived in a chaiseandsix the innkeeper who was not at all pleased with the behaviour of those passengers did not think proper to observe the instructions he had received on the contrary he plainly told him that the chaise did not halt but only entered at one door and went out at the other with a view to deceive those who pursued it as he guessed from the words of the gentleman who had earnestly desired that his route might be concealed from any person who should inquire about their motions as for my own peart measter continued this charitable publican i believes as how they are no better than they should be else they wouldnt be in such a deadly fear of being overtaken methinks said i when i saw them in such a woundy pother to be gone oddsheartlikins this must be some london prentice running away with his measters daughter as sure as im a living soul but be he who he will sartain it is a has nothing of the gentleman about en for thof a asked such a favour a never once put hand in pocket or said dog will you drink howsomever that dont argufy in reverence of his being in a hurry and a man may be sometimes a little too judgmatical in his conjectures in all probability this loquacious landlord would have served the travellers effectually had peregrine heard him to an end but this impetuous youth far from listening to the sequel of his observations interrupted him in the beginning of his career by asking eagerly which road they followed and having received the innkeepers directions clapped spurs to his horse commanding pipes to make the valet acquainted with the course that they might attend him with all imaginable despatch by the publicans account of their conduct his former opinion was fully confirmed he plied his steed to the height of his mettle and so much was his imagination engrossed by the prospect of having emilia in his power that he did not perceive the road on which he travelled was quite different from that which led to the habitation of mrs gauntlet the valetdechambre was an utter stranger to that part of the country and as for mr pipes such considerations were altogether foreign to the economy of his reflection ten long miles had our hero rode when his eyes were blessed with the sight of the chaise ascending an hill at the distance of a good league upon which he doubled his diligence in such a manner that he gained upon the carriage every minute and at length approached so near to it that he could discern the lady and her conductor with their heads thrust out at the windows looking back and speaking to the driver alternately as if they earnestly besought him to augment the speed of his cattle being thus as it were in sight of port while he crossed the road his horse happened to plunge into a cartrut with such violence that he was thrown several yards over his head and the beasts shoulder being slipped by the fall he found himself disabled from plucking the fruit which was almost within his reach for he had left his servants at a considerable distance behind him and although they had been at his back and supplied him with another horse they were so indifferently mounted that he could not reasonably expect to overtake the flyers who profited so much by this disaster that the chaise vanished in a moment it may be easily conceived how a young man of his disposition passed his time in this tantalizing situation he ejaculated with great fervency but his prayers were not the effects of resignation he ran back on foot with incredible speed in order to meet his valet whom he unhorsed in a twinkling and taking his seat began to exercise his whip and spurs after having ordered the swiss to follow him on the other gelding and committed the lame hunter to the care of pipes matters being adjusted in this manner our adventurer prosecuted the race with all his might and having made some progress was informed by a countryman that the chaise had struck off into another road and according to his judgment was by that time about three miles ahead though in all probability the horses would not be able to hold out much longer because they seemed to be quite spent when they passed his door encouraged by this intimation peregrine pushed on with great alacrity though he could not regain sight of the desired object till the clouds of night began to deepen and even then he enjoyed nothing more than a transient glimpse for the carriage was no sooner seen than shrouded again from his view these vexatious circumstances animated his endeavours while they irritated his chagrin in short he continued his pursuit till the night was far advanced and himself so uncertain about the object of his care that he entered a solitary inn with a view of obtaining some intelligence when to his infinite joy he perceived the chaise standing by itself and the horses panting in the yard in full confidence of his having arrived at last at the goal of all his wishes he alighted instantaneously and running up to the coachman with a pistol in his hand commanded him in an imperious tone to conduct him to the ladys chamber on pain of death the driver affrighted at this menacing address protested with great humility that he did not know whither his fare had retired for that he himself was paid and dismissed from the service because he would not undertake to drive them all night across the country without stopping to refresh his horses but he promised to go in quest of the waiter who would show him to their apartment he was accordingly detached on that errand while our hero stood sentinel at the gate till the arrival of his valetdechambre who joining him by accident before the coachman returned relieved him in his watch and then the young gentleman exasperated at his messengers delay rushed with fury in his eyes from room to room denouncing vengeance upon the whole family but he did not meet with one living soul until he entered the garret where he found the landlord and his wife in bed this chickenhearted couple by the light of a rush candle that burned on the hearth seeing a stranger burst into the chamber in such a terrible attitude were seized with consternation and exalting their voices in a most lamentable strain begged for the passion of christ that he would spare their lives and take all they had peregrine guessing from this exclamation and the circumstance of their being abed that they mistook him for a robber and were ignorant of that which he wanted to know dispelled their terror by making them acquainted with the cause of his visit and desired the husband to get up with all possible despatch in order to assist and attend him in his search thus reinforced he rummaged every corner of the inn and at last finding the hostler in the stable was by him informed to his unspeakable mortification that the gentleman and lady who arrived in the chaise had immediately hired posthorses for a certain village at the distance of fifteen miles and departed without halting for the least refreshment our adventurer mad with his disappointment mounted his horse in an instant and with his attendant took the same road with full determination to die rather than desist from the prosecution of his design he had by this time rode upwards of thirty miles since three oclock in the afternoon so that the horses were almost quite jaded and travelled this stage so slowly that it was morning before they reached the place of their destination where far from finding the fugitives he understood that no such persons as he described had passed that way and that in all likelihood they had taken a quite contrary direction while in order to mislead him in his pursuit they had amused the hostler with a false route this conjecture was strengthened by his perceiving now for the first time that he had deviated a considerable way from the road through which they must have journeyed in order to arrive at the place of her mothers residence and these suggestions utterly deprived him of the small remains of recollection which he had hitherto retained his eyes rolled about witnessing rage and distraction he foamed at the mouth stamped upon the ground with great violence uttered incoherent imprecations against himself and all mankind and would have sallied forth again he knew not whither upon the same horse which he had already almost killed with fatigue had not his confidant found means to quiet the tumult of his thoughts and recall his reflection by representing the condition of the poor animals and advising him to hire fresh horses and ride post across the country to the village in the neighbourhood of mrs gauntlets habitation where they should infallibly intercept the daughter provided they could get the start of her upon the road peregrine not only relished but forthwith acted in conformity with this good counsel his own horses were committed to the charge of the landlord with directions for pipes in case he should come in quest of his master and a couple of stout geldings being prepared he and his valet took the road again steering their course according to the motions of the postboy who undertook to be their guide they had almost finished the first stage when they descried a postchaise just halting at the inn where they proposed to change horses upon which our adventurer glowing with a most interesting presage put his beast to the full speed and approached near enough to distinguish as the travellers quitted the carriage that he had at last come up with the very individual persons whom he had pursued so long flushed with this discovery he galloped into the yard so suddenly that the lady and her conductor scarce had time to shut themselves up in a chamber to which they retreated with great precipitation so that the pursuer was now certain of having housed his prey that he might however leave nothing to fortune he placed himself upon the stair by which they had ascended to the apartment and sent up his compliments to the young lady desiring the favour of being admitted to her presence otherwise he should be obliged to waive all ceremony and take that liberty which she would not give the servant having conveyed his message through the keyhole returned with an answer importing that she would adhere to the resolution she had taken and perish rather than comply with his will our adventurer without staying to make any rejoinder to this reply ran upstairs and thundering at the door for entrance was given to understand by the nymphs attendant that a blunderbuss was ready primed for his reception and that he would do well to spare him the necessity of shedding blood in defence of a person who had put herself under his protection all the laws of the land said he cannot now untie the knots by which we are bound together and therefore i will guard her as my own property so that you had better desist from your fruitless attempt and thereby consult your own safety for by the god that made me i will discharge my piece upon you as soon as you set your nose within the door and your blood be upon your own head these menaces from a citizens clerk would have been sufficient motives for pickle to storm the breach although they had not been reinforced by that declaration which informed him of emilias having bestowed herself in marriage upon such a contemptible rival this sole consideration added wings to his impetuosity and he applied his foot to the door with such irresistible force as burst it open in an instant entering at the same time with a pistol ready cocked in his hand his antagonist instead of firing his blunderbuss when he saw him approach started back with evident signs of surprise and consternation exclaiming lord jesus sir you are not the man and without doubt are under some mistake with regard to us before peregrine had time to answer this salutation the lady hearing it advanced to him and pulling off a mask discovered a face which he had never seen before the gorgons head according to the fables of antiquity never had a more instantaneous or petrifying effect than that which this countenance produced upon the astonished youth his eyes were fixed upon this unknown object as if they had been attracted by the power of enchantment his feet seemed riveted to the ground and after having stood motionless for the space of a few minutes he dropped down in an apoplexy of disappointment and despair the swiss who had followed him seeing his master in this condition lifted him up and laying him upon a bed in the next room let him blood immediately without hesitation being always provided with a case of lancets against all accidents on the road to this foresight our hero in all probability was indebted for his life by virtue of a very copious evacuation he recovered the use of his senses but the complication of fatigues and violent transports which he had undergone brewed up a dangerous fever in his blood and a physician being called from the next markettown several days elapsed before he would answer for his life chapter lxxix peregrine sends a message to mrs gauntlet who rejects his proposal he repairs to the garrison at length however his constitution overcame his disease though not before it had in a great measure tamed the fury of his disposition and brought him to a serious consideration of his conduct in this humiliation of his spirits he reflected with shame and remorse upon his treachery to the fair the innocent emilia he remembered his former sentiments in her favour as well as the injunctions of his dying uncle he recollected his intimacy with her brother against which he had so basely sinned and revolving all the circumstances of her conduct found it so commendable spirited and noble that he deemed her an object of sufficient dignity to merit his honourable addresses even though his duty had not been concerned in this decision but obligated as he was to make reparation to a worthy family which he had so grossly injured he thought he could not manifest his reformation too soon and whenever he found himself able to hold a pen wrote a letter to mrs gauntlet wherein he acknowledged with many expressions of sorrow and contrition that he had acted a part altogether unbecoming a man of honour and should never enjoy the least tranquility of mind until he should have merited her forgiveness he protested that although his happiness entirely depended upon the determination of emilia he would even renounce all hope of being blessed with her favour if she could point out any other method of making reparation to that amiable young lady but by laying his heart and fortune at her feet and submitting himself to her pleasure during the remaining part of his life he conjured her therefore in the most pathetic manner to pardon him in consideration of his sincere repentance and to use her maternal influence with her daughter so as that he might be permitted to wait upon her with a wedding ring as soon as his health would allow him to undertake the journey this explanation being despatched by pipes who had by this time found his master the young gentleman inquired about the couple whom he had so unfortunately pursued and understood from his valetdechambre who learned the story from their own mouths that the lady was the only daughter of a rich jew and her attendant no other than his apprentice who had converted her to christianity and married her at the same time that this secret having taken air the old israelite had contrived a scheme to separate them for ever and they being apprised of his intention had found means to elope from his house with a view of sheltering themselves in france until the affair could be made up that seeing three men ride after them with such eagerness they never doubted that the pursuers were her father and some friends or domestics and on that supposition had fled with the utmost despatch and trepidation until they had found themselves happily undeceived at that very instant when they expected nothing but mischief and misfortune lastly the swiss gave him to understand that after having professed some concern for his deplorable situation and enjoyed a slight refreshment they had taken their departure for dover and in all likelihood were safely arrived at paris in fourandtwenty hours after pipes was charged with his commission he brought back an answer from the mother of emilia couched in these words sir i received the favour of yours and am glad for your own sake that you have attained a due sense and conviction of your unkind and unchristian behaviour to poor emy i thank god none of my children were ever so insulted before give me leave to tell you sir my daughter was no upstart without friends or education but a young lady as well bred and better born than most private gentlewomen in the kingdom and therefore though you had no esteem for her person you ought to have paid some regard to her family which no disparagement to you sir is more honourable than your own as for your proposal miss gauntlet will not hear of it being that she thinks her honour will not allow her to listen to any terms of reconciliation and she is not yet so destitute as to embrace an offer to which she has the least objection in the meantime she is so much indisposed that she cannot possibly see company so i beg you will not take the trouble of making a fruitless journey to this place perhaps your future conduct may deserve her forgiveness and really as i am concerned for your happiness which you assure me depends upon her condescension i wish with all my heart it may and am notwithstanding all that has happened your sincere wellwisher cecilia gauntlet from this epistle and the information of his messenger our hero learned that his mistress had actually profited by his wildgoose chase so as to make a safe retreat to her mothers house though sorry to hear of her indisposition he was also piqued at her implacability as well as at some stately paragraphs of the letter in which he thought the good lady had consulted her own vanity rather than her good sense these motives of resentment helped him to bear his disappointment like a philosopher especially as he had now quieted his conscience in proffering to redress the injury he had done and moreover found himself with regard to his love in a calm state of hope and resignation a seasonable fit of illness is an excellent medicine for the turbulence of passion such a reformation had the fever produced on the economy of his thoughts that he moralized like an apostle and projected several prudential schemes for his future conduct in the meantime as soon as his health was sufficiently reestablished he took a trip to the garrison in order to visit his friends and learned from hatchways own mouth that he had broke the ice of courtship to his aunt and that his addresses were now fairly afloat though when he first declared himself to the widow after she had been duly prepared for the occasion by her niece and the rest of her friends she had received his proposal with a becoming reserve and piously wept at the remembrance of her husband observing that she should never meet with his fellow peregrine promoted the lieutenants suit with all his influence and all mrs trunnions objections to the match being surmounted it was determined that the day of marriage should be put off for three months that her reputation might not suffer by a precipitate engagement his next care was to give orders for erecting a plain marble monument to the memory of his uncle on which the following inscription composed by the bridegroom actually appeared in golden letters here lies foundered in a fathom and half the shell of hawser trunnion esq formerly commander of a squadron in his majestys service who broached to at five pm oct in the year of his age threescore and nineteen he kept his guns always loaded and his tackle ready mannd and never showed his poop to the enemy except when he took her in tow but his shot being expended his match burnt out and his upper works decayed he was sunk by deaths superior weight of metal nevertheless he will be weighed again at the great day his rigging refitted and his timbers repaired and with one broadside make his adversary strike in his turn chapter lxxx he returns to london and meets with cadwallader who entertains him with many curious particulars crabtree sounds the duchess and undeceives pickle who by an extraordinary accident becomes acquainted with another lady of quality the young gentleman having performed these last offices in honour of his deceased benefactor and presented mr jolter to the longexpected living which at this time happened to be vacant returned to london and resumed his former gaiety not that he was able to shake emilia from his thought or even to remember her without violent emotions for as he recovered his vigour his former impatience recurred and therefore he resolved to plunge himself headlong into some intrigue that might engage his passions and amuse his imagination a man of his accomplishments could not fail to meet with a variety of subjects on which his gallantry would have been properly exercised and this abundance distracted his choice which at any time was apt to be influenced by caprice and whim i have already observed that he had lifted his view through a matrimonial perspective as high as a lady of the first quality and distinction and now that he was refused by miss gauntlet and enjoyed a little respite from the agonies of that flame which her charms had kindled in his heart he renewed his assiduities to her grace though he durst not yet risk an explanation he enjoyed the pleasure of seeing himself so well received in quality of a particular acquaintance that he flattered himself with the belief of his having made some progress in her heart and was confirmed in this conceited notion by the assurances of her woman whom by liberal largesses he retained in his interest because she found means to persuade him that she was in the confidence of her lady but notwithstanding this encouragement and the sanguine suggestions of his own vanity he dreaded the thoughts of exposing himself to her ridicule and resentment by a premature declaration and determined to postpone his addresses until he should be more certified of the probability of succeeding in his attempt while he remained in this hesitation and suspense he was one morning very agreeably surprised with the appearance of his friend crabtree who by the permission of pipes to whom he was well known entered his chamber before he was awake and by a violent shake of the shoulder disengaged him from the arms of sleep the first compliments having mutually passed cadwallader gave him to understand that he had arrived in town overnight in the stagecoach from bath and entertained him with such a ludicrous account of his fellowtravellers that peregrine for the first time since their parting indulged himself in mirth even to the hazard of suffocation crabtree having rehearsed these adventures in such a peculiarity of manner as added infinite ridicule to every circumstance and repeated every scandalous report which had circulated at bath after peregrines departure was informed by the youth that he harboured a design upon the person of such a duchess and in all appearance had no reason to complain of his reception but that he would not venture to declare himself until he should be more ascertained of her sentiments and therefore he begged leave to depend upon the intelligence of his friend cadwallader who he knew was admitted to her parties the misanthrope before he would promise his assistance asked if his prospect verged towards matrimony and our adventurer who guessed the meaning of his question replying in the negative he undertook the office of reconnoitring her inclination protesting at the same time that he would never concern himself in any scheme that did not tend to the disgrace and deception of all the sex on these conditions he espoused the interest of our hero and a plan was immediately concerted in consequence of which they met by accident at her graces table pickle having staid all the forepart of the evening and sat out all the company except the misanthrope and a certain widow lady who was said to be in the secrets of my lady duchess went away on pretence of an indispensable engagement that crabtree might have a proper opportunity of making him the subject of conversation accordingly he had scarce quitted the apartment when this cynic attending him to the door with a look of morose disdain were i an absolute prince said he and that fellow one of my subjects i would order him to be clothed in sackcloth and he should drive my asses to water that his lofty spirit might be lowered to the level of his deserts the pride of a peacock is downright selfdenial when compared with the vanity of that coxcomb which was naturally arrogant but is now rendered altogether intolerable by the reputation he acquired at bath for kicking a bully outwitting a club of raw sharpers and divers other pranks in the execution of which he was more lucky than wise but nothing has contributed so much to the increase of his insolence and selfconceit as the favour he found among the ladies ay the ladies madam i care not who knows it the ladies who to their honour be it spoken never fail to patronize foppery and folly provided they solicit their encouragement and yet this dog was not on the footing of those hermaphroditical animals who may be reckoned among the number of waitingwomen who air your shifts comb your lapdogs examine your noses with magnifying glasses in order to squeeze out the worms clean your toothbrushes sweeten your handkerchiefs and soften waste paper for your occasions this fellow pickle was entertained for more important purposes his turn of duty never came till all those lapwings were gone to roost then he scaled windows leaped over garden walls and was let in by mrs betty in the dark nay the magistrates of bath complimented him with the freedom of the corporation merely because through his means the waters had gained extraordinary credit for every female of a tolerable appearance that went thither on account of her sterility got the better of her complaint during his residence at bath and now the fellow thinks no woman can withstand his addresses he had not been here three minutes when i could perceive with half an eye that he had marked out your grace for a conquest i mean in an honourable way though the rascal has impudence enough to attempt anything so saying he fixed his eyes upon the duchess who while her face glowed with indignation turning to her confidant expressed herself in these words upon my life i believe there is actually some truth in what this old ruffian says i have myself observed that young fellow eyeing me with a very particular stare it is not to be at all wondered at said her friend that a youth of his complexion should be sensible to the charms of your grace but i dare say he would not presume to entertain any but the most honourable and respectful sentiments respectful sentiments cried my lady with a look of ineffable disdain if i thought the fellow had assurance enough to think of me in any shape i protest i would forbid him my house upon my honour such instances of audacity should induce persons of quality to keep your small gentry at a greater distance for they are very apt to grow impudent upon the least countenance or encouragement cadwallader satisfied with this declaration changed the subject of discourse and next day communicated his discovery to his friend pickle who upon this occasion felt the most stinging sensations of mortified pride and resolved to quit his prospect with a good grace nor did the execution of this selfdenying scheme cost him one moments uneasiness for his heart had never been interested in the pursuit and his vanity triumphed in the thoughts of manifesting his indifference accordingly the very next time he visited her grace his behaviour was remarkably frank sprightly and disengaged and the subject of love being artfully introduced by the widow who had been directed to sound his inclinations he rallied the passion with great ease and severity and made no scruple of declaring himself heartwhole though the duchess had resented his supposed affection she was now offended at his insensibility and even signified her disgust by observing that perhaps his attention to his own qualifications screened him from the impression of all other objects while he enjoyed this sarcasm the meaning of which he could plainly discern the company was joined by a certain virtuoso who had gained free access to all the great families of the land by his noble talent of gossiping and buffoonery he was now in the seventyfifth year of his age his birth was so obscure that he scarce knew his fathers name his education suitable to the dignity of his descent his character publicly branded with homicide profligacy and breach of trust yet this man by the happy inheritance of impregnable effrontery and a lucky prostitution of all principle in rendering himself subservient to the appetites of the great had attained to an independency of fortune as well as to such a particular share of favour among the quality that although he was well known to have pimped for three generations of the nobility there was not a lady of fashion in the kingdom who scrupled to admit him to her toilette or even to be squired by him in any place of public entertainment not but that this sage was occasionally useful to his fellowcreatures by these connections with people of fortune for he often undertook to solicit charity in behalf of distressed objects with a view of embezzling onehalf of the benefactions it was an errand of this kind that now brought him to the house of her grace after having sat a few minutes he told the company that he would favour them with a very proper opportunity to extend their benevolence for the relief of a poor gentlewoman who was reduced to the most abject misery by the death of her husband and just delivered of a couple of fine boys they moreover understood from his information that this object was daughter of a good family who had renounced her in consequence of her marrying an ensign without a fortune and even obstructed his promotion with all their influence and power a circumstance of barbarity which had made such an impression upon his mind as disordered his brain and drove him to despair in a fit of which he had made away with himself leaving his wife then big with child to all the horrors of indigence and grief various were the criticisms on this pathetic picture which the old man drew with great expression my lady duchess concluded that she must be a creature void of all feeling and reflection who could survive such aggravated misery therefore did not deserve to be relieved except in the character of a common beggar and was generous enough to offer a recommendation by which she would be admitted into an infirmary to which her grace was a subscriber at the same time advising the solicitor to send the twins to the foundling hospital where they could be carefully nursed and brought up so as to become useful members to the commonwealth another lady with all due deference to the opinion of the duchess was free enough to blame the generosity of her grace which would only serve to encourage children in disobedience to their parents and might be the means not only of prolonging the distress of the wretched creature but also of ruining the constitution of some young heir perhaps the hope of a great family for she did suppose that madam when her month should be up and her brats disposed of would spread her attractions to the public provided she could profit by her person and in the usual way make a regular progress from st jamess to drury lane she apprehended for these reasons that their compassion would be most effectually shown in leaving her to perish in her present necessity and that the old gentleman would be unpardonable should he persist in his endeavours to relieve her a third member of this tenderhearted society after having asked if the young woman was handsome and being answered in the negative allowed that there was a great deal of reason in what had been said by the honourable person who had spoke last nevertheless she humbly conceived her sentence would admit of some mitigation let the bantlings said she be sent to the hospital according to the advice of her grace and a small collection be made for the present support of the mother and when her health is recovered i will take her into my family in quality of an upper servant or medium between me and my woman for upon my life i cant endure to chide or give directions to a creature who is in point of birth and education but one degree above the vulgar this proposal met with universal approbation the duchess to her immortal honour began the contribution with a crown so that the rest of the company were obliged to restrict their liberality to half the sum that her grace might not be affronted and the proposer demanding the poor womans name and place of abode the old mediator could not help giving her ladyship a verbal direction though he was extremely mortified on more accounts than one to find such an issue to his solicitation peregrine who though humorous as winter had a tear for pity and a hand open as day for melting charity was shocked at the nature and result of this ungenerous consultation he contributed his halfcrown however and retiring from the company betook himself to the lodgings of the forlorn lady in the straw according to the direction he had heard upon inquiry he understood that she was then visited by some charitable gentlewoman who had sent for a nurse and waited the return of the messenger and he sent up his respects desiring he might be permitted to see her on pretence of having been intimate with her late husband though the poor woman had never heard of his name she did not think proper to deny his request and he was conducted to a paltry chamber in the third story where he found this unhappy widow sitting upon a trucklebed and suckling one of her infants with the most piteous expression of anguish in her features which were naturally regular and sweet while the other was fondled on the knee of a person whose attention was so much engrossed by her little charge that for the present she could mind nothing else and it was not till after the first compliments passed betwixt the hapless mother and our adventurer that he perceived the strangers countenance which inspired him with the highest esteem and admiration he beheld all the graces of elegance and beauty breathing sentiment and beneficence and softened into the most enchanting tenderness of weeping sympathy when he declared the cause of his visit which was no other than the desire of befriending the distressed lady to whom he presented a banknote for twenty pounds he was favoured with such a look of complacency by this amiable phantom who might have been justly taken for an angel ministering to the necessities of mortals that his whole soul was transported with love and veneration nor was this prepossession diminished by the information of the widow who after having manifested her gratitude in a flood of tears told him that the unknown object of his esteem was a person of honour who having heard by accident of her deplorable situation had immediately obeyed the dictates of her humanity and come in person to relieve her distress that she had not only generously supplied her with money for present sustenance but also undertaken to provide a nurse for her babes and even promised to favour her with protection should she survive her present melancholy situation to these articles of intelligence she added that the name of her benefactress was the celebrated lady to whose character the youth was no stranger though he had never seen her person before the killing edge of her charms was a little blunted by the accidents of time and fortune but no man of taste and imagination whose nerves were not quite chilled with the frost of age could even at that time look upon her with impunity and as peregrine saw her attractions heightened by the tender office in which she was engaged he was smitten with her beauty and so ravished with her compassion that he could not suppress his emotions but applauded her benevolence with all the warmth of enthusiasm her ladyship received his compliments with great politeness and affability and the occasion on which they met being equally interesting to both an acquaintance commenced between them and they concerted measures for the benefit of the widow and her two children one of whom our hero bespoke for his own godson for pickle was not so obscure in the beau monde but that his fame had reached the ears of this lady who therefore did not discourage his advances towards her friendship and esteem all the particulars relating to their charge being adjusted he attended her ladyship to her own house and by her conversation had the pleasure of finding her understanding suitable to her other accomplishments nor had she any reason to think that our heros qualifications had been exaggerated by common report one of their adopted children died before it was baptized so that their care concentred in the other for whom they stood sponsors understanding that the old agent was becoming troublesome in his visits to the mother to whom he now began to administer such counsel as shocked the delicacy of her virtue they removed her into another lodging where she would not be exposed to his machinations in less than a month our hero learned from a nobleman of his acquaintance that the hoary pander had actually engaged to procure for him this poor afflicted gentlewoman and being frustrated in his intention substituted in her room a nymph from the purlieus of covent garden that made his lordship smart severely for the favours she bestowed meanwhile peregrine cultivated his new acquaintance with all his art and assiduity presuming from the circumstances of her reputation and fate as well as on the strength of his own merit that in time he should be able to indulge that passion which had begun to glow within his breast as her ladyship had undergone a vast variety of fortune and adventure which he had heard indistinctly related with numberless errors and misrepresentations he was no sooner entitled by the familiarity of communication to ask such a favour than he earnestly entreated her to entertain him with the particulars of her story and by dint of importunity she was at length prevailed upon in a select party to gratify his curiosity by the account given in the following chapter chapter lxxxi the memoirs of a lady of quality by the circumstances of the story which i am going to relate you will be convinced of my candour while you are informed of my indiscretion you will be enabled i hope to perceive that howsoever my head may have erred my heart hath always been uncorrupted and that i have been unhappy because i loved and was a woman i believe i need not observe that i was the only child of a man of good fortune who indulged me in my infancy with all the tenderness of paternal affection and when i was six years old sent me to a private school where i stayed till my age was doubled and became such a favourite that i was even in those early days carried to all the places of public diversion the court itself not excepted an indulgence that flattered my love of pleasure to which i was naturally addicted and encouraged those ideas of vanity and ambition which spring up so early in the human mind i was lively and goodnatured my imagination apt to run riot my heart liberal and disinterested though i was so obstinately attached to my own opinions that i could not well brook contradiction and in the whole of my disposition resembled that of henry v as described by shakespeare in my thirteenth year i went to bath where i was first introduced into the world as a woman having been entitled to that privilege by my person which was remarkably tall for my years and there my fancy was quite captivated by the variety of diversions in which i was continually engaged not that the parties were altogether new to me but because i now found myself considered as a person of consequence and surrounded by a crowd of admirers who courted my acquaintance and fed my vanity with praise and adulation in short whether or not i deserved their encomiums i leave the world to judge but my person was commended and my talent in dancing met with universal applause no wonder then that everything appeared joyous to a young creature who was so void of experience and dissimulation that she believed everybodys heart as sincere as her own and every object such as it appeared to be among the swains who sighed or pretended to sigh for me were two that bore a pretty equal share of my favour it was too superficial to deserve the name of love one of these was a forward youth of sixteen extremely handsome lively and impudent he attended in quality of page upon the princess amelia who spent that season at bath the other was a scotch nobleman turned of thirty who was graced with a red ribbon and danced particularly well two qualifications of great weight with a girl of my age whose heart was not deeply interested in the cause nevertheless the page prevailed over this formidable rival though our amour went no farther than a little flirting and ceased entirely when i left the place next year however i revisited this agreeable scene and passed my time in the same circle of amusements in which indeed each season at bath is exactly resembled by that which succeeds allowing for the difference of company which is continually varying there i met with the same incense and again had my favourite who was a north briton and captain of foot near forty years of age and a little lame an impediment which i did not discover until it was pointed out by some of my companions who rallied me upon my choice he was always cheerful and very amorous had a good countenance and an excellent understanding possessed a great deal of art and would have persuaded me to marry him had i not been restrained by the authority of my father whose consent was not to be obtained in favour of a man of his fortune at the same time many proposals of marriage were made to my parents but as they came from people whom i did not like i rejected them all being determined to refuse every man who did not make his addresses to myself in person because i had no notion of marrying for anything but love among these formal proposers was a scottish earl whose pretensions were broke off by some difference about settlements and the son of an english baron with whom my father was in treaty when he carried me to town on a visit to a young lady with whom i had been intimate from my infancy she was just delivered of her first son for whom we stood sponsors so that this occasion detained us a whole month during which i went to a ball at court on the queens birthday and there for the first time felt what love and beauty were the second son of duke h who had just returned from his travels was dancing with the princess royal when a young lady came and desired me to go and see a stranger whom all the world admired upon which i followed her into the circle and observed this object of admiration he was dressed in a coat of white cloth faced with blue satin embroidered with silver of the same piece with his waistcoat his fine hair hung down his back in ringlets below his waist his hat was laced with silver and garnished with a white feather but his person beggared description he was tall and graceful neither corpulent nor meagre his limbs finely proportioned his countenance open and majestic his eyes full of sweetness and vivacity his teeth regular and his pouting lips of the complexion of the damask rose in short he was formed for love and inspired it wherever he appeared nor was he a niggard of his talents but liberally returned it at least what passed for such for he had a flow of gallantry for which many ladies of this land can vouch from their own experience but he exclaimed against marriage because he had as yet met with no woman to whose charms he would surrender his liberty though a princess of france and lady of the same rank in were said to be at that time enamoured of his person i went home totally engrossed by his idea flattering myself that he had observed me with some attention for i was young and new and had the good fortune to attract the notice and approbation of the queen herself next day being at the opera i was agreeably surprised with the appearance of this amiable stranger who no sooner saw me enter than he approached so near to the place where i sat that i overheard what he said to his companions and was so happy as to find myself the object of his discourse which abounded with rapturous expressions of love and admiration i could not listen to these transports without emotion my colour changed my heart throbbed with unusual violence and my eyes betrayed my inclination in sundry favourable glances which he seemed to interpret aright though he could not then avail himself of his success so far as to communicate his sentiments by speech because we were strangers to each other i passed that night in the most anxious suspense and several days elapsed before i saw him again at length however being at court on a ballnight and determined against dancing i perceived him among the crowd and to my unspeakable joy saw him advance with my lord p who introduced him to my acquaintance he soon found means to alter my resolution and i condescended to be his partner all the evening during which he declared his passion in the most tender and persuasive terms that real love could dictate or fruitful imagination invent i believed his protestations because i wished them true and was an unexperienced girl of fifteen i complied with his earnest request of being permitted to visit me and even invited him to breakfast next morning so that you may imagine i speak to those that feel i did not that night enjoy much repose such was the hurry and flutter of my spirits that i rose at six to receive him at ten i dressed myself in a new pink satin gown and my best laced nightclothes and was so animated by the occasion that if ever i deserved a compliment upon my looks it was my due at this meeting the wishedfor moment came that brought my lover to my view i was overwhelmed with joy modesty and fear of i knew not what we sat down to breakfast but did not eat he renewed his addresses with irresistible eloquence and pressed me to accept of his hand without further hesitation but to such a precipitate step i objected as a measure repugnant to my decency as well as to that duty which i owed to my father whom i tenderly loved though i withstood this premature proposal i did not attempt to disguise the situation of my thoughts and thus commenced a tender correspondence which was maintained by letters while i remained in the country and carried on when i was in town by private interviews twice or thrice a week at the house of my milliner where such endearments passed as refined and happy lovers know and others can only guess truth and innocence prevailed on my side while his heart was fraught with sincerity and love such frequent intercourse created an intimacy which i began to think dangerous and therefore yielded to his repeated desire that we might be united for ever nay i resolved to avoid him until the day should be fixed and very innocently though not very wisely told him my reason for this determination which was no other than a consciousness of my incapacity to refuse him anything he should demand as a testimony of my love the time was accordingly appointed at the distance of a few days during which i intended to have implored my fathers consent though i had but faint hopes of obtaining it but he was by some means or other apprised of our design before i could prevail upon myself to make him acquainted with our purpose i had danced with my lover at the ridotto on the preceding evening and there perhaps our eyes betrayed us certain it is several of lord w s relations who disapproved of the match came up and rallied him on his passion lord s k in particular used this remarkable expression nephew as much love as you please but no matrimony next day the priest being prepared and the bridegroom waiting for me at the appointed place in all the transports of impatient expectation i was without any previous warning carried into the country by my father who took no notice of the intelligence he had received but decoyed me into the coach on pretence of taking the air and when we had proceeded as far as turnham green gave me to understand that he would dine in that place there was no remedy i was obliged to bear my disappointment though with an aching heart and followed him upstairs into an apartment where he told me he was minutely informed of my matrimonial scheme i did not attempt to disguise the truth but assured him while the tears gushed from my eyes that my want of courage alone had hindered me from making him privy to my passion though i owned i should have married lord w even though he had disapproved of my choice i reminded him of the uneasy life i led at home and frankly acknowledged that i loved my admirer too well to live without him though if he would favour me with his consent i would defer my intention and punctually observe any day he would fix for our nuptials meanwhile i begged he would permit me to send a message to lord w who was waiting in expectation of my coming and might without such notice imagine i was playing the jilt he granted this last request in consequence of which i sent a letter to my lover who when he received it had almost fainted away believing i should be locked up in the country and snatched for ever from his arms tortured with these apprehensions he changed clothes immediately and taking horse resolved to follow me whithersoever we should go after dinner we proceeded as far as brentford where we lay intending to be at my fathers country house next night and my admirer putting up at the same inn practised every expedient his invention could suggest to procure an interview but all his endeavours were unsuccessful because i who little dreamed of his being so near had gone to bed upon our first arrival overwhelmed with affliction and tears in the morning i threw myself at my fathers feet and conjured him by all the ties of paternal affection to indulge me with an opportunity of seeing my admirer once more before i should be conveyed from his wishes the melancholy condition in which i preferred this supplication melted the tender heart of my parent who yielded to my supplications and carried me back to town for that purpose lord w who had watched our motions and arrived at his own lodgings before we arrived at my fathers house obeyed my summons on the instant and appeared before me like an angel our faculties were for some minutes suspended by a conflict of grief and joy at length i recovered the use of speech and gave him to understand that i was come to town in order to take my leave of him by the permission of my father whom i had promised to attend into the country next day before he would consent to my return the chief cause and pretence of which was my earnest desire to convince him that i was not to blame for the disappointment he had suffered and that i should see him again in a month when the nuptial knot should be tied in spite of all opposition my lover who was better acquainted with the world had wellnigh run distracted with this information he swore he would not leave me until i should promise to meet and marry him next day or if i refused to grant that request he would immediately leave the kingdom to which he would never more return and before his departure sacrifice lord h b son to the duke of s a who was the only person upon earth who could have betrayed us to my father because he alone was trusted with the secret of our intended marriage and had actually undertaken to give me away an office which he afterwards declined lord w also affirmed that my father decoyed me into the country with a view of cooping me up and sequestering me entirely from his view and correspondence in vain i pleaded my fathers wellknown tenderness and used all the arguments i could recollect to divert him from his revenge upon lord h he was deaf to all my representations and nothing i found would prevail upon him to suppress his resentment but a positive promise to comply with his former desire i told him i would hazard everything to make him happy but could not with any regard to my duty take such a step without the knowledge of my parent or if i were so inclined it would be impracticable to elude his vigilance and suspicion however he employed such pathetic remonstrances and retained such a powerful advocate within my own breast that before we parted i assured him my whole power should be exerted for his satisfaction and he signified his resolution of sitting up all night in expectation of seeing me at his lodgings he had no sooner retired than i went into the next room and desired my father to fix a day for the marriage in which case i would cheerfully wait upon him into the country whereas should he deny my request on pretence of staying for the consent of my mothers relations which was very uncertain i would seize the first opportunity of marrying lord w cost what it would he consented to the match but would not appoint a day for the ceremony which he proposed to defer until all parties should be agreed and such a favourable crisis i feared would never happen i therefore resolved within myself to gratify my lovers expectation by eloping if possible that very night though the execution of this plan was extremely difficult because my father was upon the alarm and my own maid who was my bedfellow altogether in his interest notwithstanding these considerations i found means to engage one of the housemaids in my behalf who bespoke a hackneycoach to be kept in waiting all night and to bed i went with my abigail whom as i had not closed an eye i waked about five in the morning and sent to pack up some things for our intended journey while she was thus employed i got up and huddled on my clothes standing upon my pillow lest my father who lay in the chamber below should hear me afoot and suspect my design having dressed myself with great despatch and disorder i flounced downstairs stalking as heavily as i could tread that he might mistake me for one of the servants and my confederate opening the door i sallied out into the street though i knew not which way to turn and to my unspeakable mortification neither coach nor chair appeared having travelled on foot a good way in hope of finding a convenience and being not only disappointed in that particular but also bewildered in my peregrination i began to be exceedingly alarmed with the apprehension of being met by some person who might know me because in that case my design would undoubtedly have been discovered from every circumstance of my appearance at that time of day for i had put on the very clothes which i had pulled off overnight so that my dress was altogether odd and peculiar my shoes were very fine and over a large hoop i wore a pink satin quilted petticoat trimmed with silver which was partly covered by a white dimity nightgown a full quarter of a yard too short my handkerchief and apron were hurried on without pinning my nightcap could not contain my hair which hung about my ears in great disorder and my countenance denoted a mixture of hope and fear joy and shame in this dilemma i made my addresses to that honourable member of society a shoeblack whom i earnestly entreated to provide me with a coach or chair promising to reward him liberally for his trouble but he having the misfortune to be lame was unable to keep up with my pace so that by his advice and direction i went into the first publichouse i found open where i stayed some time in the utmost consternation among a crew of wretches whom i thought proper to bribe for their civility not without the terror of being stripped at length however my messenger returned with a chair of which i took immediate possession and fearing that by this time my family would be alarmed and send directly to lord w s lodgings i ordered myself to be carried thither backwards that so i might pass undiscovered this stratagem succeeded according to my wish i ran upstairs in a state of trepidation to my faithful lover who waited for me with the most impatient and fearful suspense at sight of me his eyes lightened with transport he caught me in his arms as the richest present heaven could bestow gave me to understand that my father had already sent to his lodgings in quest of me then applauding my love and resolution in the most rapturous terms he ordered a hackneycoach to be called and that we might run no risk of separation attended me to church where we were lawfully joined in the sight of heaven his fears were then all over but mine recurred with double aggravation i dreaded the sight of my father and shared all the sorrow he suffered on account of my undutiful behaviour for i loved him with such piety of affection that i would have endured every other species of distress rather than given him the least uneasiness but love where he reigns in full empire is altogether irresistible surmounts every difficulty and swallows up all other considerations this was the case with me and now the irrevocable step was taken my first care was to avoid his sight with this view i begged that lord w would think of some remote place in the country to which we might retire for the present and he forthwith conducted me to a house on blackheath where we were very civilly received by a laughterloving dame who seemed to mistake me for one of her own sisterhood i no sooner perceived her opinion than i desired lord w to undeceive her upon which she was made acquainted with the nature of my situation and showed us into a private room where i called for pen and paper and wrote an apology to my father for having acted contrary to his will in so important a concern this task being performed the bridegroom gave me to understand that there was a necessity for our being bedded immediately in order to render the marriage binding lest my father should discover and part us before consummation i pleaded hard for a respite till the evening objecting to the indecency of going to bed before noon but he found means to invalidate all my arguments and to convince me that it was now my duty to obey rather than hazard the imputation of being obstinate and refractory on the first day of my probation i suffered myself to be led into a chamber which was darkened by my express stipulation that my shame and confusion might be the better concealed and yielded to the privilege of a dear husband who loved me to adoration about five oclock in the afternoon we were called to dinner which we had ordered to be ready at four but such a paltry care had been forgot amidst the transports of our mutual bliss we got up however and when we came downstairs i was ashamed to see the light of day or meet the eyes of my beloved lord i ate little said less was happy though overwhelmed with confusion underwent a thousand agitations some of which were painful but by far the greater part belonged to rapture and delight we were imparadised in the gratification of our mutual wishes and felt all that love can bestow and sensibility enjoy in the twilight we returned to lord w s lodgings in town where i received a letter from my father importing that he would never see me again but there was one circumstance in his manner of writing from which i conceived a happy presage of his future indulgence he had begun with his usual appellation of dear fanny which though it was expunged to make way for the word madam encouraged me to hope that his paternal fondness was not yet extinguished at supper we were visited by lord w s younger sister who laughed at us for our inconsiderate match though she owned she envied our happiness and offered me the use of her clothes until i could retrieve my own she was a woman of a great deal of humour plain but genteel civil friendly and perfectly well bred she favoured us with her company till the night was pretty far advanced and did not take her leave till we retired to our apartment as our lodgings were not spacious or magnificent we resolved to see little company but this resolution was frustrated by the numerous acquaintance of lord w who let in half the town so that i ran the gauntlet for a whole week among a set of wits who always delight in teasing a young creature of any note when she happens to make such a stolen match among those that visited us upon this occasion was my lords younger brother who was at that time in keeping with a rich heiress of masculine memory and took that opportunity of making a parade with his equipage which was indeed very magnificent but altogether disregarded by us whose happiness consisted in the opulence of mutual love this ceremony of receiving visits being performed we went to wait on his mother the duchess of h who hearing i was an heiress readily forgave her son for marrying without her knowledge and consent and favoured us with a very cordial reception insomuch that for several months we dined almost constantly at her table and i must own i always found her unaltered in her civility and affection contrary to her general character which was haughty and capricious she was undoubtedly a woman of great spirit and understanding but subject to an infirmity which very much impairs and disguises every other qualification in about three weeks after our marriage i was so happy as to obtain the forgiveness of my father to whose house we repaired in order to pay our respects and submission at sight of me he wept nor did i behold his tears unmoved my heart was overcharged with tenderness and sorrow for having offended such an indulgent parent so that i mingled my tears with his while my dear husband whose soul was of the softest and gentlest mould melted with sympathy at the affecting scene being thus reconciled to my father we attended him into the country where we were received by my mother who was a sensible good woman though not susceptible to love and therefore less apt to excuse a weakness to which she was an utter stranger this was likewise the case with an uncle from whom i had great expectations he was a plain goodnatured man and treated us with great courtesy though his notions in point of love were not exactly conformable to ours nevertheless i was and seemed to be so happy in my choice that my family not only became satisfied with the match but exceedingly fond of lord w after a short stay with them in the country we returned to london in order to be introduced at court and then set out for the north on a visit to my brotherinlaw the duke of h who had by a letter to lord w invited us to his habitation my father accordingly equipped us with horses and money for our own finances were extremely slender consisting only of a small pension allowed by his grace upon whom the brothers were entirely dependent the father having died suddenly before suitable provision could be made for his younger children when i took leave of my relations bidding adieu to my paternal home and found myself launching into a world of care and trouble though the voyage on which i embarked was altogether voluntary and my companion the person on whom i doted to distraction i could not help feeling some melancholy sensations which however in a little time gave way to a train of more agreeable ideas i was visited in town by almost all the women of fashion many of whom i perceived envied me the possession of a man who had made strange havoc among their hearts and some of them knew the value of his favour one in particular endeavoured to cultivate my friendship with singular marks of regard but i thought proper to discourage her advances by keeping within the bounds of bare civility and indeed to none of them was i lavish of my complaisance for i dedicated my whole time to the object of my affection who engrossed my wishes to such a degree that although i was never jealous because i had no reason to be so i envied the happiness of every woman whom he chanced at any time to hand into a coach the duchess of who was newly married to the earl of p a particular friend of lord w s carried me to court and presented me to the queen who expressed her approbation of my person in very particular terms and observing the satisfaction that appeared in my countenance with marks of admiration desired her ladies to take notice how little happiness depended upon wealth since there was more joy in my face than in all her court besides such a declaration could not fail to overwhelm me with blushes which her majesty seemed to behold with pleasure for she frequently repeated the remark and showed me to all the foreigners of distinction with many gracious expressions of favour she wished lord w happiness instead of joy and was pleased to promise that she would provide for her pretty beggars and poor enough we certainly were in every article but love nevertheless we felt no necessities but passed the summer in a variety of pleasures and parties the greatest part of which were planned by lord w s sister and another lady who was at that time mistress to the prime minister the first was a wit but homely in person the other a woman of great beauty and masculine understanding and a particular friendship subsisted between them though they were both lovers of power and admiration this lady who sat at the helm was extremely elegant as well as expensive in her diversions in many of which we bore a share particularly in her parties upon the water which were contrived in all the magnificence of taste in the course of these amusements a trifling circumstance occurred which i shall relate as an instance of that jealous sensibility which characterised lord w s disposition a large company of ladies and gentlemen having agreed to dine at vauxhall and sup at marblehall where we proposed to conclude the evening with a dance one barge being insufficient to contain the whole company we were divided by lots in consequence of which my husband and i were parted this separation was equally mortifying to us both who though married were still lovers and my chagrin increased when i perceived that i was doomed to sit by sir w y a man of professed gallantry for although lord w had before his marriage made his addresses to every woman he saw i knew very well he did not desire that any person should make love to his wife that i might not therefore give umbrage by talking to this gallant i conversed with a scotch nobleman who according to common report had formerly sighed among my admirers by these means in seeking to avoid one error i unwittingly plunged myself into a greater and disobliged lord w so much that he could not conceal his displeasure nay so deeply was he offended at my conduct that in the evening when the ball began he would scarce deign to take me by the hand in the course of dancing and darted such unkind looks as pierced me to the very soul what augmented my concern was my ignorance of the trespass i had committed i was tortured with a thousand uneasy reflections i began to fear that i had mistaken his temper and given my heart to a man who was tired of possession though i resolved to bear without complaining the misfortune i had entailed upon myself i seized the first opportunity of speaking to him and thereby discovered the cause of his chagrin but as there was no time for expostulation the misunderstanding continued on his side with such evident marks of uneasiness that every individual of the company made up to me and inquired about the cause of his disorder so that i was fain to amuse their concern by saying that he had been ill the day before and dancing did not agree with his constitution so much was he incensed by this unhappy circumstance of my conduct which was void of all intention to offend him that he determined to be revenged on me for my indiscretion and at supper chancing to sit between two very handsome ladies one of whom is lately dead and the other at present my neighbour in the country he affected an air of gaiety and openly coquetted with them both this was not the only punishment he inflicted on his innocent wife in the course of our entertainment we engaged in some simple diversion in consequence of which the gentlemen were ordered to salute the ladies when lord w in performing this command unkindly neglected me in my turn i had occasion for all my discretion and pride to conceal from the company the agonies i felt at this mark of indifference and disrespect however i obtained the victory over myself and pretended to laugh at his husbandlike behaviour while the tears stood in my eyes and my heart swelled even to bursting we broke up about five after having spent the most tedious evening i had ever known and this offended lover went to bed in a state of sullen silence and disgust whatever desire i had to come to an explanation i thought myself so much aggrieved by his unreasonable prejudice that i could not prevail upon myself to demand a conference till after his first nap when my pride giving way to my tenderness i clasped him in my arms though he pretended to discourage these advances of my love i asked how he could be so unjust as to take umbrage at my civility to a man whom he knew i had refused for his sake i chid him for his barbarous endeavours to awake my jealousy and used such irresistible arguments in my own vindication that he was convinced of my innocence scaled my acquittal with a kind embrace and we mutually enjoyed the soft transports of a fond reconciliation never was passion more eager delicate or unreserved than that which glowed within our breasts far from being cloyed with the possession of each other our raptures seemed to increase with the term of our union when we were separated though but for a few hours by the necessary avocations of life we were unhappy during that brief separation and met again like lovers who knew no joy but in one anothers presence how many delicious evenings did we spend together in our little apartment after we had ordered the candles to be taken away that we might enjoy the agreeable reflection of the moon in a fine summers evening such a mild and solemn scene naturally disposes the mind to peace and benevolence but when improved with conversation of the man one loves it fills the imagination with ideas of ineffable delight for my own part i can safely say my heart was so wholly engrossed by my husband that i never took pleasure in any diversion where he was not personally concerned nor was i ever guilty of one thought repugnant to my duty and my love in the autumn we set out for the north and were met on the road by the duke and twenty gentlemen who conducted us to h n where we lived in all imaginable splendour his grace at that time maintained above a hundred servants with a band of music which always performed at dinner kept open table and was visited by a great deal of company the economy of his house was superintended by his eldest sister a beautiful young lady of an amiable temper with whom i soon contracted an intimate friendship she and the duke used to rally me upon my fondness for lord w who was a sort of humourist and apt to be in a pet in which case he would leave the company and go to bed by seven oclock in the evening on these occasions i always disappeared giving up every consideration to that of pleasing my husband notwithstanding the ridicule of his relations who taxed me with having spoiled him with too much indulgence but how could i express too much tenderness and condescension for a man who doted upon me to such excess that when business obliged him to leave me he always snatched the first opportunity to return and often rode through darkness storms and tempests to my arms having stayed about seven months in this place i found myself in a fair way of being a mother and that i might be near my own relations in such an interesting situation i and my dear companion departed from h n not without great reluctance for i was fond of the scots in general who treated me with great hospitality and respect and to this day they paid me the compliment of saying i was one of the best wives in that country which is so justly celebrated for good women lord w having attended me to my fathers house was obliged to return to scotland to support his interest in being elected member of parliament so that he took his leave of me with a full resolution of seeing me again before the time of my lyingin and all the comfort i enjoyed in his absence was the perusal of his letters which i punctually received together with those of his sister who from time to time favoured me with assurances of his constancy and devotion indeed these testimonials were necessary to one of my disposition for i was none of those who could be contented with half a heart i could not even spare one complacent look to any other woman but expected the undivided homage of his love had i been disappointed in this expectation i should though a wife have rebelled or died meanwhile my parents treated me with great tenderness intending that lord w should be settled in a house of his own and accommodated with my fortune and his expectations from the queen were very sanguine when i was taken ill and delivered of a dead child an event which affected me extremely when i understood the extent of my misfortune my heart throbbed with such violence that my breast could scarce contain it and my anxiety being aggravated by the absence of my lord produced a dangerous fever of which he was no sooner apprised by letter than he came post from scotland but before his arrival i was supposed to be in a fair way during this journey he was tortured with all that terrible suspense which prevails in the minds of those who are in danger of losing that which is most dear to them and when he entered the house was so much overwhelmed with apprehension that he durst not inquire about the state of my health as for my part i never closed an eye from the time on which i expected his return and when i heard his voice i threw open my curtains and sat up in the bed to receive him though at the hazard of my life he ran towards me with all the eagerness of passion and clasped me in his arms he kneeled by the bedside and kissed my hand a thousand times and wept with transports of tenderness and joy in short this meeting was so pathetic as to overcome my enfeebled constitution and we were parted by those who were wiser than ourselves and saw that nothing was so proper for us as a little repose but how shall i relate the deplorable transition from envied happiness to excess of misery which i now sustained my month was hardly up when my dear husband was taken ill perhaps the fatigue of body as well as mind which he had undergone on my account occasioned a fatal ferment in his blood and his health fell a sacrifice to his love physicians were called from london but alas they brought no hopes of his recovery by their advice he was removed to town for the convenience of being punctually attended every moment was too precious to be thrown away he was therefore immediately put into the coach though the day was far spent and i though exceedingly weak accompanied him in the journey which was performed by the light of flambeaus and rendered unspeakingly shocking by the dismal apprehension of losing him every moment at length however we arrived at our lodgings in pall mall where i lay by him on the floor and attended the issue of his distemper in all the agonies of horror and despair in a little time his malady settled upon his brain and in his delirium he uttered such dreadful exclamations as were sufficient to pierce the most savage heart what effect then must they have had on mine which was fraught with every sentiment of the most melting affection it was not a common grief that took possession of my soul i felt all the aggravation of the most acute distress i sometimes ran down the street in a fit of distraction i sent for the doctors every minute i wearied heaven with my prayers even now my heart aches at the remembrance of what i suffered and i cannot without trembling proceed with the woeful story after having lain insensible some days he recovered the use of speech and called upon my name which he had a thousand times repeated while he was bereft of reason all hopes of his life were now relinquished and i was led to his bedside to receive his last adieus being directed to summon all my fortitude and suppress my sorrow that he might not be disturbed by my agitation i collected all my resolution to support me in this affecting scene i saw my dear lord in extremity the beauties of his youth were all decayed yet his eyes though languid retained unspeakable sweetness and expression he felt his end approaching put forth his hand and with a look full of complacency and benevolence uttered such a tender tale good heaven how had i deserved such accumulated affliction the bare remembrance of which now melts me into tears human nature could not undergo my situation without suffering an ecstasy of grief i clasped him in my arms and kissed him a thousand times with the most violent emotions of woe but i was torn from his embrace and in a little time he was ravished for ever from my view on that fatal morning which put a period to his life i saw the duchess of l approach my bed and from her appearance concluded that he was no more yet i begged she would not confirm the unhappy presage by announcing his death and she accordingly preserved the most emphatic silence i got up and trod softly over his head as if i had been afraid of interrupting his repose alas he was no longer sensible of such disturbance i was seized with a stupefaction of sorrow i threw up the window and looking around thought the sun shone with the most dismal aspect everything was solitary cheerless and replete with horror in this condition i was by the direction of my friend conveyed to her house where my faculties were so overpowered by the load of anguish which oppressed me that i know not what passed during the first days of my unhappy widowhood this only i know the kind duchess treated me with all imaginable care and compassion and carried me to her country house where i stayed some months during which she endeavoured to comfort me with all the amusements she could invent and laid me under such obligations as shall never be erased from my remembrance yet notwithstanding all her care and concern i was by my excess of grief plunged into a languishing distemper for which my physicians advised me to drink the bath waters in compliance with this prescription i went thither towards the end of summer and found some benefit by adhering to their directions though i seldom went abroad except when i visited my sisterinlaw who was there with the princess and upon these occasions i never failed to attract the notice of the company who were struck with the appearance of such a young creature in weeds nor was i free from the persecution of professed admirers but being dead to all joy i was deaf to the voice of adulation about christmas i repaired to my fathers house where my sorrows were revived by every object that recalled the idea of my dear lamented lord but these melancholy reflections i was obliged to bear because i had no other home or habitation being left an unprovided widow altogether dependent on the affection of my own family during this winter divers overtures were made to my father by people who demanded me in marriage but my heart was not yet sufficiently weaned from my former passion to admit the thoughts of another master among those that presented their proposals was a certain young nobleman who upon the first news of lord w s death came post from paris in order to declare his passion he made his first appearance in a hired chariotandsix accompanied by a big fat fellow whom as i afterwards learned he had engaged to sound his praises with a promise of a thousand pounds in lieu of which he paid him forty whether it was with a view of screening himself from the cold or of making a comfortable medium in case of being overturned and falling under his weighty companion i know not but certain it is the carriage was stuffed with hay in such a manner that when he arrived the servants were at some pains in rummaging and removing it before they could come at their master or help him to alight when he was lifted out of the chariot he exhibited a very ludicrous figure to the view he was a thin meagre shivering creature of a low stature with little black eyes a long nose sallow complexion and pitted with the smallpox dressed in a coat of light brown frieze lined with pinkcoloured shag a monstrous solitaire and bag and if i remember right a pair of huge jackboots in a word his whole appearance was so little calculated for inspiring love that i had on the strength of seeing him once before at oxford set him down as the last man on earth whom i would choose to wed and i will venture to affirm that he was in every particular the reverse of my late husband as my father was not at home he stayed but one evening and left his errand with my mother to whom he was as disagreeable as to myself so that his proposal was absolutely rejected and i heard no more of him during the space of three whole months at the expiration of which i went to town where this mortifying figure presented itself again and renewed his suit offering such advantageous terms of settlement that my father began to relish the match and warmly recommended it to my consideration lord w s relations advised me to embrace the opportunity of making myself independent all my acquaintance plied me with arguments to the same purpose i was uneasy at home and indifferent to all mankind i weighed the motives with the objections and with reluctance yielded to the importunity of my friends in consequence of this determination the little gentleman was permitted to visit me and the manner of his address did not alter the opinion i had conceived of his character and understanding i was even shocked at the prospect of marrying a man whom i could not love and in order to disburden my own conscience took an opportunity of telling him one evening as we sat opposite to each other that it was not in my power to command my affection and therefore he could not expect the possession of my heart lord w s indulgence having spoiled me for a wife nevertheless i would endeavour to contract a friendship for him which would entirely depend upon his own behaviour to this declaration he replied to my great surprise that he did not desire me to love him my friendship was sufficient and next day repeated this strange instance of moderation in a letter which i communicated to my sister who laughed heartily at the contents and persuaded me that since i could love no man he was the properest person to be my husband accordingly the wedding clothes and equipage being prepared the day the fatal day was fixed on the morning of which i went to the house of my brotherinlaw duke h who loved me tenderly and took my leave of the family a family which i shall always remember with love honour and esteem his grace received me in the most affectionate manner saying at parting lady w if he does not use you well i will take you back again the bridegroom and i met at ox chapel where the ceremony was performed by the bishop of w in presence of his lordships mother my father and another lady the nuptial knot being tied we set out for my fathers house in the country and proceeded full twenty miles on our journey before my lord opened his mouth my thoughts having been all that time employed on something quite foreign to my present situation for i was then but a giddy girl of eighteen at length my father broke silence and clapping his lordship on the shoulder told him he was but a dull bridegroom upon which my lord gave him to understand that he was out of spirits this dejection continued all the day notwithstanding the refreshment of a plentiful dinner which he ate upon the road and in the evening we arrived at the place of our destination where we were kindly received by my mother though she had no liking to the match and after supper we retired to our apartment it was here that i had occasion to perceive the most disagreeable contrast between my present helpmate and my former lord instead of flying to my arms with all the eagerness of love and rapture this manly representative sat moping in a corner like a criminal on execution day and owned he was ashamed to bed with a woman whose hand he had scarce ever touched i could not help being affected with this pusillanimous behaviour i remembered lord w while i surveyed the object before me and made such a comparison as filled me with horror and disgust nay to such a degree did my aversion to this phantom prevail that i began to sweat with anguish at the thought of being subjected to his pleasure and when after a long hesitation he ventured to approach me i trembled as if i had been exposed to the embraces of a rattlesnake nor did the efforts of his love diminish this antipathy his attempts were like the pawings of an imp sent from hell to seize and torment some guilty wretch such as are exhibited in some dramatic performance which i have never seen acted without remembering my weddingnight by such shadowy unsubstantial vexatious behaviour was i tantalized and robbed of my repose and early next morning i got up with a most sovereign contempt for my bedfellow who indulged himself in bed till eleven having passed a few days in this place i went home with him to his house at twickenham and soon after we were presented at court when the queen was pleased to say to my lords mother she did not doubt that we should be a happy couple for i had been a good wife to my former husband whatever deficiencies i had to complain of in my new spouse he was not wanting in point of liberality i was presented with a very fine chariot studded with silver nails and such a profusion of jewels as furnished a joke to some of my acquaintance who observed that i was formerly queen of hearts but now metamorphosed into the queen of diamonds i now also had an opportunity which i did not let slip of paying lord w s debts from my privy purse and on that score received the thanks of his elder brother who though he had undertaken to discharge them delayed the execution of his purpose longer than i thought they should remain unpaid this uncommon splendour attracted the eyes and envy of my competitors who were the more implacable in their resentments because notwithstanding my marriage i was as much as ever followed by the men of gallantry and pleasure among whom it is a constant maxim that a woman never withholds her affections from her husband without an intention to bestow them somewhere else i never appeared without a train of admirers and my house in the country was always crowded with gay young men of quality among those who cultivated my good graces with the greatest skill and assiduity were the earl c and mr s brother to lord f the former of whom in the course of his addresses treated me with an entertainment of surprising magnificence disposed into a dinner supper and ball to which i at his desire invited eleven ladies whom he paired with the like number of his own sex so that the whole company amounted to twentyfour we were regaled with a most elegant dinner in an apartment which was altogether superb and served by gentlemen only no livery servant being permitted to come within the door in the afternoon we embarked in two splendid barges being attended by a band of music in a third and enjoyed a delightful evening upon the river till the twilight when we returned and began the ball which was conducted with such order and taste that mirth and goodhumour prevailed no dissatisfaction appeared except in the countenance of one old maid since married to a son of the duke of who though she would not refuse to partake of such an agreeable entertainment was displeased that i should have the honour of inviting her o baleful envy thou selftormenting fiend how dost thou predominate in all assemblies from the grand gala of a court to the meeting of simple peasants at their harvesthome nor is the prevalence of this sordid passion to be wondered at if we consider the weakness pride and vanity of our sex the presence of one favourite man shall poison the enjoyment of a whole company and produce the most rancorous enmity betwixt the closest friends i danced with the master of the ball who employed all the artillery of his eloquence in making love yet i did not listen to his addresses for he was not to my taste though he possessed an agreeable person and a good acquired understanding but he was utterly ignorant of that gentle prevailing art which i afterwards experienced in mr s and which was the only method he could have successfully practised in seducing a young woman like me born with sentiments of honour and trained up in the paths of religion and virtue this young gentleman was indeed absolutely master of those insinuating qualifications which few women of passion and sensibility can resist and had a person every way adapted for profiting by these insidious talents he was well acquainted with the human heart conscious of his own power and capacity and exercised these endowments with unwearied perseverance he was tall and thin of a shape and size perfectly agreeable to my taste with large blue eloquent eyes good teeth and a long head turned to gallantry his behaviour was the standard of politeness and all his advances were conducted with the most profound respect which is the most effectual expedient a man can use against us if he can find means to persuade us that it proceeds from the excess and delicacy of his passion it is no other than a silent compliment by which our accomplishments are continually flattered and pleases in proportion to the supposed understanding of him who pays it by these arts and advantages this consummate politician in love began by degrees to sap the foundation of my conjugal faith he stole imperceptibly into my affection and by dint of opportunity which he well knew how to improve triumphed at last over all his rivals nor was he the only person that disputed my heart with earl c that nobleman was also rivalled by lord c h a scotchman who had been an intimate and relation of my former husband him i would have preferred to most of his competitors and actually coquetted with him for some time but the amour was interrupted by his going to ireland upon which occasion understanding that he was but indifferently provided with money i made him a present of a gold snuffbox in which was enclosed a banknote a trifling mark of my esteem which he afterwards justified by the most grateful friendly and genteel behaviour and as we corresponded by letters i frankly told him that mr s had stepped in and won the palm from all the rest of my admirers this new favourites mother and sister who lived in the neighbourhood were my constant companions and in consequence of this intimacy he never let a day pass without paying his respects to me in person nay so ingenious was he in contriving the means of promoting his suit that whether i rode or walked went abroad or stayed at home he was always of course one of the party so that his design seemed to engross his whole vigilance and attention thus he studied my disposition and established himself in my good opinion at the same time he found my heart was susceptible of every tender impression and saw that i was not free from the vanity of youth he had already acquired my friendship and esteem from which he knew there was a short and easy transition to love by his penetration choosing proper seasons for the theme he urged it with such pathetic vows and artful adulation as well might captivate a young woman of my complexion and experience and circumstanced as i was with a husband whom i had such reason to despise though he thus made an insensible progress in my heart he did not find my virtue an easy conquest and i myself was ignorant of the advantage he had gained with regard to my inclinations until i was convinced of his success by an alarm of jealousy which i one day felt at seeing him engaged in conversation with another lady i forthwith recognized this symptom of love with which i had been formerly acquainted and trembled at the discovery of my own weakness i underwent a strange agitation and mixture of contrary sensations i was pleased with the passion yet ashamed of avowing it even to my own mind the rights of a husband though mine was but a nominal one occurred to my reflection and virtue modesty and honour forbade me to cherish the guilty flame when i encouraged these laudable scruples and resolved to sacrifice my love to duty and reputation my lord was almost every day employed in riding post to my father with complaints of my conduct which was hitherto irreproachable though the greatest grievance which he pretended to have suffered was my refusing to comply with his desire when he entreated me to lie a whole hour every morning with my neck uncovered that by gazing he might quiet the perturbation of his spirits from this request you may judge of the man as well as of the regard i must entertain for his character and disposition during the whole summer i was besieged by my artful undoer and in the autumn set out with my lord for bath where by reason of the intimacy that subsisted between our families we lived in the same house with my lover and his sister who with another agreeable young lady accompanied us in this expedition by this time mr s had extorted from me a confession of a mutual flame though i assured him that it should never induce me to give up the valuable possession of an unspotted character and a conscience void of offence i offered him all the enjoyment he could reap from an unreserved intercourse of souls abstracted from any sensual consideration he eagerly embraced the platonic proposal because he had sagacity enough to foresee the issue of such chimerical contracts and knew me too well to think he could accomplish his purpose without seeming to acquiesce in my own terms and cultivating my tenderness under the specious pretext in consequence of this agreement we took all opportunities of seeing each other in private and these interviews were spent in mutual protestations of disinterested love this correspondence though dangerous was on my side equally innocent and endearing and many happy hours we passed before my sentiments were discovered at length my lover was taken ill and then my passion burst out beyond the power of concealment my grief and anxiety became so conspicuous in my countenance and my behaviour was so indiscreet that everybody in the house perceived the situation of my thoughts and blamed my conduct accordingly certain it is i was extremely imprudent though intentionally innocent i have lain whole nights by my lord who teased and tormented me for that which neither i could give nor he could take and ruminated on the fatal consequences of this unhappy flame until i was worked into a fever of disquiet i saw there was no safety but in flight and often determined to banish myself for ever from the sight of this dangerous intruder but my resolution always failed at the approach of day and my desire of seeing him as constantly recurred so far was i from persisting in such commendable determinations that on the eve of our departure from bath i felt the keenest pangs of sorrow at our approaching separation and as we could not enjoy our private interviews at my house in town i promised to visit him at his own apartments after he had sworn by all thats sacred that he would take no sinister advantage of my condescension by presuming upon the opportunities i should give he kept his word for he saw i trusted to it with fear and trembling and perceived that my apprehension was not affected but the natural concern of a young creature distracted between love and duty whom had he alarmed he would never had seen within his doors again instead of pressing me with solicitations in favour of his passion he was more than ever respectful and complaisant so that i found myself disengaged of all restraint conducted the conversation shortened and repeated my visits at my own pleasure till at last i became so accustomed to this communication that his house was as familiar to me as my own having in this manner secured himself in my confidence he resumed the favourite topic of love and warming my imagination by gradual advances on the subject my heart began to pant when he saw me thus moved he snatched the favourable occasion to practise all his eloquence and art i could not resist his energy nor even fly from the temptation that assailed me until he had obtained a promise that he should at our next meeting reap the fruits of his tedious expectation upon this condition i was permitted to retire and blessed heaven for my escape fully determined to continue in the path of virtue i had hitherto trod and stifle the criminal flame by which my peace and reputation were endangered but his idea which reigned in my heart without control soon baffled all these prudent suggestions i saw him again and he reminded me of my promise which i endeavoured to evade with affected pleasantry upon which he manifested the utmost displeasure and chagrin shedding some crocodile tears and upbraided me with levity and indifference he observed that he had solicited my favour for ten long months without intermission and imagined i had held out so long on virtuous motives only but now he could plainly perceive that his want of success had been owing to my want of affection and that all my professions were insincere in a word he persuaded me that his remonstrances were just and reasonable i could not see the affliction of a man i loved when i knew it was in my power to remove it and rather than forfeit his opinion of my sincerity and love i consented to his wish my heart now flutters at the remembrance of the dear though fatal indiscretion yet i reflect without remorse and even remember it with pleasure if i could not avoid the censure of the world i was resolved to bear it without repining and sure the guilt if there was any in my conduct was but venial for i considered myself as a person absolved of all matrimonial ties by the insignificance of lord who though a nominal husband was in fact a mere nonentity i therefore contracted a new engagement with my lover to which i resolved to adhere with the most scrupulous fidelity without the least intention of injuring my lord or his relations for had our mutual passion produced any visible effects i would immediately have renounced and abandoned my husband for ever that the fruit of my love for mr s might not have inherited to the detriment of the right heir this was my determination which i thought just if not prudent and for which i have incurred the imputation of folly in the opinion of this wise and honest generation by whose example and advice i have since that time been a little reformed in point of prudentials though i still retain a strong tendency to return to my primitive way of thinking when i quitted mr s after the sacrifice i had made and returned to my own bed it may perhaps be supposed that i slept but little true i was kept awake by the joyful impatience of revisiting my lover indeed i neglected no opportunity of flying to his arms when lord was in the country we enjoyed each others company without interruption but when he resided in town our correspondence was limited to stolen interviews which were unspeakably delicious as genuine love presided at the entertainment such was my happiness in the course of this tender communication that to this day i remember it with pleasure though it has cost me dear in the sequel and was at that time enjoyed at a considerable expense for i devoted myself so entirely to my lover who was desirous of engrossing my time and thoughts that my acquaintance which was very numerous justly accused me of neglect and of consequence cooled in their friendships but i was all for love or the world well lost and were the same opportunity to offer i would act the same conduct over again some there are who possibly may wonder how i could love twice with such violence of affection but all such observers must be unacquainted with the human heart mine was naturally adapted for the tender passions and had been so fortunate so cherished in its first impressions that it felt with joy the same sensations revive when influenced by the same engaging qualifications certain it is i loved the second time as well as the first and better was impossible i gave up my all for both fortune and my fathers favour for the one reputation friends and fortune for the other yet notwithstanding this intimate connection i did not relinquish the world all at once on the contrary i still appeared at court and attracted the notice and approbation of my royal patroness i danced with the p of w a circumstance which so nearly affected mr s who was present that in order to manifest his resentment he chose the ugliest woman in the ball for his partner and i no sooner perceived his uneasiness than i gave over with a view of appeasing his displeasure without repeating particular circumstances let it suffice to say our mutual passion was a perfect copy of that which had subsisted between me and my dear lord w it was jealous melting and delicate and chequered with little accident which serve to animate and maintain the flame in its first ardency of rapture when my lover was sick i attended and nursed him with indefatigable tenderness and care and during an indisposition which i caught in the performance of this agreeable office he discharged the obligation with all the warmth of sympathy and love it was however judged necessary by the physicians that i should use the bath waters for the recovery of my health and i set out for that place glad of a pretence to be absent from lord with whom i lived on very unhappy terms he had about nine months after our marriage desired that we might sleep in separate beds and gave a very whimsical reason for this proposal he said the immensity of his love deprived him of the power of gratification and that some commerce with an object to which his heart was not attached might by diminishing the transports of his spirits recompose his nerves and enable him to enjoy the fruits of his good fortune you may be sure i made no objection to this plan which was immediately put into execution he made his addresses to a nymph of drury lane whose name as he told me was mrs rock she made shift to extract some money from her patient but his infirmity was beyond the power of her art though she made some mischief between us and i communicated my suspicion to the duke of h who intended to have expostulated with her upon the subject but she got intimation of his design and saved him the trouble by a precipitate retreat after my return from bath where mr s and i had lived happily until we were interrupted by the arrival of my husband his lordship expressed an inclination to be my bedfellow again in this particular i desired to be excused i would not be the first to propose the separation which though usual in other countries is contrary to the custom of england being unwilling to furnish the least handle for censure as my character was still unblemished yet when the proposal came from him i thought myself entitled to refuse a reunion to which i accordingly objected this opposition produced a quarrel which rose to a state of perpetual animosity so that we began to talk of parting my lord relished the expedient agreeing to add three hundred pounds a year to my pinmoney which by the bye was never paid and i renounced all state and grandeur to live in a small house that i hired at carshalton where i passed my time for two months in the most agreeable retirement with my dear lover at length i was disturbed by the intrusion of my lord who molested me with visits and solicitations to return pretending that he had changed his mind and insisting upon my compliance with his desire i exhausted my invention in endeavours to evade his request but he persecuted me without ceasing so that i was fain to capitulate on condition that he should immediately set out for france and that he should not presume to approach my bed till our arrival at calais we accordingly departed for that kingdom and far from infringing the least article of our treaty his lordship did not insist upon his privilege before we reached the capital of france meanwhile i began to feel the effect of my passion in a very interesting manner and communicated my discovery to the dear author of it who would not leave me in such an affecting situation but took the first opportunity of following us to france in our road to paris we stopped to visit chantilly a magnificent chateau belonging to the prince of conde and there met by accident with some english noblemen to whom i was known the prince and his sisters invited me very politely into the gallery where they sat they complimented me on my person and seemed to admire my dress which was altogether new to them being a blue english ridinghabit trimmed with gold and a hat with a feather they were particularly well pleased with my hair which hung down to my waist and pressed me to stay a fortnight at their house an invitation which i was very much mortified at being obliged to refuse because my lord did not understand the french language i was enchanted with the place and the company the women being amiable and the men polite nor were they strangers to my name and story for mr s calling at the same place a few days after they rallied him on my account when we arrived at paris the first thing i did was to metamorphose myself into a frenchwoman i cut off my hair hid a very good complexion of my own with rouge reconciled myself to powder which i had never used before put on a robe with a large hoop and went to the tuileries full of spirits and joy for at that time everything conspired to make me happy i had health youth and beauty love vanity and affluence and found myself surrounded with diversions which were gay new and agreeable my appearance drew upon me the eyes of the whole company who considered me a stranger but not a foreigner so completely was i equipped in the fashion of the french and when they understood who i was they applauded my person with the most lavish encomiums according to their known politeness after having made a circuit round all the public places of entertainment in paris i was introduced into the company by an english family residing in that city and among others became acquainted with a french lady whose charms were remarkably attractive the duke of k was her admirer but she lived in reputation with her mother and an agreeable sister whose lover was the prince of c for almost every lady in france has her aimant with this charming woman whose name was madame de la t i often made parties of pleasure the duke mr s she and i used to meet in the bois de boulogne which is a pleasant wood at a small distance from paris whither the company repairs in the summer season for the benefit of the air and after having amused ourselves among the groves embarked in his graces equipage which was extremely elegant being a calash drawn by six fine longtailed greys adorned with ribbons in the french taste and thus we were conducted to a little enchanted or at least enchanting palace possessed by the duke at one end of the town the lower apartment appropriated to me was furnished with yellow and silver the bed surrounded with lookingglasses and the door opened into the garden laid out in a cradle walk and intervening parterres of roses and other flowers abovestairs my female companion lodged in a chamber furnished with chintz we supped all together in the saloon which though small was perfectly elegant the company was always goodhumoured the conversation sprightly and joyous and the scene though often repeated still delightful and entertaining at other times mr s and i used to pass our evenings at the palace of the prince of c which his highness lent us for our accommodation the apartments opened into the gardens of the luxembourg and were in point of magnificence suitable to the owner thither i used to repair in a flaming equipage on pretence of visiting and spent the best part of the night with him who was dearer to me than all the princes in the world while i was happily engaged in these ravishing parties my little lord was employed in his efforts to recover his health by restoratives and i know not what for he still lamented the enfeebling effects of his passion and complained that he loved me more like an angel than a woman though he strove to govern his affections according to the doctrines of the christian religion as he regulated his life by the maxims of charles the twelfth of sweden the meaning of this declaration i could never learn and indeed i have been often tempted to believe he had no meaning at all be that as it will i found my size visibly increasing and my situation extremely uneasy on account of the perpetual wrangling which prevailed between us in consequence of his desiring to sleep with me again after we had parted beds for the second time and that i might no longer be exposed to such disagreeable persecutions i resolved to leave him though at the hazard of my life thus determined i went to the british ambassador in a hackneycoach and in order to disguise my youth which might have prepossessed him against my judgment muffled myself up in a black hood which as he said instead of lending an air of gravity to my countenance added a wildness to my looks which was far from being disagreeable he had been a gallant man in his youth and even then though well stricken in years was not insensible to the power of beauty this disposition perhaps rendered him more favourable to my cause though he first advised me to return to my husband but finding me obstinate he undertook to serve me in my own way and procured a protection from the french king by virtue of which i could live at paris unmolested by my lord nevertheless he advised me if i was determined to leave him to make the best of my way to england and sue for a divorce i relished his opinion and concealed myself about three days in paris during which i borrowed some linen for as it was impossible to convey anything out of my own house without suspicion i had neither clothes for my accommodation nor a servant to wait on me in this solitary condition i took the road to flanders after i had put my lord upon a wrong scent by writing a letter to him dated at calais and travelled through an unknown country without any other attendant than the postillion being subjected to this inconvenience by the laws of france which are so severe in some particulars that if any person had been apprehended with me he would have suffered death for going off with a mans wife though any man might go to bed with that same woman without fear of incurring any legal punishment i proceeded night and day without intermission that i might the sooner reach flanders where i knew i should be safe and as the nights were excessively cold i was fain to wrap myself up in flannel which i bought for the purpose as i had no clothes to keep me warm and travelled in an open chaise while we passed through dreary woods quite remote from the habitations of men i was not without apprehension of being stripped and murdered by the postillion and in all probability owed my safety to the indigence of my appearance which might also protect me in two miserable places where i was obliged to lie before i got out of the territories of france for as i could not reach the great towns where i intended to lodge i was under the necessity of putting up at little wretched hovels where no provision was to be had but sour brown bread and sourer cheese and everything seemed to denote the dens of despair and assassination i made shift however to subsist on this fare uncomfortable as it was confiding on the meanness of my equipage for the security of my person and at length arriving at brussels fixed my quarters in the hotel de flandre so well known to the english since where i thought myself extremely happy in the accomplishment of my flight i had not been two full days in this place when i was blessed with the sight of my lover who followed me on the wings of love in pursuance of the plan we had projected before my departure from paris here we concerted measures for proceeding to england i hired a tall fine liegeoise for my maid and setting out for ostend we embarked in a vessel in which mr s had bespoke our passage our voyage was short and prosperous and our time most agreeably spent in the company of my dear partner who was a most engaging man in all respects as i dare say my lady c has since found him i assumed a fictitious name took private lodgings in polandstreet retained lawyers and commenced a suit for separation against my lord i communicated the reasons of my elopement to my father who was shocked and surprised at my conduct which he condemned with expressions of sorrow and resentment but the step was taken nor did i repent of what i had done except on his account in the morning after my arrival at london i waited upon the lord chief justice to whom i complained of the usage i had received from my lord whose temper was teasing tiresome and intolerably capricious indeed his behaviour was a strange compound of madness and folly seasoned with a small proportion of sense no wonder then that i who am hot and hasty should be wretched under the persecution of such a perverse humourist who used to terrify me and scold at me the whole night without intermission and shake my pillow from time to time that i might not sleep while he tormented me with his disagreeable expostulations i have been often frightened almost out of my senses at seeing him convulsed with the most unreasonable passion and chagrined to the highest degree of disgust to find by repeated observation his disposition so preposterous that his satisfaction and displeasure never depended upon the cause he had to be satisfied or disobliged but on the contrary when he had most reason to be pleased he was always most discontented and very often in goodhumour when he had reason enough for vexation while i lived in polandstreet i was engaged with lawyers and so often visited by my father that i could not dedicate my whole time as usual to my lover nor was it convenient that he should be seen in my company he therefore took a small house at camberwell whither i went as often as i had an opportunity and maintained the correspondence with such eagerness and industry that although i was six months gone with child i have often by myself set out for his habitation in a hackneycoach at eleven oclock at night and returned by six in the morning that i might be in my own bed when my father came to see me for i concealed my amour as well as the effects of it from his knowledge and frequently took water from the bridge that my motions might not be discovered nothing but the most passionate love could have supported my spirits under such vicissitudes of fatigue or enabled my admirer to spend whole days by himself in such a solitary retirement by this time my lord was arrived in england and employed in discovering the place of my retreat so that i lived in continual alarm and provided myself with a speakingtrumpet which stood by my bedside to be used in calling for assistance in case my pursuer should make an attack upon my lodgings this situation being extremely uncomfortable i had no sooner begun my process against him than i put myself entirely under the protection of mr s who conducted me to the house of a friend of his who lived in the country where i was secure from the attempts of my husband the world had now given me up and i had renounced the world with the most perfect resignation i weighed in my breast what i should lose in point of character with what i suffered in my peace at home and found that my reputation was not to be preserved except at the expense of my quiet for his lordship was not disposed to make me easy had i been ever so discreet i therefore determined to give up a few ceremonial visits and empty professions for the more substantial enjoyments of life we passed our time very agreeably in various amusements with this friend of mr s until the term of my reckoning was almost expired then returned to london and took lodgings in southamptonstreet where i began to make the preparations for the approaching occasion here i proposed to live with the utmost circumspection i disguised my name saw nobody but my lawyer and lover and never approached the window lest i should be discovered by accident notwithstanding these precautions my french maid whom i had sent for some of my clothes was dogged in her return and next morning my lord took my lodgings by storm had he given the assault in his person only i make no doubt but he would have suffered a repulse from the opposition of the liegeoise who made all the resistance in her power but was obliged to give way to superior numbers i was at that time abed and hearing an unusual noise below rang my bell in order to know the cause of such disturbance i drew my curtain at the same time and who should i see entering my chamber but his lordship attended by a constable and the footman who had discovered my retreat such an unexpected visit could not fail to affect me with surprise and consternation however i summoned all my fortitude to my aid and perceiving the fellows were about to open my windowshutters desired their principal to order them downstairs he readily complied with my request and sitting down by my bedside told me with an air of triumph that he had found me at last and i frankly owned that i was heartily sorry for his success instead of upbraiding me with my escape he proceeded to entertain me with all the news in town and gave me a minute detail of everything that happened to him since our parting among other articles of intelligence giving me to understand that he had challenged mr s who refused to fight him and was in disgrace with the prince of w on that account but here his lordship did not strictly adhere to the naked truth he had indeed before our departure from the country gone to my lover and insisted upon having satisfaction in hyde park two days from the date of his demand and at three oclock in the afternoon s believing him in earnest accepted the invitation though he observed that these affairs could not be discussed too soon and wished the time of meeting might be an earlier hour but his lordship did not choose to alter the circumstances of his first proposal and when he went away said he should expect him at the appointed place and time if it did not rain his antagonist gave me an account of the conversation when i assured him the whole business would end in smoke accordingly my lord sent him a letter on monday desiring that the assignation might be deferred till thursday that he might have time to settle his affairs and pay s a hundred pounds which he had formerly borrowed of him when thursday came he was favoured with another epistle importing that the challenger had changed his mind and would seek satisfaction at law thus ended that heroic exploit which his lordship now boasted of with such arrogant misrepresentation while he thus regaled me with these interesting particulars i was contriving a scheme to frustrate the discovery he had made so that i did not contradict his assertions but told him that if he would go downstairs i would rise and come to breakfast he consented to this proposal with great cheerfulness and i own i was not a little surprised to find him at this first interview in as good a humour as if nothing had happened to interrupt the felicity of our matrimonial union it cost me some invention to conceal my condition from his notice being now within a week of the expected crisis but i knew i had to do with a man of no great penetration and succeeded in my attempt accordingly we breakfasted with great harmony and i invited him to dinner after having prevailed upon him to send away his myrmidons whom nevertheless he ordered to return at eleven oclock at night we conversed together with great gaiety and mirth when i rallied him for visiting me in such a dishabille he stood on tiptoe to view himself in the glass and owning i was in the right said he would go and dress himself before dinner he accordingly went away charging my maid to give him entrance at his return and he was no sooner gone than i wrote to mr s giving him an account of what had happened then without having determined on any certain plan i huddled on my clothes muffled myself up and calling a chair went to the next tavern where i stayed no longer than was sufficient to change my vehicle and to the astonishment of the drawers who could not conceive the meaning of my perturbation proceeded to a shop in the neighbourhood where i dismissed my second chair and procured a hackneycoach in which i repaired to the lodgings of my lawyer whom i could trust having made him acquainted with the circumstances of my distress and consulted him about a proper place of retreat after some recollection he directed me to a little house in a court to which by the assistance of my lover my woman and clothes were safely conveyed that same evening my lord however came to dinner according to invitation and did not seem at all alarmed when my maid told him i was gone but stepped to my lawyer to know if he thought i should return upon his answering in the affirmative and advising his lordship to go back in the meantime and eat the dinner i had provided he very deliberately took his advice made a very hearty meal drank his bottle of wine and as i did not return according to his expectation withdrew in order to consult his associates this motion of his furnished my woman with an opportunity of making her retreat and when he returned at night the coast was clear and he found nobody in the house but a porter who had been left to take care of the furniture he was so enraged at this disappointment that he made a furious noise which raised the whole neighbourhood reinforced his crew with the authority of a justice of the peace tarried in the street till three oclock in the morning discharged a lodging he had hired at a barbers shop opposite to the house from which i had escaped and retired with the comfortable reflection of having done everything which a man could do to retrieve me the hurry of spirits and surprise i had undergone in effecting this retreat produced such a disorder in my constitution that i began to fear i should be delivered before i could be provided with the necessaries for the occasion i signified my apprehension to mr s who with infinite care and concern endeavoured to find a more convenient place and after all his inquiries was obliged to fix upon a paltry apartment in the city though his tenderness was extremely shocked at the necessity of choosing it however there was no remedy nor time to be lost to this miserable habitation i was carried in a hackneycoach and though extremely ill bore my fate with spirit and resignation in testimony of my sincere and indelible attachment to my lover for whose case and pleasure i could have suffered every inconvenience and even sacrificed my life immediately after i had taken possession of my wretched apartment i was constrained by my indisposition to go to bed and send for necessary help and in a few hours a living pledge of my love and indiscretion saw the light though the terrors and fatigue i had undergone had affected this little innocent so severely that it scarce discovered any visible signs of life my grief at this misfortune was inexpressible i forthwith despatched a message to the dear the anxious father who flew to my arms and shared my sorrow with all the gentleness of love and parental fondness yet our fears were for that time happily disappointed by the recovery of our infant daughter who was committed to the charge of a nurse in the neighbourhood so that i could every day be satisfied in my inquiries about her health thus i continued a whole fortnight in a state of happiness and tranquility being blessed with the conversation and tender offices of my admirer whose love and attention i wholly engrossed in a word he gave up all business and amusement and concentrated all his care and assiduity in ministering to my ease and satisfaction and sure i had no cause to regret what i had suffered on his account but this my agreeable situation was one day disturbed by a most alarming accident by which my life was drawn into imminent danger the room under my bedchamber took fire i immediately smelt it and saw the people about me in the utmost perplexity and consternation though they would not own the true cause of their confusion lest my health should suffer in the fright nevertheless i was so calm in my inquiries that they ventured to tell me my suspicion was but too just upon which i gave such directions as i thought would secure me from catching cold in case there should be a necessity for removing me but the fire being happily extinguished i escaped that ceremony which might have cost me my life indeed it was surprising that the agitation of my spirits did not produce some fatal effect upon my constitution and i looked upon my deliverance as the protection of a particular providence though i escaped the hazard of a sudden removal i found it was high time to change my lodgings because the neighbours rushing into the house upon the alarm of fire had discovered my situation though they were ignorant of my name and i did not think myself safe in being the subject of their conjectures mr s therefore procured another compartment with better accommodation to which i was carried as soon as my health would admit of my removal and soon after my lord wrote to me by the hands of my lawyer earnestly entreating me to drop my prosecution and come home but i would not comply with his request and nothing was farther from my intention than the desire of receiving any favours at his hands thus repulsed he set on foot a most accurate search for my person in the course of which he is said to have detected several ladies and young girls who had reasons for keeping themselves concealed and had like to have been very severely handled for his impertinent curiosity being unsuccessful in all his attempts he entered into a treaty with one sir r h a person of a very indifferent character who undertook to furnish him with an infallible expedient to discover the place of my abode if he would gratify him with a bond for a thousand pounds which being executed accordingly this worthy knight advertised me and my maid in the public papers offering one hundred pounds as a reward to any person who should disclose the place of our retirement as soon as the paper fell into my hands i was again involved in perplexity and being afraid of staying in town resolved with the concurrence of my lover to accept of an invitation i had received from the duke of k who had by this time arrived in england with that lady whom i have already mentioned as one of our parties at paris having visited my little infant i next day set out for the dukes country seat which is a most elegant chateau and stands in a charming situation mr s followed in a few days we met with a very cordial reception his grace was civil and goodnatured lived nobly and loved pleasure madame de la t was formed to please there was always a great deal of company in the house so that we passed our time agreeably in playing at billiards and cards hunting walking reading and conversation but my terms of happiness were generally of short duration in the midst of this felicity i was overtaken by a most severe affliction in the death of my dear hapless infant who had engrossed a greater share of my tenderness than perhaps i even should have paid to the offspring of a legitimate contract because the circumstance of her birth would have been an insurmountable misfortune to her through the whole course of her life and rendered her absolutely dependent on my love and protection while i still lamented the untimely fate of this fair blossom lord came down and demanded me as his wife but the suit which i then maintained against him deprived him for the present of a husbands right and therefore the duke would not deliver me into his hands in six months he repeated his visit and demand and an agreement was patched up in consequence of which i consented to live in the same house with him on condition that he should never desire to sleep with me or take any other measure to disturb my peace otherwise i should be at liberty to leave him again and entitled to the provision of a separate maintenance to these articles i assented by the advice of my lawyers with a view of obtaining the payment of my pinmoney which i had never received since our parting but subsisted on the sale of my jewels which were very considerable and had been presented to me with full power of alienation as to my lover he had no fortune to support me and for that reason i was scrupulously cautious of augmenting his expense we had now enjoyed each others company for three years during which our mutual passions had suffered no abatement nor had my happiness been mixed with any considerable alloy except that late stroke of providence which i have already mentioned and the reflection of the sorrow that my conduct had entailed upon my dear father whom i loved beyond expression and whom nothing could have compelled me to disoblige but a more powerful flame that prevailed over every other consideration as i was now forced to break off this enchanting correspondence it is not to be doubted that our parting cost us the most acute sensations of grief and disappointment however there was no remedy i tore myself from his arms took my leave of the family after having acknowledged my obligations to the duke and set out for the place of rendezvous where i was met by my lord attended by a steward whom he had lately engaged and who was one chief cause of our future separations my lord having quitted his house in town conducted me to his lodgings in pall mall and insisted upon sleeping with me the first night but i refused to gratify his desire on the authority of our agreement this dispute produced a quarrel in consequence of which i attempted to leave the house he endeavouring to prevent my retreat i fairly locked him in ran downstairs and calling a hackneycoach made the best of my way into the city to my fathers lodgings where i lay the family being in town though he himself was in the country i wrote to him immediately and when he came to london declared my intention of separating from my lord in which seeing me obstinate and determined he at length acquiesced and a formal separation accordingly ensued which at that time i thought binding and immutable i was now sheltered under the wings of an indulgent father who had taken me into favour again on the supposition that my commerce with mr s was absolutely at an end nevertheless though we had separated in all appearance for ever we had previously agreed to maintain our correspondence in private interviews which should escape the notice of the world with which i was again obliged to keep some measures our parting at the duke of k s house in the country was attended with all the genuine marks of sincere and reciprocal affection and i lived in the sweet hope of seeing him again in all the transport of his former passion when my lawyer who received my letters brought me a billet one night just as i had gone to bed seeing the superscription of s s handwriting i opened it with all the impatience of an absent lover but how shall i describe the astonishment and consternation with which i was seized when i perused the contents instead of the most tender vows and protestations this fatal epistle began with madam the best thing you can do is to return to your father or some cold and killing expression to that effect heaven and earth what did i feel at this dire conjuncture the light forsook my eyes a cold sweat bedewed my limbs and i was overwhelmed with such a torrent of sorrow and surprise that everybody present believed i would have died under the violent agitation they endeavoured to support my spirits with repeated draughts of strong liquor which had no sensible effect upon my constitution though for eight whole years i had drunk nothing stronger than water and i must have infallibly perished in the first ecstasy of my grief had it not made its way in a fit of tears and exclamation in which i continued all night to the amazement of the family whom my condition had alarmed and raised from their repose my father was the only person who guessed the cause of my affliction he said he was sure i had received some illusage in a letter or message from that rascal s so he termed him in the bitterness of passion at mention of that name my agony redoubled to such a degree that all who were present wept at sight of my deplorable condition my poor father shed a flood of tears and conjured me to tell him the cause of my disquiet upon which rather than confess the truth i amused his concern by pretending that my lover was ill the whole family having stayed by me till i was a little more composed left me to the care of my maid who put me into bed about six in the morning but i enjoyed no rest i revolved every circumstance of my conduct endeavouring to find out the cause of this fatal change in s s disposition and as i could recollect nothing which could justly give offence concluded that some malicious persons had abused his ears with stories to my prejudice with this conjecture i got up and sent my lawyer to him with a letter wherein i insisted upon seeing him that i might have an opportunity of justifying myself in person a task which would be easily performed as i had never offended but in loving too well i waited with the most anxious impatience for the return of my messenger who brought me an answer couched in the coldest terms of civility which indifference could dictate acknowledging however that he had nothing to lay to my charge but that it was for the good of us both that we should part he ought to have reflected on that before not after i had sacrificed my all for his love i was wellnigh distracted by this confirmation of his inconstancy and i wonder to this day how i retained the use of my reason under such circumstances of horror and despair my grief laid aside all decorum and restraint i told my father that s was dying and that i would visit him with all expedition startled at the proposal this careful parent demonstrated the fatal consequence of such an unguarded step reminded me of the difficulty with which he had prevailed upon my mother and uncle to forgive my former imprudence observed that his intention was to carry me into the country next day in order to effect a perfect reconciliation but now i was on the brink of forfeiting all pretensions to their regard by committing another fatal error which could not possibly be retrieved and that for his part whatever pangs it might cost him he was resolved to banish me from his sight for ever while he uttered this declaration the tears trickled down his cheeks and he seemed overwhelmed with the keenest sorrow and mortification so it may be easily conceived what were the impressions of my grief reinforced with the affliction of a father whom i dearly loved and the consciousness of being the cause of all his disquiet i was struck dumb with remorse and woe and when i recovered the use of speech i told him how sensible i was of his great goodness and humanity and owned how little i deserved his favour and affection that the sense of my own unworthiness was one cause of my present distraction for such was the condition of my fate that i must either see s or die i said though i could not expect his forgiveness i was surely worthy of his compassion that nothing but the most irresistible passion could have misled me at first from my duty or tempted me to incur the least degree of his displeasure that the same fatal influence still prevailed and would in all probability continue to the grave which was the only abode in which i hoped for peace while i expressed myself in this manner my dear good father wept with the most tender sympathy and saying i might do as i pleased for he had done with me quitted the room leaving me to the cruel sensations of my own heart which almost burst with anguish upbraiding me with a fault which i could not help committing i immediately hired a chariot and six and would have set out by myself had not my fathers affection which all my errors could not efface provided an attendant he saw me quite delirious and desperate and therefore engaged a relation of my own to accompany and take care of me in this rash expedition during this journey which lasted two days i felt no remission of grief and anxiety but underwent the most intolerable sorrow and suspense at last we arrived at a little house called the hut on salisbury plain where in the most frantic agitation i wrote a letter to s describing the miserable condition to which i was reduced by his unkindness and desiring to see him with the most earnest solicitations this billet i committed to the care of my attendant and laid strong injunctions upon him to tell mr s my injuries were so great and my despair so violent that if he did not favour me with a visit i would go to him though at his sisters house where he then was he received my message with great coldness and told my friend that if i would return to london without insisting upon the interview i demanded he would in a little time follow me to town and everything should be amicably adjusted but when the messenger assured him that i was too much transported with grief to hear of such a proposal he consented to meet me in the middle of salisbury plain that we might avoid all observation and though i was little able to walk i set out for the place of assignation my companion following at a small distance when i saw him leading his horse down the hill i collected all my fortitude and advanced to him with all the speed i could exert but when i made an effort to speak my tongue denied its office and so lively was the expression of unutterable sorrow in my countenance that his heart hard as it was melted at the sight of my sufferings which he well knew proceeded from the sincerity of my love at length i recovered the use of speech enough to tell him that i was come to take my leave and when i would have proceeded my voice failed me again but after a considerable pause i found means with great difficulty to let him know how sensible i was of my own incapacity to retrieve his lost affections but that i was willing if possible to retain his esteem of which could i be assured i would endeavour to compose myself that i was determined to leave the kingdom because i could not bear the sight of those places where we had been so happy in our mutual love and that till my departure i hoped he would visit me sometimes that i might by degrees wean myself from his company for i should not be able to survive the shock of being deprived of him all at once this address may seem very humble to an unconcerned observer but love will tame the proudest disposition as plainly appeared in my case for i had naturally as much spirit or more than the generality of people have mr s was so much confounded at the manner of my behaviour that he scarce knew what answer to make for as he afterwards owned he expected to hear himself upbraided but he was not proof against my tenderness after some hesitation he said he never meant to forsake me entirely that his affection was still unimpaired and that he would follow me directly to london i imposed upon myself and believed what he said because i could not bear to think of parting with him for ever and returned to town in a more tranquil state of mind than that in which i had left my father though my heart was far from being at ease my fears being ingenious enough to foresee that i should never be able to overcome his indifference i took lodgings in mountstreet and my maid having disposed of herself in marriage hired another who supplied her place very much to my satisfaction she was a good girl had a particular attachment to me and for many years during which she lived in my service was indefatigably assiduous in contributing to my ease or rather in alleviating my affliction for though s came up to town according to promise and renewed a sort of correspondence with me for the space of five months his complaisance would extend no farther and he gave me to understand that he had determined to go abroad with mr v whom he accordingly accompanied in his envoying to d i understood the real cause of this expedition which notwithstanding his oaths and protestations of unabated love and regard i construed into a palpable mark of dislike and disrespect nor could the repeated assurances i received from him in letters mitigate the anguish and mortification that preyed upon my heart i therefore gave up all hopes of recovering the happiness i had lost i told him on the eve of his departure that he might exercise his gallantry a great while before he would meet with my fellow in point of sincerity and love for i would rather have been a servant in his house with the privilege of seeing him than the queen of england debarred of that pleasure when he took his leave and went downstairs i shrunk at every step he made as if a new wound had been inflicted upon me and when i heard the door shut behind him my heart died within me i had the satisfaction to hear afterwards he lamented the loss of me prodigiously and that he had never been so happy since i sat down to write a letter in which i forgave his indifference because i knew the affections are altogether involuntary and wished him all the happiness he deserved i then walked up and down the room in the most restless anxiety was put to bed by my maid rose at six mounted my horse and rode forty miles in order to fatigue myself that i might next night enjoy some repose this exercise i daily underwent for months together and when it did not answer my purpose i used to walk round hydepark in the evening when the place was quite solitary and unvisited by any other human creature in the course of this melancholy perambulation i was one day accosted by a very great man who after the first salutation asked whether or not my intercourse with s was at an end and if i had any allowance from my husband to the first of these questions i replied in the affirmative and to the last answered that my lord did not allow me a great deal indeed i might have truly said nothing at all but i was too proud to own my indigence he then expressed his wonder how one like me who had been used to splendour and affluence from my cradle could make shift to live in my present narrow circumstances and when i told him that i could make a very good shift so i had peace he seemed to lament my situation and very kindly invited me to sup with his wife at his house i accepted the invitation without any apprehension of the consequence and when i went to the place was introduced into an apartment magnificently lighted up i suppose for my reception after i had stayed alone for some time in this mysterious situation without seeing a living soul my inviter appeared and said he hoped i would not take it amiss that he and i were to sup by ourselves as he had something to say which could not be so properly communicated before company or servants i then for the first time perceived his drift to my no small surprise and indignation and with evident marks of displeasure told him i was sure he had nothing to propose that would be agreeable to my inclination and that i would immediately leave the house upon which he gave me to understand that i could not possibly retire because he had sent away my chair and all his servants were disposed to obey his orders incensed at this declaration which i considered as an insult i answered with an air of resolution it was very well i despised his contrivance and was afraid of nothing seeing me thus alarmed he assured me i had no reason to be afraid that he had loved me long and could find no other opportunity of declaring his passion he said the q had told him that lord had renewed his addresses to me and as he understood from my own mouth my correspondence with s was absolutely broke off he thought himself as well entitled as another to my regard in conclusion he told me that i might command his purse and that he had power enough to bring me into the world again with eclat to these advances i replied that he was very much mistaken in his opinion of my character if he imagined i was to be won by any temptations of fortune and very frankly declared that i would rather give myself to a footman than sell myself to a prince supper being served we sat down together but i would neither eat nor drink anything except a little bread and water for i was an odd whimsical girl and it came into my head that he might perhaps have mixed something in the victuals or wine which would alter my way of thinking in short finding himself baffled in all his endeavours he permitted me about twelve oclock to depart in peace and gave up his suit as a desperate cause this uncomfortable life did i lead for a whole twelvemonth without feeling the least abatement of my melancholy finding myself worn to a skeleton i resumed my former resolution of trying to profit by change of place and actually went abroad with no other attendant than my woman and the utmost indifference for life my intention was to have gone to the south of france where i thought i could have subsisted on the little i had left which amounted to five hundred pounds until the issue of my lawsuit by which i hoped to obtain some provision from my lord and without all doubt my expectation would have been answered had i put this my plan in execution but being at paris from whence i proposed to set forward in a few days i sent to m k who had been formerly intimate with my father and shown me many civilities during my first residence in france this gentleman favoured me with a visit and when i made him acquainted with my scheme dissuaded me from it as an uncomfortable determination he advised me to stay at paris where with good economy i could live as cheap as in any other place and enjoy the conversation and countenance of my friends among which number he declared himself one of the most faithful he assured me that i should be always welcome to his table and want for nothing he promised to recommend me as a lodger to a friend of his with whom i would live in a frugal and decent manner and observed that as the woman was well known and esteemed by all the english company in paris it would be the most reputable step i could take considering my youth and situation to lodge with a creditable person who could answer for my conduct thus persuaded i very simply followed his advice i say simply because notwithstanding his representations i soon found my money melt away without any prospect of a fresh supply in lieu of this however i passed my time very agreeably in several english and some french families where in a little time i became quite intimate saw a great deal of company and was treated with the utmost politeness and regard yet in the midst of these pleasures many a melancholy sigh would rise at the remembrance of my beloved s whom for several years i could not recollect without emotion but time company amusements and change of place in a great measure dissipated these ideas and enabled me to bear my fate with patience and resignation on my last arrival at paris i was surrounded by a crowd of professed admirers who sighed and flattered in the usual forms but besides that my heart was not in a condition to contract new engagements i was prepossessed against them all by supposing that they presumed upon the knowledge of my indiscretion with s and therefore rejected their addresses with detestation and disdain for as i have already observed i was not to be won but by the appearance of esteem and the most respectful carriage and though by a false step i had in my own opinion forfeited my title to the one i was resolved to discourage the advances of any man who seemed deficient in the other in this manner my lovers were one by one repulsed almost as soon as they presented themselves and i preserved the independence of my heart until i became acquainted with a certain peer whom i often saw at the house of mrs p an english lady then resident at paris this young nobleman professed himself deeply enamoured of me in a style so different from that of my other admirers that i heard his protestations without disgust and though my inclinations were still free could not find in my heart to discountenance his addresses which were preferred with the most engaging modesty disinterestedness and respect by these neverfailing arts he gradually conquered my indifference and gained the preference in my esteem from lord c and the prince of c who were at that time his rivals but what contributed more than any consideration to his success was his declaring openly that he would marry me without hesitation as soon as i could obtain a divorce from my present husband which in all probability might have been easily procured for before i left england lord had offered me five thousand pounds if i would consent to such a mutual release that he might be at liberty to espouse one miss w of kent to whom he then made love upon honourable terms but i was fool enough to refuse his proposal by the advice of s and whether or not his lordship finding it impracticable to wed his new mistress began to make love upon another footing i know not but certain it is the mother forbade him the house a circumstance which he took so heinously ill that he appealed to the world in a public advertisement beginning with whereas for some time i have passionately loved miss w and upon my not complying with the mothers proposals they have turned me out of doors this is to justify etc this declaration signed with his name was actually printed in a number of detached advertisements which he ordered to be distributed to the public and afterwards being convinced by some of his friends that he had done a very silly thing he recalled them at half a guinea apiece a copy of one of them was sent to me at paris and i believe my father has now one of the originals in his possession after this wise vindication of his conduct he made an attempt to carry off the lady from church by force of arms but she was rescued by the neighbours headed by her brother who being an attorney had like to have made his lordship smart severely for this exploit meanwhile my new admirer had made some progress in my heart and my finances being exhausted i was reduced to the alternative of returning to lord again or accepting earl b s love when my affairs were brought to an issue i made no hesitation in my choice putting myself under the protection of a man of honour whom i esteemed rather than suffer every sort of mortification from a person who was the object of my abhorrence and contempt from a mistaken pride i chose to live in lord b s house rather than be maintained at his expense in another place we spent several months agreeably in balls and other diversions visited lord b who lived at the distance of a few leagues from paris and stayed some days at his house where the entertainment was in all respects delightful elegant and refined their habitation was the rendezvous of the best company in france and lady b maintained the same superiority in her own sex for which her lord is so justly distinguished among the men about christmas we set out for england accompanied by a little north briton who lived with lord b as his companion and did not at all approve of our correspondence whether out of real friendship for his patron or apprehension that in time i might supersede his own influence with my lord i shall not pretend to determine be that as it will the frost was so severe that we were detained ten days at calais before we could get out of the harbour and during that time i reflected seriously on what my new lover proposed as he was very young and unacquainted with the world i thought my story might have escaped him and therefore determined to give him a faithful detail of the whole that he might not have anything to reproach me with in the sequel besides i did not think it honest to engage him to do more for me than he might afterwards perhaps think i was worth accordingly i communicated to him every particular of my life and the narration far from altering his sentiments rather confirmed his good opinion by exhibiting an undoubted proof of my frankness and sincerity in short he behaved with such generosity as made an absolute conquest of my heart but my love was of a different kind from that which had formerly reigned within my breast being founded upon the warmest gratitude and esteem exclusive of any other consideration though his person was very agreeable and his address engaging when we arrived in england i went directly to his country seat about twelve miles from london where he soon joined me and we lived some time in perfect retirement his relations being greatly alarmed with the apprehension that lord would bring an action against him though he himself desired nothing more and lived so easy under that expectation that they soon laid aside their fears on his account we were visited by mr h b a relation of my lord and one mr r of the guards who with the little scotchman and my lover made an agreeable set among whom i enjoyed hunting and all manner of country diversions as to mr h b if ever there was perfection in one man it centred in him or at least he of all the men i ever knew approached the nearest to that idea which i had conceived of a perfect character he was both good and great possessed an uncommon genius and the best of hearts mr r was a very sociable man had a good person and cultivated understanding and my lord was excessively goodhumoured so that with such companions no place could be dull or insipid for my own part i conducted the family and as i endeavoured to please and make everybody happy i had the good fortune to succeed mr b told me that before he saw me he heard i was a fool but finding as he was pleased to say that i had been egregiously misrepresented he courted my friendship and a correspondence commenced between us indeed it was impossible for any person to know him without entertaining the utmost esteem and veneration for his virtue after i had lived some time in this agreeable retreat my husband began to make a bustle he sent a message demanding me from lord b then came in person with his nightcap in his pocket intending to have stayed all night had he been asked and attended by a relation whom he assured that i was very fond of him and detained by force from his arms finding himself disappointed in his expectations he commenced a lawsuit against lord b though not for a divorce as we desired but with a view to reclaim me as his lawful wife his lawyers however attempted to prove criminal conversation in hopes of extorting money from my lover but their endeavours were altogether fruitless for no servant of lord b s or mine could with justice say we were ever seen to trespass against modesty and decorum so that the plaintiff was nonsuited while this cause was depending all my lovers friends expressed fear and concern for the issue while he himself behaved with the utmost resolution and gave me such convincing proofs of a strong and steady affection as augmented my gratitude and riveted the ties of my love which was unblemished faithful and sincere soon after this event i was seized with a violent fit of illness in which i was visited by my father and attended by two physicians one of whom despaired of my life and took his leave accordingly but dr s who was the other persisted in his attendance and in all human appearance saved my life a circumstance by which he acquired a great share of reputation yet notwithstanding all his assistance i was confined to my bed for ten weeks during which lord b s grief was immoderate his care and generosity unlimited while i lay in this extremity mr s penetrated by my melancholy condition which revived his tenderness begged leave to be admitted to my presence and lord b would have complied with his request had i not been judged too weak to bear the shock of such an interview my constitution however agreeably disappointed my fears and the fever had no sooner left me than i was removed to a hunting seat belonging to my lover from whence after i had recovered my strength we went to b castle where we kept open house and while we remained at this place lord b received a letter from lord dated in november challenging him to single combat in may upon the frontiers of france and flanders this defiance was sent in consequence of what had passed between them long before my indisposition at a meeting in a certain tavern where they quarrelled and in the fray my lover threw his antagonist under the table i counselled him to take no notice of this rhodomontade which i knew was void of all intention of performance and he was wise enough to follow my advice resolved however should the message be repeated to take the challenger at his word having resided some time at this place we returned to the other country house which he had left where lord b addicted himself so much to hunting and other male diversions that i began to think he neglected me and apprised him of my suspicion assuring him at the same time that i would leave him as soon as my opinion should be confirmed this declaration had no effect upon his behaviour which became so remarkably cold that even mr r who lived with us imagined that his affection was palpably diminished when i went to town i was usually attended by his cousin or this gentleman or both but seldom favoured with his company nay when i repaired to bath for the reestablishment of my health he permitted me to go alone so that i was quite persuaded of his indifference and yet i was mistaken in my opinion but i had been spoiled by the behaviour of my first husband and mr s who never quitted me for the sake of any amusement and often resisted the calls of the most urgent business rather than part from me though but for a few hours i thought every man who loved me truly would act in the same manner and whether i am right or wrong in my conjectures i leave wiser casuists to judge certain it is such sacrifice and devotion is the most pleasing proof of an admirers passion and voyezmoi plus souvent et ne me donnez rien is one of my favourite maxims a man may give money because he is profuse he may be violently fond because he is of a sanguine constitution but if he gives me his time he gives me an unquestionable proof of my being in full possession of his heart my appearance at bath without the company of lord b occasioned a general surprise and encouraged the men to pester me with addresses every new admirer endeavouring to advance his suit by demonstrating the unkind and disrespectful behaviour of his lordship indeed this was the most effectual string they could touch my pride and resentment were alarmed i was weak enough to listen to one man who had like to have insinuated himself into my inclinations he was tall and largeboned with white hair inclining to what is called sandy and had the reputation of being handsome though i think he scarce deserved that epithet he possessed a large fortune loved mischief and stuck at nothing for the accomplishment of his designs one of his chief pleasures being that of setting any two lovers at variance he employed his address upon me with great assiduity and knew so well how to manage my resentment that i was pleased with his manner heard his vows without disgust and in a word promised to deliberate with myself upon his proposals and give him an account of my determination in writing thus resolved i went to lord b in wiltshire whither i was followed by this pretender to my heart who visited us on the footing of an acquaintance but when i reflected on what i had done i condemned my own conduct as indiscreet though nothing decisive had passed between us and began to hate him in proportion to the selfconviction i felt perceiving that i had involved myself in a difficulty from which i should not be easily disengaged for the present however i found means to postpone my declaration he admitted my excuse and i returned to london with lord b who was again summoned to the field by his former challenger h d n governor counsellor and steward to this little hero came to lord b with a verbal message importing that his lordship had changed his mind about going to flanders but expected to meet him on such a day and hour in the buryingground near red lionsquare lord b accepted the challenge and gave me an account of what had passed but he had been anticipated by the messenger who had already tried to alarm my fears from the consideration of the consequence that i might take some measures to prevent their meeting i perceived his drift and told him plainly that lord had no intention to risk his person though he endeavoured with all his might to persuade me that his principal was desperate and determined i knew my little husband too well to think he would bring matters to any dangerous issue and was apprehensive of nothing but foul play from the villainy of h d n with which i was equally well acquainted indeed i signified my doubts on that score to mr b who would have attended his kinsman to the field had he not thought he might be liable to censure if anything should happen to lord b because he himself was heir at law for that reason he judiciously declined being personally concerned and we pitched upon the earl of a his lordships uncle who willingly undertook the office at the appointed time they went to the house of rendezvous where they had not waited long when the challenger appeared in a new pink satin waistcoat which he had put on for the occasion with his sword under his arm and his steward by him leaving in a hackneycoach at some distance a surgeon whom he had provided for the care of his person thus equipped he advanced to his antagonist and desired him to choose his ground upon which lord b told him that if he must fall it was not material which grave he should tumble over our little hero finding him so jocose and determined turned to lord a and desired to speak with him that he might disburden his conscience before they should begin the work of death they accordingly went aside and he gave him to understand that his motive for fighting was lord b s detaining his wife from him by compulsion the earl of a assured him he was egregiously mistaken in his conjecture that his nephew used no force or undue influence to keep me in his house but it could not be expected that he would turn me out of doors this explanation was altogether satisfactory to lord who said he was far from being so unreasonable as to expect lord b would commit such a breach of hospitality and all he desired was that his wife should be left to her own inclinations upon these articles peace was concluded and they parted without bloodshed at least these are the particulars of the story as they were related by lord a with whom i laughed heartily at the adventure for i never doubted that the challenger would find some expedient to prevent the duel though i wondered how he mustered up resolution enough to carry it so far that he might not however give us any more trouble we resolved to go and enjoy ourselves in france whither i went by myself in hopes of being soon joined by my lover who was obliged to stay some time longer in england to settle his affairs he was so much affected at our parting though but for a few weeks that he was almost distracted and this affliction renewed my tenderness for him because it was an undoubted proof of his love i wrote to him every post from france and as i had no secrets desired him to take care of all the letters that should come to his house directed to me after my departure from england this was an unfortunate office for him in the execution of which he chanced to open a letter from sir t a with whom as i have already observed i had some correspondence at bath i had according to my promise given this gentleman a decisive answer importing that i was determined to remain in my present situation but as lord b was ignorant of my sentiments in that particular and perceived from the letter that something extraordinary had passed between us and that i was earnestly solicited to leave him he was seized with the utmost consternation and concern and having previously obtained the kings leave to go abroad set out that very night for france leaving his affairs in the greatest confusion sir t a hearing i was gone without understanding the cause of my departure took the same route and both arrived at dover next day they heard of each others motions each bribed the master of a packetboat to transport him with expedition but that depending upon the wind both reached calais at the same time though in different vessels sir t sent his valetdechambre post with a letter entreating me to accompany him into italy where he would make me mistress of his whole fortune and to set out directly for that country that he might not lose me by the arrival of lord b promising to join me on the road if i would consent to make him happy i sent his messenger back with an answer wherein i expressed surprise at his proposals after having signified my resolution to him before i left england he was scarce dismissed when i received another letter from lord b beseeching me to meet him at clermont upon the road from calais and conjuring me to avoid the sight of his rival should he get the start of him in travelling this however was not likely to be the case as lord b rode post and the other was by his corpulence obliged to travel in a chaise yet that i might not increase his anxiety i left paris immediately on the receipt of his message and met him at the appointed place where he received me with all the agitation of joy and fear and asked if i had ever encouraged sir t a in his addresses i very candidly told him the whole transaction at which he was incensed but his indignation was soon appeased when i professed my penitence and assured him that i had totally rejected his rival not that i approved of my behaviour to sir t who i own was illused in this affair but surely it was more excusable to halt here than proceed farther in my indiscretion my lover being satisfied with my declaration we went together to paris being attended by the scotchman whom i have already mentioned though i believe he was not over and above well pleased to see matters thus amicably compromised the furious knight followed us to the capital insisted on seeing me in person told this north briton that i was actually engaged to him wrote every hour and railed at my perfidious conduct i took no notice of these delirious transports which were also disregarded by lord b till one night he was exasperated by the insinuations of mr c who i believe inflamed his jealousy by hinting a suspicion that i was really in love with his rival what passed betwixt them i know not but he sent for me from the opera by a physician of paris who was a sort of gobetween among us all and who told me that if i did not come home in the instant a duel would be fought on my account i was very much shocked at this information but by being used to alarms from the behaviour of lord i had acquired a pretty good share of resolution and with great composure entered the room where lord b was with his companion whom i immediately ordered to withdraw i then gave his lordship to understand that i was informed of what had passed and thought myself so much injured by the person who had just quitted the apartment that i would no longer live under the same roof with him lord b raved like a bedlamite taxing me with want of candour and affection but i easily justified my own integrity and gave him such assurances of my love that his jealousy subsided and his spirits were recomposed nevertheless i insisted upon his dismissing mr c on pain of my leaving the house as i could not help thinking he had used his endeavours to prejudice me in the opinion of my lord if his conduct was the result of friendship for his patron he certainly acted the part of an honest and trusty adherent but i could not easily forgive him because a few weeks before he had by my interest obtained a considerable addition to his allowance and even after the steps he had taken to disoblige me i was not so much his enemy but that i prevailed upon lord b to double his salary that his leaving the family might be no detriment to his fortune his lordship having complied with my demand this gentleman after having stayed three days in the house to prepare for his departure during which i would not suffer him to be admitted into my presence made his retreat with a fine young girl who was my companion and i have never seen him since that time sir t still continued furious and would not take a denial except from my own mouth upon which with the approbation of lord b i indulged him with an interview he entered the apartment with a stern countenance and told me i had used him ill i pleaded guilty to the charge and begged his pardon accordingly i attempted to reason the case with him but he would hear no arguments except his own and even tried to intimidate me with threats which provoked me to such a degree that i defied his vengeance i told him that i feared nothing but the report of my own conscience that though i had acted a simple part he durst not say there was anything criminal in my conduct and that from his present frantic and unjust behaviour i thought myself happy in having escaped him he swore i was the most inflexible of all creatures asked if nothing would move me and when i answered nothing took his leave and never after persecuted me with his addresses though i have heard he was vain and false enough to boast of favours which upon my honour he never received as he himself at one time owned to dr cantwell at paris while he underwent all this frenzy and distraction upon my account he was loved with the same violence of passion by a certain scotch lady of quality who when he followed me to france pursued him thither with the same eagerness and expedition far from being jealous of me as a rival she used to come to my house implore my good offices with the object of her love and laying herself on the floor at full length before the fire weep and cry like a person bereft of her senses she bitterly complained that he had never obliged her but once and begged with the most earnest supplications that i would give her an opportunity of seeing him at my house but i thought proper to avoid her company as soon as i perceived her intention we continued at paris for some time during which i contracted an acquaintance with the sister of madame de la t she was the supposed mistress of the prince of c endowed with a great share of understanding and loved pleasure to excess though she maintained her reputation on a respectable footing by living with her husband and mother this lady perceiving that i had inspired her lover with a passion which gave me uneasiness on her account actually practised all her eloquence and art in persuading me to listen to his love for it was a maxim with her to please him at any rate i was shocked at her indelicate complaisance and rejected the proposal as repugnant to my present engagement which i held as sacred as any nuptial tie and much more binding than a forced or unnatural marriage upon our return to england we lived in great harmony and peace and nothing was wanting to my happiness but the one thing to me the most needful i mean the enchanting tenderness and delightful enthusiasm of love lord b s heart i believe felt the soft impressions and for my own part i loved him with the most faithful affection it is not enough to say i wished him well i had the most delicate the most genuine esteem for his virtue i had an intimate regard and anxiety for his interest and felt for him as if he had been my own son but still there was a vacancy in my heart there was not that fervour that transport that ecstasy of passion which i had formerly known my bosom was not filled with the little deity i could not help recalling to my remembrance the fond the ravishing moments i had passed with s had i understood the conditions of life those pleasures were happily exchanged for my present situation because if i was now deprived of those rapturous enjoyments i was also exempted from the cares and anxiety that attended them but i was generally extravagant in my notions of happiness and therefore construed my present tranquility into an insipid languor and stagnation of life while i remained in this inactivity of sentiment lord having received a very considerable addition to his fortune sent a message to me promising that if i would leave lord b he would make me a present of a house and furniture where i should live at my case without being exposed to his visits except when i should be disposed to receive them this proposal he made in consequence of what i had always declared namely that if he had not reduced me to the necessity of putting myself under the protection of some person or other by depriving me of any other means of subsistence i should never have given the world the least cause to scandalize my reputation and that i would withdraw myself from my present dependence as soon as he should enable me to live by myself i was therefore resolved to be as good as my word and accepted his offer on condition that i should be wholly at my own disposal and that he should never enter my door but as a visitant or common friend these articles being ratified by his word and honour the value of which i did not then know a house was furnished according to my directions and i signified my intention to lord b who consented to my removal with this proviso that i should continue to see him i wrote also to his relation mr b who in his answer observed that it was too late to advise when i was actually determined all my friends and acquaintance approved of the scheme though it was one of the most unjustifiable steps i had ever taken being a real act of ingratitude to my benefactor which i soon did and always shall regret and condemn so little is the world qualified to judge of private affairs when the time of our parting drew near lord b became gloomy and discontented and even entreated me to postpone my resolution but i told him that now everything was prepared for my reception i could not retract without incurring the imputation of folly and extravagance on the very day of my departure mr b endeavoured with all the arguments he could suggest to dissuade me from my purpose and i made use of the same answer which had satisfied his friend finding me determined on removing he burst out into a flood of tears exclaiming by god if lord b can bear it i cant i was thunderstruck at this expression for though i had been told that mr b was in love with me i gave no credit to the report because he had never declared his passion and this was the first hint of it that ever escaped him in my hearing i was therefore so much amazed at the circumstance of this abrupt explanation that i could make no answer but having taken my leave went away ruminating on the unexpected declaration lord b as i was informed spoke not a word that whole night and took my leaving him so much to heart that two years elapsed before he got the better of his grief this intelligence i afterwards received from his own mouth and asked his forgiveness for my unkind retreat though i shall never be able to obtain my own as for mr b he was overwhelmed with sorrow and made such efforts to suppress his concern as had well nigh cost him his life dr s was called to him in the middle of the night and found him almost suffocated he soon guessed the cause when he understood that i had left the house so that i myself was the only person concerned who was utterly ignorant of his affection for i solemnly declare he never gave me the least reason to suspect it while i lived with his relation because he had too much honour to entertain a thought of supplanting his friend and too good an opinion of me to believe he should have succeeded in the attempt though my love for lord b was not so tender and interesting as the passion i had felt for s my fidelity was inviolable and i never harboured the most distant thought of any other person till after i had resolved to leave him when i own i afforded some small encouragement to the addresses of a new admirer by telling him that i should in a little time be my own mistress though i was not now at my own disposal i enjoyed my new house as a little paradise it was accommodated with all sorts of conveniences everything was new and therefore pleasing and the whole absolutely at my command i had the company of a relation a very good woman with whom i lived in the most amicable manner was visited by the best people in town i mean those of the male sex the ladies having long ago forsaken me i frequented all reputable places of public entertainment and had a concert at home once a week so that my days rolled on in happiness and quiet till all my sweets were embittered by the vexatious behaviour of my husband who began to importune me again to live with him and by the increasing anxiety of lord b who though i still admitted his visits plainly perceived that i wanted to relinquish his correspondence this discovery raised such tempests of jealousy and despair within his breast that he kept me in continual alarm he sent messages to me every hour signed his letters with his own blood raved like a man in ecstasy of madness railed at my ingratitude and praised my conduct by turns he offered to sacrifice everything for my love to leave the kingdom forthwith and live with me for ever in any part of the world where i should choose to reside these were generous and tempting proposals but i was beset with counsellors who were not totally disinterested and who dissuaded me from embracing the proffers of my lover on pretence that lord would be highly injured by my compliance i listened to their advice and hardened my heart against lord b s sorrow and solicitations my behaviour on this occasion is altogether unaccountable this was the only time that ever i was a slave to admonition the condition of lord b would have melted any heart but mine and yet mine was one of the most sensible he employed his cousin as an advocate with me till that gentleman actually refused the office telling him candidly that his own inclinations were too much engaged to permit him to perform the task with fidelity and truth he accordingly resolved to avoid my presence until my lord and i should come to some final determination which was greatly retarded by the perseverance of his lordship who would not resign his hopes even when i pretended that another man had engaged my heart but said that in time my affection might return our correspondence however gradually wore off upon which mr b renewed his visits and many agreeable and happy hours we passed together not that he or any other person whom i now saw succeeded to the privilege of a fortunate lover i knew he loved me to madness but i would not gratify his passion any other way than by the most profound esteem and veneration for his virtues which were altogether amiable and sublime and i would here draw his character minutely but it would take up too much time to set forth his merit the only man living of my acquaintance who resembles him is lord f of whom i shall speak in the sequel about this time i underwent a very interesting change in the situation of my heart i had sent a message to my old lover s desiring he would allow my picture which was in his possession to be copied and he now transmitted it to me by my lawyer whom he directed to ask if i intended to be at the next masquerade this curiosity had a strange effect upon my spirits my heart fluttered at the question and my imagination glowed with a thousand fond presages i answered in the affirmative and we met by accident at the ball i could nut behold him without emotion when he accosted me his wellknown voice made my heart vibrate like a musical chord when its unison is struck all the ideas of our past love which the lapse of time and absence had enfeebled and lulled to sleep now awoke and were reinspired by his appearance so that his artful excuses were easily admitted i forgave him all that i had suffered on his account because he was the natural lord of my affection and our former correspondence was renewed i thought myself in a new world of bliss in consequence of this reconciliation the rapture of which continued unimpaired for the space of four months during which time he was fonder of me if possible than before repeated his promise of marriage if we should ever have it in our power assured me he had never been happy since he left me that he believed no woman loved like me and indeed to have a notion of my passion for that man you must first have loved as i did but through a strange caprice i broke off the correspondence out of apprehension that he would forsake me again from his past conduct i dreaded what might happen and the remembrance of what i had undergone by his inconstancy filled my imagination with such horror that i could not endure the shocking prospect and prematurely plunged myself into the danger rather than endure the terrors of expectation i remembered that his former attachment began in the season of my prosperity when my fortune was in the zenith and my youth in its prime and that he had forsaken me in the day of trouble when my life became embarrassed and my circumstances were on the decline i foresaw nothing but continual persecution from my husband and feared that once the keener transports of our reconciliation should be over his affection would sink under the severity of its trial in consequence of this desertion i received a letter from him acknowledging that he was rightly served but that my retreat gave him inexpressible concern meanwhile lord continued to act in the character of a fiend tormenting me with his nauseous importunities he prevailed upon the duke of l to employ his influence in persuading me to live with him assuring his grace that i had actually promised to give him that proof of my obedience and that i would come home the sooner for being pressed to compliance by a person of his rank and character induced by these representations the duke honoured me with a visit and in the course of his exhortations i understood how he had been thus misinformed upon which i sent for lord and in his presence convicted him of the falsehood by communicating to his grace the articles of our last agreement which he did not think proper to deny and the duke being undeceived declared that he would not have given me the trouble of vindicating myself had he not been misled by the insincerity of my lord baffled in this attempt he engaged mr h v and afterwards my own father in the same task and though i still adhered to my first resolution persisted with such obstinacy in his endeavours to make me unhappy that i determined to leave the kingdom accordingly after i had spent the evening with him at ranelagh i went away about two oclock in the morning leaving my companion with directions to restore to my lord his house furniture plate and everything he had given me since our last accommodation so far was i upon this occasion or at any other time of my life from embezzling any part of his fortune my friend followed my instructions most punctually and his lordship knows and will acknowledge the truth of this assertion thus have i explained the true cause of my first expedition to flanders whither the world was goodnatured enough to say i followed mr b and the whole army which happened to be sent abroad that summer before my departure i likewise transmitted to lord b the dressing plate china and a very considerable settlement of which he had been generous enough to make me a present this was an instance of my integrity which i thought due to a man who had laid me under great obligations and though i lived to be refused a small sum both by him and s i do not repent of my disinterested behaviour all the revenge i harbour against the last of these lovers is the desire of having it in my power to do him good i now found myself adrift in the world again and very richly deserved the hardships of my condition for my indiscretion in leaving lord b and in trusting to the word of lord without some further security but i have dearly paid for my imprudence the more i saw into the character of this man whom destiny hath appointed my scourge the more was i determined to avoid his fellowship and communication for he and i are in point of disposition as opposite as any two principles in nature in the first place he is one of the most unsocial beings that ever existed when i was pleased and happy he was always out of temper but if he could find means to overcast and cloud my mirth though never so innocent he then discovered signs of uncommon satisfaction and content because by this disagreeable temper he banished all company from his house he is extremely weak of understanding though he possesses a good share of low cunning which has so egregiously imposed upon some people that they have actually believed him a goodnatured easy creature and blamed me because i did not manage him to better purpose but upon further acquaintance they have always found him obstinate as a mule and capricious as a monkey not that he is utterly void of all commendable qualities he is punctual in paying his debts liberal when in good humour and would be wellbred were he not subject to fits of absence during which he is altogether unconversable but he is proud naturally suspicious jealous equally with and without cause never made a friend and is an utter stranger to the joys of intimacy in short he hangs like a damp upon society and may be properly called killjoy an epithet which he has justly acquired he honoured me with constant professions of love but his conduct is so opposite to my sentiments of that passion as to have been the prime source of all my misfortunes and affliction and i have often wished myself the object of his hate in hopes of profiting by a change in his behaviour indeed he has not been able to make me more unhappy than i believe he is in his own mind for he is literally a selftormentor who never enjoyed one gleam of satisfaction except at the expense of anothers quiet and yet with this i had almost called it diabolical quality he expects that i should cherish him with all the tenderness of affection after he has been at pains to incur my aversion he punishes my disgust by contriving schemes to mortify and perplex me which have often succeeded so effectually as to endanger my life and constitution for i have been fretted and frighted into sundry fits of illness and then i own i have experienced his care and concern over and above the oddities i have mentioned he is so unsteady in his economy that he is always newmodelling his affairs and exhausting his fortune by laying out ten pounds in order to save a shilling he inquires into the character of a servant after he has lived two years in his family and is so ridiculously stocked with vanity and selfconceit that notwithstanding my assurance before and the whole series of my conduct since our marriage which ought to have convinced him of my dislike he is still persuaded that at bottom i must admire and be enamoured of his agreeable person and accomplishments and that i would not fail to manifest my love were i not spirited against him by his own relations perhaps it might be their interest to foment the misunderstanding betwixt us but really they give themselves no trouble about our affairs and so far as i know them are a very good sort of people on the whole i think i may with justice pronounce my precious yokefellow a trifling teasing insufferable inconsistent creature with the little money which remained of what i had received from his lordship for housekeeping i transported myself to flanders and arrived in ghent a few days after our troops were quartered in that city which was so much crowded with these new visitants that i should have found it impracticable to procure a lodging had i not been accommodated by lord b the duke of a s youngest brother who very politely gave me up his own here i saw my friend mr b who was overjoyed at my arrival though jealous of every man of his acquaintance for he loved me with all the ardour of passion and i regarded him with all the perfection of friendship which had he lived in time might have produced love though that was a fruit which it never brought forth notwithstanding his earnest solicitations to the contrary i stayed but a week in ghent from whence i proceeded to brussels and fixed my abode in the hotel de flandre among an agreeable set of gentlemen and ladies with whom i spent my time very cheerfully there was a sort of court in this city frequented by all the officers who could obtain permission to go thither and the place in general was gay and agreeable i was introduced to the best families and very happy in my acquaintance for the ladies were polite goodtempered and obliging and treated me with the utmost hospitality and respect among others i contracted a friendship with madame la comtesse de c and her two daughters who were very amiable young ladies and became intimate with the princess c and countess w lady of the bedchamber to the queen of hungary and a great favourite of the governor monsieur dh in whose house she lived with his wife who was also a lady of a very engaging disposition soon after i had fixed my habitation in brussels the company at our hotel was increased by three officers who professed themselves my admirers and came from ghent with a view of soliciting my love this triumvirate consisted of the scotch earl of lord rm and another young officer the first was a man of a very genteel figure and amorous complexion danced well and had a great deal of goodhumour with a mixture of vanity and selfconceit the second had a good face though a clumsy person and a very sweet disposition very much adapted for the sentimental passion of love and the third mr w by name was tall thin and wellbred with a great stock of goodnature and vivacity these adventurers began their addresses in general acts of gallantry that comprehended several of my female friends with whom we used to engage in parties of pleasure both in the city and the environs which are extremely agreeable when they thought they had taken the preliminary steps of securing themselves in my good opinion and esteem they agreed to go on without further delay and that lord should make the first attack upon my heart he accordingly laid siege to me with such warmth and assiduity that i believe he deceived himself and began to think he was actually in love though at bottom he felt no impulse that deserved the sacred name though i discouraged him in the beginning he persecuted me with his addresses he always sat by me at dinner and imparted a thousand trifles in continual whispers which attracted the notice of the company so much that i began to fear his behaviour would give rise to some report to my prejudice and therefore avoided him with the utmost caution notwithstanding all my care however he found means one night while my maid who lay in my room went downstairs to get into my chamber after i was abed upon which i started up and told him that if he should approach me i would alarm the house for i never wanted courage and resolution perceiving my displeasure he kneeled by the bedside begged i would have pity on his sufferings and swore i should have carte blanche to the utmost extent of his fortune to these proposals i made no other reply but that of protesting i would never speak to him again if he did not quit my apartment that moment upon which he thought proper to withdraw and i never afterwards gave him an opportunity of speaking to me on the same subject so that in a few weeks he separated himself from our society though the ladies of brussels considered him as my lover because of all the other officers he was their greatest favourite his lordship being thus repulsed mr w took the field and assailed my heart in a very different manner he said he knew not how to make love but was a man of honour and would keep the secret and so forth to this cavalier address i answered that i was not angry as i otherwise should have been at his blunt declaration because i found by his own confession he did not know what was due to the sex and my unhappy situation in some shape excused him for a liberty which he would not have dreamed of taking had not my misfortunes encouraged his presumption but i would deal with him in his own way and far from assuming the prude frankly assured him that he was not at all to my taste hoping he would consider my dislike as a sufficient reason to reject his love lord r began to feel the symptoms of a genuine passion which he carefully cherished in silence being naturally diffident and bashful but by the very means he used to conceal it from my observation i plainly discerned the situation of his heart and was not at all displeased at the progress i had made in his inclinations meanwhile he cultivated my acquaintance with great assiduity and respect attended me in all my excursions and particularly in an expedition to antwerp with two other gentlemen where in downright gaiete de coeur we sat for our pictures which were drawn in one piece one of the party being represented in the dress of a hussar and another in that of a running footman this incident i mention because the performance which is now in my possession gave birth to a thousand groundless reports circulated in england at our expense it was immediately after this jaunt that lord r began to disclose his passion though he at the same time started such objections as seemed to extinguish his hopes lamenting that even if he should have the happiness to engage my affections his fortune was too inconsiderable to support us against the efforts of lord should he attempt to interrupt our felicity and that he himself was obliged to follow the motions of the army in short he seemed to consider my felicity more than his own and behaved with such delicacy as gradually made an impression on my heart so that when we parted we agreed to renew our correspondence in england in the midst of these agreeable amusements which i enjoyed in almost all the different towns of flanders i happened to be at ghent one day sitting among a good deal of company in one of their hotels when a postchaise stopped at the gate upon which we went to the windows to satisfy our curiosity when who should step out of the convenience but my little insignificant lord i no sooner announced him to the company than all the gentlemen asked whether they should stay and protect me or withdraw and when i assured them that their protection was not necessary one and all of them retired though lord r m went no farther than the parlour below being determined to screen me against all violence and compulsion i sent a message to my lord desiring him to walk up into my apartment but although his sole errand was to see and carry me off he would not venture to accept of my invitation till he had demanded me in form from the governor of the place that gentleman being altogether a stranger to his person and character referred him to the commanding officer of the english troops who was a man of honour and upon his lordships application pretended to doubt his identity observing that he had always heard lord represented as a jolly corpulent man he gave him to understand however that even granting him to be the person i was by no means subject to military law unless he could prove that i had ever listed in his majestys service thus disappointed in his endeavours he returned to the inn and with much persuasion trusted himself in my diningroom after having stationed his attendants at the door in case of accidents when i asked what had procured me the honour of this visit he told me his business and intention were to carry me home this declaration produced a conference in which i argued the case with him and matters were accommodated for the present by my promising to be in england some time in september on condition that he would permit me to live by myself as before and immediately order the arrears of my pinmoney to be paid he assented to everything i proposed returned in peace to his own country and the deficiencies of my allowance were made good while i returned to brussels where i stayed until my departure for england which i regulated in such a manner as was consistent with my engagement i took lodgings in pallmall and sending for my lord convinced him of my punctuality and put him in mind of his promise when to my utter astonishment and confusion he owned that his promise was no more than a decoy to bring me over and that i must lay my account with living in his house like a dutiful and obedient wife i heard him with the indignation such treatment deserved upbraiding him with his perfidious dealing which i told him would have determined me against cohabitation with him had i not been already resolved and being destitute of all resource repaired to bath where i afterwards met with mr d and mr r two gentlemen who had been my fellowpassengers in the yacht from flanders and treated me with great friendship and politeness without either talking or thinking of love with these gentlemen who were as idle as myself i went to the jubilee at preston which was no other than a great number of people assembled in a small town extremely illaccommodated to partake of diversions that were bad imitations of plays concerts and masquerades if the world should place to the account of my indiscretion my travelling in this manner with gentlemen to whom i had no particular attachment let it also be considered as an alleviation that i always lived in terror of my lord and consequently was often obliged to shift my quarters so that my finances being extremely slender i stood the more in need of assistance and protection i was besides young inconsiderate and so simple as to suppose the figure of an ugly man would always secure me from censure on his account neither did i ever dream of any mans addresses until he made an actual declaration of his love upon my return to bath i was again harassed by lord who came thither accompanied by my father whom i was very glad to see though he importuned me to comply with my husbands desire and for the future keep measures with the world this remonstrance about living with my lord which he constantly repeated was the only instance of his unkindness which i ever felt but all his admonitions were not of force sufficient to shake my resolution in that particular though the debate continued so late that i told his lordship it was high time to retire for i could not accommodate him with a bed he then gave me to understand that he would stay where he was upon which my father took his leave on pretence of looking out for a lodging for himself the little gentleman being now left with me began to discover some signs of apprehension in his looks but mustering up all his resolution he went to the door called up three of his servants whom he placed as sentinels upon the stairs and flounced into my elbowchair where he resigned himself to rest intending to go to bed i thought it was but just and decent that i should screen myself from the intrusion of his footmen and with that view bolted the door lord hearing himself locked in started up in the utmost terror and consternation kicked the door with his heel and screamed aloud as if he had been in the hands of an assassin my father who had not yet quitted the house hearing these outcries ran upstairs again and coming through my bedchamber into the diningroom where we were found me almost suffocated with laughter and his heroic soninlaw staring like one who had lost his wits with his hair standing on end when my father asked the meaning of his exclamations he told him with all the symptoms of dismay that i had locked him in and he did not understand such usage but i explained the whole mystery by saying i had bolted the door because i did not like the company of his servants and could not imagine the cause of his panic unless he thought i designed to ravish him an insult than which nothing was farther from my intention my father himself could scarce refrain from laughing at his ridiculous fear but seeing him in great confusion took pity on his condition and carried him off to his own lodgings after i had given my word that i would not attempt to escape but give him audience next morning i accordingly kept my promise and found means to persuade them to leave me at my own discretion next day i was rallied upon the stratagem i had contrived to frighten lord and a thousand idle stories were told about this adventure which happened literally as i have related it from bath i betook myself to a small house near lincoln which i had hired of the d of a because a country life suited best with my income which was no more than four hundred pounds a year and that not well paid i continued some months in this retirement and saw no company except lord r m who lived in the neighbourhood and visited me twice till finding myself indisposed i was obliged to remove to london and took lodgings in maddoxstreet where my garrison was taken by storm by my lord and his steward reinforced by mr l v who as my lord told me had a subsidy of fiveandtwenty pounds before he would take the field and a couple of hardy footmen this formidable band rushed into my apartment laid violent hands upon me dragged me downstairs without gloves or a cloak and thrusting me into a coach that stood at the door conveyed me to my lords lodgings in gloucesterstreet upon this occasion his lordship courageously drew his sword upon my woman who attempted to defend me from his insults and in all probability would have intimidated him from proceeding for he looked pale and aghast his knees knocked together and he breathed thick and hard with his nostrils dilated as if he had seen a ghost but he was encouraged by his mercenary associate who for the fiveandtwenty pounds stood by him in the day of trouble and spirited him on to this gallant enterprise in consequence of this exploit i was cooped up in a paltry apartment in gloucesterstreet where i was close beset by his lordship and his worthy steward mr h with a set of servants that were the creatures of this fellow of whom my lord himself stood in awe so that i could not help thinking myself in newgate among thieves and ruffians to such a degree did my terror avail that i actually believed i was in danger of being poisoned and would not receive any sustenance except from the hands of one harmlesslooking fellow a foreigner who was my lords valetdechambre i will not pretend to say my fears were just but such was my opinion of h that i never doubted he would put me out of the way if he thought my life interfered with his interest on the second day of my imprisonment i was visited by the duke of l a friend of my lord who found me sitting upon a trunk in a poor little diningroom filled with lumber and lighted with two bits of tallow candle which had been left overnight he perceived in my face a mixture of rage indignation terror and despair he compassionated my sufferings though he could not alleviate my distress any other way than by interceding with my tyrant to mitigate my oppression nevertheless i remained eleven days in this uncomfortable situation i was watched like a criminal all day and one of the servants walked from one room to another all night in the nature of a patrol while my lord who lay in the chamber above me got out of bed and tripped to the window at the sound of every coach that chanced to pass through the street h who was consummate in the arts of a sycophant began to court my favour by condoling my affliction and assuring me that the only method by which i could regain my liberty was a cheerful compliance with the humour of my lord i was fully convinced of the truth of this observation and though my temper is altogether averse to dissimulation attempted to affect an air of serenity and resignation but this disguise i found would not answer my purpose and therefore i had recourse to the assistance of my maid who was permitted to attend me in my confinement with her i frequently consulted about the means of accomplishing my escape in consequence of our deliberations she directed a coach and six to be ready at a certain part of the town and to wait for me three days in the same place in case i could not come before the expiration of that term this previous measure being taken according to my instructions the next necessary step was to elude the vigilance of my guard and in this manner did i effectuate my purpose being by this time indulged in the liberty of going out in the coach for the benefit of the air attended by two footmen who had orders to watch all my motions i made use of this privilege one forenoon when lord expected some company to dinner and bade the coachman drive to the lodgings of a man who wrote with his mouth intending to give my spies the slip on pretence of seeing this curiosity but they were too alert in their duty to be thus outwitted and followed me upstairs into the very apartment disappointed in this hope i resolved another scheme which was attended with success i bought some olives at an oilshop and telling the servants i would proceed to st jamessgate and take a turn in the park broke one of the bottles by the way complained of the misfortune when i was set down and desired my coach might be cleaned before my return while my attendants were employed in this office i tripped across the parade to the horse guards and chanced to meet with an acquaintance in the park who said he saw by my countenance that i was upon some expedition i owned his suspicion was just but as i had not time to relate particulars i quickened my pace and took possession of a hackneycoach in which i proceeded to the vehicle i had appointed to be in waiting while i thus compassed my escape there was nothing but perplexity and confusion at home dinner was delayed till six oclock my lord ran half the town over in quest of his equipage which at last returned with an account of my elopement my maid was brought to the question and grievously threatened but like all the women i ever had remained unshaken in her fidelity in the meantime i travelled night and day towards my retreat in lincolnshire of which his lordship had not as yet got the least intelligence and as my coachman was but an inexperienced driver i was obliged to make use of my own skill in that exercise and direct his endeavours the whole way without venturing to go to bed or take the least repose until i reached my own habitation there i lived in peace and tranquility for the space of six weeks when i was alarmed by one of my lords myrmidons who came into the neighbourhood blustering and swearing that he would carry me off either dead or alive it is not to be supposed that i was perfectly easy when i was made acquainted with his purpose and declaration as my whole family consisted of no more than a couple of women and one footman however i summoned up my courage which had been often tried and never forsook me in the day of danger and sent him word that if ever he should presume to approach my house i would order him to be shot without ceremony the fellow did not choose to put me to the trial and returned to town without his errand but as the place of my abode was now discovered i laid my account with having a visit from his employer i therefore planted spies upon the road with a promise of reward to him who should bring me the first intelligence of his lordships approach accordingly i was one morning apprised of his coming and mounting horse immediately with my woman and valet away we rode in defiance of winter in two days i traversed the wilds of lincolnshire and hundreds of essex crossed the river at tilbury breakfasted at chatham by the help of a guide and moonlight arrived at dover the same evening embarked for calais in which place i found myself next day at two oclock in the afternoon and being heartily tired with my journey betook myself to rest my maid who was not able to travel with such expedition followed me at an easier pace and the footman was so astonished at my perseverance that he could not help asking me upon the road if ever i was weary in my life certain it is my spirits and resolution have enabled me to undergo fatigues that are almost incredible from calais i went to brussels where i again set up my rest in private lodgings was again perfectly well received by the fashionable people of that place and by the interest of my friends obtained the queen of hungarys protection against the persecution of my husband while i should reside in the austrian netherlands thus secured i lived uncensured conversing with the english company with which this city was crowded but spent the most agreeable part of my time with the countess of calemberg in whose house i generally dined and supped and i also contracted an intimacy with the princess of chemay who was a great favourite with madame dharrach the governors lady i had not been long in this happy situation when i was disturbed by the arrival of lord who demanded me of the governor but finding me sheltered from his power he set out for vienna and in consequence of his representations strengthened with the duke of n s name my protection was withdrawn but before this application he had gone to the camp and addressed himself to my lord stair who was my particular friend and ally by my first marriage desiring he would compel me to return to his house his lordship told him that i was in no shape subject to his command but invited him to dinner with a view of diverting himself and company at the expense of his guest in the evening he was plied with so many bumpers to my health that he became intoxicated and extremely obstreperous insisted upon seeing lord stair after he was retired to rest and quarrelled with lord d who being a tall large rawboned scotchman could have swallowed him at one mouthful but he thought he might venture to challenge him in hopes of being put under arrest by the general though he reckoned without his host lord stair knew his disposition and in order to punish his presumption winked at the affair the challenger finding himself mistaken in his conjecture got up early in the morning and went off post for vienna and lord stair desired a certain man of quality to make me a visit and give me an account of his behaviour being now deprived of my protection and pinmoney which my generous husband would no longer pay i was reduced to great difficulty and distress the duchess daremberg lord g and many other persons of distinction interceded in my behalf with his majesty who was then abroad but he refused to interpose between man and wife the countess of calemberg wrote a letter to my father in which she represented my uncomfortable situation and undertook to answer for my conduct in case he would allow me a small annuity on which i could live independent of lord who by all accounts was a wretch with whom i could never enjoy the least happiness or quiet otherwise she would be the first to advise me to an accommodation she gave him to understand that her character was neither doubtful nor obscure and that if my conduct there had not been irreproachable she should not have taken me under her protection that as i proposed to board in a convent a small sum would answer my occasions but if that should be denied i would actually go to service or take some other desperate step to avoid the man who was my bane and aversion to this kind remonstrance my father answered that his fortune would not allow him to assist me he had now a young family and that i ought at all events to return to my husband by this time such was the extremity of my circumstances that i was forced to pawn my clothes and every trifling trinket in my possession and even to descend so far as to solicit mr s for a loan of fifty pounds which he refused thus was i deserted in my distress by two persons to whom in the season of my affluence my purse had been always open nothing so effectually subdues a spirit unused to supplicate as want repulsed in this manner i had recourse to lord b who was also it seems unable to relieve my necessities this mortification i deserved at his hands though he had once put it in my power to be above all such paltry applications and i should not have been compelled to the disagreeable task of troubling my friends had not i voluntarily resigned what he formerly gave me as to the other gentleman to whom i addressed myself on this occasion i think he might have shown more regard to my situation not only for the reasons already mentioned but because he knew me too well to be ignorant of what i must have suffered in condescending to make such a request several officers who guessed my adversity generously offered to supply me with money but i could not bring myself to make use of their friendship or even to own my distress except to one person of whom i borrowed a small sum to crown my misfortunes i was taken very ill at a time when there was no other way of avoiding the clutches of my persecutor but by a precipitate flight in this emergency i applied to a worthy gentleman of brussels a very good friend of mine but no lover i say no lover because every man is supposed to act in that capacity who befriends a young woman in distress this generous fleming set out with me in the night from brussels and conducted me to the frontier of france being very much indisposed both in mind and body when i was obliged to undertake this expedition i should in all probability have sunk under the fatigue of travelling had not my spirits been kept up by the conversation of my companion who was a man of business and consequence and undertook to manage my affairs in such a manner as would enable me to reestablish my residence in the place i had left he was young and active attended me with the utmost care and assiduity and left nothing undone which he thought would contribute to my ease and satisfaction i believe his friendship for me was a little tinctured with another passion but he was married and lived very well with his wife who was also my friend so that he knew i would never think of him in the light of a lover upon our arrival at valenciennes he accommodated me with a little money for a little was all i would take and returned to his own city after we had settled a correspondence by letters i was detained a day or two in this place by my indisposition which increased but nevertheless proceeded to paris to make interest for a protection from the king of france which that monarch graciously accorded me in three days after my first application and his minister sent orders to all the governors and intendants of the province towns to protect me against the efforts of lord in whatever place i should choose to reside having returned my thanks at versailles for this favour and tarried a few days at paris which was a place altogether unsuitable to the low ebb of my fortune i repaired to lisle where i intended to fix my habitation and there my disorder recurred with such violence that i was obliged to send for a physician who seemed to have been a disciple of sangrado for he scarce left a drop of blood in my body and yet i found myself never a whit the better indeed i was so much exhausted by these evacuations and my constitution so much impaired by fatigue and perturbation of mind that i had no other hope of recovering but that of reaching england and putting myself under the direction of a physician on whose ability i could depend with this doubtful prospect therefore i determined to attempt a return to my native air and actually departed from lisle in such a melancholy enfeebled condition that i had almost fainted when i was put into the coach but before i resolved upon this journey i was reduced to the utmost exigence of fortune so that i could scarce afford to buy provisions had it been in my power to eat and should not have been able to defray my travelling expenses had i not been generously befriended by lord r h who i am sure would have done anything for my case and accommodation though he has unjustly incurred the imputation of being parsimonious and i had no reason to expect any such favour at his hands in this deplorable state of health i was conveyed to calais being all the way as it were in the arms of death without having swallowed the least sustenance on the road so much was my indisposition augmented by the fatigue of the journey that i swooned when i was brought into the inn and had almost expired before i could receive the least assistance or advice however my spirits were a little revived by some bread and wine which i took at the persuasion of a french surgeon who chancing to pass by the door was called up to my relief having sent my servant to brussels to take care of my clothes i embarked in the packetboat and by the time we arrived at dover was almost in extremity here i found a return coach in which i was carried to london and was put to bed at the house we put up at more dead than alive the people of the inn sent for an apothecary who administered some cordial that recalled me to life and when i recovered the use of speech i told him who i was and desired him to wait upon dr s and inform him of my situation a young girl who was niece to the landlords wife seeing me unattended made a tender of her service to me and i accepted the offer as well as of a lodging in the apothecarys house to which i was conveyed as soon as my strength would admit of my removal there i was visited by my physician who was shocked to find me in such a dangerous condition however having considered my case he perceived that my indisposition proceeded from the calamities i had undergone and encouraged me with the hope of a speedy cure provided i could be kept easy and undisturbed i was accordingly attended with all imaginable care my lords name being never mentioned in my hearing because i considered him as the fatal source of all my misfortunes and in a month i recovered my health by the great skill and tenderness of my doctor who now finding me strong enough to encounter fresh troubles endeavoured to persuade me that it would be my wisest step to return to my husband whom at that time he had often occasion to see but i rejected his proposal commencing a new lawsuit for separation and took a small house in st jamesssquare about this time my woman returned from brussels but without my clothes which were detained on account of the money i owed in that place and asking her dismission from my service set up shop for herself i had not lived many weeks in my new habitation when my persecutor renewed his attempts to make himself master of my person but i had learned from experience to redouble my vigilance and he was frustrated in all his endeavours i was again happy in the conversation of my former acquaintance and visited by a great number of gentlemen mostly persons of probity and sense who cultivated my friendship without any other motive of attachment not that i was unsolicited on the article of love that was a theme on which i never wanted orators and could i have prevailed upon myself to profit by the advances that were made i might have managed my opportunities so as to have set fortune at defiance for the future but i was none of these economists who can sacrifice their hearts to interested considerations one evening while i was conversing with three or four of my friends my lawyer came in and told me he had something of consequence to impart upon which all the gentlemen but one went away then he gave me to understand that my suit would immediately come to trial and though he hoped the best the issue was uncertain that if it should be given against me the decision would inspire my lord with fresh spirits to disturb my peace and therefore it would be convenient for me to retire until the affair should be brought to a determination i was very much disconcerted at this intelligence and the gentleman who stayed perceiving my concern asked what i intended to do or if he could serve me in any shape and desired to know whither i proposed to retreat i affected to laugh and answered to a garret i believe to this overstrained reasoning he replied that if i should his friendship and regard would find the way to my apartment and i had no reason to doubt the sincerity of his declaration we consulted about the measures i should take and i determined to remove into the country where i was soon favoured with a letter from him wherein he expressed the infinite pleasure he had in being able to assure me that my suit had been successful and that i might appear again with great safety accordingly i returned to town in his coach and six which he had sent for my convenience and the same evening went with him to the masquerade where we passed the night very agreeably his spirits as well as mine being elevated to a joyous pitch by the happy event of my process this gentleman was a person of great honour worth and goodnature he loved me extremely but did not care that i should know the extent of his passion on the contrary he endeavoured to persuade me he had laid it down as a maxim that no woman should ever have power enough over his heart to give him the least pain or disquiet in short he had made a progress in my affection and to his generosity was i indebted for my subsistence two whole years during which he was continually professing this philosophic indifference while at the same time he was giving me daily assurances of his friendship and esteem and treated me with incessant marks of the most passionate love so that i concluded his intention was cold though his temper was warm considering myself as an encumbrance upon his fortune i redoubled my endeavours to obtain a separate maintenance from my lord and removed from st jamesssquare to lodgings at kensington where i had not long enjoyed myself in tranquility before i was interrupted by a very unexpected visit while i was busy one day dressing in my diningroom i found his lordship at my elbow before i was aware of his approach although his coach was at the door and the house already in the possession of his servants he accosted me in the usual style as if we had parted the night before and i answered him with an appearance of the same careless familiarity desiring him to sit down while i retreated to my chamber locked the door and fairly went to bed being perhaps the first woman who went thither for protection from the insults of a man here then i immured myself with my faithful abigail my lord finding me secured knocked at the door and through the keyhole begged to be admitted assuring me that all he wanted was a conference i desired to be excused though i believed his assurance but i had no inclination to converse with him because i knew from experience the nature of his conversation which was so disagreeable and tormenting that i would have exchanged it at any time for a good beating and thought myself a gainer by the bargain however he persisted in his importunities to such a degree that i assented to his proposal on condition that the duke of l should be present at the interview and he immediately sent a message for his grace while i in peace ate my breakfast conveyed in a basket which was hoisted up to the window of my bedchamber the duke was so kind as to come at my lords request and before i would open the door gave me his word that i should be protected from all violence and compulsion thus assured they were permitted to enter my little gentleman sitting down by my bedside began to repeat the old hackneyed arguments he had formerly used with a view of inducing me to live with him and i on my side repeated my former objections or pretended to listen to his representations while my imagination was employed in contriving the means of effecting an escape as the duke easily perceived by my countenance finding all his remonstrances ineffectual he quitted the chamber and left his cause to the eloquence of his grace who sat with me a whole halfhour without exerting himself much in behalf of his client because he knew i was altogether obstinate and determined on that score but joked upon the behaviour of his lordship who though jealous of most people had left him alone with me in my bedchamber observing that he must neither have great confidence in his virtue or a very bad opinion of him otherwise in short i found means to defer the categorical answer till next day and invited the duke and his lordship to dine with me tomorrow my wise yokefellow seemed to doubt the sincerity of this invitation and was very much disposed to keep possession of my house but by the persuasion of his grace and the advice of h who was his chief counsellor and back he was prevailed upon to take my word and for the present left me they were no sooner retired than i rose with great expedition packed up my clothes and took shelter in essex for the first time next day my lord and his noble friend came to dinner according to appointment and being informed of my escape by my woman whom i left in the house his lordship discovered some signs of discontent and insisted upon seeing my papers upon which my maid produced a parcel of bills which i owed to different people notwithstanding this disappointment he sat down to what was provided for dinner and with great deliberation ate up a leg of lamb the best part of a fowl and something else which i do not now remember and then very peaceably went away giving my maid an opportunity of following me to the place of my retreat my intention was to have sought refuge as formerly in another country but i was prevented from putting my design in execution by a fit of illness during which i was visited by my physician and some of my own relations particularly a distant cousin of mine whom my lord had engaged in his interests by promising to recompense her amply if she could persuade me to comply with his desire in this office she was assisted by the doctor who was my friend and a man of sense for whom i have the most perfect esteem though he and i have often differed in point of opinion in a word i was exposed to the incessant importunities of all my acquaintance which added to the desperate circumstances of my fortune compelled me to embrace the terms that were offered and i again returned to the domestic duties of a wife i was conducted to my lords house by an old friend of mine a gentleman turned of fifty of admirable parts and understanding he was a pleasing companion cheerful and humane and had acquired a great share of my esteem and respect in a word his advice had great weight in my deliberations because it seemed to be the result of experience and disinterested friendship without all doubt he had an unfeigned concern for my welfare but being an admirable politician his scheme was to make my interest coincide with his own inclinations for i had unwittingly made an innovation upon his heart and as he thought i should hardly favour his passion while i was at liberty to converse with the rest of my admirers he counselled me to surrender that freedom well knowing that my lord would be easily persuaded to banish all his rivals from the house in which case he did not doubt of his being able to insinuate himself into my affections because he laid it down as an eternal truth that if any two persons of different sexes were obliged to live together in a desert where they would be excluded from all other human intercourse they would naturally and inevitably contract an inclination for each other how just this hypothesis might be i leave to the determination of the curious though if i may be allowed to judge from my own disposition a couple so situated would be apt to imbibe mutual disgusts from the nature and necessity of their union unless their association was at first the effect of reciprocal affection and esteem be this as it will i honour the gentleman for his plan which was ingeniously contrived and artfully conducted but i happened to have too much address for him in the sequel cunning as he was though at first i did not perceive his drift and his lordship was much less likely to comprehend his meaning immediately after this new accommodation i was carried to a country house belonging to my lord and was simple enough to venture myself unattended by any servant on whose integrity i could depend in the hands of his lordship and h whose villainy i always dreaded though at this time my apprehensions were considerably increased by recollecting that it was not his interest to let me live in the house lest his conduct should be inquired into and by remembering that the very house to which we were going had been twice burnt down in a very short space of time not without suspicion of his having been the incendiary on account of some box of writings which was lost in the conflagration true it is this imputation was never made good and perhaps he was altogether innocent of the charge which nevertheless affected my spirits in such a manner as rendered me the most miserable of all mortals in this terror did i remain till my consternation was awakened by the arrival of mr b a goodnatured worthy man whom my lord had invited to his house and i thought would not see me illused in a few weeks we were joined by dr s and his lady who visited us according to their promise and it was resolved that we should set out for tunbridge on a party of pleasure and at our return examine h s accounts this last part of our scheme was not at all relished by our worthy steward who therefore determined to overturn our whole plan and succeeded accordingly my lord all of a sudden declared himself against the jaunt we had projected and insisted upon my staying at home without assigning any reason for this peremptory behaviour his countenance being cloudy and for the space of three days he did not open his mouth at last he one night entered my bedchamber to which he now had free access with his sword under his arm and if i remember aright it was ready drawn i could not help taking notice of this alarming circumstance which shocked me the more as it happened immediately after a gloomy fit of discontent however i seemed to overlook the incident and dismissing my maid went to bed because i was ashamed to acknowledge even to my own heart any dread of a person whom i despised so much however the strength of my constitution was not equal to the fortitude of my mind i was taken ill and the servants were obliged to be called up while my lord himself terrified at my situation ran upstairs to mrs s who was in bed told her with evident perturbation of spirits that i was very much indisposed and said he believed i was frightened by his entering my chamber with his sword in hand this lady was so startled at his information that she ran into my apartment half naked and as she went downstairs asked what reason could induce him to have carried his sword with him upon which he gave her to understand that his intention was to kill the bats i believe and hope he had no other design than that of intimidating me but when the affair happened i was of a different opinion mrs s having put on her clothes sat up all night by my bedside and was so good as to assure me that she would not leave me until i should be safely delivered from the apprehensions that surrounded me in this house to which she and the doctor had been the principal cause of my coming for my lord had haunted and importuned them incessantly on this subject protesting that he loved me with the most inviolable affection and all he desired was that i would sit at his table manage his family and share his fortune by these professions uttered with an air of honesty and goodnature he had imposed himself upon them for the best tempered creature upon earth and they used all their influence with me to take him into favour this has been the case with a great many people who had but a superficial knowledge of his disposition but in the course of their acquaintance they have never failed to discern and acknowledge their mistake the doctor on his return from tunbridge to which place he had made a trip by himself found me ill abed and the whole family in confusion surprised and concerned at this disorder he entered into expostulation with my lord who owned that the cause of his displeasure and disquiet was no other than jealousy he had informed him that i had been seen to walk out with mr bal in a morning and that our correspondence had been observed with many additional circumstances which were absolutely false and groundless this imputation was no sooner understood than it was resolved that the accuser should be examined in presence of us all he accordingly appeared exceedingly drunk though it was morning and repeated the articles of the charge as an information he had received from a man who came from town to hang the bells and was long ago returned to london this was an instance of his cunning and address which did not forsake him even in his hours of intoxication had he fixed the calumny on any one of the servants he would have been confronted and detected in his falsehood nevertheless though he could not be legally convicted it plainly appeared that he was the author of this defamation which incensed mr bal to such a degree that he could scarce be withheld from punishing him on the spot by manual chastisement however he was prevailed upon to abstain from such immediate vengeance as a step unworthy of his character and the affair was brought to this issue that his lordship should either part with me or mr h for i was fully determined against living under the same roof with such an incendiary this alternative being proposed my lord dismissed his steward and we returned to town with the doctor and mrs s for i had imbibed such horror and aversion for this country seat though one of the pleasantest in england that i could not bear to live in it we therefore removed to a house in bondstreet where according to the advice of my friends i exerted my whole power and complaisance in endeavours to keep my husband in goodhumour but was so unsuccessful in my attempts that if ever he was worse tempered more capricious or intolerable at one time than at another this was the season in which his illhumour predominated in the most rancorous degree i was scarce ever permitted to stir abroad saw nobody at home but my old male friend whom i have mentioned above and the doctor with his lady from whose conversation also i was at last excluded nevertheless i contrived to steal a meeting now and then with my late benefactor for whom i entertained a great share of affection exclusive of that gratitude that was due to his generosity it was not his fault that i compromised matters with my lord for he was as free of his purse as i was unwilling to use it it would therefore have been unfriendly unkind and ungrateful in me now that i was in affluence to avoid all intercourse with a man who had supported me in adversity i think people cannot be too shy and scrupulous in receiving favours but once they are conferred they ought never to forget the obligation and i was never more concerned at any incident of my life than at hearing that this gentleman did not receive a letter in which i acknowledged the last proof of his friendship and liberality which i had occasion to use because i have since learned that he suspected me of neglect but to return to my situation in bondstreet i bore it as well as i could for the space of three months during which i lived in the midst of spies who were employed to watch my conduct and underwent every mortification that malice power and folly could inflict nay so ridiculous so unreasonable was my tyrant in his spleen that he declared he would even be jealous of heydigger if there was no other man to incur his suspicion he expected that i should spend my whole time with him teteatete when i sacrificed my enjoyment to these comfortable parties he never failed to lay hold on some innocent expression of mine which he made the foundation of a quarrel and when i strove to avoid these disagreeable misinterpretations by reading or writing he incessantly teased and tormented me with the imputation of being peevish sullen and reserved harassed by this insufferable behaviour i communicated my case to dr s and his lady intimating that i neither could nor would expose myself any longer to such usage the doctor exhorted me to bear my fate with patience and mrs s was silent on the subject so that i still hesitated between staying and going when the doctor being one night at supper happened to have some words with my lord who was so violently transported with passion that i was actually afraid of going to bed with him and next morning when he awakened there was such an expression of frantic wildness in his countenance that i imagined he was actually distracted this alarming circumstance confirmed me in my resolution of decamping and i accordingly moved my quarters to a house in sackvillestreet where i had lodged when i was a widow from thence i sent a message to the duke of l desiring he would make my lord acquainted with the place of my abode my reasons for removing and my intention to defend myself against all his attempts the first night of this separation i went to bed by myself with as much pleasure as a man would feel in going to bed to his mistress whom he had long solicited in vain so rejoiced was i to be delivered from my obnoxious bedfellow from these lodgings i soon moved to brookstreet where i had not long enjoyed the sweets of my escape when i was importuned to return by a new steward whom my lord had engaged in the room of h this gentleman who bore a very fair character made such judicious representations and behaved so candidly in the discharge of his function that i agreed he should act as umpire in the difference betwixt us and once more a reconciliation was effected though his lordship began to be dissatisfied even before the execution of our agreement in consequence of which he attended me to bath whither i went for the benefit of my health which was not a little impaired this accommodation had a surprising effect upon my lover who notwithstanding his repeated declarations that no woman should ever gain such an ascendancy over his heart as to be able to give him pain suffered all the agonies of disappointed love when he now found himself deprived of the opportunities of seeing me and behaved very differently from what he had imagined he should his words and actions were desperate one of his expressions to me was it is like twisting my heartstrings and tearing it out of my body indeed i never should have acted this part had i foreseen what he would have suffered but i protest i believed him when he said otherwise so much that his declaration on that subject was the occasion of my giving him up and it was now too late to retract in our expedition to bath i was accompanied by a very agreeable young lady with whom i passed my time very happily amid the diversions of the place which screened me in a good measure from the vexatious society of my hopeful partner from this place we repaired to his seat in the country where we spent a few months and thence returned again to our house in bondstreet here while i was confined to my bed by illness it was supposed my indisposition was no other than a private lyingin though i was under the roof with my lord and attended by his servants while the distemper continued my lord to do him justice behaved with all imaginable tenderness and care and his concern on these occasions i have already mentioned as a strange inconsistency in his disposition if his actions were at all accountable i should think he took pains to fret me into a fever first in order to manifest his love and humanity afterwards when i recovered my strength and spirits i went abroad saw company and should have been easy had he been contented but as my satisfaction increased his goodhumour decayed and he banished from his house one by one all the people whose conversation could have made my life agreeable i often expostulated with him on his malignant behaviour protesting my desire of living peaceably with him and begging he would not lay me under the necessity of changing my measures he was deaf to all my remonstrances though i warned him more than once of the event persisted in his maxims of persecution and after repeated quarrels i again left his house fully determined to suffer all sorts of extremity rather than subject myself to the tyranny of his disposition this year was productive of one fatal event which i felt with the utmost sensibility of sorrow and i shall always remember with regret i mean the death of mr b with whom i had constantly maintained an intimate correspondence since the first commencement of our acquaintance he was one of the most valuable men and promised to be one of the brightest ornaments that this or any other age had produced i enjoyed his friendship without reserve and such was the confidence he reposed in my integrity from long experience of my truth that he often said he would believe my bare assertion even though it should contradict the evidence of his own senses these being the terms upon which we lived it is not to be supposed that i bore the loss of him without repining indeed my grief was unspeakable and though the edge of it be now smoothed by the lenient hand of time i shall never cease to cherish his memory with the most tender remembrance during the last period of my living with my lord i had agreed to the expediency of obtaining an act of parliament which would enable him to pay his debts on which occasion there was a necessity of cancelling a deed that subsisted between us relating to a separate maintenance to which on certain provisions i was entitled and this was to be set aside so far as it interfered with the abovementioned scheme while the rest of it should remain in force when this affair was about to be transacted my lord very generously insisted upon my concurrence in annulling the whole settlement and when i refused to comply with this demand because this was the sole resource i had against his illusage he would not proceed in the execution of his plan though by dropping it he hurt nobody but himself and he accused me of having receded from my word after i had drawn him into considerable expense this imputation of breaking my word which i defy the whole world to prove i ever did incensed me the more as i myself had proposed the scheme for his service although i knew the accomplishment of it would endanger the validity of my own settlement and my indignation was still more augmented by the behaviour of mr g who had always professed a regard for my interest and upon my last accommodation with my lord undertaken to effect a reconciliation between my father and me but when he was questioned about the particulars of this difference and desired to declare whether his lordship or i was to blame he declined the office of arbitrator refused to be explicit upon the subject and by certain shrewd hums and has signified his disapprobation of my conduct yet this very man when i imparted to him in confidence my intention of making another retreat and frankly asked his opinion of my design seemed to acquiesce in the justice of it in these remarkable words madam if i thought or had hopes of my lord growing better i would down on my knees to desire you to stay but as i have not i say nothing if he connived at my conduct in this particular why should he disapprove of it when all i asked was but common justice but he was a dependant and therefore i excuse his phlegmatic not to call it unfriendly behaviour indeed he could not be too cautious of giving offence to his lordship who sometimes made him feel the effects of that wrath which other people had kindled particularly in consequence of a small adventure which happened about this very period of time a very agreeable sprightly goodnatured young man a near relation of my lord happening to be at our house one evening when there was a fire in the neighbourhood we agreed to go and sup at the tavern en famille and having spent the evening with great mirth and goodhumour this young gentleman who was naturally facetious in taking his leave saluted us all round my lord who had before entertained some jealousy of his kinsman was very much provoked by this trifling incident but very prudently suppressed his displeasure till he returned to his own house where his rage cooperating with the champagne he had drunk inflamed him to such a degree of resolution that he sprang upon the innocent g and collared him with great fury though he was altogether unconcerned in the cause of his indignation this extravagant and frantic behaviour added to other grievances under which i laboured hastened my resolution of leaving him and he to this day blames his relation as the immediate cause of my escape whereas he ought to place it to the account of his own madness and indiscretion when i retired to parkstreet he cautioned all my tradesmen not even excepting my baker against giving me credit assuring them that he would not pay any debts i should contract and the difficulties to which i was reduced in consequence of this charitable declaration together with the reflection of what i had suffered and might undergo from the caprice and barbarity of his disposition affected my health so much that i was again taken ill and my life thought in danger my constitution however got the better of my distemper and i was ordered into the country by my physicians for the benefit of the air so that i found myself under the necessity of keeping two houses when i was little able to support one and set up my chariot because i could not defray the expense of a hackneycoach for i had as much credit given me as i asked for notwithstanding my lords orders to the contrary having recruited my spirits in the country i returned to town and was visited by my friends who never forsook me in adversity and in the summer removed to a house in essex where i lived a few months in great tranquility unmolested by my tyrant who sometimes gave me a whole years respite here i used to ride and drive by turns as my humour dictated with horses which were lent me and i had the company of my lover and another gentleman who was a very agreeable companion and of singular service to me in the sequel at last my lord having received intelligence of the place of my abode and his tormenting humour recurring he set out for my habitation and in the morning appeared in his coach and six attended by mr g and another person whom he had engaged for the purpose with several domestics armed i immediately shut up my doors at his approach and refused him admittance which he endeavoured to obtain by a succession of prayers and threats but i was deaf to both and resolved to hold out to the last seeing me determined he began his attack and his servants actually forced their way into the house upon which i retreated upstairs and fortified myself in my apartment which the assailants stormed with such fury that the door began to give way and i retired into another room whilst i remained in this post mr g demanded a parley in which he begged i would favour my lord with an interview otherwise he knew not what might be the consequence to this remonstrance i replied that i was not disposed to comply with his request and though their design should be murder i was not at all afraid of death upon this declaration they renewed their attacks which they carried on with indifferent success till the afternoon when my lord as if he had been at play sent a formal message to me desiring that all hostilities should cease till after both parties should have dined at the same time my own servants came for instructions and i ordered them to let him have everything which he should call for as far as the house would afford he did not fail to make use of this permission but sitting down with his companions ate up my dinner without hesitation after he had paid me the compliment of desiring to know what he should send up to my apartment far from having any stomach to partake of his meal i sat solitary upon my bed in a state of melancholy expectation having fastened the door of the outward room for my security while i kept my chamber open for the convenience of air the weather being excessively hot his lordship having indulged his appetite resumed his attempt and all of a sudden i heard a noise in the next room upon which i started up and perceiving that he had got into my antechamber by the help of a bench that stood under the window i flung to the door of my room which i locked with great expedition and opening another that communicated with the staircase ran out of the house through a crowd of more than a hundred people whom this fray had gathered together being universally beloved in the neighbourhood and respected by my lords servants i passed among them untouched and took refuge in a neighbouring cottage while his lordship bawled and roared for assistance being afraid to come out as he had gone in without waiting for his deliberations i changed clothes with the poor woman who had given me shelter and in her blue apron and straw hat sallied out into the fields intending to seek protection in the house of a gentleman not far off though i was utterly ignorant of the road that led me to it however it was my good fortune to meet with a farmer who undertook to conduct me to the place otherwise i should have missed my way and in all probability lain in the fields for by this time it was eight oclock at night under the direction of this guide i traversed hedges and ditches for i would not venture to travel in the highway lest i should fall into the hands of my pursuer and after i had actually tumbled into the mire and walked six or seven long miles by the help of a good spirit which never failed me on such occasions i arrived at the place and rung the bell at the garden gate for admittance seeing my figure which was very uncouth together with my draggled condition they denied me entrance but when they understood who i was immediately opened the door and i was hospitably entertained after having been the subject of mirth on account of my dress and adventure next day i returned and took possession of my house again where i resumed my former amusements which i enjoyed in quiet for the space of a whole month waiting with resignation for the issue of my lawsuit when one afternoon i was apprised of his lordships approach by one of my spies whom i always employed to reconnoitre the road and so fortunate was i in the choice of these scouts that i never was betrayed by one of them though they were often bribed for that purpose i no sooner received this intelligence than i ordered my horse to be saddled and mounting rode out of sight immediately directing my course a different way from the london road i had not long proceeded in this track when my career was all of a sudden stopped by a fivebar gate which after some hesitation i resolved to leap my horse being an old hunter if i should find myself pursued however with much difficulty i made a shift to open it and arrived in safety at the house of my very good friend mr g who being a justice of the peace had promised me his protection if it should be wanted thus secured for the present i sent out spies to bring information of his lordships proceedings and understood that he had taken possession of my house turned my servants adrift and made himself master of all my movables clothes and papers as for the papers they were of no consequence but of clothes i had a good stock and when i had reason to believe that he did not intend to relinquish his conquest i thought it was high time for me to remove to a greater distance from his quarters accordingly two days after my escape i set out at eleven oclock at night in a chariot and four which i borrowed of my friend attended by a footman who was a stout fellow and well armed i myself being provided with a brace of good pistols which i was fully determined to use against any person who should presume to lay violent hands upon me except my lord for whom a less mortal weapon would have sufficed such as a bodkin or a tinderbox nothing could be farther from my intention than the desire of hurting any living creature much less my husband my design was only to defend myself from cruelty and oppression which i knew by fatal experience would infallibly be my lot should he get me into his power and i thought i had as good a right to preserve my happiness as that which every individual has to preserve his life especially against a set of ruffians who were engaged to rob me of it for a little dirty lucre in the midst of our journey the footman came up and told me i was dogged upon which i looked out and seeing a man riding by the chariot side presented one of my pistols out of my window and preserved that posture of defence until he thought proper to retreat and rid me of the fears that attended his company i arrived in town and changing my equipage hired an open chaise in which though i was almost starved with cold i travelled to reading which i reached by ten next morning and from thence proceeded farther in the country with a view of taking refuge with mrs c who was my particular friend here i should have found shelter though my lord had been beforehand with me and endeavoured to prepossess her against my conduct had not the house been crowded with company among whom i could not possibly have been concealed especially from her brother who was an intimate friend of my persecutor things being thus situated i enjoyed but a very short interview with her in which her sorrow and perplexity on my account appeared with great expression in her countenance and though it was not in her power to afford me the relief i expected she in the most genteel manner sent after me a small sum of money thinking that considering the hurry in which i left my house i might have occasion for it on the road i was by this time benumbed with cold fatigued with travelling and almost fretted to death by my disappointment however this was no time to indulge despondence since nobody could or would assist me i stood the more in need of my own resolution and presence of mind after some deliberation i steered my course back to london and being unwilling to return by the same road in which i came as well as impatient to be at the end of my journey i chose the bagshot way and ventured to cross the heath by moonlight here i was attacked by a footpad armed with a broadsword who came up and demanded my money my stock amounted to twelve guineas and i foresaw that should i be stripped of the whole sum i could not travel without discovering who i was and consequently running the risk of being detected by my pursuer on these considerations i gave the fellow three guineas and some silver with which he was so far from being satisfied that he threatened to search me for more but i ordered the coachman to proceed and by good fortune escaped that ceremony though i was under some apprehension of being overtaken with a pistol bullet in my flight and therefore held down my head in the chaise in imitation of some great men who are said to have ducked in the same manner in the day of battle my fears happened to be disappointed i lay at an inn upon the road and next day arrived in town in the utmost difficulty and distress for i knew not where to fix my habitation and was destitute of all means of support in this dilemma i applied to my lawyer who recommended me to the house of a tradesman in westminster where i lodged and boarded upon credit with my faithful abigail whom i shall distinguish by the name of mrs s for the space of ten weeks during which i saw nobody and never once stirred abroad while i was thus harassed out of all enjoyment of life and reduced to the utmost indigence by the cruelty of my persecutor who had even stripped me of my wearing apparel i made a conquest of lord d a nobleman who is now dead and therefore i shall say little of his character which is perfectly well known this only will i observe that next to my own tyrant he was the person of whom i had the greatest abhorrence nevertheless when these two came in competition i preferred the offers of this new lover which were very considerable and as an asylum was the chief thing i wanted agreed to follow him to his country seat whither i actually sent my clothes which i had purchased upon credit however upon mature deliberation i changed my mind and signified my resolution in a letter desiring at the same time that my baggage might be sent back in consequence of this message i expected a visit from him in all the rage of indignation and disappointment and gave orders that he should not be admitted into my house yet notwithstanding this precaution he found means to procure entrance and one of the first objects that i saw next morning in my bedchamber was my lover armed with a horsewhip against which from the knowledge of the man i did not think myself altogether secure though i was not much alarmed because i believed myself superior to him in point of bravery should the worst come to the worst but contrary to my expectation and his usual behaviour to our sex he accosted me very politely and began to expostulate on the contents of my letter i freely told him that i had rashly assented to his proposal for my own convenience only that when i reflected on what i had done i thought it ungenerous in me to live with him upon these terms and that as i did not like him and could not dissemble such a correspondence could never tend to the satisfaction of either he allowed the inference was just though he was very much chagrined at my previous proceeding he relinquished his claim restored my clothes and never afterwards upbraided me with my conduct in this affair though he at one time owned that he still loved me and ever should because i had used him ill a declaration that strongly marks the peculiarity of his character as for my own part i own that my behaviour on this occasion is no other way excusable than on account of the miserable perplexity of my circumstances which were often so calamitous that i wonder i have not been compelled to take such steps as would have rendered my conduct much more exceptionable than it really is at last all my hopes were blasted by the issue of my suit which was determined in favour of my lord even then i refused to yield on the contrary coming out of retirement i took lodgings in suffolkstreet and set my tyrant at defiance but being unwilling to trust my doors to the care of other people i hired a house in conduitstreet and no sooner appeared in the world again than i was surrounded by divers and sundry sorts of admirers i believe i received the incense and addresses of all kinds under the sun except that sort which was most to my liking a man capable of contracting and inspiring a mutual attachment but such a one is equally rare and inestimable not but that i own myself greatly obliged to all those who cultivated my good graces though they were very little beholden to me for where i did not really love i could never profess that passion that sort of dissimulation is a slavery that no honest nature will undergo except one worthy young man whom i sometimes saw they were a strange medley of insignificant beings one was insipid another ridiculously affected a third void of all education a fourth altogether inconsistent and in short i found as many trifling characters among the men as ever i observed in my own sex some of them i endeavoured to bring over to my maxims while they attempted to make a proselyte of me but finding the task impracticable on both sides we very wisely dropped each other at length however i was blessed with the acquaintance of one nobleman who is perhaps the first character in england in point of honour integrity wit sense and benevolence when i have thus distinguished him i need scarce mention lord this great this good man possesses every accomplishment requisite to inspire admiration love and esteem with infinitely more merit than almost ever fell to one mans share he manifests such diffidence of his own qualifications as cannot fail to prepossess every company in his favour he seems to observe nothing yet sees everything his manner of telling a story and making trifles elegant is peculiar to himself and though he has a thousand oddities they serve only to make him more agreeable after what i have said it may be supposed that i was enamoured of his person but this was not the case love is altogether capricious and fanciful yet i admire honour and esteem him to the highest degree and when i observe that his character resembled that of my dear departed friend mr b or rather that mr b had he lived would have resembled lord i pay the highest compliment i can conceive both to the living and to the dead in this noblemans friendship and conversation i thought myself happy though i was as usual exposed to the indefatigable efforts of my lord who one day while i was favoured with the company of this generous friend appeared at my door in his coach attended by another gentleman who demanded entrance with an air of authority a very honest footman who had been long in my service ran upstairs in the utmost consternation and gave me an account of what had happened below upon which i told him he had nothing to answer for and ordered him to keep the door fast shut against all opposition though i was so much affected with this unexpected assault that lord said he was never more surprised and shocked in his life than at the horror which appeared in my countenance when i saw the coach stop at my door my little hero being refused admittance went away threatening to return speedily with a reinforcement and during this interval i provided myself with a soldier whom i placed sentinel at the door within side to guard me from the danger of such assaults for the future my lord true to his promise marched back with his auxiliaries reinforced with a constable and repeated his demand of being admitted and my soldier opening the sash in order to answer him according to my directions he no sooner perceived the red coat than he was seized with such a panic that he instantly fled with great precipitation and when he recounted the adventure like falstaff in the play multiplied my guard into a whole file of musqueteers he also made a shift to discover the gentleman who had been so kind as to lend me one of his company and complained of him to the duke of n in hopes of seeing him broke for his misdemeanour but in that expectation he was luckily disappointed perceiving that in england i should never enjoy peace but be continually subject to those alarms and disquiets which had already impaired my health and spirits i resolved to repair again to france my best refuge and sure retreat from the persecution of my tyrant yet before i took this step i endeavoured by the advice of my friends to conceal myself near windsor but was in a little time discovered by my lord and hunted out of my lurkingplace accordingly i then removed to chelsea where i suffered inconceivable uneasiness and agitation of mind from the nature of my situation my tranquility being thus incessantly invaded by a man who could not be satisfied with me and yet could not live without me so that though i was very much indisposed i set out for france by way of the hague as the war had shut up all other communication having no other attendant but my woman s who though she dreaded the sea and was upon the brink of matrimony would not quit me in such a calamitous condition until i was joined by my footman and another maid whom i ordered to follow me with the baggage but before my departure i sent a message to lord demanding my clothes which he had seized in essex and he refusing to deliver them i was obliged to equip myself anew upon credit i was supplied with money for my journey by my good friend l and after a short and pleasant passage arrived at the hague where i stayed two months and parted with s on whom i settled an annuity of fiveandtwenty pounds payable out of the provision which i had or might obtain from my husband the same allowance had i prevailed upon lord b to grant to another maid who attended me while i lived in his house i did not much relish the people in holland because they seemed entirely devoted to selfinterest without any taste for pleasure or politeness a species of disposition that could not be very agreeable to me who always despised money had an unbounded benevolence of heart and loved pleasure beyond every other consideration when i say pleasure i would not be understood to mean sensuality which constitutes the supreme happiness of those only who are void of sentiment and imagination nevertheless i received some civilities in this place and among the rest the reputation of having for my lover the king of p s minister who was young and airy and visited me often circumstances that were sufficient to lay me under the imputation of an amour which i frequently incurred without having given the least cause of suspicion having taken leave of my dutch friends i departed from the hague in company with an english woman whom i had chosen for that purpose and arrived at antwerp with much difficulty and danger the highway being infested with robbers after having reposed myself a few days in this city i hired a coach for myself and set out with my companion for brussels but before we reached mechlin our vehicle was attacked by two hussars who with their sabres drawn obliged the coachman to drive into a wood near the road i at first imagined that they wanted to examine our passports but was soon too well convinced of their design and though very much shocked at the discovery found resolution enough to suppress my concern so that it should not aggravate the terrors of the young woman who had almost died with apprehension i even encouraged her to hope for the best and addressing myself to the robbers in french begged in the most suppliant manner that they would spare our lives upon which one of them who was a little fellow assured me in the same language that we had nothing to fear for our persons when we were conveyed in a state of dreadful suspense about threequarters of a mile into the wood the ruffians came into the coach and taking my keys which i kept ready in my hand for them opened three large trunks that contained my baggage and emptying them of everything but my hoops and a few books packed up their booty in a cloth then robbed me of my money and jewels even to my shoebuckles and sleevebuttons took my footmans laced hat and gave it by way of gratification to a peasant who came from behind the bushes and assisted them in packing this affair being despatched they ordered us to return to the road by a different way from that in which we were carried into the wood and mounting their horses rode off with the plunder though not before the little fellow who was the least ferocious of the two had come and shaken me by the hand wishing us a good journey a compliment which i heartily returned being extremely well pleased with the retreat of two such companions who had detained us a whole halfhour during which notwithstanding the assurance i had received i was in continual apprehension of seeing their operation concluded with the murder of us all for i supposed they were of that gang who had some time before murdered a french officer and used a lady extremely ill after having rifled her of all she had having thus undergone pillage and being reduced to the extremity of indigence in a foreign land it is not to be supposed that my reflections were very comfortable and yet though i sustained the whole damage i was the only person in the company who bore the accident with any resolution and presence of mind my coachman and valet seemed quite petrified with fear and it was not till i had repeated my directions that the former drove farther into the wood and took the first turning to the right in order to regain the road according to the command of the robbers which i did not choose to disobey this misfortune i suffered by the misinformation i received at antwerp where i would have provided myself with an escort had not i been assured that there was not the least occasion to put myself to such extraordinary expense and indeed the robbers took the only halfhour in which they could have had an opportunity of plundering us for we no sooner returned into the highway than we met with the french artillery coming from brussels which was a security to us during the rest of our journey we were afterwards informed at a small village that there was actually a large gang of deserters who harboured in that wood from which they made excursions in the neighbourhood and kept the peasants in continual alarms having proceeded a little way we were stopped by the artillery crossing a bridge and as the train was very long must have been detained till night had not a soldier informed me that if i would take the trouble to come out of my coach and apply to the commandant he would order them to halt and allow me to pass i took the mans advice and was by him conducted with much difficulty through the crowd to some officers who seemed scarce to deserve the name for when i signified my request they neither rose up nor desired me to sit down but lolling in their chairs with one leg stretched out asked with an air of disrespectful raillery where i was going and when i answered to paris desired to know what i would do there i who am naturally civil where i am civilly used and saucy enough where i think myself treated with disregard was very much piqued at their insolent and unmannerly behaviour and began to reply to the impertinent questions very abruptly so that a very tart dialogue would have ensued had not the conversation been interrupted by a tall thin genteel young french nobleman an officer in the army who chancing to come in asked with great politeness what i would please to have i then repeated my desire and produced my passports by which he learned who i was he immediately gave orders that my coach should pass and afterwards visited me at paris having obtained my permission and taken my address at parting while the others understanding my name and quality asked pardon for their impolite carriage which they told me was owing to the representation of the soldier who gave them to understand that i was a strolling actress i could not help laughing heartily at this mistake which might have proceeded from the circumstances of my appearance my footman having been obliged to change hats with the peasant and myself being without buckles on my shoes and buttons on my ridingskirt while my countenance still retained marks of the fear and confusion i had undergone after all perhaps the fellow was a droll and wanted to entertain himself at my expense the day was so far consumed in these adventures that i was obliged to take up my lodgings at mechlin where i addressed myself to the intendant giving him an account of the disaster i had met with and desiring i might have credit at the inn as our whole company could not raise the value of a sixpence this gentleman though a provincial was polite in his way and not only granted my request but invited me to lodge at his own house i accordingly gave him my company at supper but did not choose to sleep at his quarters because he appeared to be what the french call un vieux debauche next day he sent a trumpet to the general with a detail of my misfortune in hopes of retrieving what i had lost but notwithstanding all possible search i was fain to put up with my damage which in linen laces clothes and baubles amounted to upwards of seven hundred pounds a loss which never deprived me of one moments rest for though i lodged at a miserable inn and lay in a paltry bed i slept as sound as if nothing extraordinary had happened after i had written to london and paris directing that the payment of my bills of credit might be stopped indeed i know of but two misfortunes in life capable of depressing my spirits namely the loss of health and friends all others may be prevented or endured the articles of that calamity which i chiefly regretted were a picture of lord w and some inimitable letters from mr b from mechlin i proceeded to brussels where being known i got credit for some necessaries and borrowed twenty guineas to defray the expense of my journey to paris having consulted with my friends about the safest method of travelling through flanders i was persuaded to take places in the public voiture and accordingly departed not without fears of finding one part of the country as much infested with robbers as another nor were these apprehensions assuaged by the conversation of my fellowtravellers who being of the lower sort of people that delight in exaggerating dangers entertained me all the way with an account of all the robberies and murders which had been committed on that road with many additional circumstances of their own invention after having been two days exposed to this comfortable conversation among very disagreeable company which is certainly one of the most disagreeable situations in life i arrived at lisle where thinking the dangerous part of the journey was now past i hired a postchaise and in two days more reached paris without any further molestation upon my arrival in the capital i was immediately visited by my old acquaintances who hearing my disaster offered me their clothes and insisted upon my wearing them until i could be otherwise provided they likewise engaged me in parties with a view of amusing my imagination that i might not grow melancholy in reflecting upon my loss and desired me to repeat the particulars of my story forty times over expressing great surprise at our not being murdered or ravished at least as for this last species of outrage the fear of it never once entered my head otherwise i should have been more shocked and alarmed than i really was but it seems this was the chief circumstance of my companions apprehension and i cannot help observing that a homely woman is always more apt to entertain those fears than one whose person exposes her to much more imminent danger however i now learned that the risk i ran was much greater than i imagined it to be those ruffians being familiarized to rape as well as murder soon after my appearance at paris i was favoured with the addresses of several french lovers but i never had any taste for foreigners or indeed for any amusement of that kind except such as were likely to be lasting and settled upon a more agreeable footing than that of common gallantry when i deviated from this principle my conduct was the effect of compulsion and therefore i was never easy under it having been reduced to the alternative of two evils the least of which i was obliged to choose as a man leaps into the sea in order to escape from a ship that is on fire though i rejected their love i did not refuse their company and conversation and though my health was considerably impaired by the shock i received in my last adventure which was considerably greater than i at first imagined and affected my companion so much that she did not recover her spirits till she returned to england i say though i was for some time a valetudinarian i enjoyed myself in great tranquility for the space of ten months during which i was visited by english scotch and french of all parties and persuasions for pleasure is of no faction and that was the chief object of my pursuit neither was i so ambitious of being a politician as to employ my time and thoughts upon subjects which i did not understand i had admirers of all sides and should have spent my time very much to my liking had not i felt my funds sensibly diminish without any prospect of their being repaired for i had been obliged to lay out a great part of the sum allotted for my subsistence in supplying my companion my servant and myself with necessaries in lieu of those which we had lost having before my eyes the uncomfortable prospect of wanting money in a strange place i found myself under the necessity of returning to england where i had more resources than i could possibly have among foreigners and with that view wrote to lord s agents desiring that i might be enabled to discharge my obligations at paris by the payment of my pinmoney thus a negotiation commenced and his lordship promised to remit money for the clearance of my paris debts which amounted to four hundred pounds but he would not advance one farthing more though i gave him to understand that while he protracted the agreement i must inevitably be adding to my encumbrances and that i should be as effectually detained by a debt of twenty pounds as if i owed a thousand notwithstanding all my representations he would not part with one shilling over the net sum which i at first stipulated so that all my measures were rendered abortive and i found it altogether impracticable to execute those resolutions i had formed in his favour thus did he for a mere trifle embarrass the woman for whom he professed the most unlimited love and whose principles he pretended to hold in the utmost veneration indeed his confidence in my integrity was not without foundation for many wives with one half of my provocation would have ruined him to all intents and purposes whereas notwithstanding all the extraordinary expenses to which i had been exposed by his continual persecution he never paid a shilling on my account except one thousand pounds exclusive of the small allowance which was my due in a word so much time elapsed before my lord could prevail upon himself to advance the bare four hundred that i was involved in fresh difficulties from which i found it impossible to extricate myself and though i had occasion to write a letter to my benefactor lord in which i expressed my acknowledgment of past favours i could not venture to solicit more even when i was encouraged by a very obliging answer wherein he declared that the good qualities of my mind and heart would bind him to me in friendship for ever while i ruminated on my uncomfortable situation which would neither permit me to return to england nor to stay much longer where i was a young englishman of immense fortune took paris in his way from italy accompanied by a most agreeable scotchman of very good sense and great vivacity it was my good or ill fortune to become acquainted with these gentlemen who having seen me at the opera expressed a desire of being known to me and accordingly favoured me with a visit one afternoon when the brisk north briton engrossed the whole conversation while the other seemed fearful and diffident even to a degree of bashfulness through which however i could discern a delicate sensibility and uncommon understanding there was in his person which was very agreeable as well as in his behaviour a certain naivete that was very pleasing and at this first interview we relished each others company so well that a sort of intimacy immediately commenced and was carried on in a succession of parties of pleasure in the course of which i found him fraught with all the tenderness and sentiment that render the heart susceptible of the most refined love a disposition that immediately made me partial to him while it subjected his own heart to all the violent impressions of a passion which i little imagined our correspondence would have produced nevertheless i was far from being displeased with my conquest because his person and qualifications as well as his manner of address were very much to my liking and recommended him in a particular manner to my affection indeed he made greater progress in my heart than i myself suspected for there was something congenial in our souls which from our first meeting i believe had attracted us unknown to ourselves under the notions of friendship and regard and now disclosed itself in the most passionate love i listened to his addresses and we were truly happy his attachment was the quintessence of tenderness and sincerity while his generosity knew no bounds not contented with having paid twelve hundred pounds on my account in the space of one fortnight he would have loaded me with present after present had i not absolutely refused to accept such expensive marks of his munificence i was even mortified at those instances of his liberality which my situation compelled me to receive lest being but little acquainted with my disposition he should suspect me of being interested in my love and judge my conduct by the malicious reports of common fame which he afterwards owned had at first obtained such credit with him that he believed our mutual attachment would not be of long duration but in this particular he was soon undeceived his heart though naturally adapted for the melting passion had hitherto escaped untouched by all the ladies of italy and france and therefore the first impressions were the more deeply fixed as he was unpractised in the ways of common gallantry and deceit the striking simplicity in his character was the more likely to engage the heart of one who knew the perfidy of the world and despised all the farce and bombast of fashionable profession which i had always considered as the phrase of vanity and ostentation rather than the genuine language of love besides gratitude had a considerable share in augmenting my affection which manifested itself in such a warm cordial artless manner as increased his esteem and riveted his attachment for he could easily perceive from the whole tenor of my conduct that my breast was an utter stranger to craft and dissimulation yet i was at first fearful of contracting any engagement with him because being younger than me he might be more apt to change and the world might be malicious enough to suppose i had practised upon his inexperience but conscious of my own integrity i set slander at defiance trusting to my own behaviour and his natural probity for the continuance of his love though we did not live together in the same house the greatest part of our time was spent in each others company we dined and supped at the same table frequented public places went upon parties to the country and never parted but for a few hours in the night which we passed in the utmost impatience to meet again in this agreeable manner did the days roll on when my felicity was interrupted by a fit of jealousy with which i happened to be seized i had contracted an acquaintance with a young married lady who though her personal attractions were but slender was upon the whole an agreeable cheerful goodnatured companion with a little dash of the coquette in her composition this woman being in very indigent circumstances occasioned by some losses her husband had sustained no sooner had an opportunity of seeing and conversing with my lover than she formed the design of making a conquest of him i should have forgiven her for this scheme whatever pangs it might have cost me had i believed it the effect of real passion but i knew her too well to suppose her heart was susceptible of love and accordingly resented it in the execution of her plan she neglected nothing which she thought capable of engaging his attention she took all opportunities of sitting near him at table ogled him in the most palpable manner directed her whole discourse to him trod upon his toes nay i believe squeezed his hand my blood boiled at her though my pride for some time enabled me to conceal my uneasiness till at length her behaviour became so arrogant and gross that i could no longer suppress my indignation and one day told my lover that i would immediately renounce his correspondence he was greatly alarmed at this unexpected declaration and when he understood the cause of it assured me that for the future he would never exchange one word with her satisfied with this mark of his sincerity and regard i released him from his promise which he could not possibly keep while she and i lived upon any terms and we continued to visit each other as usual though she still persisted in her endeavours to rival me in his affection and contracted an intimacy with his companion who seemed to entertain a passion for her that she might have the more frequent opportunities of being among us for she had no objection against favouring the addresses of both one evening i remember we set out in my coach for the opera and in the way this inamorata was so busy with her feet that i was incensed at her behaviour and when we arrived at the place refused to alight but setting them down declared my intention of returning home immediately she was so much pleased with this intimation that she could not conceal the joy she felt at the thoughts of conversing with him uninterrupted by my presence an opportunity with which i had never favoured her before this open exultation increased my anger and anxiety i went home but being still tortured with the reflection of having left them together adjusted myself in the glass though i was too angry to take notice of my own figure and without further delay returned to the opera having inquired for the box in which they sat i took possession of one that fronted them and reconnoitring them without being perceived had the satisfaction of seeing him removed to as great a distance from her as the place would permit and his head turned another way composed by this examination i joined them without further scruple when my young gentleman expressed great joy at my appearance and told me he was determined to have left the entertainment and come in quest of me had i not returned at that instant in our way homewards my rival repeated her usual hints and with her large hoop almost overshadowed my lover from my view upon which my jealousy and wrath recurred with such violence that i pulled the string as a signal for the coachman to stop with a view of getting out and going home afoot a step which would have afforded a new spectacle to the people of paris but i reflected in a moment upon the folly of such a resolution and soon recollected myself by calling my pride to my assistance i determined however that she should act no more scenes of this kind in my presence and that same night insisted upon my lovers dropping all intercourse and connection with this tormentor he very cheerfully complied with my desire and was even glad of an occasion to break off his acquaintance with a person about whom i had plagued him so much thus was i freed from the persecution of one of those creatures who though of little consequence in themselves are yet the pests of society and find means to destroy that harmony which reigns between two lovers by the intrusion of a loose appetite void of all sensibility and discretion having no feelings themselves they cannot sympathize with those of other people and do mischief out of mere wantonness my lover being obliged to go to england had settled me in a genteel house in paris with a view of returning when his affairs should be adjusted but when the time of his departure approached he began to be uneasy at the prospect of separation and in order to alleviate his anxiety desired me to accompany him to calais where we stayed together three or four days during which the dread of parting became more and more intense so that we determined upon my following him into england at the first opportunity where i should live altogether incog that i might be concealed from the inquiries and attempts of my lord even after this resolution was fixed we parted with all the agonies of lovers who despair of ever meeting again and the wind blowing very high after he had embarked increased my fears but by the return of the packetboat i was blessed with the report of his being safe arrived in england and had the satisfaction of perusing his letters by every post my admirer being thus detached from me my thoughts were entirely employed in concerting some private method of conveying myself to him as i would not trust myself in the common packet for fear of being discovered after having revolved divers schemes i determined to transport myself in one of the dutch fishingboats though i knew the passage would be hazardous but in a case of such interesting concern i overlooked all danger and inconvenience before i put this resolution in practice i was so fortunate as to hear of a small english vessel that arrived in calais with a prisoner of war in which i embarked with my companion and another lady who lived with me for some time afterwards and when we came on board discovered that the ship was no other than a light collier and that her whole company amounted to no more than three men nevertheless though the sea was so rough and the weather so unpromising that no other boat would venture to put to sea we set sail and between two storms in about three hours arrived in safety in dover from hence my first companion went to her friends in the stagecoach while the other lady and i hired an open postchaise though it snowed very hard and without any accident performed our journey to london where i met with my lover who flew to my arms in all the transports of impatient joy and doubtless i deserved his affection for the hardships perils and difficulties i had undergone to be with him for i never scrupled to undertake anything practicable in order to demonstrate the sincerity of what i professed in consequence of our plan i assumed a fictitious name and never appeared in public being fully satisfied and happy in the company and conversation of the man i loved and when he went into the country contented myself with his correspondence which he punctually maintained in a series of letters equally sensible sincere and affectionate upon his return to town for the remainder of the season he devoted the greatest part of his time to our mutual enjoyment left me with reluctance when he was called away by indispensable business and the civility which was due to his acquaintance and very seldom went to any place of public entertainment because i could not accompany and share with him in the diversion nay so much did i engross his attention that one evening after he had been teased into an agreement of meeting some friends at a play he went thither precisely at the appointed hour and as they did not arrive punctually at the very minute he returned to me immediately as much rejoiced at his escape as if he had met with some signal deliverance nor was his constancy inferior to the ardour of his love we went once together to a ball in the haymarket where in the midst of a thousand fine women whose charms were enhanced by the peculiarity of the dresses they wore he remained unshaken unseduced preserving his attachment for me in spite of all temptation in the summer he provided me with a house in the neighbourhood of his own but the accommodations being bad and that country affording no other place fit for my residence he brought me home to his own seat and by that step raised such a universal clamour though i saw no company and led such a solitary life that nothing but excessive love could have supported my spirits not but that he gave me as much of his time as he could possibly spare from the necessary duties of paying and receiving visits together with the avocations of hunting and other country amusements which i could not partake formerly indeed i used to hunt and shoot but i had left off both so that i was now reduced to the alternative of reading and walking by myself but love made up for all deficiencies to me who think nothing else worth the living for had i been blessed with a partner for life who could have loved sincerely and inspired me with a mutual flame i would have asked no more of fate interest and ambition have no share in my composition love which is pleasure or pleasure which is love makes up the whole a heart so disposed cannot be devoid of other good qualities it must be subject to the impressions of humanity and benevolence and enemy to nothing but itself this you will give me leave to affirm in justice to myself as i have frankly owned my failings and misconduct towards the end of summer my heart was a little alarmed by a report that prevailed of my lovers being actually engaged in a treaty of marriage however i gave little credit to this rumour till i was obliged to go to town about business and there i heard the same information confidently affirmed though i still considered it as a vague surmise i wrote to him an account of what i had heard and in his answer which is still in my possession he assured me with repeated vows and protestations that the report was altogether false satisfied with this declaration i returned to his house and though the tale was incessantly thundered in my ears still believed it void of all foundation till my suspicion was awakened by a very inconsiderable circumstance one day on his return from hunting i perceived he had a very fine pair of dresden ruffles on his shirt which i could not suppose he would wear at such a rustic exercise and therefore my fears took the alarm when i questioned him about this particular of his dress his colour changed and though he attempted to elude my suspicion by imputing it to a mistake of his servant i could not rest satisfied with this account of the matter but inquired into the truth with such eagerness and penetration that he could not deny he had been to make a visit by degrees i even extorted from him a confession that he had engaged himself further than he ought to have proceeded without making me acquainted with his design though he endeavoured to excuse his conduct and pacify my displeasure by saying that the affair would not be brought to bear for a great while and perhaps might never come to a determination but he was in great confusion and indeed hardly knew what he said i would have quitted his house that moment had not he beforehand obtained a promise that i would take no rash resolution of that kind and put it out of my power to procure any method of conveyance by which i could make my retreat i gave no vent to reproaches but only upbraided him with his having permitted me to return in ignorance to the country after i was once fairly gone upon which he swore that he could not bear the thoughts of parting with me this declaration was a mystery at that time but i have been since so fully satisfied of his reasons for his conduct that i heartily acquit him of all injustice to me and indeed it is my sincere opinion that if ever young man deserved to be happy he is certainly entitled to that privilege and if i may be allowed to judge has a heart susceptible of the most refined enjoyment the violence of the grief and consternation which i suffered from this stroke having a little subsided i deliberated with myself about the measures i should take and determined to leave his house some day when he should be abroad i was encouraged in this resolution by the advice of our scotch friend who came about this time from london on a visit to his fellowtraveller we thought such an abrupt departure would be less shocking than to stay and take a formal leave of my lover whose heart was of such a delicate frame that after i told him i should one day withdraw myself in his absence he never came home from the chase or any other avocation without trembling with apprehension that i had escaped after he had been some time accustomed to these fears by my previous intimation i at length decamped in good earnest though my heart ached upon the occasion because i left him loving and beloved for his affection was evident notwithstanding the step he had taken by the advice and importunity of all his relations who laid a disagreeable restraint upon his inclinations while they consulted his interest in every other particular while i halted in the next great town until i could be supplied with fresh horses i was visited by a gentleman who had been formerly intimate with my lover but a breach had happened in their friendship and he now came to complain of the treatment he had received perceiving that i was not in a humour to listen to his story he shifted the conversation to my own and observed that i had been extremely illused i told him that i was of a different opinion that it was not only just but expedient that a young man of mr s fortune should think of making some alliance to strengthen and support the interest of his family and that i had nothing to accuse him of but his letting me remain so long in ignorance of his intention he then gave me to understand that i was still ignorant of a great part of the illusage i had received affirming that while i lived in his house he had amused himself with all the common women in that town to some of whom this gentleman had personally introduced him at first i could not believe this imputation but he supported his assertion with so many convincing circumstances that i could no longer doubt the truth of them and i felt so much resentment that my love vanished immediately into air instead of proceeding on my journey to london i went back a considerable way and sent a message desiring to see him in a little house about midway between his own habitation and the town from whence i came he obeyed my summons and appeared at the place appointed where i reproached him with great bitterness he pleaded guilty to the charge so far as acknowledging that he had corresponded with other women lately in order to get the better of his affection for me but the experiment had failed and he found that he should be for ever miserable i did not look upon this candid confession as a sufficient atonement for his past dissimulation and in the sharpness of my revenge demanded a settlement which he peremptorily refused so that for the present we held each other in the utmost contempt indeed i afterwards despised myself for my condescension which was owing to the advice of my companion supported and inflamed by the spirit of resentment nevertheless he begged that i would return to his house or stay all night where i was but i was deaf to his entreaties and after a great deal of ironical civility on my side i took my leave and went away yet before i set out i looked back and saw him on horseback with such an air of simplicity and truth as called up a profound sigh notwithstanding all that had passed in our conversation upon my arrival in london i took lodgings in leicesterfields and answered a letter which i had some months before received from my lord telling him that i would go home to him without stipulating for any terms to try what effect my confidence would have upon his generosity he readily embraced the offer and took a house in st jamessstreet where i proposed to comply with his humour in everything that was consistent with my own peace and tranquility meanwhile my lover passed his time very disagreeably in the country with his friend of whom it seems he had conceived some jealousy which was increased by a letter i wrote to that gentleman till he was made acquainted with the contents which he read over forty times and then his passion breaking out with more violence than ever he not only expressed his feeling in an epistle which i immediately received but when he came to town suffered such agonies of despair as i had never seen before except in lord b it was then in my power to have taken ample revenge upon him as well as upon my insolent rival who had insisted upon my leaving his house in a very abrupt manner though he absolutely refused to gratify her malice for he was now disposed to do anything for my satisfaction but i knew his worth and had too much regard for his reputation to advise him to act inconsistent with his honour about this time many tender feelings and sorrowful partings happened between us till the marriage knot was tied when he sent me a banknote for a thousand pounds by way of specimen as he called it of his friendship and of what he would do for me should i ever want his assistance this mark of his generosity i received in a most tender billet which i shall never part with together with his picture set in diamonds i now employed my thoughts in keeping measures with my lord we lay in the same apartment and for the first four or five months i neither dined nor supped abroad above twice and then he knew where i was and approved of my company but all this complacency and circumspection had no effect upon his temper which remained as capricious and dissatisfied as ever nay to such a provoking degree did this unhappy humour prevail that one day in the presence of his lawyer he harangued upon my misconduct since our last reunion and very freely affirmed that every step i had taken was diametrically opposite to his will conscious of the pains i had been at to please him i was so incensed at these unjust invectives that starting up i told him he was a little dirty fellow and would have left the house immediately had not his lawyer and others who were in the room interposed and by dint of argument and importunity diverted me from my purpose by the bye i have been informed by a person of rank that my lord discovered exactly the same disposition in his fathers lifetime and only changed the subject of his complaint from the word father to that of wife indeed he takes all opportunities of plaguing my dear parent as he has just sagacity enough to know that this is the most effectual way he can take to distress me after repeated trials i have given up all hopes of making him happy or of finding myself easy in my situation and live with him at present to avoid a greater inconvenience not that his illnature is all the grievance of which i complain exclusive of the personal disgust i entertain for him his folly is of that species which disobliges rather than diverts and his vanity and affectation altogether intolerable for he actually believes himself or at least would impose himself upon mankind as a pattern of gallantry and taste and in point of business a person of infinite sagacity and penetration but the most ridiculous part of his character is his pretended talent for politics in which he so deeply concerns himself that he has dismissed many a good servant because he suspected him of having wrong connections a theme upon which he has often quarrelled with me even almost to parting accusing me with holding correspondence with the earls of b and c and mr h v though i never had the least acquaintance with any of these gentlemen except the earl of c to whom i have not spoken these ten years past in short i have often been at a loss to know whether he was more mad and malicious in those fits of enthusiasm wherein he seemed transported with zeal for the commonwealth and tormented me with his admonitions out of all temper and patience at length however i contrived an expedient which freed me from these troublesome expostulations and silenced him effectually on the score of politics this was no other than an open avowal of being connected with all those people whom i have named indeed i knew him too well to believe there was anything solid in his intention or professions even when he carried himself so far as to demand a private audience of the k in order to communicate a scheme for suppressing the rebellion and that being denied solicited the duke of d s interest for permission to raise and head a regiment of kentish smugglers nay to such a pitch did his loyalty soar that he purchased a firelock of particular mechanism calculated for the safety of the bearer in case he had been placed sentinel at his majestys door and kept his horses ready caparisoned with a view of attending his sovereign to the field notwithstanding all these pompous preparations had he been put to the proof he would have infallibly crept out of his engagements through some sneaking evasion his imagination being very fertile in such saving pretences yet he will talk sometimes so fervently and even sensibly on the subject that a stranger would mistake him for a man of understanding and determined zeal for the good of his country since my last return to his house that act of parliament passed by which he was enabled to pay his debts and among the rest a thousand pounds of my contracting the only burden of that kind i ever entailed upon him exclusive of my pinmoney which was never regularly paid nor would he have been subject to this had he not by his persecution and pursuit exposed me to an extraordinary expense i have also had it in my power to reward some of my faithful abigails in particular to relieve from extreme distress that maid to whom as i have already observed lord b granted an annuity which she had sold so that she was reduced to the most abject poverty and i found her in a dismal hole with two infants perishing for want a spectacle which drew tears from my eyes and indeed could not but make deep impression upon a heart like mine which the misery of my fellowcreatures never failed to melt nor did i upon this occasion forget the attachment and fidelity of my other woman mrs s who hearing i was robbed in my passage through flanders had generously relinquished the allowance i had settled upon her at parting the exercise of such acts of humanity and benevolence and the pleasure of seeing my dear and tender parent often in some measure alleviate the chagrin to which i am subject from the disagreeable disposition of my lord who consistent with his former inconsistency upon our last reconciliation cheerfully agreed to a proposal i made of having concerts in the house and even approved of the scheme with marks of particular satisfaction but before one half of the winter was expired he found means to banish all the company beginning with lord r b who as he walked upstairs one evening was stopped by a footman who plainly told him he had orders to say to him in particular that his lordship was not at home yet the very next day perceiving that nobleman and me walking together in the park he joins us with an air of alacrity as if no such thing had happened and even behaved to lord r with the most fawning complaisance his deportment was equally absurd and impertinent to the rest of his friends who forsook us gradually being tired of maintaining any friendly communication with such a disagreeable composition of ignorance and arrogance for my own part i look upon him as utterly incorrigible and as fate has subjected me to his power endeavour to make the bitter draught go down by detaching myself as much as possible from the supposition that there is any such existence upon earth indeed if i had not fatal experience to the contrary i should be apt to believe that such a character is not to be found among the sons of men because his conduct is altogether unaccountable by the known rules and maxims of life and falls entirely under the poets observation when he says tis true no meaning puzzles more than wit her ladyship having thus concluded her story to the entertainment of the company and the admiration of peregrine who expressed his astonishment at the variety of adventures she had undergone which was such as he thought sufficient to destroy the most hardy and robust constitution and therefore infinitely more than enough to overwhelm one of her delicate frame one of the gentlemen present roundly taxed her with want of candour in suppressing some circumstances of her life which he thought essential in the consideration of her character she reddened at this peremptory charge which had an evident effect upon the countenances of the whole audience when the accuser proceeded to explain his imputation by observing that in the course of her narration she had omitted to mention a thousand acts of uncommon charity of which he himself knew her to be guilty and that she had concealed a great many advantageous proposals of marriage which she might have accepted before she was engaged the company were agreeably undeceived by this explanation which her ladyship acknowledged in very polite terms as a compliment equally genteel and unexpected and our hero after having testified the sense he had of her complaisance and condescension in regaling him with a mark of her confidence and esteem took his leave and went home in a state of confusion and perplexity for from the circumstances of the tale he had heard he plainly perceived that her ladyships heart was too delicate to receive such incense as he in the capacity of an admirer could at present pay because though he had in some measure abridged the empire of emilia in his own breast it was not in his own power to restrain it so effectually but that it would interfere with any other sovereign whom his thoughts should adopt and unless lady could engross his whole love time and attention he foresaw that it would be impossible for him to support the passion which he might have the good fortune to inspire he was moreover deterred from declaring his love by the fate of her former admirers who seemed to have been wound up to a degree of enthusiasm that looked more like the effect of enchantment than the inspiration of human attractions an ecstasy of passion which he durst not venture to undergo he therefore resolved to combat with the impressions he had already received and if possible cultivate her friendship without soliciting her affection but before he could fix upon this determination he desired to know the footing on which he stood in her opinion and by the intelligence of crabtree obtained in the usual manner understood that her sentiments of him were very favourable though without the least tincture of love he would have been transported with joy had her thoughts of him been of a more tender texture though his reason was better pleased with the information he received in consequence of which he mustered up the ideas of his first passion and set them in opposition to those of this new and dangerous attachment by which means he kept the balance in equilibrio and his bosom tolerably quiet chapter lxxxii he persuades cadwallader to assume the character of a magician in which he acquires a great share of reputation by his responses to three females of distinction who severally consult the researches of his art his heart being thus as it were suspended between two objects that lessened the force of each others attraction he took this opportunity of enjoying some respite and for the present detached his sentiments from both resolving to indulge himself in the exercise of that practical satire which was so agreeable and peculiar in his disposition in this laudable determination he was confirmed by the repeated suggestions of his friend cadwallader who taxed him with letting his talents rust in indolence and stimulated his natural vivacity with a succession of fresh discoveries in the world of scandal peregrine was now seized with a strange whim and when he communicated the conceit to cadwallader it in a moment acquired his approbation this notion he imparted in a proposal to subject the town to their ridicule by giving responses to the character of a professed conjurer to be personated by the old misanthrope whose aspect was extremely well calculated for the purpose the plan was immediately adjusted in all its parts an apartment hired in a house accommodated with a public stair so that people might have free ingress and egress without being exposed to observation and this tenement being furnished with the apparatus of a magician such as globes telescopes a magiclanthorn a skeleton a dried monkey together with the skins of an alligator otter and snake the conjurer himself took possession of his castle after having distributed printed advertisements containing the particulars of his undertaking these bills soon operated according to the wish of the projectors as the price of the oracle was fixed at half a guinea the public naturally concluded that the author was no common fortuneteller and the very next day peregrine found some ladies of his quality acquaintance infected with the desire of making an experiment upon the skill of this new conjurer who pretended to be just arrived from the moguls empire where he had learned the art from a brachman philosopher our young gentleman affected to talk of the pretensions of this sage with ridicule and contempt and with seeming reluctance undertook to attend them to his apartment observing that it would be a very easy matter to detect the fellows ignorance and no more than common justice to chastise him for his presumption though he could easily perceive a great fund of credulity in the company they affected to espouse his opinion and under the notion of a frolic agreed that one particular lady should endeavour to baffle his art by appearing before him in the dress of her woman who should at the same time personate her mistress and be treated as such by our adventurer who promised to squire them to the place these measures being concerted and the appointment fixed for the next audienceday peregrine furnished his friend with the necessary information and when the hour of assignation arrived conducted his charge to this oraculous seer they were admitted by our heros valetdechambre whose visage being naturally meagre and swarthy was adorned with artificial whiskers so that he became the persian dress which he wore and seemed a very proper master of the ceremonies to an oriental necromancer having crossed his arms upon his breasts with an inclination of the head he stalked in solemn silence before them into the penetralia of the temple where they found the conjurer sitting at a table provided with pen ink and paper divers books mathematical instruments and a long white wand lying across the whole he was habited in a black gown and fur cap his countenance over and above a double proportion of philosophic gravity which he had assumed for the occasion was improved by a thick beard white as snow that reached to his middle and upon each shoulder sat a prodigious large black cat which had been tutored for the purpose such a figure which would have startled peregrine himself had not he been concerned in the mystery could not fail to make an impression upon those whom he accompanied the fictitious chambermaid in spite of all her natural pertness and vivacity changed colour when she entered the room while the pretended lady whose intellects were not quite so enlightened began to tremble in every joint and ejaculate petitions to heaven for her safety their conductor advancing to the table presented his offering and pointing to the maid told him that lady desired to know what would be her destiny in point of marriage the philosopher without lifting up his eyes to view the person in whose behalf he was consulted turned his ear to one of the sable familiars that purred upon his shoulder and taking up the pen wrote upon a detached slip of paper these words which peregrine at the desire of the ladies repeated aloud her destiny will in a great measure depend upon what happened to her about nine oclock in the morning on the third day of last december this sentence was no sooner pronounced than the counterfeit lady screamed and ran into the antechamber exclaiming christ have mercy upon us sure he is the devil incarnate her mistress who followed her with great consternation insisted upon knowing the transaction to which the response alluded and mrs abigail after some recollection gave her to understand that she had an admirer who on that very hour and day mentioned by the cunning man had addressed himself to her in a serious proposal of marriage this explanation however was more ingenious than candid for the admirer was no other than the identical mr pickle himself who was a mere dragon among the chambermaids and in his previous information communicated to his associate had given an account of this assignation with which he had been favoured by the damsel in question our hero seeing his company very much affected with the circumstance of the wizards art which had almost frightened both mistress and maid into hysteric fits pretended to laugh them out of their fears by observing that there was nothing extraordinary in this instance of his knowledge which might have been acquired by some of those secret emissaries whom such impostors are obliged to employ for intelligence or imparted by the lover himself who had perhaps come to consult him about the success of his amour encouraged by this observation or rather prompted by an insatiable curiosity which was proof against all sorts of apprehension the disguised lady returned to the magicians own apartment and assuming the air of a pert chambermaid mr conjurer said she now you have satisfied my mistress will you be as good as to tell me if ever i shall be married the sage without the least hesitation favoured her with an answer in the following words you cannot be married before you are a widow and whether or not that will ever be the case is a question which my art cannot resolve because my foreknowledge exceeds not the term of thirty years this reply which at once cut her off from her pleasing prospect of seeing herself independent in the enjoyment of youth and fortune in a moment clouded her aspect all her goodhumour was overcast and she went away without further inquiry muttering in the rancour of her chagrin that he was a silly impertinent fellow and a mere quack in his profession notwithstanding the prejudice of this resentment her conviction soon recurred and when the report of his answers was made to those confederates by whom she had been deputed to make trial of his skill they were universally persuaded that his art was altogether supernatural though each affected to treat it with contempt resolving in her own breast to have recourse to him in private in the meantime the maid though laid under the most peremptory injunctions of secrecy was so full of the circumstance which related to her own conduct that she extolled his prescience in whispers to all acquaintances assuring them that he had told her all the particulars of her life so that his fame was almost instantaneously conveyed through a thousand different channels to all parts of the town and the very next time he assumed the chair his doors were besieged by curious people of all sects and denominations being an old practitioner in this art cadwallader knew it would be impossible for him to support his reputation in the promiscuous exercise of fortunetelling because every person that should come to consult him would expect a sample of his skill relating to things past and it could not be supposed that he was acquainted with the private concerns of every individual who might apply to him for that purpose he therefore ordered his minister whom he distinguished by the name of hadgi rourk to signify to all those who demanded entrance that his price was half a guinea and that all such as were not disposed to gratify him with that consideration would do well to leave the passage free for the rest this declaration succeeded to his wish for this congregation consisted chiefly of footmen chambermaids prentices and the lower class of tradesmen who could not afford to purchase prescience at such a price so that after fruitless offers of shillings and halfcrowns they dropped off one by one and left the field open for customers of a higher rank the first person of this species who appeared was dressed like the wife of a substantial tradesman but this disguise could not screen her from the penetration of the conjurer who at first sight knew her to be one of the ladies of whose coming he had been apprised by peregrine on the supposition that their curiosity was rather inflamed than allayed by the intelligence they had received from his first client this lady approached the philosopher with that intrepidity of countenance so conspicuous in matrons of her dignified sphere and in a soft voice asked with a simper of what complexion her next child would be the necromancer who was perfectly well acquainted with her private history forthwith delivered his response in the following question written in the usual form how long has pompey the black been dismissed from your ladyships service endued as she was with a great share of that fortitude which is distinguished by the appellation of effrontery her face exhibited some signs of shame and confusion at the receipt of this oracular interrogation by which she was convinced of his extraordinary intelligence and accosting him in a very serious tone doctor said she i perceive you are a person of great abilities in the art you profess and therefore without pretending to dissemble i will own you have touched the true string of my apprehensions i am persuaded i need not be more particular in my inquiries here is a purse of money take it and deliver me from a most alarming and uneasy suspense so saying she deposited her offering upon the table and waited for his answer with a face of fearful expectation while he was employed in writing this sentence for her perusal though i see into the womb of time the prospect is not perfectly distinct the seeds of future events lie mingled and confused so that i am under the necessity of assisting my divination in some cases by analogy and human intelligence and cannot possibly satisfy your present doubts unless you will condescend to make me privy to all those occurrences which you think might have interfered with the cause of your apprehension the lady having read the declaration affected a small emotion of shyness and repugnance and seating herself upon a settee after having cautiously informed herself of the privacy of the apartment gave such a detail of the succession of her lovers as amazed while it entertained the necromancer as well as his friend pickle who from a closet in which he had concealed himself overheard every syllable of her confession cadwallader listened to her story with a look of infinite importance and sagacity and after a short pause told her that he would not pretend to give a categorical answer until he should have deliberated maturely upon the various circumstances of the affair but if she would take the trouble of honouring him with another visit on his next public day he hoped he should be able to give her full satisfaction conscious of the importance of her doubts she could not help commending his caution and took her leave with a promise of returning at the appointed time then the conjurer being joined by his associate they gave a loose to their mirth which having indulged they began to concert measures for inflicting some disgraceful punishment on the shameless and insatiate termagant who had so impudently avowed her own prostitution they were interrupted however in their conference by the arrival of a new guest who being announced by hadgi our hero retreated to his lurkingplace and cadwallader resumed his mysterious appearance this new client though she hid her face in a mask could not conceal herself from the knowledge of the conjurer who by her voice recognised her to be an unmarried lady of his own acquaintance she had within a small compass of time made herself remarkable for two adventures which had not at all succeeded to her expectation being very much addicted to play she had at a certain rout indulged that passion to such excess as not only got the better of her justice but also of her circumspection so that she was unfortunately detected in her endeavours to appropriate to herself what was not lawfully her due this small slip was attended with another indiscretion which had likewise an unlucky effect upon her reputation she had been favoured with the addresses of one of those hopeful heirs who swarm and swagger about town under the denomination of bucks and in the confidence of his honour consented to be one of a party that made an excursion as far as windsor thinking herself secured from scandal by the company of another young lady who had also condescended to trust her person to the protection of her admirer the two gallants in the course of this expedition were said to use the most perfidious means to intoxicate the passions of their mistresses by mixing drugs with their wine which inflamed their constitutions to such a degree that they fell an easy sacrifice to the appetites of their conductors who upon their return to town were so base and inhuman as to boast among their companions of the exploit they had achieved thus the story was circulated with a thousand additional circumstances to the prejudice of the sufferers one of whom had thought proper to withdraw into the country until the scandal raised at her expense should subside while the other who was not so easily put out of countenance resolved to outface the report as a treacherous aspersion invented by her lover as an excuse for his own inconstancy and actually appeared in public as usual till she found herself neglected by the greatest part of her acquaintance in consequence of this disgrace which she knew not whether to impute to the card affair or to the last faux pas she had committed she now came to consult the conjurer and signified her errand by asking whether the cause of her present disquiet was of the town or the country cadwallader at once perceiving her allusion answered her question in these terms this honest world will forgive a young gamester for indiscretion at play but a favour granted to a babbling coxcomb is an unpardonable offence this response she received with equal astonishment and chagrin and fully convinced of the necromancers omniscience implored his advice touching the retrieval of her reputation upon which he counselled her to wed with the first opportunity she seemed so well pleased with his admonition that she gratified him with a double fee and dropping a low curtsey retired our undertakers now thought it high time to silence the oracle for the day and hadgi was accordingly ordered to exclude all comers while peregrine and his friend renewed the deliberations which had been interrupted and settled a plan of operations for the next occasion meanwhile it was resolved that hadgi should not only exercise his own talents but also employ inferior agents in procuring general intelligence for the support of their scheme that the expense of this ministry should be defrayed from the profits of their professions and the remainder be distributed to poor families in distress chapter lxxxiii peregrine and his friend cadwallader proceed in the exercise of the mystery of fortunetelling in the course of which they achieve various adventures these preliminaries being adjusted our hero forthwith repaired to a card assembly which was frequented by some of the most notable gossips in town and having artfully turned the conversation upon the subject of the fortuneteller whose talents he pretended to ridicule incensed their itch of knowing secrets to such a degree of impatience that their curiosity became flagrant and he took it for granted that all or some of them would visit albumazar on his very first visitingday while peregrine was thus engaged his associate made his appearance in another convocation of fashionable people where he soon had the pleasure of hearing the conjurer brought upon the carpet by an elderly gentlewoman remarkable for her inquisitive disposition who addressing herself to cadwallader asked by the help of the fingeralphabet if he knew anything of the magician that made such a noise in town the misanthrope answered as usual in a surly tone by your question you must either take me for a pimp or an idiot what in the name of nonsense should i know of such a rascal unless i were to court his acquaintance with a view to feast my own spleen in seeing him fool the whole nation out of their money though i suppose his chief profits arise from his practice in quality of pander all fortunetellers are bawds and for that reason are so much followed by people of fashion this fellow i warrant has got sundry convenient apartments for the benefit of procreation for it is not to be supposed that those who visit him on the pretence of consulting his supernatural art can be such fools such drivellers as to believe that he can actually prognosticate future events the company according to his expectation imputed his remarks to the rancour of his disposition which could not bear to think that any person upon earth was wiser than himself and his ears were regaled with a thousand instances of the conjurers wonderful prescience for which he was altogether indebted to fiction some of these specimens being communicated to him by way of appeal to his opinion they are said he mere phantoms of ignorance and credulity swelled up in the repetition like those unsubstantial bubbles which the boys blow up in soapsuds with a tobaccopipe and this will ever be the case in the propagation of all extraordinary intelligence the imagination naturally magnifies every object that falls under its cognizance especially those that concern the passions of fear and admiration and when the occurrence comes to be rehearsed the vanity of the relater exaggerates every circumstance in order to enhance the importance of the communication thus an incident which is but barely uncommon often gains such accession in its progress through the fancies and mouths of those who represent it that the original fact cannot possibly be distinguished this observation might be proved and illustrated by a thousand undeniable examples out of which i shall only select one instance for the entertainment and edification of the company a very honest gentleman remarkable for the gravity of his deportment was one day in a certain coffeehouse accosted by one of his particular friends who taking him by the hand expressed uncommon satisfaction in seeing him abroad and in good health after the dangerous and portentous malady he had undergone surprised at this salutation the gentleman replied it was true he had been a little out of order overnight but there was nothing at all extraordinary in his indisposition jesu not extraordinary cried the other when you vomited three black crows this strange exclamation the grave gentleman at first mistook for raillery though his friend was no joker but perceiving in him all the marks of sincerity and astonishment he suddenly changed his opinion and after a short reverie taking him aside expressed himself in these words sir it is not unknown to you that i am at present engaged in a treaty of marriage which would have been settled long ago had it not been retarded by the repeated machinations of a certain person who professed himself my rival now i am fully persuaded that this affair of the three crows is a story of his invention calculated to prejudice me in the opinion of the lady who to be sure would not choose to marry a man who has a rookery in his bowels and therefore i must insist upon knowing the author of this scandalous report that i may be able to vindicate my character from the malicious aspersion his friend who thought the demand was very reasonable told him without hesitation that he was made acquainted with the circumstances of his distemper by mr suchaone their common acquaintance upon which the person who conceived himself injured went immediately in quest of his supposed defamer and having found him pray sir said he with a peremptory tone who told you that i vomited three black crows three answered the gentleman i mentioned two only zounds sir cried the other incensed at his indifference you will find the two too many if you refuse to discover the villainous source of such calumny the gentleman surprised at his heat said he was sorry to find he had been the accidental instrument of giving him offence but translated the blame if any there was from himself to a third person to whose information he owed his knowledge of the report the plaintiff according to the direction he received repaired to the house of the accused and his indignation being inflamed at finding the story had already circulated among his acquaintance he told him with evident marks of displeasure that he was come to pluck the same brace of crows which he said he had disgorged the defendant seeing him very much irritated positively denied that he had mentioned a brace one indeed said he i own i took notice of upon the authority of your own physician who gave me an account of it this morning by the lord cried the sufferer in a rage which he could no longer contain that rascal has been suborned by my rival to slander my character in this manner but ill be revenged if there be either law or equity in england he had scarce pronounced these words when the doctor happened to enter the room when his exasperated patient lifting up his cane sirrah said he if i live ill make that black crow the blackest circumstance of thy whole life and conversation the physician confounded at this address assured him that he was utterly ignorant of his meaning and when the other gentleman explained it absolutely denied the charge affirming he had said no more than that he had vomited a quantity of something as black as a crow the landlord of the house acknowledged that he might have been mistaken and thus the whole mystery was explained the company seeming to relish the story of the three black crows which they considered as an impromptu of cadwalladers own invention but granting it to be true they unanimously declared that it could have no weight in invalidating the testimony of divers persons of honour who had been witnesses of the magicians supernatural skill on the next day of consultation the necromancer being in the chair and his friend behind the curtain the outward door was scarce opened when a female visitant flounced in and discovered to the magician the features of one of those inquisitive ladies whose curiosity he knew his confederate had aroused in the matter above described she addressed herself to him with a familiar air observing that she had heard much of his great knowledge and was come to be a witness of his art which she desired him to display in declaring what he knew to be her ruling passion cadwallader who was no stranger to her disposition assumed the pen without hesitation and furnished her with an answer importing that the love of money predominated and scandal possessed the next place in her heart far from being offended at his freedom she commended his frankness with a smile and satisfied of his uncommon talents expressed a desire of being better acquainted with his person nay she began to catechise him upon the private history of divers great families in which he happened to be well versed and he in a mysterious manner dropped such artful hints of his knowledge that she was amazed at his capacity and actually asked if his art was communicable the conjurer replied in the affirmative but at the same time gave her to understand that it was attainable by those only who were pure and undefiled in point of chastity and honour or such as by a long course of penitence had weaned themselves from all attachments to the flesh she not only disapproved but seemed to doubt the truth of this assertion telling him with a look of disdain that his art was not worth having if one could not use it for the benefit of ones pleasure she had even penetration enough to take notice of an inconsistency in what he had advanced and asked why he himself exercised his knowledge for hire if he was so much detached from all worldly concerns come come doctor added she you are in the right to be cautious against impertinent curiosity but perhaps i may make it worth your while to be communicative these overtures were interrupted by a rap at the door signifying the approach of another client upon which the lady inquired for his private passage through which she might retire without the risk of being seen when she understood he was deficient in that convenience she withdrew into an empty room adjoining to the audiencechamber in order to conceal herself from the observation of the newcomer this was no other than the inamorata who came by appointment to receive the solution of her doubts and the misanthrope glad of an opportunity to expose her to the censure of such an indefatigable minister of fame as the person who he knew would listen from the next apartment laid her under the necessity of refreshing his remembrance with a recapitulation of her former confession which was almost finished when she was alarmed by a noise at the door occasioned by two gentlemen who attempted to enter by force terrified at this uproar which disconcerted the magician himself she ran for shelter into the place which was preoccupied by the other lady who hearing this disturbance had closed the windowshutters that she might have the better chance of remaining unknown here they ensconced themselves in the utmost consternation while the necromancer after some recollection ordered hadgi to open the door and admit the rioters who he hoped would be overawed by the authority of his appearance the janitor had no sooner obeyed his instructions than in rushed a young libertine who had been for some time upon the town together with his tutor who was a wornout debauchee well known to the magician they were both in that degree of intoxication necessary to prepare such dispositions for what they commonly call frolics and the sober part of mankind feel to be extravagant outrages against the laws of their country and the peace of their fellowsubjects having staggered up to the table the senior who undertook to be spokesman saluted cadwallader with how dost do old capricorn thou seemst to be a most venerable pimp and i doubt not hast abundance of discretion here is this young whoremaster a true chip of the old venereal block his father and myself come for a comfortable cast of thy function i dont mean that stale pretence of conjuring d futurity let us live for the present old haly conjure me up a couple of hale wenches and i warrant we shall get into the magic circle in a twinkling what says galileo what says the reverend brahe here is a purse you pimp hark how it chinks this is sweeter than the music of spheres our necromancer perplexed at this rencontre made no reply but taking up his wand waved it around his head in a very mysterious motion with a view of intimidating these forward visitants who far from being awed by this sort of evolution became more and more obstreperous and even threatened to pull him by the beard if he would not immediately comply with their desire had he called his associate or even hadgi to his aid he knew he could have soon calmed their turbulence but being unwilling to run the risk of a discovery or even of a riot he bethought himself of chastising their insolence in another manner that would be less hazardous and rather more effectual in consequence of this suggestion he pointed his wand towards the door of the apartment in which the ladies had taken sanctuary and the two rakes understanding the hint rushed in without hesitation the females finding their place of retreat taken by assault ran about the room in great consternation and were immediately taken prisoners by the assailants who pulling them towards the windows opened the shutters at the same instant of time when strange to tell one of the heroes discovered in the prize he had made the very wife of his bosom and his companion perceived that he had stumbled in the dark upon his own mother their mutual astonishment was unspeakable at this eclaircissement which produced a universal silence for the space of several minutes during this pause the ladies having recollected themselves an expostulation was begun by the elder of the two who roundly took her son to task for his disorderly life which laid her under the disagreeable necessity of watching his motions and detecting him in such an infamous place while the careful mother thus exercised her talent for reprehension the hopeful young gentleman with a hand in each fob stood whistling an opera tune without seeming to pay the most profound regard to his parents reproof and the other lady in imitation of such a consummate pattern began to open upon her husband whom she bitterly reproached with his looseness and intemperance demanding to know what he had to allege in alleviation of his present misconduct the surprise occasioned by such an unexpected meeting had already in a great measure destroyed the effects of the wine he had so plentifully drunk and the first use he made of his recovered sobriety was to revolve within himself the motives that could possibly induce his wife to give him the rendezvous in this manner as he had good reason to believe she was utterly void of jealousy he naturally placed this rencontre to the account of another passion and his chagrin was not at all impaired by the effrontery with which she now presumed to reprimand him he listened to her therefore with a grave or rather grim aspect and to the question with which she concluded her rebuke answered with great composure all that i have to allege madam is that the bawd has committed a mistake in consequence of which we are both disappointed and so ladies your humble servant so saying he retired with manifest confusion in his looks and as he passed through the audiencechamber eyeing the conjurer askance pronounced the epithet of precious rascal with great emphasis meanwhile the junior like a dutiful child handed his mamma to her chair and the other client after having reviled the necromancer because he could not foresee this event went away in a state of mortification the coast being clear peregrine came forth from his den and congratulated his friend upon the peaceable issue of the adventure which he had overheard but that he might not be exposed to such inconvenience for the future they resolved that a grate should be fixed in the middle of the outward door through which the conjurer himself might reconnoitre all the visitants before their admission so that to those whose appearance he might not like hadgi should without opening give notice that his master was engaged by this expedient too they provided against those difficulties which cadwallader must have encountered in giving satisfaction to strangers whom he did not know for the original intention of the founders was to confine the practice of their art to people of fashion only most of whom were personally known to the counterfeit magician and his coadjutors indeed these associates cadwallader in particular notwithstanding his boasted insight into the characters of life never imagined that his pretended skill would be consulted by any but the weakerminded of the female sex incited by that spirit of curiosity which he knew was implanted in their nature but in the course of his practice he found himself cultivated in his preternatural capacity by people of all sexes complexions and degrees of reputation and had occasion to observe that when the passions are concerned howsoever cool cautious and deliberate the disposition may otherwise be there is nothing so idle frivolous or absurd to which they will not apply for encouragement and gratification the last occurrence according to the hopes and expectation of the confederates was whispered about by the ladies concerned in such a manner that the whole affair was in a few days the universal topic of discourse in which it was retailed with numberless embellishments invented by the parties themselves who had long indulged a pique at each other and took this opportunity of enjoying their revenge these incidents while they regaled the spleen at the same time augmented the renown of the conjurer who was described on both sides as a very extraordinary person in his way and the alteration in his door was no sooner performed than he had occasion to avail himself of it against the intrusion of a great many with whom he would have found it very difficult to support the fame he had acquired among those who appeared at his grate he perceived a certain clergyman whom he had long known a humble attendant on the great and with some the reputed minister of their pleasures this levite had disguised himself in a greatcoat boots and dress quite foreign to the habit worn by those of his function and being admitted attempted to impose himself as a country squire upon the conjurer who calling him by his name desired him to sit down this reception corresponding with the report he had heard touching our magicians art the doctor said he would lay aside all dissimulation after having professed an implicit belief that his supernatural knowledge did not proceed from any communication with evil spirits but was the immediate gift of heaven he declared the intention of his coming was to inquire into the health of a good friend and brother of his who possessed a certain living in the country which he named and as he was old and infirm to know what space of time was allotted to him in this frail state of mortality that he might have the melancholy satisfaction of attending him in his last moments and assisting him in his preparations for eternity the conjurer who at once perceived the purport of this question after a solemn pause during which he seemed absorbed in contemplation delivered this response to his consulter though i foresee some occurrences i do not pretend to be omniscient i know not to what age that clergymans life will extend but so far i can penetrate into the womb of time as to discern that the incumbent will survive his intended successor this dreadful sentence in a moment banished the blood from the face of the appalled consulter who hearing his own doom pronounced began to tremble in every joint he lifted up his eyes in the agony of fear and saying the will of god be done withdrew in silent despondence his teeth chattering with terror and dismay this client was succeeded by an old man about the age of seventyfive who being resolved to purchase a lease desired to be determined in the term of years by the necromancers advice observing that as he had no children of his own body and had no regard for his heirsatlaw the purchase would be made with a view to his own convenience only and therefore considering his age he himself hesitated in the period of the lease between thirty and threescore years the conjurer upon due deliberation advised him to double the last specified term because he distinguished in his features something portending extreme old age and second childhood and he ought to provide for that state of incapacity which otherwise would be attended with infinite misery and affliction the superannuated wretch thunderstruck with this prediction held up his hands and in the first transports of his apprehension exclaimed lord have mercy upon me i have not wherewithal to purchase such a long lease and i have long outlived all my friends what then must become of me sinner that i am one hundred and twenty years hence cadwallader who enjoyed his terror under pretence of alleviating his concern told him that what he had prognosticated did not deprive him of the means which he and every person had in their power to curtail a life of misfortune and the old gentleman went away seemingly comforted with the assurance that it would always be in his power to employ an halter for his own deliverance soon after the retreat of this elder the magician was visited by one of those worthies known among the romans by the appellation of haeredipetae who had amassed a large fortune by a close attention to the immediate wants and weakness of raw inexperienced heirs this honourable usurer had sold an annuity upon the life of a young spendthrift being thereto induced by the affirmation of his physician who had assured him his patients constitution was so rotten that he could not live one year to an end he had nevertheless made shift to weather eighteen months and now seemed more vigorous and healthy than he had ever been known for he was supposed to have nourished an hereditary pox from his cradle alarmed at this alteration the seller came to consult cadwallader not only about the life of the annuitant but also concerning the state of his health at the time of his purchasing the annuity purposing to sue the physician for false intelligence should the conjurer declare that the young man was sound when the doctor pronounced him diseased but this was a piece of satisfaction he did not obtain from the misanthrope who in order to punish his sordid disposition gave him to understand that the physician had told him the truth and nothing but the truth and that the young gentleman was in a fair way of attaining a comfortable old age that is to say cried the client in the impatience of his mortification at this answer bating accidents for thank god the annuitant does not lead the most regular life besides i am credibly informed he is choleric and rash so that he may be concerned in a duel then there are such things as riots in the street in which a rakes skull may be casually cracked he may be overturned in a coach overset in the river thrown from a vicious horse overtaken with a cold endangered by a surfeit but what i place my chief confidence in is an hearty pox a distemper which hath been fatal to his whole family not but that the issue of all these things is uncertain and expedients might be found which would more effectually answer the purpose i know they have arts in india by which a man can secure his own interest in the salutation of a friendly shake by the hand and i dont doubt that you who have lived in that country are master of the secret to be sure if you were inclined to communicate such a nostrum there are abundance of people who would purchase it at a very high price cadwallader understood this insinuation and was tempted to amuse him in such a manner as would tend to his disgrace and confusion but considering that the case was of too criminal a nature to be tampered with he withstood his desire of punishing this rapacious cormorant any other way than by telling him he would not impart the secret for his whole fortune ten times doubled so that the usurer retired very much dissatisfied with the issue of his consultation the next person who presented himself at this altar of intelligence was an author who recommended himself to a gratis advice by observing that a prophet and poet were known by the same appellation among the ancients and that at this day both the one and the other spoke by inspiration the conjurer refused to own this affinity which he said formerly subsisted because both species of the vates were the children of fiction but as he himself did not fall under that predicament he begged leave to disown all connection with the family of the poets and the poor author would have been dismissed without his errand though he offered to leave an ode as security for the magicians fee to be paid from the profits of his first third night had not cadwalladers curiosity prompted him to know the subject of this gentlemans inquiry he therefore told him that in consideration of his genius he would for once satisfy him without a fee and desired him to specify the doubts in which he wished to be resolved the son of parnassus glad of this condescension for which he thanked the necromancer gave him to understand that he had some time before presented a play in manuscript to a certain great man at the head of taste who had not only read and approved the performance but also undertaken to introduce and support it on the stage that he the author was assured by this patron that the play was already in consequence of his recommendation accepted by one of the managers who had faithfully promised to bring it to light but that when he waited on this said manager to know when he intended to put his production in rehearsal the man declared he had never seen or heard of the piece now mr conjurer said he i want to know whether or not my play has been presented and if i have any sort of chance of seeing it acted this winter cadwallader who had in his younger days sported among the theatrical muses began to lose his temper at this question which recalled the remembrance of his own disappointments and despatched the author with an abrupt answer importing that the affairs of the stage were altogether without the sphere of his divination being entirely regulated by the daemons of dissimulation ignorance and caprice it would be an endless task to recount every individual response which our magician delivered in the course of his conjuration he was consulted in all cases of law physic and trade over and above the ordinary subjects of marriage and fornication his advice and assistance were solicited by sharpers who desired to possess an infallible method of cheating unperceived by fortunehunters who wanted to make prize of widows and heiresses by debauchees who were disposed to be with other mens wives by coxcombs who longed for the death of their fathers by wenches with child who wished themselves rid of their burdens by merchants who had insured above value and thirsted after the news of a wreck by underwriters who prayed for the gift of prescience that they might venture money upon such ships only as should perform the voyage in safety by jews who wanted to foresee the fluctuations of stock by usurers who advance money upon undecided causes by clients who were dubious of the honesty of their counsel in short all matters of uncertain issue were appealed to this tribunal and in point of calculation de moivre was utterly neglected chapter lxxxiv the conjurer and his associate execute a plan of vengeance against certain infidels who pretend to despise their art and peregrine achieves an adventure with a young nobleman by these means the whole variety of characters undisguised passed as it were in review before the confederates who by divers ingenious contrivances punished the most flagrant offenders with as much severity as the nature of their plan would allow at length they projected a scheme for chastising a number of their own acquaintance who had all along professed the utmost contempt for the talent of this conjurer which they endeavoured to ridicule in all companies where his surprising art was the subject of discourse not that they had sense and discernment enough to perceive the absurdity of his pretensions but affected a singularity of opinions with a view of insulting the inferior understandings of those who were deceived by such an idle impostor peregrine indeed for obvious reasons had always espoused their judgment in this case and joined them in reviling the public character of his friend but he knew how far the capacities of those virtuosi extended and had frequently caught them in the fact of recounting their exploits against the conjurer which were the productions of their own invention only on these considerations his wrath was kindled against them and he accordingly concerted measures with his coadjutor for overwhelming them with confusion and dismay in the first place a report was spread by his emissaries that the magician had undertaken to entertain their view with the appearance of any person whom his customers should desire to see whether dead or at the distance of a thousand leagues this extraordinary proposal chancing to be the subject of conversation in a place where most of those infidels were assembled they talked of it in the usual style and some of them swore the fellow ought to be pilloried for his presumption our hero seizing this favourable opportunity acquiesced in their remarks and observed with great vehemence that it would be a meritorious action to put the rascal to the proof and then toss him in a blanket for nonperformance they were wonderfully pleased with this suggestion and forthwith determined to try the experiment though as they understood the apparition would be produced to one only at a time they could not immediately agree in the choice of the person who should stand the first brunt of the magicians skill while each of them severally excused himself from this preference on various pretences peregrine readily undertook the post expressing great confidence of the conjurers incapacity to give him the least cause of apprehension this point being settled they detached one of their number to crabtree in order to bespeak and adjust the hour and terms of the operation which he insisted upon performing at his own apartment where everything was prepared for the occasion at the appointed time they went thither in a body to the number of seven in full expectation of detecting the impostor and were received with such gloomy formality as seemed to have an effect upon the countenances of some among them though they were encouraged by the vivacity of pickle who affected a double share of petulance for the more effectual accomplishment of his purpose cadwallader made no reply to the interrogations they uttered in the levity of their insolence at the first entrance but ordered hadgi to conduct them through the next room that they might see there was no previous apparatus to affright their deputy with objects foreign to his undertaking they found nothing but a couple of wax tapers burning on a table that stood with a chair by it in the middle of the apartment and returned to the audiencechamber leaving peregrine by himself to encounter the phantom of that person whom they should without his knowledge desire the magician to conjure up to his view all the doors being shut and the company seated a profound silence ensued together with a face of dreadful expectation encouraged by the blue flame of the candles which were tipped with sulphur for that purpose and heightened by the dismal sound of a large bell which hadgi tolled in the antechamber cadwallader having thus practised upon their ignorance and fear desired them to name the person to be produced after some whispers among themselves one of them took the pen and writing the name of commodore trunnion upon a slip of paper put it into the hands of the magician who rose from his seat and opening the door of his closet displayed to their view a skull with thigh bones crossed upon a table covered with black cloth this melancholy spectacle made a remarkable impression upon the imaginations of the company already prepossessed by the previous ceremony and they began to survey one another with looks of consternation while cadwallader shutting himself in the closet that was contiguous to the chamber in which his friend peregrine was stationed thrust the label with his uncles name through a small chink in the partition according to agreement muttering at the time a sort of gibberish that increased the panic of his audience then returning to his chair the knell was tolled again and pickle called aloud d n your mummery why dont you despatch this was a signal to crabtree who thus certified of his having received the paper stood up and waved his wand in the figure of an s the motion being thrice performed their ears were all of a sudden invaded by a terrible noise in the next room accompanied with the voice of peregrine who exclaimed in a tone of horror and amazement guard me heaven my uncle trunnion this ejaculation had such an effect upon the hearers that two of them swooned with fear a third fell upon his knees and prayed aloud while the other three in a transport of dismay and distraction burst open the door and rushed into the haunted chamber where they found the table and chair overturned and peregrine extended in all appearance without sense or motion upon the floor they immediately began to chafe his temples and the first symptom of his recovery which they perceived was a hollow groan after which he pronounced these words merciful powers if i live i saw the commodore with his black patch in the very clothes he wore at my sisters wedding this declaration completed their astonishment and terror they observed a wildness in his looks which he seemed to bend on something concealed from their view and were infected by his appearance to such a pitch of superstition that it would have been an easy matter to persuade them that the chair and table were apparitions of their forefathers however they conducted peregrine into the council chamber where the conjurer and hadgi were employed in ministering to those who had fainted the patients having retrieved the use of their faculties cadwallader assuming a double portion of severity in his aspect asked if they were not ashamed of their former incredulity declaring that he was ready to give them more convincing proofs of his art upon the spot and would immediately recall three generations of their progenitors from the dead if they were disposed to relish such company then turning to one of them whose grandfather had been hanged are you said he ambitious of seeing the first remarkable personage of your family say the word and he shall appear this youth who had been the most insolent and obstreperous in the whole society and was now depressed with the same proportion of fear alarmed at the proposal assured the magician he had no curiosity of that sort remaining and that what he had already seen would he hoped have a good effect upon his future life and conversation every one of these heroes made an acknowledgment and profession of the same kind some of which were attended with tears and hadgi having provided chairs for the whole company they departed exceedingly crestfallen two of the number actually sickened with the agitation they had undergone while our hero and his associate made themselves merry with the success of their enterprise but this scheme of fortunetelling did not engross his whole attention he still continued to maintain his appearance in the beau monde and as his expense far exceeded his income strove to contract intimacies with people of interest and power he showed himself regularly at court paid his respects to them in all places of public diversion and frequently entered into their parties either of pleasure or cards in the course of this cultivation he happened one evening at a certain chocolatehouse to overlook a match of piquet in which he perceived a couple of sharpers making a prey of a young nobleman who had neither temper nor skill sufficient to cope with such antagonists our hero being a professed enemy to all knights of industry could not bear to see them cheat in public with such insolent audacity under pretence of communicating some business of importance he begged the favour of speaking to the young gentleman in another corner of the room and in a friendly manner cautioned him against his opponents this hotheaded representative far from thinking or owning himself obliged to pickle for his good counsel looked upon his advice as an insult upon his understanding and replied with an air of ferocious displeasure that he knew how to take care of his own concerns and would not suffer either him or them to bubble him out of a shilling peregrine offended at the association as well as at the ingratitude and folly of this conceited coxcomb expressed his resentment by telling him that he expected at least an acknowledgment for his candid intention but he found his intellects too much warped by his vanity to perceive his own want of capacity and experience inflamed by this reproof the young nobleman challenged him to play for five hundred pounds with many opprobrious or at least contemptuous terms of defiance which provoked our hero to accept the proposal after the other had disengaged himself from the old rooks who were extremely mortified at the interruption the two young champions sat down and fortune acting with uncommon impartiality pickle by the superiority of his talents in two hours won to the amount of as many thousand pounds for which he was obliged to take his antagonists note the sharpers having previously secured his ready money frantic with his loss the rash young man would have continued the game and doubled stakes every time so that peregrine might have increased his acquisition to ten times the sum he had gained but he thought he had already sufficiently chastised the presumption of the challenger and was unwilling to empower fortune to ravish from him the fruits of his success he therefore declined my lords proposal unless he would play for ready money and his lordship having in vain tried his credit among the company our adventurer withdrew leaving him in an ecstasy of rage and disappointment as the insolence of his behaviour had increased with his illluck and he had given vent to divers expressions which peregrine took amiss our young gentleman resolved to augment his punishment by teasing him with demands which could not he knew be immediately satisfied and next day sent pipes to his fathers house with the note which was drawn payable upon demand the debtor who had gone to bed halfdistracted with his misfortune finding himself waked with such a disagreeable dun lost all patience cursed pickle threatened his messenger blasphemed with horrible execrations and made such a noise as reached the ears of his father who ordering his son to be called into his presence examined him about the cause of that uproar which had disturbed the whole family the young gentleman after having essayed to amuse him with sundry equivocations which served only to increase his suspicion and desire of knowing the truth acknowledged that he had lost some money overnight at cards to a gamester who had been so impertinent as to send a message demanding it that morning though he had told the fellow that it would not suit him to pay him immediately the father who was a man of honour reproached him with great severity for his profligate behaviour in general and this scandalous debt in particular which he believed to be some trifle then giving him a banknote for five hundred pounds commanded him to go and discharge it without loss of time this wellprincipled heir took the money but instead of waiting upon his creditor he forthwith repaired to the gaminghouse in hopes of retrieving his loss and before he rose from the table saw his note mortgaged for seveneighths of its value meanwhile pickle incensed at the treatment which his servant had received and informed of his lordships second loss which aggravated his resentment determined to preserve no medium and taking out a writ the same day put it immediately in execution upon the body of his debtor just as he stepped into his chair at the door of whites chocolatehouse the prisoner being naturally fierce and haughty attempted to draw upon the bailiffs who disarmed him in a twinkling and this effort served only to heighten his disgrace which was witnessed by a thousand people most of whom laughed very heartily at the adventure of a lords being arrested such a public transaction could not long escape the knowledge of his father who that very day had the satisfaction to hear that his son was in a spunginghouse in consequence of this information he sent his steward to learn the particulars of the arrest and was equally offended surprised and concerned when he understood the nature of the debt which he imagined his son had already discharged unwilling to pay such a considerable sum for a spendthrift whom he had but too much indulged and who in less than one week might involve himself in such another difficulty the old gentleman wrote a letter to peregrine representing what a hardship it would be upon him to forfeit such sums by the indiscretion of a son whose engagements he was not bound to fulfil and desiring some mitigation in his demand as it was not a debt contracted for value received but incurred without subjecting him to the least damage or inconvenience our adventurer no sooner received this letter than he went in person to wait upon the author to whom he in a candid manner related the particular circumstances of the match together with the ingratitude and audacity of his son which he owned had stimulated him to such measures as he otherwise would have scorned to take the nobleman acknowledged that the revenge was hardly adequate to the provocation and condemned the conduct of his son with such justice and integrity as disarmed peregrine of his resentment and disposed him to give an undoubted proof of his own disinterestedness which he immediately exhibited by producing the note and tearing it to pieces after having assured his lordship that the writ should be withdrawn and the prisoner discharged before night the earl who perfectly well understood the value of money and was no stranger to the characters of mankind stood amazed at the sacrifice which pickle protested was offered by his esteem for his lordship and after having complimented him upon his generosity in a very uncommon strain of encomium begged the favour of his acquaintance and insisted upon his dining with him next day the youth proud of having met with such an opportunity to distinguish himself in less than an hour performed every article of his promise and in the morning was visited by the debtor who came by the express order of his father to thank him for the obligation under which he was laid and to ask pardon for the offence he had given this condescension was very glorious for our hero who graciously received his submission and accompanied him to dinner where he was caressed by the old earl with marks of particular affection and esteem nor was his gratitude confined to exterior civility he offered him the use of his interest at court which was very powerful and repeated his desire of serving him so pressingly that peregrine thought he could not dispense with the opportunity of assisting his absent friend godfrey in whose behalf he begged the influence of his lordship the earl pleased with this request which was another proof of the young gentlemans benevolence said he would not fail to pay the utmost regard to his recommendation and in six weeks a captains commission was actually signed for the brother of emilia who was very agreeably surprised at the intimation he received from the war office though he was utterly ignorant of the canal through which he obtained that promotion chapter lxxxv peregrine is celebrated as a wit and patron and proceeds to entertain himself at the expense of whom it did concern in the meantime peregrine flourished in the gay scenes of life and as i have already observed had divers opportunities of profiting in the way of marriage had not his ambition been a little too inordinate and his heart still biased by a passion which all the levity of youth could not balance nor all the pride of vanity overcome nor was our hero unmarked in the world of letters and taste he had signalized himself in several poetical productions by which he had acquired a good share of reputation not that the pieces were such as ought to have done much honour to his genius but any tolerable performance from a person of his figure and supposed fortune will always be considered by the bulk of readers as an instance of astonishing capacity though the very same production ushered into the world with the name of an author in less affluent circumstances would be justly disregarded and despised so much is the opinion of most people influenced and overawed by ridiculous considerations be this as it will our young gentleman was no sooner distinguished as an author than he was marked out as a patron by all the starving retainers to poetry he was solemnised in odes celebrated in epigrams and fed with the milk of soft dedication his vanity even relished this incense and though his reason could not help despising those that offered it not one of them was sent away unowned by his munificence he began to think himself in good earnest that superior genius which their flattery had described he cultivated acquaintance with the wits of fashion and even composed in secret a number of bonmots which he uttered in company as the impromptus of his imagination in this practice indeed he imitated some of the most renowned geniuses of the age who if the truth were known have laboured in secret with the sweat of their brows for many a repartee which they have vended as the immediate production of fancy and expression he was so successful in this exercise of his talents that his fame actually came in competition with that great man who had long sat at the helm of wit and in a dialogue that once happened between them on the subject of a corkscrew wherein the altercation was discharged according to bayes slap for slap dash for dash our hero was judged to have the better of his lordship by some of the minor satellites that commonly surround and reflect the rays of such mighty luminaries in a word he dipped himself so far in these literary amusements that he took the management of the pit into his direction putting himself at the head of those critics who call themselves the town and in that capacity chastised several players who had been rendered insolent and refractory by unmerited success as for the new productions of the stage though generally unspirited and insipid they always enjoyed the benefit of his influence and protection because he never disliked the performance so much as he sympathized with the poor author who stood behind the scenes in the most dreadful suspense trembling as it were on the very brink of damnation yet though he extended his generosity and compassion to the humble and needy he never let slip one opportunity of mortifying villainy and arrogance had the executive power of the legislature been vested in him he would have doubtless devised strange species of punishment for all offenders against humanity and decorum but restricted as he was he employed his invention in subjecting them to the ridicule and contempt of their fellowsubjects it was with this view he set on foot the scheme of conjuration which was still happily carried on and made use of the intelligence of his friend cadwallader though he sometimes converted this advantage to the purposes of gallantry being as the reader may have perceived of a very amorous complexion he not only acted the reformer or rather the castigator in the fashionable world but also exercised his talents among the inferior class of people who chanced to incur his displeasure one mischievous plan that entered our heros imagination was suggested by two advertisements published in the same paper by persons who wanted to borrow certain sums of money for which they promised to give undeniable security peregrine from the style and manner of both concluded they were written by attorneys a species of people for whom he entertained his uncles aversion in order to amuse himself and some of his friends with their disappointment he wrote a letter signed a b to each advertiser according to the address specified in the newspaper importing that if he would come with his writings to a certain coffeehouse near the temple precisely at six in the evening he would find a person sitting in the righthand box next to the window who would be glad to treat with him about the subject of his advertisement and should his security be liked would accommodate him with the sum which he wanted to raise before the hour of this double appointment pickle with his friend cadwallader and a few more gentlemen to whom he had thought proper to communicate the plan went to the coffeehouse and seated themselves near the place that was destined for their meeting the hope of getting money had such an evident effect upon their punctuality that one of them arrived a considerable time before the hour and having reconnoitred the room took his station according to the direction he had received fixing his eye upon a dock that stood before him and asking of the barkeeper if it was not too slow he had not remained in this posture many minutes when he was joined by a strange figure that waddled into the room with a bundle of papers in his bosom and the sweat running over his nose seeing a man in the box to which he had been directed he took it for granted that he was the lender and as soon as he could recover his breath which was almost exhausted by the despatch he had made sir said he i presume you are the gentleman i was to meet about that loan here he was interrupted by the other who eagerly replied a b sir i suppose the same cried the lastcomer i was afraid i should be too late for i was detained beyond my expectation by a nobleman at the other end of the town that wants to mortgage a small trifle of his estate about a thousand a year and my watch happens to be in the hands of the maker having met with an accident a few nights ago which set it asleep but howsomever there is no time lost and i hope this affair will be transacted to the satisfaction of us both for my own part i love to do good offices myself and therefore i expect nothing but what is fair and honest of other people his new friend was exceedingly comforted by this declaration which he considered as a happy omen of his success and the hope of fingering the cash operated visibly in his countenance while he expressed his satisfaction at meeting with a person of such candour and humanity the pleasure said he of dealing with an easy conscientious man is in my opinion superior to that of touching all the money upon earth for what joy can be compared with what a generous mind feels in befriending its fellowcreatures i was never so happy in my life as at one time in lending five hundred pounds to a worthy gentleman in distress without insisting upon rigid security sir one may easily distinguish an upright man by his countenance for example now i think i could take your word for ten thousand pounds the other with great joy protested that he was right in his conjecture and returned the compliment a thousandfold by which means the expectation of both was wound up to a very interesting pitch and both at the same instant began to produce their papers in the untying of which their hands shook with transports of eagerness and impatience while their eyes were so intent upon their work that they did not perceive the occupation of each other at length one of them having got the start of the other and unrolled several skins of musty parchment directed his view to the employment of his friend and seeing him fumbling at his bundle asked if that was a blank bond and conveyance which he had brought along with him the other without lifting up his eyes or desisting from his endeavours to loose the knot which by this time he had applied to his teeth answered this question in the negative observing that the papers in his hand were the security which he proposed to give for the money this reply converted the looks of the inquirer into a stare of infinite solidity accompanied with the word anan which he pronounced in a tone of fear and astonishment the other alarmed at this note cast his eyes towards the supposed lender and was in a moment infected by his aspect all the exultation of hope that sparkled in their eyes was now succeeded by disappointment and dismay and while they gazed ruefully at each other their features were gradually elongated like the transient curls of a middlerow periwig this emphatic silence was however broken by the lastcomer who in a faltering accent desired the other to recollect the contents of his letter of your letter cried the first putting into his hand the advertisement he had received from pickle which he had no sooner perused than he produced his own for the satisfaction of the other party so that another gloomy pause ensued at the end of which each uttered a profound sigh or rather groan and rising up sneaked off without further communication he who seemed to be the most afflicted of the two taking his departure with an exclamation of humbugged egad such were the amusements of our hero though they did not engross his whole time some part of which was dedicated to nocturnal riots and revels among a set of young noblemen who had denounced war against temperance economy and common sense and were indeed the devoted sons of tumult waste and prodigality not that peregrine relished those scenes which were a succession of absurd extravagance devoid of all true spirit taste or enjoyment but his vanity prompted him to mingle with those who are entitled the choice spirits of the age and his disposition was so pliable as to adapt itself easily to the measures of his company where he had not influence enough to act in the capacity of a director their rendezvous was a certain tavern which might be properly styled the temple of excess where they left the choice of their fare to the discretion of the landlord that they might save themselves the pains of exercising their own reason and in order to avoid the trouble of adjusting the bill ordered the waiter to declare how much every individual must pay without specifying the articles of the charge this proportion generally amounted to two guineas per head for each dinner and supper and frequently exceeded that sum of which the landlord durst not abate without running the risk of having his nose slit for his moderation but this was puny expense compared with that which they often incurred by the damage done to the furniture and servants in the madness of their intoxication as well as the loss they sustained at hazard an amusement to which all of them had recourse in the progress of their debauches this elegant diversion was introduced encouraged and promoted by a crew of rapacious sharpers who had made themselves necessary companions to this hopeful generation by the talents of pimping and buffoonery though they were universally known even by those they preyed upon to have no other means of earning their livelihood than the most infamous and fraudulent practices they were caressed and courted by these infatuated dupes when a man of honour who would not join in their excesses would have been treated with the utmost indignity and contempt though peregrine in his heart detested those abandoned courses and was a professed enemy to the whole society of gamesters whom he considered and always treated as the foes of humankind he was insensibly accustomed to licentious riot and even led imperceptibly into play by those cormorants who are no less dangerous in the art of cheating than by their consummate skill in working up the passions of unwary youth they are for the most part naturally cool phlegmatic and crafty and by a long habit of dissimulation have gained an absolute dominion over the hasty passions of the heart so that they engage with manifest advantage over the impatience and impetuosity of a warm undesigning temper like that of our young gentleman who when he was heated with wine misled by example invited on one hand and defied on the other forgot all his maxims of caution and sobriety and plunging into the reigning folly of the place had frequent occasions to moralize in the morning upon the loss of the preceding night these penitential reflections were attended with many laudable resolutions of profiting by the experience which he had so dearly purchased but he was one of those philosophers who always put off till another day the commencement of their reformation chapter lxxxvi peregrine receives a letter from hatchway in consequence of which he repairs to the garrison and performs the last offices to his aunt he is visited by mr gauntlet who invites him to his marriage in this circle of amusements our heros time was parcelled out and few young gentlemen of the age enjoyed life with greater relish notwithstanding those intervening checks of reason which served only to whet his appetite for a repetition of the pleasures she so prudently condemned when he received the following letter by which he was determined to visit his estate in the country cousin pickle i hope you are in a better trim than your aunt who hath been fast moored to her bed these seven weeks by several feet of underwater lodging in her hold and hollop whereby i doubt her planks are rotted so that she cannot choose but fall to pieces in a short time i have done all in my power to keep her tight and easy and free from sudden squalls that might overstrain her and here have been the doctors who have scuttled her lower deck and let out six gallons of water for my own part i wonder how the devil it came there for you know as how it was a liquor she never took in but as for those fellows the doctors they are like unskilful carpenters that in mending one leak make a couple and so she fills again apace but the worst sign of all is this here she wont let a drop of nantz go between the combings of her teeth and has quite lost the rudder of her understanding whereby she yaws woundily in her speech palavering about some foreign part called the new geereusalem and wishing herself in a safe berth in the river geordun the parson i must say strives to keep her steady concerning the navigation of her soul and talks very sensibly of charity and the poor whereof she hath left a legacy of two hundred pounds in her will and here has been mr gamaliel and your brother my lord demanding entrance at the gate in order to see her but i would not suffer them to come aboard and pointed my patereroes which made them sheer off your sister mrs clover keeps close watch upon her kinswoman without ever turning in and a kindhearted young woman it is i should be glad to see you at the garrison if the wind of your inclination sits that way and mayhap it may be a comfort to your aunt to behold you alongside of her when her anchor is apeak so no more at present but rests your friend and humble servant to command john hatchway next morning after the receipt of this epistle peregrine in order to manifest his regard to his aunt as well as his friendship for honest jack set out on horseback for their habitation attended by pipes who longed to see his old messmate but before he had reached the garrison mrs hatchway had given up the ghost in the threescore and fifth year of her age the widower seemed to bear his loss with resignation and behaved very decently upon the occasion though he did not undergo those dangerous transports of sorrow which some tenderhearted husbands have felt at the departure of their wives the lieutenant was naturally a philosopher and so well disposed to acquiesce in the dispensations of providence that in this as well as in every other emergency of his life he firmly believed that everything which happened was for the best peregrines task therefore was not so great in comforting him as in consoling his own sister who with great poignancy and sincerity of grief lamented the death of the only relation with whom she had maintained any intimacy of correspondence for her mother was as implacable as ever in her enmity against her and peregrine and rather more determined in her rancour that which was originally a sudden transport of indignation being by this time settled into a confirmed inveteracy of hate as for gam who was now dignified by the country people with the appellation of the young squire he still acted in the capacity of minister to the caprice and vengeance of his mother taking all opportunities of disturbing julias peace slandering her reputation and committing outrages against the tenants and domestics of her husband who was a man of quiet and timorous disposition but the chief amusement of young pickle in his later years was the chase in which he acquired some renown by his intrepidity and remarkable figure which improved every day in deformity insomuch as to suggest a ludicrous scheme of revenge to a gentleman in the neighbourhood having been affronted by the insolence of crookback he clothed a large baboon that was in his possession in a dress that resembled the hunting equipage of gam and ordering the animal to be set astride and tied upon the back of his keenest hunter turned them out one day after the hounds the horse in a little time outstripping all the rest in the field the rider was mistaken for gam by the whole company who saluted him as he passed with a halloo observing that the squire had his usual good luck in being better mounted than his neighbours pickle afterwards appearing in his own person created great astonishment in the spectators one of whom asked if he had split himself in twain and pointed out his representative who was by this time almost up with the hounds upon which the identical gam went in pursuit of the impostor when he overtook him he was so much enraged at the counterfeit that he attacked the baboon whip in hand and in all probability would have sacrificed him to his resentment had not he been prevented by the other foxhunters they interposed in order to make up the difference betwixt two brothers of the sport and were equally surprised and diverted when they distinguished the quality of crookbacks antagonist which they rescued from his rage and reconveyed to its master peregrine at the request of his friend jack took charge of his aunts funeral to which his parents were invited though they did not think proper to appear or pay the least regard to his solicitations when he desired permission to wait upon them in person nevertheless old gamaliel at the instigation of his wife afterwards obtained an order from doctors commons obliging hatchway to produce the will of his wife on the supposition that she had bequeathed to him some part of the money which he knew was at her own disposal but from this step he reaped no other satisfaction than that of finding himself altogether neglected by the testatrix who had left all her effects to her husband except one thousand pounds with her jewels to julias daughter the benefaction mentioned in the lieutenants letter and some inconsiderable legacies to her favourite domestics a few days after the interment of this good lady our hero was agreeably surprised with a visit from his friend godfrey who had come to england in consequence of that promotion which he owed to his interest though the soldier himself placed it to the credit of a certain courtier who had formerly promised to befriend him and now finding his advancement unowned very modestly arrogated the merit of it to himself he communicated his goodfortune to pickle who complimented him upon it as an event of which he had no precognition and at the same time told him that in consequence of his preferment his cousin at windsor had consented to his being immediately united in the bands of wedlock with his lovely sophy that the weddingday was already fixed and that nothing would be wanting to his happiness if peregrine would honour the nuptials with his presence our hero accepted the invitation with great eagerness when he learned that emilia would be there in quality of bridesmaid and now repeated what he had formerly written to his friend namely that he was not only willing but extremely impatient to atone for his mad behaviour to that young lady by laying himself and his whole fortune at her feet godfrey thanked him for his honourable intention and promised to use his influence and that of sophy in his behalf though he seemed dubious of their success on account of his sisters delicacy which could not pardon the least shadow of disrespect he owned indeed he was not certain that she would appear in the same company with pickle but as she made no stipulation on that score he would interpret her silence in the most favourable manner and keep her in ignorance of his design until she should find it too late to retract with any decency the hope of seeing and conversing with emilia and perhaps of being reconciled to her after having suffered so much and so long from her displeasure raised a tumult of ideas in his breast and produced a strange inquietude of joy and perturbation gauntlet having stayed with him a few days and signified the time appointed for his spousals took his leave in order to prepare for the occasion while peregrine with his friend hatchway made a tour among his acquaintance in the country with a view of sounding their inclinations touching a project which he had lately conceived of offering himself as a candidate for a certain borough in the neighbourhood at the ensuing election for members of parliament this scheme which was suggested to him by one of his quality patrons would have succeeded according to his wish had the election taken place immediately but before that happened his interest was overbalanced by some small accidents that will be recorded in the sequel in the meantime he repaired to windsor on the eve of his friends marriage and understood from godfrey that it was with the utmost difficulty he and sophy could prevail upon his sister to be present at the wedding when she was informed that her lover was invited and that her consent had not been obtained until they had promised on the part of peregrine that he should not renew the old topic nor even speak to her in the style of a former acquaintance our young gentleman was nettled at this preliminary to which however he said he would adhere and so well did he think himself fortified with pride and resentment that he resolved to behave towards her with such indifference as would he hoped mortify her vanity and thereby punish her for the implacability of her disposition armed with these sentiments he was next day introduced by godfrey to the bride who received him with her usual sweetness of temper and affability and emilia being present he saluted her with a distant bow which she acknowledged with a cold courtesy and an aspect of ice though this deportment confirmed his displeasure her beauty undermined his resolution he thought her charms infinitely improved since their last parting and a thousand fond images recurring to his imagination he felt his whole soul dissolving into tenderness and love in order to banish those dangerous ideas he endeavoured to enter into a gay conversation with sophy on the subject of the approaching ceremony but his tongue performed its office awkwardly his eyes were attracted towards emilia as if they had been subject to the power of fascination in spite of all his efforts a deep sigh escaped from his bosom and his whole appearance indicated anxiety and confusion the bridegroom perceiving his condition abridged the visit and having conducted his companion to his own lodgings expressed his concern at having been the innocent occasion of his uneasiness by exposing him to the sight of emilia which he perceived had given him pain peregrine who had by this time recollected the dictates of his pride assured him that he was very much mistaken in the cause of his disorder which was no other than a sudden qualm to which he had been for some time subject and to show him how philosophically he could bear the disdain of emilia which with all deference to her conduct he could not help thinking a little too severe he desired as the bridegroom had made preparation for a private ball in the evening that he would provide him with an agreeable partner in which case he would exhibit undoubted proofs of the tranquility of his heart i was in hopes answered godfrey of being able with the assistance of sophy to make up matters between you and my sister and for that reason kept her unengaged to any other gentleman for the night but since she was so peevishly obstinate i shall take care to accommodate you with a very handsome young lady whose partner will not be sorry to exchange her for emilia the thoughts of having an opportunity to coquette with another woman under the eye of this implacable mistress supported his spirits during the ceremony which put gauntlet in possession of his hearts desire and by means of this cordial he found himself so undisturbed at dinner though he sat opposite to his fair enemy that he was able to pass some occasional jokes upon the newmarried couple with some appearance of mirth and goodhumour nor did emily any otherwise seem affected by his presence than by excepting him from the participation of those genial regards which she distributed to the rest of the company this easiness of behaviour on her side reinforced his resolution by giving him pretence to call her sensibility in question for he could not conceive how any woman of acute feelings could sit unmoved in presence of a man with whom she had such recent and intimate connection not considering that she had much more reason to condemn his affectation of unconcern and that her external deportment might like his own be an effort of pride and resentment this contest in point of dissimulation continued till night when the company was paired for dancing and peregrine began the ball by walking a minuet with the bride then he took out the young lady to whom he was recommended by gauntlet being very well pleased to see that her person was such as might have inspired even emily herself with jealousy though at the same time he perceived his mistress coupled with a gay young officer whom with all due deference to his own qualifications he considered as no despicable rival however he himself first began hostilities by becoming all of a sudden particular with his partner whom he forthwith assailed with flattering compliments that soon introduced the subject of love upon which he expatiated with great art and elocution using not only the faculty of speech but also the language of the eyes in which he was a perfect connoisseur this behaviour soon manifested itself to the whole assembly the greatest part of whom believed that he was in good earnest captivated by the charms of his partner while emilia penetrating into his design turned his own artillery upon himself by seeming to listen with pleasure to the addresses of his rival who was no novice in the art of making love she even affected uncommon vivacity and giggled aloud at every whisper which he conveyed into her ear insomuch that she in her turn afforded speculation to the company who imagined the young soldier had made a conquest of the bridegrooms sister pickle himself began to cherish the same opinion which gradually invaded his goodhumour and at length filled his bosom with rage he strove to suppress his indignation and called every consideration of vanity and revenge to his aid he endeavoured to wean his eyes from the fatal object that disturbed him but they would not obey his direction and command he wished himself deprived of all sensation when he heard her laugh and saw her smile upon the officer and in the course of countrydancing when he was obliged to join hands with her the touch thrilled through all his nerves and kindled a flame within him which he could not contain in a word his endeavours to conceal the situation of his thoughts were so violent that his constitution could not endure the shock the sweat ran down his forehead in a stream the colour vanished from his cheeks his knees began to totter and his eyesight to fail so that he must have fallen at his full length upon the floor had not he retired very abruptly into another room where he threw himself upon a couch and fainted in this condition he was found by his friend who seeing him withdraw with such symptoms of disorder followed him thither and when he recovered the use of his faculties pressed him to make use of a bed in that house rather than expose himself in the night air by going home to his own lodgings but not being able to prevail upon him to accept the offer he wrapped him up in a cloak and conducting him to the inn where he lodged helped him to undress and go to bed where he was immediately seized with a violent fit of the ague godfrey behaved with great tenderness and would have actually borne him company all night notwithstanding the circumstances of his own situation had not his friend insisted upon his returning to the company and making his apology to his partner for his sudden departure this was a step absolutely necessary towards maintaining the quiet of the assembly which he found in great consternation occasioned by his absence for some of the ladies seeing the bridegroom follow the stranger in his retreat the meaning of which they did not comprehend began to be afraid of a quarrel emilia upon pretence of that supposition was so much alarmed that she could not stand and was fain to have recourse to a smellingbottle the bride who understood the whole mystery was the only person that acted with deliberation and composure she imputed emilias disorder to the right cause which was no other than concern for the condition of her lover and assured the ladies there was nothing extraordinary in mr pickles going off he being subject to fainting fits by which he was often overtaken without any previous notice the arrival of gauntlet confirmed the truth of this declaration he made an apology to the company in the name of his friend who he told them was suddenly taken ill and they returned to their diversion of dancing with this variation emilia was so disordered and fatigued that she begged to be excused from continuing the exercise and peregrines partner being disengaged was paired with the young officer for whom she was originally designed meanwhile the bride withdrew into another apartment with her sister and expostulated with her upon her cruelty to mr pickle assuring her from godfreys information that he had undergone a severe fit on her account which in all likelihood would have a dangerous effect upon his constitution though emily was inflexible in her answers to the kind remonstrances of the gentle sophy her heart was melting with the impressions of pity and love and finding herself unable to perform the duty of her function in putting the bride to bed she retired to her own chamber and in secret sympathized with the distemper of her lover in the morning as early as decency would permit him to leave the arms of his dear wife captain gauntlet made a visit to peregrine who had passed a very tedious and uneasy night having been subject to short intervals of delirium during which pipes had found it very difficult to keep him fast belayed he owned indeed to godfrey that his imagination had been haunted by the ideas of emilia and her officer which tormented him to an unspeakable degree of anguish and distraction and that he would rather suffer death than a repetition of such excruciating reflections he was however comforted by his friend who assured him that his sisters inclinations would in time prevail over all the endeavours of resentment and pride illustrating this asseveration by an account of the manner in which she was affected by the knowledge of his disorder and advising him to implore the mediation of sophy in a letter which she should communicate to emilia this was an opportunity which our hero thought too favourable to be neglected calling for paper he sat up in his bed and in the first transports of his emotion wrote the following petition to godfreys amiable wife dear madam the affliction of a contrite heart can never appeal to your benevolence in vain and therefore i presume to approach you in this season of delight with the language of sorrow requesting that you will espouse the cause of an unhappy lover who mourns with unutterable anguish over his ruined hope and intercede for my pardon with that divine creature whom in the intemperance and excess of passion i have so mortally offended good heaven is my guilt inexpiable am i excluded from all hope of remission am i devoted to misery and despair i have offered all the atonement which the most perfect and sincere penitence could suggest and she rejects my humility and repentance if her resentment would pursue me to the grave let her signify her pleasure and may i be branded with the name of villain and remembered with infamy and detestation to all posterity if i hesitate one moment in sacrificing a life which is odious to emilia ah madam while i thus pour forth the effusions of my grief and distraction i look around the apartment in which i lie and every wellknown object that salutes my view recalls to my remembrance that fond that happy day on which the fair the good the tenderhearted sophy became my advocate though i was a stranger to her acquaintance and effected a transporting reconciliation between me and that same enchanting beauty that is now so implacably incensed if she is not satisfied with the pangs of remorse and disappointment the transports of madness i have undergone let her prescribe what further penance she thinks i ought to endure and when i decline her sentence let me be the object of her eternal disdain i commit myself dear madam dear sophy dear partner of my friend to your kind interposition i know you will manage my cause as a concern on which my happiness entirely depends and i hope everything from your compassion and beneficence while i fear everything from her rigour and barbarity yes i call it barbarity a savageness of delicacy altogether inconsistent with the tenderness of human nature and may the most abject contempt be my portion if i live under its scourge but i begin to rave i conjure you by your own humanity and sweetness of disposition i conjure you by your love for the man whom heaven hath decreed your protector to employ your influence with that angel of wrath in behalf of your obliged and obedient servant p pickle this epistle was immediately transmitted by godfrey to his wife who perused it with marks of the most humane sympathy and carrying it into her sisters chamber here is something said she presenting the paper which i must recommend to your serious attention emilia who immediately guessed the meaning of this address absolutely refused to look upon it or even to hear it read till her brother entering her apartment reprimanded her sharply for her obstinacy and pride accused her of folly and dissimulation and entered so warmly into the interests of his friend that she thought him unkind in his remonstrances and bursting into a flood of tears reproached him with partiality and want of affection godfrey who entertained the most perfect love and veneration for his sister asked pardon for having given offence and kissing the drops from her fair eyes begged she would for his sake listen to the declaration of his friend thus solicited she could not refuse to hear the letter which when he had repeated she lamented her own fate in being the occasion of so much uneasiness desired her brother to assure mr pickle that she was not a voluntary enemy to his peace on the contrary she wished him all happiness though she hoped he would not blame her for consulting her own in avoiding any future explanation or connection with a person whose correspondence she found herself under a necessity to renounce in vain did the newmarried couple exhaust their eloquence in attempting to prove that the reparation which our hero had offered was adequate to the injury she had sustained that in reconciling herself to a penitent lover who subscribed to her own terms of submission her honour would be acquitted by the most scrupulous and severe judges of decorum and that her inflexibility would be justly ascribed to the pride and insensibility of her heart she turned a deaf ear to all their arguments exhortations and entreaties and threatened to leave the house immediately if they would not promise to drop that subject of discourse godfrey very much chagrined at the bad success of his endeavours returned to his friend and made as favourable a report of the affair as the nature of his conversation with emilia would permit but as he could not avoid mentioning her resolution in the close peregrine was obliged to drink again the bitter draught of disappointment which put his passions into such a state of agitation as produced a short ecstasy of despair in which he acted a thousand extravagances this paroxysm however soon subsided into a settled reserve of gloomy resentment which he in secret indulged detaching himself as soon as possible from the company of the soldier on pretence of retiring to rest while he lay ruminating upon the circumstances of his present situation his friend pipes who knew the cause of his anxiety and firmly believed that emilia loved his master at her heart howsoever she might attempt to disguise her sentiments i say thomas was taken with a conceit which he thought would set everything to rights and therefore put it in execution without further delay laying aside his hat he ran directly to the house of sophys father and affecting an air of surprise and consternation to which he had never before been subject thundered at the door with such an alarming knock as in a moment brought the whole family into the hall when he was admitted he began to gape stare and pant at the same time and made no reply when godfrey asked what was the matter till mrs gauntlet expressed her apprehensions about his master when pickles name was mentioned he seemed to make an effort to speak and in a bellowing tone pronounced brought himself up split my topsails so saying he pointed to his own neck and rose upon his tiptoes by way of explaining the meaning of his words godfrey without staying to ask another question rushed out and flew towards the inn with the utmost horror and concern while sophy who did not rightly understand the language of the messenger addressing herself to him a second time said i hope no accident has happened to mr pickle no accident at all replied tom he has only hanged himself for love these words had scarcely proceeded from his mouth when emilia who stood listening at the parlour door shrieked aloud and dropped down senseless upon the floor while her sister who was almost equally shocked at the intelligence had recourse to the assistance of her maid by whom she was supported from falling pipes hearing emilys voice congratulated himself upon the success of his stratagem he sprung to her assistance and lifting her up into an easy chair stood by her until he saw her recover from her swoon and heard her call upon his masters name with all the frenzy of despairing love then he bent his course back to the inn overjoyed at the opportunity of telling peregrine what a confession he had extorted from his mistress and extremely vain of this proof of his own sagacity in the meantime godfrey arriving at the house in which he supposed this fatal catastrophe had happened ran upstairs to peregrines chamber without staying to make any inquiry below and finding the door locked burst it open with one stroke of his foot but what was his amazement when upon entrance our hero starting up from the bed saluted him with a boisterous exclamation of zounds whos there he was struck dumb with astonishment which also riveted him to the place where he stood scarce crediting the testimony of his own senses till peregrine with an air of discontent which denoted him displeased with his intrusion dispelled his apprehension by a second address saying i see you consider me as a friend by your using me without ceremony the soldier thus convinced of the falsehood of the information he had received began to imagine that pickle had projected the plan which was executed by his servant and looking upon it as a piece of unjustifiable finesse which might be attended with very melancholy consequences to his sister or wife he answered in a supercilious tone that mr pickle must blame himself for the interruption of his repose which was entirely owing to the sorry jest he had set on foot pickle who was the child of passion and more than half mad with impatience before this visit hearing himself treated in such a cavalier manner advanced close up to godfreys breast and assuming a stern or rather frantic countenance hark ye sir said he you are mistaken if you think i jest i am in downright earnest i assure you gauntlet who was not a man to be browbeaten seeing himself thus bearded by a person of whose conduct he had he thought reason to complain put on his military look of defiance and erecting his chest replied with an exalted voice mr pickle whether you were in jest or earnest you must give me leave to tell you that the scheme was childish unseasonable and unkind not to give it a harsher term death sir cried our adventurer you trifle with my disquiet if there is any meaning in your insinuation explain yourself and then i shall know what answer it will befit me to give i came with very different sentiments resumed the soldier but since you urge me to expostulation and behave with such unprovoked loftiness of displeasure i will without circumlocution tax you with having committed an outrage upon the peace of my family in sending your fellow to alarm us with such an abrupt account of your having done violence upon yourself peregrine confounded at this imputation stood silent with a most savage aspect of surprise eager to know the circumstance to which his accuser alluded and incensed to find it beyond the sphere of his comprehension while these two irritated friends stood fronting each other with mutual indignation in their eyes and attitudes they were joined by pipes who without taking the least notice of the situation in which he found them told his master that he might up with the topgallant masts of his heart and out with his rejoicing pendants for as to miss emily he had clapped her helm aweather the vessel wore and now she was upon the other tack standing right into the harbour of his goodwill peregrine who was not yet a connoisseur in the terms of his lacquey commanded him upon pain of his displeasure to be more explicit in his intelligence and by dint of divers questions obtained a perfect knowledge of the scheme which he had put in execution for his service this information perplexed him not a little he would have chastised his servant upon the spot for his temerity had he not plainly perceived that the fellows intention was to promote his case and satisfaction and on the other hand he knew not how to acquit himself of the suspicion which he saw godfrey entertain of his being the projector of the plan without condescending to an explanation which his present disposition could not brook after some pause however turning to pipes with a severe frown rascal said he this is the second time i have suffered in the opinion of that lady by your ignorance and presumption if ever you intermeddle in my affairs for the future without express order and direction by all thats sacred i will put you to death without mercy away and let my horse be saddled this instant pipes having withdrawn in order to perform this piece of duty our young gentleman addressing himself again to the soldier and laying his hand upon his breast said with a solemnity of regard captain gauntlet upon my honour i am altogether innocent of that shallow device which you impute to my invention and i dont think you do justice either to my intellect or honour in supposing me capable of such insolent absurdity as for your sister i have once in my life affronted her in the madness and impetuosity of desire but i have made such acknowledgments and offered such atonement as few women of her sphere would have refused and before god i am determined to endure every torment of disappointment and despair rather than prostrate myself again to the cruelty of her unjustifiable pride so saying he stalked suddenly downstairs and took horse immediately his spirits being supported by resentment which prompted him to vow within himself that he would seek consolation for the disdain of emilia in the possession of the first willing wench he should meet upon the road while he set out for the garrison with these sentiments gauntlet in a suspense between anger shame and concern returned to the house of his fatherinlaw where he found his sister still violently agitated from the news of peregrines death the mystery of which he forthwith unravelled recounting at the same time the particulars of the conversation which had happened at the inn and describing the demeanour of pickle with some expressions of asperity which were neither agreeable to emilia nor approved by the gentle sophy who tenderly chid him for allowing peregrine to depart in terms of misunderstanding chapter lxxxvii peregrine sets out for the garrison and meets with a nymph of the road whom he takes into keeping and metamorphoses into a fine lady in the meantime our hero jogged along in a profound reverie which was disturbed by a beggarwoman and her daughter who solicited him for alms as he passed them on the road the girl was about the age of sixteen and notwithstanding the wretched equipage in which she appeared exhibited to his view a set of agreeable features enlivened with the complexion of health and cheerfulness the resolution i have already mentioned was still warm in his imagination and he looked upon this young mendicant as a very proper object for the performance of his vow he therefore entered into a conference with the mother and for a small sum of money purchased her property in the wench who did not require much courtship and entreaty before she consented to accompany him to any place that he should appoint for her habitation this contract being settled to his satisfaction he ordered pipes to seat his acquisition behind him upon the crupper and alighting at the first publichouse which they found upon the road he wrote a letter to hatchway desiring him to receive this hedge inamorata and direct her to be cleaned and clothed in a decent manner with all expedition so that she should be touchable upon his arrival which on that account he would defer for the space of one day this billet together with the girl he committed to the charge of pipes after having laid strong injunctions upon him to abstain from all attempts upon her chastity and ordered him to make the best of his way to the garrison while he himself crossed the country to a market town where he proposed to spend the night tom thus cautioned proceeded with his charge and being naturally taciturn opened not his lips until he had performed the best half of his journey but thomas notwithstanding his irony appearance was in reality composed of flesh and blood his desire being titillated by the contact of a buxom wench whose right arm embraced his middle as he rode his thoughts began to mutiny against his master and he found it almost impossible to withstand the temptation of making love nevertheless he wrestled with these rebellious suggestions with all the reason that heaven had enabled him to exert and that being totally overcome his victorious passion suddenly broke out in this address sblood i believe master thinks i have no more stuff in my body than a dried haddock to turn me adrift in the dark with such a spanker dye think he dont my dear to this question his fellowtraveller replied swanker anan and the lover resumed his suit saying oons how you tickle my timber something shoots from your arm through my stowage to the very keelstone hant you got quicksilver in your hand quicksilver said the lady d n the silver that has crossed my hand this month dye think if i had silver i shouldnt buy me a smock adsooks you baggage cried the lover you shouldnt want a smock nor a petticoat neither if you could have a kindness for a truehearted sailor as sound and strong as a nineinch cable that would keep all clear above board and everything snug under the hatches curse your gum said the charmer whats your gay balls and your hatches to me do but let us bringto a little answered the wooer whose appetite was by this time whetted to a most ravenous degree and ill teach you to box the compass my dear ah you strapper what a jolly b you are b exclaimed this modern dulcinea incensed at the opprobrious term such a b as your mother you dog d you ive a good mind to box your jaws instead of your comepiss ill let you know as how i am meat for your master you saucy blackguard you are worse than a dog you old flintyfaced fleabitten scrub a dog wears his own coat but you wear your masters such a torrent of disgraceful epithets from a person who had no clothes at all converted the gallants love into choler and he threatened to dismount and seize her to a tree when she should have a taste of his catoninetails athwart her quarters but instead of being intimidated by his menaces she set him at defiance and held forth with such a flow of eloquence as would have entitled her to a considerable share of reputation even among the nymphs of billingsgate for this young lady over and above a natural genius for altercation had her talents cultivated among the venerable society of weeders podders and hoppers with whom she had associated from her tender years no wonder then that she soon obtained a complete victory over pipes who as the reader may have observed was very little addicted to the exercise of speech indeed he was utterly disconcerted by her volubility of tongue and being altogether unfurnished with answers to the distinct periods of her discourse very wisely chose to save himself the expense of breath and argument by giving her a full swing of cable so that she might bring herself up while he rode onwards in silent composure without taking any more notice of his fair fellowtraveller than if she had been his masters cloakbag in spite of all the despatch he could make it was late before he arrived at the garrison where he delivered the letter and the lady to the lieutenant who no sooner understood the intention of his friend than he ordered all the tubs in the house to be carried into the hall and filled with water tom having provided himself with swabs and brushes divested the fair stranger of her variegated drapery which was immediately committed to the flames and performed upon her soft and sleek person the ceremony of scrubbing as it is practised on board of the kings ships of war yet the nymph herself did not submit to this purification without repining she cursed the director who was upon the spot with many abusive allusions to his wooden leg and as for pipes the operator she employed her talons so effectually upon his face that the blood ran over his nose in sundry streams and next morning when those rivulets were dry his countenance resembled the rough bark of a plumtree plastered with gum nevertheless he did his duty with great perseverance cut off her hair close to the scalp handled his brushes with dexterity applied his swabs of different magnitude and texture as the case required and lastly rinsed the whole body with a dozen pails of cold water discharged upon her head these ablutions being executed he dried her with towels accommodated her with a clean shift and acting the part of a valetdechambre clothed her from head to foot in clean and decent apparel which had belonged to mrs hatchway by which means her appearance was altered so much for the better that when peregrine arrived next day he could scarce believe his own eyes he was for that reason extremely well pleased with his purchase and now resolved to indulge a whim which seized him at the very instant of his arrival he had as i believe the reader will readily allow made considerable progress in the study of character from the highest rank to the most humble station of life and found it diversified in the same manner through every degree of subordination and precedency nay he moreover observed that the conversation of those who are dignified with the appellation of polite company is neither more edifying nor entertaining than that which is met with among the lower classes of mankind and that the only essential difference in point of demeanour is the form of an education which the meanest capacity can acquire without much study or application possessed of this notion he determined to take the young mendicant under his own tutorage and instruction in consequence of which he hoped he should in a few weeks be able to produce her in company as an accomplished young lady of uncommon wit and an excellent understanding this extravagant plan he forthwith began to execute with great eagerness and industry and his endeavours succeeded even beyond his expectation the obstacle in surmounting of which he found the greatest difficulty was an inveterate habit of swearing which had been indulged from her infancy and confirmed by the example of those among whom she had lived however she had the rudiments of good sense from nature which taught her to listen to wholesome advice and was so docile as to comprehend and retain the lessons which her governor recommended to her attention insomuch that he ventured in a few days to present her at table among a set of country squires to whom she was introduced as niece to the lieutenant in that capacity she sat with becoming easiness of mien for she was as void of the mauvaise honte as any duchess in the land bowed very graciously to the compliments of the gentlemen and though she said little or nothing because she was previously cautioned on that score she more than once gave way to laughter and her mirth happened to be pretty well timed in a word she attracted the applause and admiration of the guests who after she was withdrawn complimented mr hatchway upon the beauty breeding and goodhumour of his kinswoman but what contributed more than any other circumstance to her speedy improvement was some small insight into the primer which she had acquired at a dayschool during the life of her father who was a daylabourer in the country upon this foundation did peregrine build a most elegant superstructure he culled out choice sentences from shakespeare otway and pope and taught her to repeat them with an emphasis and theatrical cadence he then instructed her in the names and epithets of the most celebrated players which he directed her to pronounce occasionally with an air of careless familiarity and perceiving that her voice was naturally clear he enriched it with remnants of opera tunes to be hummed during a pause in conversation which is generally supplied with a circulation of a pinch of snuff by means of this cultivation she became a wonderful proficient in the polite graces of the age she with great facility comprehended the scheme of whist though cribbage was her favourite game with which she had amused herself in her vacant hours from her first entrance into the profession of hopping and brag soon grew familiar to her practice and conception thus prepared she was exposed to the company of her own sex being first of all visited by the parsons daughter who could not avoid showing that civility to mr hatchways niece after she had made her public appearance at church mrs clover who had a great share of penetration could not help entertaining some doubts about this same relation whose name she had never heard the uncle mention during the whole term of her residence at the garrison but as the young lady was treated in that character she would not refuse her acquaintance and after having seen her at the castle actually invited miss hatchway to her house in short she made a progress through almost all the families in the neighbourhood and by dint of her quotations which by the bye were not always judiciously used she passed for a sprightly young lady of uncommon learning and taste peregrine having in this manner initiated her in the beau monde of the country conducted her to london where she was provided with private lodgings and a female attendant and put her immediately under the tuition of his valetdechambre who had orders to instruct her in dancing and the french language he attended her to plays and concerts three or four times a week and when our hero thought her sufficiently accustomed to the sight of great company he squired her in person to a public assembly and danced with her among all the gay ladies of fashion not but that there was still an evident air of rusticity and awkwardness in her demeanour which was interpreted into an agreeable wildness of spirit superior to the forms of common breeding he afterwards found means to make her acquainted with some distinguished patterns of her own sex by whom she was admitted into the most elegant parties and continued to make good her pretensions to gentility with great circumspection but one evening being at cards with a certain lady whom she detected in the very fact of unfair conveyance she taxed her roundly with the fraud and brought upon herself such a torrent of sarcastic reproof as overbore all her maxims of caution and burst open the floodgates of her own natural repartee twanged off with the appellation of b and w which she repeated with great vehemence in an attitude of manual defiance to the terror of her antagonist and the astonishment of all present nay to such an unguarded pitch was she provoked that starting up she snapped her fingers in testimony of disdain and as she quitted the room applied her hand to that part which was the last of her that disappeared inviting the company to kiss it by one of its coarsest denominations peregrine was a little disconcerted at this oversight in her behaviour which by the demon of intelligence was in a moment conveyed to all the private companies in town so that she was absolutely excluded from all polite communication and peregrine for the present disgraced among the modest part of his female acquaintance many of whom not only forbade him their houses on account of the impudent insult he had committed upon their honour as well as understanding in palming a common trull upon them as a young lady of birth and education but also aspersed his family by affirming that she was actually his own cousingerman whom he had precipitately raised from the most abject state of humility and contempt in revenge for this calumny our young gentleman explained the whole mystery of her promotion together with the motives that induced him to bring her into the fashionable world and repeated among his companions the extravagant encomiums which had been bestowed upon her by the most discerning matrons of the age meanwhile the infanta herself being rebuked by her benefactor for this instance of misbehaviour promised faithfully to keep a stricter guard for the future over her conduct and applied herself with great assiduity to the studies in which she was assisted by the swiss who gradually lost the freedom of his heart while she was profiting by his instruction in other words she made a conquest of her preceptor who yielding to the instigations of the flesh chose a proper opportunity to declare his passion which was powerfully recommended by his personal qualifications and his intentions being honourable she listened to his proposals of espousing her in private in consequence of this agreement they made an elopement together and being buckled at the fleet consummated their nuptials in private lodgings by the seven dials from which the husband next morning sent a letter to our hero begging forgiveness for the clandestine step he had taken which he solemnly protested was not owing to any abatement in his inviolable regard for his master whom he should always honour and esteem to his latest breath but entirely to the irresistible charms of the young lady to whom he was now so happy as to be joined in the silken bonds of marriage peregrine though at first offended at his valets presumption was upon second thoughts reconciled to the event by which he was delivered from an encumbrance for by this time he had performed his frolic and began to be tired of his acquisition he reflected upon the former fidelity of the swiss which had been manifested in a long course of service and attachment and thinking it would be cruelly severe to abandon him to poverty and distress for one venial trespass he resolved to pardon what he had done and enable him in some shape to provide for the family which he had entailed upon himself with these sentiments he sent a favourable answer to the delinquent desiring to see him as soon as his passion should permit him to leave the arms of his spouse for an hour or two and hadgi in obedience to this intimation repaired immediately to the lodgings of his master before whom he appeared with a most penitential aspect peregrine though he could scarce help laughing at his rueful length of face reprimanded him sharply for his disrespect and ingratitude in taking that by stealth which he might have had for asking the culprit assured him that next to the vengeance of god his masters displeasure was that which of all evils he dreaded to incur but that love had distracted his brain in such a manner as to banish every other consideration but that of gratifying his desire and he owned that he should not have been able to preserve his fidelity and duty to his own father had they interfered with the interest of his passion he then appealed to his masters own heart for the remission of his guilt alluding to certain circumstances of our heros conduct which evinced the desperate effects of love in short he made such an apology as extorted a smile from his offended judge who not only forgave his transgression but also promised to put him in some fair way of earning a comfortable subsistence the swiss was so much affected with this instance of generosity that he fell upon his knees and kissed his hand praying to heaven with great fervour to make him worthy of such goodness and condescension his scheme he said was to open a coffeehouse and tavern in some creditable part of the town in hopes of being favoured with the custom of a numerous acquaintance he had made among upper servants and reputable tradesmen not doubting that his wife would be an ornament to his bar and a careful manager of his affairs peregrine approved of the plan towards the execution of which he made him and his wife a present of five hundred pounds together with a promise of erecting a weekly club among his friends for the reputation and advantage of the house hadgi was so transported with his good fortune that he ran to pipes who was in the room and having hugged him with great cordiality and made his obeisance to his master hied him home to his bride to communicate his happiness cutting capers and talking to himself all the way chapter lxxxviii he is visited by pallet contracts an intimacy with a newmarket nobleman and is by the knowing ones taken in this affair being settled and our adventurer for the present free of all female connections he returned to his former course of fast living among the bucks of the town and performed innumerable exploits among whores bullies rooks constables and justices of the peace in the midst of these occupations he was one morning visited by his old fellowtraveller pallet whose appearance gave him equal surprise and concern though the weather was severe he was clothed in the thin summer dress which he had worn at paris and was now not only threadbare but in some parts actually patched his stockings by a repetition of that practice known among economists by the term of coaxing hung like puddingbags about his ankles his shirt though new washed was of the saffron hue and in divers places appeared through the crannies of his breeches he had exchanged his own hair for a smokedried tieperiwig which all the flour in his dredgingbox had not been able to whiten his eyes were sunk his jaws lengthened beyond their usual extension and he seemed twenty years older than he looked when he and our hero parted at rotterdam in spite of all these evidences of decay he accosted him with a meagre affectation of content and goodhumour struggled piteously to appear gay and unconcerned professed his joy at seeing him in england excused himself for having delayed so long to come and present his respects alleging that since his return he had been a mere slave to the satisfaction of some persons of quality and taste who had insisted upon his finishing some pieces with the utmost expedition peregrine received him with that compassion and complaisance which was natural to his disposition inquired about the health of mrs pallet and his family and asked if his friend the doctor was in town the painter seemed to have resumed his resentment against that gentleman of whom he spoke in contemptuous terms the doctor said he is so much overshadowed with presumption and selfconceit that his merit has no relief it does not rise there is no keeping in the picture my dear sir all the same as if i were to represent the moon under a cloud there will be nothing but a deep mass of shade with a little tiny speck of light in the middle which would only serve to make as it were the darkness visible you understand me had he taken my advice it might have been better for him but he is bigoted to his own opinion you must know mr pickle upon our return to england i counselled him to compose a little smart clever ode upon my cleopatra as gad shall judge me i thought it would have been of some service in helping him out of obscurity for you know as sir richard observes soon will that die which adds thy fame to mine let me then live joind to a work of thine by the bye there is a most picturesque contrast in these lines of thy and me living and dying and thine and mine ah a prize upon it dick after all was the man ecod he rounded it off but to return to this unhappy young man would you believe it he tossed up his nose at my friendly proposal and gabbled something in greek which is not worth repeating the case was this my dear sir he was out of humour at the neglect of the world he thought the poets of the age were jealous of his genius and strove to crush it accordingly while the rest of mankind wanted taste sufficient to discern it for my own part i profess myself one of these and as the clown in billy shakespeare says of the courtiers oath had i sworn by the doctors genius that the pancakes were naught they might have been for all that very good yet shouldnt i have been forsworn let that be as it will he retired from town in great dudgeon and set up his rest near a hill in derbyshire with two tops resembling parnassus and a well at the bottom which he had christened hypothegreen egad if he stays in that habitation tis my opinion hell soon grow green with the hip indeed hell be glad of an opportunity to return to the fleshpots of egypt and pay his court to the slighted queen cleopatra ha well remembered by this light you shall know my good sir that this same egyptian princess has been courted by so many gallants of taste that as i hope to live i found myself in some sort of dilemma because in parting with her to one i should have disobliged all his rivals now a man would not choose to give offence to his friends at least i lay it down as a maxim to avoid the smallest appearance of ingratitude perhaps i may be in the wrong but every man has his way for this reason i proposed to all the candidates that a lottery or raffle should be set on foot by which every individual would have an equal chance for her good graces and the prize be left to the decision of fortune the scheme was mightily relished and the terms being such a trifle as half a guinea the whole town crowded into my house in order to subscribe but there i was their humble servant gentlemen you must have a little patience till my own particular friends are served among that number i do myself the honour to consider mr pickle here is a copy of the proposals and if the list should be adorned with his name i hope notwithstanding his merited success among the young ladies he will for once be shunned by that little vixen called miss fortune he he he so saying he bowed with a thousand apish congees and presented his paper to peregrine who seeing the number of subscribers was limited to one hundred said he thought him too moderate in his expectations as he did not doubt that his picture would be a cheap purchase at five hundred instead of fifty pounds at which the price was fixed to this unexpected remark pallet answered that among the connoisseurs he would not pretend to appraise his picture but that in valuing his works he was obliged to have an eye to the gothic ignorance of the age in which he lived our adventurer saw at once into the nature of this raffle which was no other than a begging shift to dispose of a paltry piece that he could not otherwise have sold for twenty shillings however far from shocking the poor man in distress by dropping the least hint of his conjecture he desired to be favoured with six chances if the circumstances of his plan would indulge him so far and the painter after some hesitation condescended to comply with his request out of pure friendship and veneration though he observed that in so doing he must exclude some of his most intimate companions having received the money he gave pickle his address desiring he would with his convenience visit the princess who he was sure would display her most engaging attractions in order to captivate his fancy and took his leave extremely well pleased with the success of his application though peregrine was tempted with the curiosity of seeing this portrait which he imagined must contain some analogy to the ridiculous oddity of the painter he would not expose himself to the disagreeable alternative of applauding the performance contrary to the dictates of conscience and common sense or of condemning it to the unspeakable mortification of the miserable author and therefore never dreamt of returning the painters visit nor did he ever hear of the lotterys being drawn about this time he was invited to spend a few weeks at the country seat of a certain nobleman with whom he had contracted an acquaintance in the course of his debauches which we have already described his lordship being remarkable for his skill and success in horseracing his house was continually filled with the connoisseurs and admirers of that sport upon which the whole conversation turned insomuch that peregrine gradually imbibed some knowledge in horseflesh and the diversions of the course for the whole occupation of the day exclusive of eating and drinking consisted in viewing managing and exercising his lordships stud our hero looked upon these amusements with an eye of taste as well as curiosity he contemplated the animal as a beautiful and elegant part of the creation and relished the surprising exertion of its speed with a refined and classical delight in a little time he became personally acquainted with every horse in the stable and interested himself in the reputation of each while he also gratified his appetite for knowledge in observing the methods of preparing their bodies and training them to the race his lordship saw and encouraged his eagerness from which he promised himself some advantage he formed several private matches for his entertainment and flattered his discernment by permitting him to be successful in the first bets he made thus was he artfully decoyed into a spirit of keenness and adventure and disposed to depend upon his own judgment in opposition to that of people who had made horseracing the sole study of their lives he accompanied my lord to newmarket and entering at once into the genius of the place was marked as fair game by all the knowing ones there assembled many of whom found means to take him in in spite of all the cautions and admonitions of his lordship who wanted to reserve him for his own use it is almost impossible for any man let him be never so fearful or phlegmatic to be an unconcerned spectator in this busy scene the demon of play hovers in the air like a pestilential vapour tainting the minds of all present with infallible infection which communicates from one person to another like the circulation of a general panic peregrine was seized with this epidemic distemper to a violent degree and after having lost a few loose hundreds in his progress through the various rookeries of the place entered into partnership with his noble friend in a grand match upon the issue of which he ventured no less than three thousand pounds indeed he would not have risked such a considerable sum had not his own confidence been reinforced by the opinion and concurrence of his lordship who hazarded an equal bet upon the same event these two associates engaged themselves in the penalty of six thousand pounds to run one chaise and four against another three times round the course and our adventurer had the satisfaction of seeing his antagonist distanced in the first and second heat but all of a sudden one of the horses of his machine was knocked up by which accident the victory was ravished almost from his very grasp and he was obliged to endure the damage and the scorn he was deeply affected with this misfortune which he imputed to his own extravagance and temerity but discovered no external signs of affliction because his illustrious partner bore his loss with the most philosophic resignation consoling himself as well as pickle with the hope of making it up on some other occasion nevertheless our young gentleman could not help admiring and even envying his equanimity not knowing that his lordship had managed matters so as to be a gainer by the misfortune which to retrieve peregrine purchased several horses at the recommendation of his friend and instead of returning to london made a tour with him to all the celebrated races in england at which after several vicissitudes of fortune he made shift before the end of the season to treble his loss but his hopes seemed to increase with his illluck in the beginning of winter he came to town fully persuaded that fortune must necessarily change and that next season he should reap the happy fruits of his experience in this confidence he seemed to drown all ideas of prudence and economy his former expense was mere parsimony compared with that which he now incurred he subscribed to the opera and half a dozen concerts at different parts of the town was a benefactor to several hospitals purchased a collection of valuable pictures took a house and furnished it in a most magnificent taste laid in a large stock of french wines and gave extravagant entertainments to his quality friends who in return loaded him with compliments and insisted upon his making use of their interest and goodwill chapter lxxxix he is taken into the protection of a great man sets up for a member of parliament is disappointed in his expectation and finds himself egregiously outwitted among these professed patrons the greatest part of whom peregrine saw through there was one great personage who seemed to support with dignity the sphere in which fortune had placed him his behaviour to pickle was not a series of grinning complaisance in a flat repetition of general expressions of friendship and regard he demeaned himself with a seemingly honest reserve in point of profession his advances to peregrine appeared to be the result of deliberation and experiment he chid the young gentleman for his extravagance with the authority of a parent and the sincerity of a fast friend and having by gradual inquiries made himself acquainted with the state of his private affairs condemned his conduct with an air of candour and concern he represented to him the folly and dangerous consequences of the profligate life in which he had plunged himself counselled him with great warmth to sell off his racehorses which would otherwise insensibly eat him up to retrench all superfluous expense which would only serve to expose him to the ridicule and ingratitude of those who were benefited by it to lay out his money upon secure mortgages at good interest and carry into execution his former design of standing candidate for a borough at the ensuing election for a new parliament in which case this nobleman promised to assist him with his influence and advice assuring him that if he could once procure a seat in the house he might look upon his fortune as already made our adventurer perceiving the wisdom and sanity of this advice for which he made his acknowledgments to his generous monitor protested that he would adhere to it in every particular and immediately set about a reformation he accordingly took cognizance of his most minute affairs and after an exact scrutiny gave his patron to understand that exclusive of his furniture his fortune was reduced to fourteen thousand three hundred and thirty pounds in bank and southsea annuities over and above the garrison and its appendages which he reckoned at sixty pounds a year he therefore desired that as his lordship had been so kind as to favour him with his friendship and advice he would extend his generosity still farther by putting him in a way of making the most advantage of his money my lord said that for his own part he did not choose to meddle in money matters that mr pickle would find abundance of people ready to borrow it upon land security but that he ought to be extremely cautious in a transaction of such consequence promising at the same time to employ his own steward in seeking out a mortgager to whom it might be safely lent this agent was accordingly set at work and for a few days made a fruitless inquiry so that the young gentleman was obliged to have recourse to his own intelligence by which he got notice of several people of reputed credit who offered him mortgages for the whole sum but when he made a report of the particulars to his noble friend his lordship started such doubts and objections relating to each that he was deterred from entering into any engagements with the proposers congratulating himself in the meantime on his good fortune in being favoured with the advice and direction of such a sage counsellor nevertheless he began to be impatient after having unsuccessfully consulted all the money brokers and conveyancers about town and resolved to try the expedient of a public advertisement but he was persuaded by my lord to postpone that experiment until every other method should have failed because it would attract the attention of all the pettifoggers in london who though they might not be able to overreach would infallibly harass and tease him out of all tranquility it was on the back of this conversation that peregrine chancing to meet the steward near his lords house stopped him in the street to give him an account of his bad luck at which the other expressed some concern and rubbing his chin with his hand in a musing posture told pickle there was a thought just come into his head pointing out one way of doing his business effectually the youth upon this intimation begged he would accompany him to the next coffeehouse in which having chosen a private situation this grave manager gave him to understand that a part of my lords estate was mortgaged in consequence of a debt contracted by his grandfather for provision to the younger children of the family and that the equity of redemption would be foreclosed in a few months unless the burden could be discharged my lord said he has always lived in a splendid manner and notwithstanding his ample fortune together with the profits accruing from the posts he enjoys he saves so little money that upon this occasion i know he will be obliged to borrow ten thousand pounds to make up the sum that is requisite to redeem the mortgage now certain i am that when his design comes to be known he will be solicited on all hands by people desirous of lending money upon such undoubted security and tis odds but he has already promised the preference to some particular acquaintance however as i know he has your interest very much at heart i will if you please sound his lordship upon the subject and in a day or two give you notice of my success peregrine ravished with the prospect of settling this affair so much to his satisfaction thanked the steward for his friendly hint and undertaking which he assured him should be acknowledged by a more solid proof of his gratitude provided the business could be brought to bear and next day he was visited by this kind manager with the happy news of his lordships having consented to borrow ten thousand pounds of his stock upon mortgage at the interest of five per cent this information he received as an instance of the singular esteem of his noble patron and the papers being immediately drawn and executed the money was deposited in the hands of the mortgager who in the hearing of the lender laid strong injunctions on his steward to pay the interest punctually at quarterday the best part of our heros fortune being thus happily deposited and the agent gratified with a present of fifty pieces he began to put his retrenching scheme in execution all his servants pipes excepted were discharged his chariot and running horses disposed of his housekeeping broken up and his furniture sold by auction nay the heat of his disposition was as remarkable in this as any other transaction in his life for every step of his saving project was taken with such eagerness and even precipitation that most of his companions thought he was either ruined or mad but he answered all their expostulations with a string of prudent apophthegms such as the shortest follies are the best better to retrench upon conviction than compulsion and divers other wise maxims seemingly the result of experience and philosophic reflection to such a degree of enthusiasm did his present economy prevail that he was actually seized with the desire of amassing and as he every day received proposals from those brokers whom he had employed about the disposal of his cash he at length ventured fifteen hundred pounds upon bottomry being tempted by the excessive premium but it must be observed for the honour of our adventurer that this reformation did not at all interfere with the good qualities of his heart he was still as friendly and benevolent as ever though his liberality was more subject to the restraint of reason and he might have justly pleaded in vindication of his generosity that he retrenched the superfluities in his own way of living in order to preserve the power of assisting his fellowcreatures in distress numberless were the objects to which he extended his charity in private indeed he exerted this virtue in secret not only on account of avoiding the charge of ostentation but also because he was ashamed of being detected in such an awkward unfashionable practice by the censorious observers of this humane generation in this particular he seemed to confound the ideas of virtue and vice for he did good as other people do evil by stealth and was so capricious in point of behaviour that frequently in public he wagged his tongue in satirical animadversions upon that poverty which his hand had in private relieved yet far from shunning the acquaintance or discouraging the solicitation of those who he thought wanted his assistance he was always accessible open and complaisant to them even when the haughtiness of his temper kept his superiors at a distance and often saved a modest man the anguish and confusion of declaring himself by penetrating into his necessity and anticipating his request in a frank offer of his purse and friendship not that he practised this beneficence to all the needy of his acquaintance without distinction there is always a set of idle profligate fellows who having squandered away their own fortunes and conquered all sense of honour and shame maintain themselves by borrowing from those who have not yet finished the same career and want resolution to resist their importunate demands to these he was always inflexible though he could not absolutely detach himself from their company because by dint of effrontery and such of their original connections as they have been able to retain they find admission to all places of fashionable resort several unsuccessful attacks had been made upon his pocket by beggars of this class one of the most artful of them having one day joined him in the mall and made the usual observation on the weather d d all the fogs of london and began a dissertation on the difference of air preferring that of the country in which he was born to any climate under the sun were you ever in gloucestershire said he to peregrine who replying in the negative he thus went on i have got a house there where i should be glad to see you let us go down together during the easter holidays i can promise you good country fare and wholesome exercise for i have everything within myself and as good a pack of foxhounds as any in the three kingdoms i shant pretend to expatiate upon the elegance of the house which to be sure is an old building and these you know are generally cold and not very convenient but curse the house the dirty acres about it are the thing and d d fine parcel they are to be sure if my old grandmother was dead she cant live another season for shes turned of fourscore and quite worn out nay as for that matter i believe i have got a letter in my pocket giving an account of her being despaired of by the doctors let me see no d it i left it at home in the pocket of another coat pickle who from the beginning of this harangue saw its tendency seemed to yield the most serious attention to what he said breaking in upon it every now and then with the interjections hum ha the deuce and several civil questions from which the other conceived happy omens of success till perceiving they had advanced as far as the passage into st jamess the mischievous youth interrupted him all at once saying i see you are for the end of the walk this is my way with these words he took leave of the saunterer who would have delayed his retreat by calling to him aloud that he had not yet described the situation of his castle but peregrine without stopping answered in the same tone another time will do as well and in a moment disappeared leaving the projector very much mortified with his disappointment for his intention was to close the description with a demand of twenty pieces to be repaid out of the first remittance he should receive from his estate it would have been well for our hero had he always acted with the same circumspection but he had his unguarded moments in which he fell a prey to the unsuspecting integrity of his own heart there was a person among the number of his acquaintances whose conversation he particularly relished because it was frank agreeable and fraught with many sensible observations upon the craft and treachery of mankind this gentleman had made shift to discuss a very genteel fortune though it was spent with taste and reputation and now he was reduced to his shifts for the maintenance of his family which consisted of a wife and child not that he was destitute of the necessaries of life being comfortably supplied by the bounty of his friends but this was a provision not at all suited to his inclination and he had endeavoured by divers unsuccessful schemes to retrieve his former independency peregrine happened one evening to be sitting alone in a coffeehouse where he overheard a conversation between this schemer and another gentleman touching an affair that engaged his attention the stranger had been left trustee for fifteen hundred pounds bequeathed to the others daughter by an aunt and was strongly solicited to pay the money to the childs father who assured him he had then an opportunity to lay it out in such a manner as would greatly conduce to the advantage of his family the trustee reminded him of the nature of his charge which made him accountable for the money until the child should have attained the age of eighteen but at the same time gave him to understand that if he could procure such security as would indemnify him from the consequences he would forthwith pay the legacy into his hands to this proposal the father replied that it was not to be supposed he would risk the fortune of his only child upon any idle scheme or precarious issue and therefore he thought it reasonable that he should have the use of it in the meantime and that as to security he was loth to trouble any of his friends about an affair which might be compromised without their interposition observing that he would not look upon his condescension as a favour if obtained by security on which he could borrow the same sum from any usurer in town after much importunity on one side and evasion on the other the moneyed gentleman told him that though he would not surrender the sum deposited in his hands for the use of his daughter he would lend him what he should have occasion for in the meantime and if upon her being of age he should be able to obtain her concurrence the money should be placed to her account provided he could find any person of credit who would join with him in a bond for the assurance of the lender this proviso was an obstruction which the other would not have been able to surmount without great difficulty had not his cause been espoused by our hero who thought it was a pity a man of honour and understanding should suffer in his principal concerns on such a paltry consideration he therefore presuming on his acquaintance interposed in the conversation as a friend who interested himself in the affair and being fully informed of the particulars offered himself as a security for the lender this gentleman being a stranger to peregrine was next day made acquainted with his funds and without further scruple accommodated his friend with one thousand pounds for which he took their bond payable in six months though he protested that the money should never be demanded until the infant should be of age unless some accident should happen which he could not then foresee pickle believed this declaration sincere because he could have no interest in dissembling but what he chiefly depended upon for his own security was the integrity and confidence of the borrower who assured him that happen what would he should be able to stand between him and all danger the nature of his plan being such as would infallibly treble the sum in a very few months in a little time after this transaction writs being issued out for electing a new parliament our adventurer by the advice of his patron went into the country in order to canvass for a borough and lined his pockets with a competent share of banknotes for the occasion but in this project he unfortunately happened to interfere with the interest of a great family in the opposition who for a long series of years had made members for that place and were now so much offended at the intrusion of our young gentleman that they threatened to spend ten thousand pounds in frustrating his design this menace was no other than an incitement to peregrine who confided so much in his own influence and address that he verily believed he should be able to baffle his grace even in his own territories by that victory he hoped to establish his reputation and interest with the minister who through the recommendation of his noble friend countenanced his cause and would have been very well pleased to see one of his great enemies suffer such a disgraceful overthrow which would have moreover in a great measure shaken his credit with his faction our hero intoxicated with the ideas of pride and ambition put all his talents to the test in the execution of this project he spared no expense in treating the electors but finding himself rivalled in this respect by his competitor who was powerfully supported he had recourse to those qualifications in which he thought himself superior he made balls for the ladies visited the matrons of the corporation adapted himself to their various humours with surprising facility drank with those who loved a cherishing cup in private made love to the amorous prayed with the religious gossiped with those who delighted in scandal and with great sagacity contrived agreeable presents to them all this was the most effectual method of engaging such electors as were under the influence of their wives as for the rest he assailed them in their own way setting whole hogsheads of beer and wine abroach for the benefit of comers and into those sordid hearts that liquor would not open he found means to convey himself by the help of a golden key while he thus exerted himself his antagonist was not idle his age and infirmities would not permit him to enter personally into their parties but his stewards and adherents bestirred themselves with great industry and perseverance the market for votes ran so high that pickles ready money was exhausted before the day of election and he was obliged to write to his patron an account of the dilemma to which he was reduced entreating him to take such speedy measures as would enable him to finish the business which he had so happily begun this nobleman communicated the circumstances of the case to the minister and in a day or two our candidate found credit with the receivergeneral of the county who lent him twelve hundred pounds on his personal note payable on demand by means of this new supply he managed matters so successfully that an evident majority of votes was secured in his interest and nothing could have obstructed his election had not the noble peer who set up his competitor in order to avoid the shame and mortification of being foiled in his own borough offered to compromise the affair with his honour by giving up two members in another place provided the opposition should cease in his own corporation this proposal was greedily embraced on the eve of the election peregrine received an intimation from his patron desiring him to quit his pretensions on pain of his and the ministers displeasure and promising that he should be elected for another place no other disappointment in life could have given him such chagrin as he felt at the receipt of this tantalizing order by which the cup of success was snatched from his lip and all the vanity of his ambitious hope humbled in the dust he cursed the whole chain of his court connections inveighed with great animosity against the rascally scheme of politics to which he was sacrificed and in conclusion swore he would not give up the fruits of his own address for the pleasure of any minister upon earth this laudable resolution however was rendered ineffectual by his friend the receivergeneral who was bearer of the message and after having in vain endeavoured to persuade him to submission fairly arrested him upon the spot for the money he had advanced this expedient being performed by virtue of a writ which he had been advised to take out in case the young man should prove refractory the reader who by this time must be pretty well acquainted with the disposition of our hero may easily conceive how he relished this adventure at first all the faculties of his soul were swallowed up in astonishment and indignation and some minutes elapsed before his nerves would obey the impulse of his rage which manifested itself in such an application to the temples of the plaintiff as laid him sprawling on the floor this assault which was committed in a tavern whither he had been purposely decoyed attracted the regard of the bailiff and his followers who to the number of four rushed upon him at once in order to overpower him but his wrath inspired him with such additional strength and agility that he disengaged himself from them in a trice and seizing a poker which was the first weapon that presented itself to his hand exercised it upon their skulls with incredible dexterity and execution the officer himself who had been the first that presumed to lay violent hands upon him felt the first effects of his fury in a blow upon the jaws in consequence of which he lost three of his teeth and fell athwart the body of the receiver with which he formed the figure of a st andrews cross one of his myrmidons seeing the fate of his chief would not venture to attack the victor in front but wheeling to one side made an attempt upon him in flank and was received obliquely by our heros left hand and foot so masterly disposed to the right side of his leg and the left side of his neck that he bolted head foremost into the chimney where his chin was encountered by the grate which in a moment seared him to the bone the rest of the detachment did not think proper to maintain the dispute but evacuating the room with great expedition locked the door on the outside and bellowed aloud to the receivers servants beseeching them to come to the assistance of their master who was in danger of his life meanwhile this gentleman having recollected himself demanded a parley which having with difficulty obtained of our incensed candidate in consequence of the most submissive application he complained grievously of the young gentlemans intemperance and heat of disposition and very calmly represented the danger of his rashness and indiscretion he told him that nothing could be more outrageous or idle than the resistance he had made against the laws of his country because he would find it impracticable to withstand the whole executive power of the country which he could easily raise to apprehend and secure him that over and above the disgrace that would accrue to him from this imprudent conduct he would knock his own interest on the head by disobliging his friends in the administration who were to his knowledge at present very well disposed to do him service that for his own part what he had done was by the express order of his superiors and not out of any desire of distressing him and that far from being his enemy notwithstanding the shocking insult he had sustained he was ready to withdraw the writ provided he would listen to any reasonable terms of accommodation peregrine who was not more prone to anger than open to conviction being appeased by his condescension moved by his arguments and chid by his own reflection for what he had done in the precipitation of his wrath began to give ear to his remonstrances and the bailiffs being ordered to withdraw they entered into a conference the result of which was our adventurers immediate departure for london so that next day his competitor was unanimously chosen because nobody appeared to oppose his election the discontented pickle on his arrival in town went directly to the house of his patron to whom in the anguish of his disappointment he bitterly complained of the treatment he had received by which besides the disgrace of his overthrow he was no less than two thousand pounds out of pocket exclusive of the debt for which he stood engaged to the receiver his lordship who was prepared for this expostulation on his knowledge of the young mans impetuous temper answered all the articles of his charge with great deliberation giving him to understand the motives that induced the minister to quit his interest in that borough and soothing him with assurances that his loss would be amply rewarded by his honour to whom he was next day introduced by this nobleman in the warmest style of recommendation the minister who was a pattern of complaisance received him with the most engaging affability thanked him very kindly for his endeavours to support and strengthen the interest of the administration and faithfully promised to lay hold on the first opportunity to express the sense he had of his zeal and attachment desiring to see him often at his levee that in the multiplicity of business he might not be in danger of forgetting his services and desert chapter xc peregrine commences ministers dependant meets by accident with mrs gauntlet and descends gradually in the condition of life this reception favourable as it was did not please peregrine who had too much discernment to be cajoled with general promises at a time when he thought himself entitled to the most particular assurance he accordingly signified his disgust to his introductor giving him to understand that he had laid his account with being chosen representative of one of those boroughs for which he had been sacrificed his lordship agreed to the reasonableness of his expectation observing however that he could not suppose the minister would enter upon business with him on his first visit and that it would be time enough at his next audience to communicate his demand notwithstanding this remonstrance our hero continued to indulge his suspicion and chagrin and even made a point of it with his patron that his lordship should next day make application on his behalf lest the two seats should be filled up on pretence of his inclinations being unknown thus importuned my lord went to his principal and returned with an answer importing that his honour was extremely sorry that mr pickle had not signified his request before the boroughs in question were promised to two gentlemen whom he could not now disappoint with any regard to his own credit or interest but as several persons who would be chosen were to his certain knowledge very aged and infirm he did not doubt that there would be plenty of vacant seats in a very short time and then the young gentleman might depend upon his friendship peregrine was so much irritated at this intimation that in the first transports of his anger he forgot the respect he owed his friend and in his presence inveighed against the minister as a person devoid of gratitude and candour protesting that if ever an opportunity should offer itself he would spend the whole remains of his fortune in opposing his measures the nobleman having given him time to exhaust the impetuosity of his passion rebuked him very calmly for his disrespectful expressions which were equally injurious and indiscreet assured him that this project of revenge if ever put in execution would redound to his own prejudice and confusion and advised him to cultivate and improve with patience and assiduity the footing he had already obtained in the ministers good graces our hero convinced of the truth though not satisfied with the occasion of his admonitions took his leave in a fit of sullen discontent and began to ruminate upon the shattered posture of his affairs all that now remained of the ample fortune he had inherited was the sum he had deposited in his lordships hands together with fifteen hundred pounds he had ventured on bottomry and the garrison which he had left for the use and accommodation of the lieutenant and on the per contra side of his account he was debtor for the supply he had received from the receivergeneral and the money for which he was bound in behalf of his friend so that he found himself for the first time of his life very much embarrassed in his circumstances for of the first halfyears interest of his ten thousand which was punctually paid he had but fourscore pounds in bank without any prospect of a farther supply till the other term which was at the distance of four long months he seriously reflected upon the uncertainty of human affairs the ship with his fifteen hundred pounds might be lost the gentleman for whom he was security might miscarry in this as well as in his former projects and the minister might one day through policy or displeasure expose him to the mercy of his dependant who was in possession of his notes these suggestions did not at all contribute to the ease of our adventurers mind already ruffled by his disappointment he cursed his own folly and extravagance by which he was reduced to such an uncomfortable situation he compared his own conduct with that of some young gentlemen of his acquaintance who while he was squandering away the best part of his inheritance had improved their fortunes strengthened their interest and increased their reputation he was abandoned by his gaiety and goodhumour his countenance gradually contracted itself into a representation of severity and care he dropped all his amusements and the companions of his pleasure and turned his whole attention to the minister at whose levees he never failed to appear while he thus laboured in the wheel of dependence with all that mortification which a youth of his pride and sensibility may be supposed to feel from such a disagreeable necessity he one day heard himself called by name as he crossed the park and turning perceived the wife of captain gauntlet with another lady he no sooner recognized the kind sophy than he accosted her with his wonted civility and friendship but his former sprightly air was metamorphosed into such austerity or rather dejection of feature that she could scarce believe her own eyes and in her astonishment is it possible said she that the gay mr pickle should be so much altered in such a short space of time he made no other reply to this exclamation but by a languid smile and asked how long she had been in town observing that he would have paid his compliments to her at her own lodgings had he been favoured with the least intimation of her arrival after having thanked him for his politeness she told him it was not owing to any abatement of her friendship and esteem for him that she had omitted to give him that notice but his abrupt departure from windsor and the manner in which he quitted mr gauntlet had given her just grounds to believe that they had incurred his displeasure which suspicion was reinforced by his long silence and neglect from that period to the present time she observed it was still farther confirmed by his forbearing to inquire for emilia and her brother judge then said she if i had any reason to believe that you would be pleased to hear that i was in town however i will not detain you at present because you seem to be engaged about some particular business but if you will favour me with your company at breakfast tomorrow i shall be much pleased and honoured to boot by the visit so saying she gave him a direction to her lodgings and he took his leave with a faithful promise of seeing her at the appointed time he was very much affected with this advance of sophy which he considered as an instance of her uncommon sweetness of temper he felt strange longings of returning friendship towards godfrey and the remembrance of emilia melted his heart already softened with grief and mortification next day he did not neglect his engagement and had the pleasure of enjoying a long conversation with this sensible young lady who gave him to understand that her husband was with his regiment and presented to him a fine boy the firstfruits of their love whom they had christened by the name of peregrine in memory of the friendship which had subsisted between godfrey and our youth this proof of their regard notwithstanding the interruption in their correspondence made a deep impression upon the mind of our adventurer who having made the warmest acknowledgments for this undeserved mark of respect took the child in his arms and almost devoured him with kisses protesting before god that he should always consider him with the tenderness of a parent this was the highest compliment he could pay to the gentle sophy who again kindly chid him for his disdainful and precipitate retreat immediately after her marriage and expressed an earnest desire of seeing him and the captain reconciled he assured her nothing could give him greater satisfaction than such an event to which he would contribute all that lay in his power though he could not help looking upon himself as injured by captain gauntlets behaviour which denoted a suspicion of his honour as well as contempt for his understanding the lady undertook for the concession of her husband who she told him had been extremely sorry for his own heat after mr pickles departure and would have followed him to the garrison in order to solicit his forgiveness had he not been restrained by certain punctilios occasioned by some acrimonious expressions that dropped from peregrine at the inn after having cleared up this misunderstanding she proceeded to give an account of emilia whose behaviour at that juncture plainly indicated a continuance of affection for her first lover and desired that he would give her full powers to bring that matter also to an accommodation for i am not more certain of my own existence said she than that you are still in possession of my sisters heart at this declaration the tear started in his eye but he shook his head and declined her good offices wishing that the young lady might be much more happy than ever he should be able to make her mrs gauntlet confounded at these expressions and moved by the desponding manner in which they were delivered begged to know if any new obstacle was raised by some late change in his sentiments or situation and he in order to avoid a painful explanation told her that he had long despaired of being able to vanquish emilias resentment and for that reason quitted the pursuit which he would never renew howsoever his heart might suffer by that resolution though he took heaven to witness that his love esteem and admiration of her were not in the least impaired but the true motive of his laying aside his design was the consciousness of his decayed fortune which by adding to the sensibility of his pride increased the horror of another repulse she expressed her concern for this determination both on his own account and in behalf of emilia whose happiness in her opinion depended upon his constancy and affection and she would have questioned him more minutely about the state of his affairs had not he discouraged the inquiry by seeking to introduce another subject of conversation after mutual protestations of friendship and regard he promised to visit her often during her residence in town and took his leave in a strange perplexity of mind occasioned by the images of love intruding upon the remonstrances of carking care he had some time ago forsaken those extravagant companions with whom he had rioted in the heyday of his fortune and begun to consort with a graver and more sober species of acquaintance but he now found himself disabled from cultivating the society of these also who were men of ample estates and liberal dispositions in consequence of which their parties were too expensive for the consumptive state of his finances so that he was obliged to descend to another degree and mingle with a set of old bachelors and younger brothers who subsisted on slender annuities or what is called a bare competency in the public funds this association was composed of secondhand politicians and minor critics who in the forenoon saunter in the mall or lounge at shows of pictures appear in the drawingroom once or twice a week dine at an ordinary decide disputes in a coffeehouse with an air of superior intelligence frequent the pit of the playhouse and once in a month spend an evening with some noted actor whose remarkable sayings they repeat for the entertainment of their ordinary friends after all he found something comfortable enough in the company of these gentlemen who never interested his passions to any violence of transport nor teased him with impertinent curiosity about his private affairs for though many of them had maintained a very long close and friendly correspondence with each other they never dreamt of inquiring into particular concerns and if one of the two who were most intimately connected had been asked how the other made a shift to live he would have answered with great truth really that is more than i know notwithstanding this phlegmatic indifference which is of the true english production they were all inoffensive goodnatured people who loved a joke and a song delighted in telling a merry story and prided themselves in the art of catering especially in the articles of fish venison and wild fowl our young gentleman was not received among them on the footing of a common member who makes interest for his admission he was courted as a person of superior genius and importance and his compliance looked upon as an honour to their society this their idea of his preeminence was supported by his conversation which while it was more liberal and learned than that to which they had been accustomed was tinctured with an assuming air so agreeably diffused that instead of producing aversion it commanded respect they not only appealed to him in all doubts relating to foreign parts to which one and all of them were strangers but also consulted his knowledge in history and divinity which were frequently the topics of their debates and in poetry of all kinds he decided with such magisterial authority as even weighed against the opinions of the players themselves the variety of characters he had seen and observed and the high spheres of life in which he had so lately moved furnished him with a thousand entertaining anecdotes when he became a little familiarized to his disappointments so that his natural vivacity began to revive he flashed among them in such a number of bright sallies as struck them with admiration and constituted himself a classic in wit insomuch that they began to retail his remnants and even invited some particular friends to come and hear him hold forth one of the players who had for many years strutted about the taverns in the neighbourhood of covent garden as the grand turk of wit and humour began to find his admirers melt away and a certain petulant physician who had shone at almost all the port clubs in that end of the town was actually obliged to import his talents into the city where he was now happily taken root nor was this success to be wondered at if we consider that over and above his natural genius and education our adventurer still had the opportunity of knowing everything which happened among the great by means of his friend cadwallader with whom he still maintained his former intimacy though it was now chequered with many occasional tiffs owing to the sarcastic remonstrances of the misanthrope who disapproved of those schemes which miscarried with peregrine and now took unseasonable methods of valuing himself upon his own foresight nay he was between whiles like a raven croaking presages of more illluck from the deceit of the minister the dissimulation of his patron the folly of the projector for whom he was bound the uncertainty of the seas and the villainy of those with whom he had entrusted his cash for crabtree saw and considered everything through a perspective of spleen that always reflected the worst side of human nature for these reasons our young gentleman began to be disgusted at certain intervals with the character of this old man whom he now thought a morose cynic not so much incensed against the follies and vices of mankind as delighted with the distress of his fellowcreatures thus he put the most unfavourable construction on the principles of his friend because he found himself justly fallen under the lash of his animadversion thus selfaccusation very often dissolves the closest friendship a man conscious of his own indiscretion is implacably offended at the rectitude of his companions conduct which he considers as an insult upon his failings never to be forgiven even though he has not tasted the bitterness of reproof which no sinner can commodiously digest the friendship therefore subsisting between crabtree and pickle had of late suffered several symptomatic shocks that seemed to prognosticate a total dissolution a great deal of smart dialogue had passed in their private conversations and the senior began to repent of having placed his confidence in such an imprudent headstrong ungovernable youth it was in such paroxysms of displeasure that he prophesied misfortune to peregrine and even told him one morning that he had dreamed of the shipwreck of the two east indiamen on board of which he had hazarded his money but this was no other than a false vision for in a few weeks one of them arrived at her moorings in the river and he received a thousand in lieu of eight hundred pounds which he had lent upon bond to one of the mates at the same time he was informed that the other ship in which he was concerned had in all probability lost her passage for the season by being unable to weather the cape he was not at all concerned at that piece of news knowing that the longer he should he out of his money he would have the more interest to receive and finding his present difficulties removed by this supply his heart began to dilate and his countenance to resume its former alacrity this state of exultation however was soon interrupted by a small accident which he could not foresee he was visited one morning by the person who had lent his friend a thousand pounds on his security and given to understand that the borrower had absconded in consequence of a disappointment by which he had lost the whole sum and all hopes of retrieving it so that our hero was now liable for the debt which he besought him to discharge according to the bond that he the lender might not suffer by his humanity it may be easily conceived that peregrine did not receive this intelligence in cold blood he cursed his own imprudence in contracting such engagements with an adventurer whom he did not sufficiently know he exclaimed against the treachery of the projector and having for some time indulged his resentment in threats and imprecations inquired into the nature of the scheme which had miscarried the lender who had informed himself of the whole affair gratified his curiosity in this particular by telling him that the fugitive had been cajoled by a certain knight of the post who undertook to manage the thousand pounds in such a manner as would in a very little time make him perfectly independent and thus he delineated the plan one half of the sum said he shall be laid out in jewels which i will pawn to certain persons of credit and fortune who lend money upon such pledges at an exorbitant interest the other shall be kept for relieving them so that they may be again deposited with a second set of those honourable usurers and when they shall have been circulated in this manner through a variety of hands we will extort money from each of the pawnbrokers by threatening them with a public prosecution for exacting illegal interest and i know that they will bleed freely rather than be exposed to the infamy attending such an accusation the scheme was feasible and though not very honourable made such an impression upon the needy borrower that he assented to the proposals and by our heros credit the money was raised the jewels were accordingly purchased pawned relieved and repledged by the agent who undertook to manage the whole affair and so judiciously was the project executed that he could have easily proved each lender guilty of the charge having thus far successfully transacted the business this faithful agent visited them severally on his own account to give them intimation that his employer intended to sue them on the statute of usury upon which every one for himself bribed the informer to withdraw his evidence by which alone he could be convicted and having received these gratifications he had thought proper to retreat into france with the whole booty including the original thousand that put them in motion in consequence of this decampment the borrower had withdrawn himself so that the lender was obliged to have recourse to his security this was a very mortifying account to our young gentleman who in vain reminded the narrator of his promise importing that he would not demand the money until he should be called to an account by his ward and observed that long before that period the fugitive might appear and discharge the debt but the other was deaf to these remonstrances alleging that his promise was provisional on the supposition that the borrower would deal candidly and fairly that he had forfeited all title to his friendship and trust by the scandalous scheme in which he had embarked and that his treacherous flight from his security was no proof of his honesty and intended return but on the contrary a warning by which he the lender was taught to take care of himself he therefore insisted upon his being indemnified immediately on pain of letting the law take its course and peregrine was actually obliged to part with the whole sum he had so lately received but this payment was not made without extreme reluctance indignation and denunciation of eternal war against the absconder and the rigid creditor betwixt whom he suspected some collusion chapter xci cadwallader acts the part of a comforter to his friend and in his turn is consoled by peregrine who begins to find himself a most egregious dupe this new misfortune which he justly charged to the account of his own folly recalled his chagrin and though he endeavoured with all his might to conceal the affair from the knowledge of cadwallader that prying observer perceived his countenance overcast the projectors sudden disappearance alarming his suspicion he managed his inquiries with so much art that in a few days he made himself acquainted with every particular of the transaction and resolved to gratify his spleen at the expense of the impatient dupe with this view he took an opportunity to accost him with a very serious air saying a friend of his had immediate occasion for a thousand pounds and as peregrine had the exact sum lying by him he would take it as a great favour if he would part with it for a few months on undoubted security had pickle known the true motive of this demand he would in all likelihood have made a very disagreeable answer but crabtree had wrappped himself up so securely in the dissimulation of his features that the youth could not possibly penetrate into his intention and in the most galling suspense replied that the money was otherwise engaged the misanthrope not contented with this irritation assumed the prerogative of a friend and questioned him so minutely about the disposal of the cash that after numberless evasions which cost him a world of torture to invent he could contain his vexation no longer but exclaimed in a rage d your impertinence tis gone to the devil and thats enough thereafter as it may be said this tormentor with a most provoking indifference of aspect i should be glad to know upon what footing for i suppose you have some expectation of advantage from that quarter sdeath sir cried the impatient youth if i had any expectation from hell i would make interest with you for i believe from my soul you are one of its most favoured ministers upon earth with these words he flung out of the room leaving cadwallader very well satisfied with the chastisement he had bestowed peregrine having cooled himself with a solitary walk in the park during which the violence of his choler gradually evaporated and his reflection was called to a serious deliberation upon the posture of his affairs he resolved to redouble his diligence and importunity with his patron and the minister in order to obtain some sinecure which would indemnify him for the damage he had sustained on their account he accordingly went to his lordship and signified his demand after having told him that he had suffered several fresh losses which rendered an immediate provision of that sort necessary to his credit and subsistence his noble friend commended him for the regard he manifested for his own interest which he considered as a proof of his being at last detached from the careless inadvertency of youth he approved of his demand which he assured him should be faithfully transmitted to the minister and backed with all his influence and encouraged his hope by observing that some profitable places were at that time vacant and so far as he knew unengaged this conversation helped to restore the tranquility of pickles breast though he still harboured resentment against cadwallader on account of the last insult and on the instant he formed a plan of revenge he knew the misanthropes remittances from his estate in the country had been of late very scanty in consequence of repairs and bankruptcies among his tenants so that in spite of all his frugality he had been but barely able to maintain his credit and even that was engaged on the strength of his running rent being therefore intimately acquainted with the particulars of his fortune he wrote a letter to crabtree subscribed with the name of his principal farmers wife importing that her husband being lately dead and the greatest part of her cattle destroyed by the infectious distemper she found herself utterly incapable of paying the rent which was due or even of keeping the farm unless he would out of his great goodness be pleased to give her some assistance and allow her to sit free for a twelvemonth to come this intimation he found means to convey by post from a market town adjoining to the farm directed in the usual style to the cynic who seeing it stamped with the known marks could not possibly suspect any imposition hackneyed as he was in the ways of life and steeled with his boasted stoicism this epistle threw him into such an agony of vexation that a double proportion of souring was visible in his aspect when he was visited by the author who having observed and followed the postman at a proper distance introduced a conversation upon his own disappointments in which among other circumstances of his own illluck he told him that his patrons steward had desired to be excused from paying the last quarter of his interest precisely at the appointed term for which reason he should be utterly void of cash and therefore requested that crabtree would accommodate him with an hundred pieces of his next remittance from the country this demand galled and perplexed the old man to such a degree that the muscles of his face assumed a contraction peculiarly virulent and exhibited the character of diogenes with a most lively expression he knew that a confession of his true situation would furnish pickle with an opportunity to make reprisals upon him with intolerable triumph and that by a downright refusal to supply his wants he would for ever forfeit his friendship and esteem and might provoke him to take ample vengeance for his sordid behaviour by exposing him in his native colours to the resentment of those whom he had so long deceived these considerations kept him some time in a most rancorous state of suspense which peregrine affected to misinterpret by bidding him freely declare his suspicion if he did not think it safe to comply with his request and he would make shift elsewhere this seeming misconstruction increased the torture of the misanthrope who with the utmost irritation of feature oons cried he what villainy have you noted in my conduct that you treat me like a rascally usurer peregrine very gravely replied that the question needed no answer for said he had i considered you as a usurer i would have come with a security under my arm but all evasion apart will you stead me will you pleasure me shall i have the money would it were in your belly with a barrel of gunpowder exclaimed the enraged cynic since i must be excruciated read that plaguy paper sblood why didnt nature clap a pair of long ears and a tail upon me that i might be a real ass and champ thistles on some common independent of my fellowcreatures would i were a worm that i might creep into the earth and thatch my habitation with a single straw or rather a wasp or a viper that i might make the rascally world feel my resentment but why do i talk of rascality folly folly is the scourge of life give me a scoundrel so he be a sensible one and i will put him in my heart of hearts but a fool is more mischievous than famine pestilence and war the idiotical hag that writes or causes to be writ this same letter has ruined her family and broke her husbands heart by ignorance and mismanagement and she imputes her calamity to providence with a vengeance and so i am defrauded of three hundred pounds the greatest part of which i owe to tradesmen whom i have promised to pay this very quarter pox upon her i would she were a horned beast that the distemper might lay hold on her the beldame has the impudence too after she has brought me into this dilemma to solicit my assistance to stock the farm anew before god i have a good mind to send her a halter and perhaps i might purchase another for myself but that i would not furnish food for laughter to knaves and coxcombs peregrine having perused the billet and listened to this ejaculation replied with great composure that he was ashamed to see a man of his years and pretensions to philosophy so ruffled by a trifle what signify all the boasted hardships you have overcome said he and the shrewd observations you pretend to have made on human nature where is that stoical indifference you affirm you have attained if such a paltry disappointment can disturb you in this manner what is the loss of three hundred pounds compared with the misfortunes which i myself have undergone within these two years yet you will take upon you to act the censor and inveigh against the impatience and impetuosity of youth as if you yourself had gained an absolute conquest over all the passions of the heart you were so kind as to insult me another day in my affliction by reproaching me with indiscretion and misconduct suppose i were now to retort the imputation and ask how a man of your profound sagacity could leave your fortune at the discretion of ignorant peasants how could you be so blind as not to foresee the necessity of repairs together with the danger of bankruptcy murrain or thin crop why did you not convert your land into ready money and as you have no connections in life purchase an annuity on which you might have lived at your ease without any fear of the consequence cant you from the whole budget of your philosophy cull one apophthegm to console you for this trivial mischance rot your rapidity said the cynic halfchoked with gall if the cancer or the pox were in your throat i should not be thus tormented with your tongue and yet a magpie shall speak infinitely more to the purpose dont you know mr wiseacre that my case does not fall within the province of philosophy had i been curtailed of all my members racked by the gout and gravel deprived of liberty robbed of an only child or visited with the death of a dear friend like you philosophy might have contributed to my consolation but will philosophy pay my debts or free me from the burden of obligation to a set of fellows whom i despise speakpronouncedemonstrate or may heaven close your mouth for ever these are the comfortable fruits of your misanthropy answered the youth your laudable scheme of detaching yourself from the bonds of society and of moving in a superior sphere of your own had you not been so peculiarly sage and intent upon laughing at mankind you could never have been disconcerted by such a pitiful inconvenience any friend would have accommodated you with the sum in question but now the world may retort the laugh for you stand upon such an agreeable footing with your acquaintance that nothing could please them better than an account of your having given disappointment the slip by the help of a noose properly applied this i mention by way of hint upon which i would have you chew the cud of reflection and should it come to that issue i will use my whole interest with the coroner to bring in his verdict lunacy that your carcase may have christian burial so saying he withdrew very well satisfied with the revenge he had taken which operated so violently upon crabtree that if it had not been for the sole consideration mentioned above he would in all probability have had recourse to the remedy proposed but his unwillingness to oblige and entertain his fellowcreatures hindered him from practising that expedient till by course of post he was happily undeceived with regard to the situation of his affairs and that information had such an effect upon him that he not only forgave our hero for the stratagem which he immediately ascribed to the right author but also made him a tender of his purse so that matters for the present were brought to an amicable accommodation meanwhile peregrine never slacked in his attendance upon the great he never omitted to appear upon every levee day employed his industry and penetration in getting intelligence of posts that were unfilled and every day recommended himself to the good offices of his patron who seemed to espouse his interest with great cordiality nevertheless he was always too late in his application or the place he demanded chanced to be out of the ministers gift these intimations though communicated in the most warm professions of friendship and regard gave great umbrage to the young gentleman who considered them as the evasions of an insincere courtier and loudly complained of them as such to his lordship signifying at the same time an intention to sell his mortgage for ready money which he would expend to the last farthing in thwarting his honour in the very first election he should patronize his lordship never wanted a proper exhortation upon these occasions he did not now endeavour to pacify him with assurances of the ministers favour because he perceived that these medicines had by repeated use lost their effect upon our adventurer whose menaces he now combated by representing that the ministers purse was heavier than that of mr pickle that therefore should he make a point of opposing his interest the youth must infallibly fail in the contest in which case he would find himself utterly destitute of the means of subsistence and consequently precluded from all hope of provision this was an observation the truth of which our young gentleman could not pretend to doubt though it did not at all tend to the vindication of his honours conduct indeed pickle began to suspect the sincerity of his own patron who in his opinion had trifled with his impatience and even eluded by sorry excuses his desire of having another private audience of the first mover his lordship also began to be less accessible than usual and peregrine had been obliged to dun the steward with repeated demands before he could finger the last quarter of his interest alarmed by these considerations he went and consulted the nobleman whom he had obliged in the affair of his son and had the mortification to hear but a very indifferent character of the person in whom he had so long confided this new adviser who though a courtier was a rival of the other gave our adventurer to understand that he had been leaning upon a broken reed that his professed patron was a man of shattered fortune and decayed interest which extended no farther than a smile and a whisper that for his own part he should have been proud of an opportunity to use his influence with the minister in behalf of mr pickle but since you have put yourself under the protection of another peer said he whose connections interfere with mine i cannot now espouse your cause without incurring the imputation of seducing that noblemans adherents a charge which of all others i would most carefully avoid however i shall always be ready to assist you with my private advice as a specimen of which i now counsel you to insist upon having another interview with sir steady steerwell himself that you may in person explain your pretensions without any risk of being misrepresented and endeavour if possible to draw him into some particular promise from which he cannot retract with any regard to his reputation for general profession is a necessary armour worn by all ministers in their own defence against the importunity of those whom they will not befriend and would not disoblige this advice was so conformable to his own sentiments that our adventurer seized the first opportunity to demand a hearing and plainly told his patron that if he could not be indulged with that favour he should look upon his lordships influence to be very small and his own hopes to be altogether desperate in which case he was resolved to dispose of the mortgage purchase an annuity and live independent chapter xcii he is indulged with a second audience by the minister of whose sincerity he is convinced his pride and ambition revive and again are mortified if the young gentlemans money had been in other hands perhaps the peer would have been at very little pains either in gratifying his demand or opposing his revenge but he knew that the sale of the mortgage could not be effected without an inquiry to which he did not wish to be exposed he therefore employed all his interest in procuring the solicited audience this being granted peregrine with great warmth and elocution expatiated upon the injury his fortune had suffered in the affair of the borough for which he had stood candidate he took notice of the disappointment he had sustained in the other election reminded him of the promises with which he had been amused and in conclusion desired to know what he had to expect from his favour the minister having patiently heard him to an end replied with a most gracious aspect that he was very well informed of his merit and attachment and very much disposed to convince him of the regard which he paid to both that till of late he did not know the nature of his expectations neither had he the power of creating posts for those whom he was inclined to serve but if mr pickle would chalk out any feasible method by which he could manifest his sentiments of friendship he should not be backward in executing the plan peregrine laying hold on this declaration mentioned several places which he knew to be vacant but the old evasion was still used one of them was not in his department of business another had been promised to the third son of a certain earl before the death of the last possessor and a third was encumbered with a pension that ate up a good half of the appointments in short such obstructions were started to all his proposals as he could not possibly surmount though he plainly perceived they were no other than specious pretexts to cover the mortifying side of a refusal exasperated therefore at this lack of sincerity and gratitude i can easily foresee said he that such difficulties will never be wanting when i have anything to ask and for that reason will save myself the trouble of any further application so saying he withdrew in a very abrupt manner breathing defiance and revenge but his patron who did not think proper to drive him to extremities found means to persuade his honour to do something for the pacification of the young mans choler and that same evening our adventurer received a message from his lordship desiring to see him immediately in consequence of this intimation pickle went to his house and appeared before him with a very cloudy aspect which signified to whom it might concern that his temper was at present too much galled to endure reproof and therefore the sagacious peer forbore taking him to task for his behaviour during the audience he had obtained but gave him to understand that the minister in consideration of his services had sent him a banknote of three hundred pounds with a promise of the like sum yearly until he could be otherwise provided for this declaration in some measure appeased the youth who condescended to accept the present and next levee day made his acknowledgment to the donor who favoured him with a smile of infinite complacency which entirely dissipated all the remains of his resentment for as he could not possibly divine the true cause of his being temporized with he looked upon this condescension as an undoubted proof of sir steadys sincerity and firmly believed that he would settle him in some place with the first opportunity rather than continue to pay this pension out of his own pocket in all probability his prediction would have been verified had not an unforeseen accident in a moment overwhelmed the barque of his interest at court meanwhile this short gleam of good fortune recalled the ideas of pride and ambition which he had formerly cherished his countenance was again lifted up his goodhumour retrieved and his mien reexalted indeed he began to be considered as a rising man by his fellowdependents who saw the particular notice with which he was favoured at the public levee and some of them for that reason were at pains to court his good graces he no longer shunned his former intimates with whom a good part of his fortune had been spent but made up to them in all places of public resort with the same ease and familiarity as he had been used to express and even reembarked in some of their excesses upon the strength of his sanguine expectation cadwallader and he renewed their consultations in the court of ridicule and divers exploits were achieved to the confusion of those who had sailed into the north of their displeasure but these enjoyments were soon interrupted by a misfortune equally fatal and unexpected his noble patron was seized with an apoplectic fit from which he was recovered by the physicians that they might despatch him according to rule and in two months after they were called he went the way of all flesh peregrine was very much afflicted at this event not only on account of his friendship for the deceased to whom he thought himself under many and great obligations but also because he feared that his own interest would suffer a severe shock by the removal of this nobleman whom he considered as its chief support he put himself therefore in mourning out of regard to the memory of his departed friend and exhibited genuine marks of sorrow and concern though he had in reality more cause to grieve than he as yet imagined when quarterday came about he applied to the steward of his lordships heir for the interest of his money as usual and the reader will readily own he had some reason to be surprised when he was told he had no claim either to principal or interest true it is the manager talked very civilly as well as sensibly on the subject your appearance sir said he to pickle screens you from all suspicion of an intended fraud but the mortgage upon those lands you mention was granted to another person many years before you pretend to have lent that sum and i have this very morning paid one quarters interest as appears from this receipt which you may peruse for your satisfaction peregrine was so thunderstruck at this information which stripped him of his all that he could not utter one word a circumstance that did no great honour to his character in the opinion of the steward who in good earnest began to entertain some doubts of his integrity for among the papers of the deceased which he had examined there was no writing memorandum or receipt relating to this encumbrance after a long pause of stupefaction peregrine recollected himself so far as to observe that either he was egregiously mistaken or the predecessor of his lord the greatest villain upon earth but mr whatdycallum said he you must give me leave to tell you that your bare assertion in this affair will by no means induce me to put up quietly with the loss of ten thousand pounds having thus expressed himself he retired from the house so discontented at this demur that he scarce knew whether he moved upon his head or heels and the park chancing to be in his way he sauntered about giving vent to a soliloquy in praise of his departed friend the burden of which was a string of incoherent curses imprecated upon himself till his transports by degrees giving way to his reflection he deliberated seriously and sorrowfully upon his misfortune and resolved to consult lawyers without loss of time but first of all he proposed to make personal application to the heir who by a candid representation of the case might be inclined to do him justice in consequence of this determination he next morning put his writings in his pocket and went in a chair to the house of the young nobleman to whom being admitted by virtue of his appearance and a small gratification to the porter he explained the whole affair corroborating his assertions with the papers which he produced and describing the disgrace that would be entailed upon the memory of the deceased should he be obliged to seek redress in a public court of justice the executor who was a person of good breeding condoled him upon his loss with great goodnature though he did not seem much surprised at his account of the matter but wished that since the fraud must have been committed the damage had fallen upon the first mortgager who he said was a thievish usurer grown rich by the distresses of his fellowcreatures in answer to our heros remonstrances he observed that he did not look upon himself as obliged to pay the least regard to the character of his predecessor who had used him with great barbarity and injustice not only in excluding him from his countenance and assistance but also in prejudicing his inheritance as much as lay in his power so that it could not be reasonably expected that he would pay ten thousand pounds of his debt for which he had received no value peregrine in spite of his chagrin could not help owning within himself that there was a good deal of reason in this refusal after having given loose to his indignation in the most violent invectives against the defunct he took his leave of the complaisant heir and had immediate recourse to the advice of counsel who assured him that he had an excellent plea and was accordingly retained in the cause all these measures were taken in the first vigour of his exertion during which his spirits were so fluttered with the diversity of passions produced by his mischance that he mistook for equanimity that which was no other than intoxication and two whole days elapsed before he attained a due sense of his misfortune then indeed he underwent a woeful selfexamination every circumstance of the inquiry added fresh pangs to his reflection and the result of the whole was a discovery that his fortune was totally consumed and himself reduced to a state of the most deplorable dependence this suggestion alone might in the anguish of his despondency have driven him to some desperate course had it not been in some measure qualified by the confidence of his lawyers and the assurance of the minister which slender as the world hath generally found them were the only bulwarks between misery and him the mind is naturally pliable and provided it has the least hope to lean upon adapts itself wonderfully to the emergencies of fortune especially when the imagination is gay and luxuriant this was the case with our adventurer instead of indulging the melancholy ideas which his loss inspired he had recourse to the flattering delusions of hope soothing himself with unsubstantial plans of future greatness and endeavouring to cover what was past with the veil of oblivion after some hesitation he resolved to make crabtree acquainted with his misfortune that once for all he might pass the ordeal of his satire without subjecting himself to a long series of sarcastic hints and doubtful allusions which he could not endure he accordingly took the first opportunity of telling him that he was absolutely ruined by the perfidy of his patron and desired that he would not aggravate his affliction by those cynical remarks which were peculiar to men of his misanthropical disposition cadwallader listened to this declaration with internal surprise which however produced no alteration in his countenance and after some pause observed that our hero had no reason to look for any new observation from him upon this event which he had long foreseen and daily expected and exhorted him with an ironical sneer to console himself with the promise of the minister who would doubtless discharge the debts of his deceased bosom friend chapter xciii peregrine commits himself to the public and is admitted member of a college of authors the bitterness of this explanation being passed our young gentleman began to revolve within himself schemes for making up the deficiencies of his yearly income which was now so grievously reduced and determined to profit in some shape or other by those talents which he owed to nature and education he had in his affluence heard of several authors who without any pretensions to genius or human literature earned a very genteel subsistence by undertaking work for booksellers in which reputation was not at all concerned one for example professed all manner of translation at so much per sheet and actually kept five or six amanuenses continually employed like so many clerks in a countinghouse by which means he was enabled to live at his ease and enjoy his friend and his bottle ambitious of no other character than that of an honest man and a good neighbour another projected a variety of plans for new dictionaries which were executed under his eye by daylabourers and the province of a third was history and voyages collected or abridged by understrappers of the same class mr pickle in his comparisons paid such deference to his own capacity as banished all doubts of his being able to excel any of those undertakers in their different branches of profession if ever he should be driven to that experiment but his ambition prompted him to make his interest and glory coincide by attempting some performance which should do him honour with the public and at the same time establish his importance among the copypurchasers in town with this view he worshipped the muse and conscious of the little regard which is in this age paid to every species of poetic composition in which neither satire nor obscenity occurs he produced an imitation of juvenal and lashed some conspicuous characters with equal truth spirit and severity though his name did not appear in the titlepage of this production he managed matters so that the work was universally imputed to the true author who was not altogether disappointed in his expectations of success for the impression was immediately sold off and the piece became the subject of conversation in all assemblies of taste this happy exordium not only attracted the addresses of the booksellers who made interest for his acquaintance but also roused the notice of a society of authors who styled themselves the college from which he was honoured with a deputation offering to enroll him a member by unanimous consent the person employed for this purpose being a bard who had formerly tasted of our heros bounty used all his eloquence to persuade him to comply with the advances of their fraternity which he described in such a manner as inflamed the curiosity of pickle who dismissed the ambassador with an acknowledgment of the great honour they conferred upon him and a faithful promise of endeavouring to merit the continuance of their approbation he was afterwards by the same minister instructed in the ceremonies of the college and in consequence of his information composed an ode to be publicly recited on the evening of his introduction he understood that this constitution was no other than a body of authors incorporated by mutual consent for their joint advantage and satisfaction opposed to another assembly of the same kind their avowed enemies and detractors no wonder then that they sought to strengthen themselves with such a valuable acquisition as our hero was likely to prove the college consisted of authors only and these of all degrees in point of reputation from the fabricator of a song set to music and sung at marylebone to the dramatic bard who had appeared in buskins upon the stage nay one of the members had actually finished eight books of an epic poem for the publication of which he was at that time soliciting subscriptions it cannot be supposed that such a congregation of the sons of apollo would sit a whole evening with order and decorum unless they were under the check of some established authority and this inconvenience having been foreseen they had elected a president vested with full power to silence any member or members that should attempt to disturb the harmony and subordination of the whole the sage who at this time possessed the chair was a person in years whose countenance was a lively portraiture of that rancorous discontent which follows repeated damnation he had been extremely unfortunate in his theatrical productions and was to use the words of a profane wag who assisted at the condemnation of his last play by this time d d beyond redemption nevertheless he still tarried about the skirts of parnassus translating some of the classics and writing miscellanies and by dint of an invincible assurance supercilious insolence the most undaunted virulence of tongue and some knowledge of life he made shift to acquire and maintain the character of a man of learning and wit in the opinion of people who had neither that is thirtynine in forty of those with whom he associated himself he was even looked upon in this light by some few of the college though the major part of those who favoured his election were such as dreaded his malice respected his experience and seniority or hated his competitor who was the epic poet the chief end of this society as i have already hinted was to assist and support each other in their productions which they mutually recommended to sale with all their art and influence not only in private conversation but also in occasional epigrams criticisms and advertisements inserted in the public papers this science which is known by the vulgar appellation of puffing they carried to such a pitch of finesse that an author very often wrote an abusive answer to his own performance in order to inflame the curiosity of the town by which it had been overlooked notwithstanding this general unanimity in the college a private animosity had long subsisted between the two rivals i have mentioned on account of precedence to which both laid claim though by a majority of votes it had been decided in favour of the present chairman the grudge indeed never proceeded to any degree of outrage or defiance but manifested itself at every meeting in attempts to eclipse each other in smart sayings and pregnant repartee so that there was always a delicate mess of this kind of wit served up in the front of the evening for the entertainment and example of the junior members who never failed to divide upon this occasion declaring themselves for one or other of the combatants whom they encouraged by their looks gestures and applause according to the circumstances of the dispute this honourable consistory was held in the best room of an alehouse which afforded wine punch or beer suitable to the purse or inclination of every individual who separately paid for his own choice and here was our hero introduced in the midst of twenty strangers who by their looks and equipage formed a very picturesque variety he was received with a most gracious solemnity and placed upon the right hand of the president who having commanded silence recited aloud his introductory ode which met with universal approbation then was tendered to him the customary oath obliging him to consult the honour and advantage of the society as far as it should he in his power in every station of life and this being taken his temples were bound with a wreath of laurel which was kept sacred for such inauguration when these rites were performed with all due ceremony the new member cast his eyes around the place and took a more accurate survey of his brethren among whom he observed a strange collection of periwigs with regard to the colour fashions and dimensions which were such as he had never seen before those who sat on each side nearest the president were generally distinguished by venerable ties the foretops of which exhibited a surprising diversity some of them rose slanting backwards like the glacis of a fortification some were elevated in two distinct eminences like the hills helicon and parnassus and others were curled and reflected as the horns of jupiter ammon next to these the majors took place many of which were mere succedanea made by the application of an occasional rose to the tail of a lank bob and in the lower form appeared masses of hair which would admit of no description their clothes were tolerably well suited to the furniture of their heads the apparel of the upper bench being decent and clean while that of the second class was threadbare and soiled and at the lower end of the room he perceived divers efforts made to conceal their rent breeches and dirty linen nay he could distinguish by their countenances the different kinds of poetry in which they exercised the muse he saw tragedy conspicuous in a grave solemnity of regard satire louring in a frown of envy and discontent elegy whining in a funeral aspect pastoral dozing in a most insipid languor of face odewriting delineated in a distracted stare and epigram squinting with a pert sneer perhaps our hero refined too much in his penetration when he affirmed that over and above these discoveries he could plainly perceive the state of every ones finances and would have undertaken to have guessed each particular sum without varying three farthings from the truth the conversation instead of becoming general began to fall into parties and the epic poet had actually attracted the attention of a private committee when the chairman interposed calling aloud no cabals no conspiracies gentlemen his rival thinking it incumbent upon him to make some reply to this rebuke answered we have no secrets he that hath ears let him hear this was spoke as an intimation to the company whose looks were instantly whetted with the expectation of their ordinary meal but the president seemed to decline the contest for without putting on his fighting face he calmly replied that he had seen mr metaphor tip the wink and whisper to one of his confederates and thence judged that there was something mysterious on the carpet the epic poet believing his antagonist crestfallen resolved to take the advantage of his dejection that he might enhance his own character in the opinion of the stranger and with that view asked with an air of exultation if a man might not be allowed to have a convulsion in his eye without being suspected of a conspiracy the president perceiving his drift and piqued at his presumption to be sure said he a man of a weak head may be very well supposed to have convulsions in his eyes this repartee produced a laugh of triumph among the chairmans adherents one of whom observed that his rival had got a smart rap on the pate yes replied the bard in that respect mr chairman has the advantage of me had my head been fortified with a hornwork i should not have been so sensible of the stroke this retort which carried a severe allusion to the presidents wife lighted up the countenances of the aggressors friends which had begun to be a little obumbrated and had a contrary effect upon the other faction till their chief collecting all his capacity returned the salute by observing that there was no occasion for a hornwork when the covered way was not worth defending such a reprisal upon mr metaphors yokefellow who was by no means remarkable for her beauty could not fail to operate upon the hearers and as for the bard himself he was evidently ruffled by the reflection to which however he without hesitation replied egad tis my opinion that if your covered way was laid open few people would venture to give the assault not unless their batteries were more effectual than the fire of your wit said the president as for that matter cried the other with precipitation they would have no occasion to batter in breach they would find the angle of the la pucelle bastion demolished to their hands he he but i believe it would surpass your understanding resumed the chairman to fill up the fosse that i own is impracticable replied the bard there i should meet with a hiatus maxime deflendus the president exasperated at this insinuation in presence of the new member exclaimed with indignation in his looks and yet if a body of pioneers were set at work upon your skull they would find rubbish enough to choke up all the common sewers in town here a groan was uttered by the admirers of the epic poet who taking a pinch of snuff with great composure when a man grows scurrilous said he i take it for an undoubted proof of his overthrow if that be the case cried the other you yourself must be the vanquished party for you were the first that was driven to personal abuse i appeal answered the bard to those who can distinguish gentlemen your judgment this reference produced a universal clamour and the whole college was involved in confusion every man entered into dispute with his neighbour on the merits of this cause the chairman interposed his authority in vain the noise grew louder and louder the disputants waxed warm the epithets of blockhead fool and scoundrel were bandied about peregrine enjoyed the uproar and leaping upon the table sounded the charge to battle which was immediately commenced in ten different duels the lights were extinguished the combatants thrashed one another without distinction the mischievous pickle distributed sundry random blows in the dark and the people below being alarmed with the sound of application the overturning of chairs and the outcries of those who were engaged came upstairs in a body with lights to reconnoitre and if possible quell this hideous tumult objects were no sooner rendered visible than the field of battle exhibited strange groups of the standing and the fallen each of mr metaphors eyes was surrounded with a circle of a livid hue and the presidents nose distilled a quantity of clotted blood one of the tragic authors finding himself assaulted in the dark had by way of a poniard employed upon his adversarys throat a knife which lay upon the table for the convenience of cutting cheese but by the blessing of god the edge of it was not keen enough to enter the skin which it had only scratched in divers places a satirist had almost bit off the ear of a lyric bard shirts and neckcloths were torn to rags and there was such a woeful wreck of periwigs on the floor that no examination could adjust the property of the owners the greatest part of whom were obliged to use handkerchiefs by way of nightcap the fray however ceased at the approach of those who interposed part of the combatants being tired of an exercise in which they had received nothing but hard blows part of them being intimidated by the remonstrances of the landlord and his company who threatened to call the watch and a very few being ashamed of the scandalous dispute in which they were detected but though the battle was ended it was impossible for that evening to restore harmony and good order to the society which broke up after the president had pronounced a short and confused apology to our adventurer for the indecent uproar which had unfortunately happened on the first night of his admission indeed peregrine deliberated with himself whether or not his reputation would allow him to appear again among this venerable fraternity but as he knew some of them to be men of real genius how ridiculous soever their carriage might be modified and was of that laughing disposition which is always seeking food for mirth as horace observes of philippus risus undique quaerit he resolved to frequent the college notwithstanding this accident which happened at his inauguration being thereto moreover induced by his desire of knowing the private history of the stage with which he supposed some of the members perfectly well acquainted he was also visited before the next meeting by his introductor who assured him that such a tumult had never happened since the first institution of the assembly till that very night and promised that for the future he should have no cause to be scandalized at their behaviour persuaded by these motives and assurances he trusted himself once more in the midst of their community and everything proceeded with great decorum all dispute and altercation was avoided and the college applied itself seriously to the purposes of its meeting namely to hear the grievances of individuals and assist them with salutary advice the first person that craved redress was a noisy north briton who complained in a strange dialect that he had in the beginning of the season presented a comedy to the manager of a certain theatre who after it had lain six weeks in his hands returned it to the author affirming there was neither sense nor english in the performance the president who by the bye had revised the piece thinking his own reputation concerned declared in presence of the whole society that with regard to sense he would not undertake to vindicate the production but in point of language no fault could be justly laid to its charge the case however is very plain said he the manager never gave himself the trouble to peruse the play but formed a judgment of it from the conversation of the author never dreaming that it had undergone the revisal of an english writer be that as it will you are infinitely obliged to him for having despatched you so soon and i shall have the better opinion of him for it so long as i live for i have known other guise authors than you that is in point of interest and fame kept in continual attendance and dependence during the best part of their lives and after all disappointed in the expectation of seeing their performances exhibited on the stage chapter xciv further proceedings of the college this affair was no sooner discussed than another gentleman exhibited a complaint signifying that he had undertaken to translate into english a certain celebrated author who had been cruelly mangled by former attempts and that soon as his design took air the proprietors of those miserable translations had endeavoured to prejudice his work by industrious insinuations contrary to truth and fair dealing importing that he did not understand one word of the language which he pretended to translate this being a case that nearly concerned the greatest part of the audience it was taken into serious deliberation some observed that it was not only a malicious effort against the plaintiff but also a spiteful advertisement to the public tending to promote an inquiry into the abilities of all other translators few of whom it was well known were so qualified as to stand the test of such examination others said that over and above this consideration which ought to have its due weight with the college there was a necessity for concerting measures to humble the presumption of booksellers who had from time immemorial taken all opportunities to oppress and enslave their authors not only by limiting men of genius to the wages of journeymen tailors without even allowing them one sabbath in the week but also in taking such advantages of their necessities as were inconsistent with justice and humanity for example said one of the members after i myself had acquired a little reputation with the town i was caressed by one of those tyrants who professed a friendship for me and even supplied me with money according to the exigencies of my situation so that i looked upon him as the mirror of disinterested benevolence and had he known my disposition and treated me accordingly i should have writ for him upon his own terms after i had used his friendship in this manner for some time i happened to have occasion for a small sum of money and with great confidence made another application to my good friend when all of a sudden he put a stop to his generosity refused to accommodate me in the most abrupt and mortifying style and though i was at that time pretty far advanced in a work for his benefit which was a sufficient security for what i owed him he roundly asked how i proposed to pay the money which i had already borrowed thus was i used like a young w just come upon the town whom the b d allows to run into her debt that she may have it in her power to oppress her at pleasure and if the sufferer complains she is treated like the most ungrateful wretch upon earth and that too with such appearance of reason as may easily mislead an unconcerned spectator you unthankful drab she will say didnt i take you into my house when you hadnt a shift to your back a petticoat to your tail nor a morsel of bread to put into your belly hant i clothed you from head to foot like a gentlewoman supported you with board lodging and all necessaries till your own extravagance hath brought you into distress and now you have the impudence you nasty stinking brimstone bungaway to say you are hardly dealt with when i demand no more than my own thus the w and the author are equally oppressed and even left without the melancholy privilege of complaining so that they are fain to subscribe to such terms as their creditors shall please to impose this illustration operated so powerfully upon the conviction and resentment of the whole college that revenge was universally denounced against those who had aggrieved the plaintiff and after some debate it was agreed that he should make a new translation of some other saleable book in opposition to a former version belonging to the delinquents and print it in such a small size as would enable him to undersell their property and that this new translation should be recommended and introduced into the world with the whole art and influence of the society this affair being settled to the satisfaction of all present an author of some character stood up and craved the advice and assistance of his fellows in punishing a certain nobleman of great pretensions to taste who in consequence of a production which this gentleman had ushered into the world with universal applause not only desired but even eagerly courted his acquaintance he invited me to his house said he where i was overwhelmed with civility and professions of friendship he insisted upon my treating him as an intimate and calling upon him at all hours without ceremony he made me promise to breakfast with him at least three times a week in short i looked upon myself as very fortunate in meeting with such advances from a man of his interest and reputation who had it in his power to befriend me effectually in my passage through life and that i might not give him any cause to think i neglected his friendship i went to his house in two days with a view of drinking chocolate according to appointment but he had been so much fatigued with dancing at an assembly overnight that his valetdechambre would not venture to wake him so early and i left my compliments to his lordship with a performance in manuscript which he had expressed a most eager desire to peruse i repeated my visit next morning that his impatience to see me might not have some violent effect upon his constitution and received a message from his minister signifying that he had been highly entertained with the manuscript i had left a great part of which he had read but was at present so busy in contriving a proper dress for a private masquerade which would be given that same evening that he could not have the pleasure of my company at breakfast this was a feasible excuse which i admitted accordingly and in a day or two appeared again when his lordship was particularly engaged this might possibly be the case and therefore i returned the fourth time in hopes of finding him more at leisure but he had gone out about half an hour before my arrival and left my performance with his valetdechambre who assured me that his lord had perused it with infinite pleasure perhaps i might have retired very well satisfied with this declaration had not i in my passage through the hall heard one of the footmen upon the top of the staircase pronounce with an audible voice will your lordship please to be at home when he calls it is not to be supposed that i was pleased at this discovery which i no sooner made than turning to my conductor i find said i his lordship is disposed to be abroad to more people than me this morning the fellow though a valetdechambre blushed at this observation and i withdrew not a little irritated at the peers disingenuity and fully resolved to spare him my visits for the future it was not long after this occasion that i happened to meet him in the park and being naturally civil i could not pass him without a salutation of the hat which he returned in the most distant manner though we were both solitary and not a soul within view and when that very performance which he had applauded so warmly was lately published by subscription he did not bespeak so much as one copy i have often reflected with wonder upon this inconsistency of his conduct i never courted his patronage nor indeed thought of his name until he made interest for my acquaintance and if he was disappointed in my conversation why did he press me so much to further connection the case is very clear cried the chairman interrupting him he is one of those connoisseurs who set up for taste and value themselves upon knowing all men of genius whom they would be thought to assist in their productions i will lay an even bet with any man that his lordship on the strength of that slender interview together with the opportunity of having seen your performance in manuscript has already hinted to every company in which he is conversant that you solicited his assistance in retouching the piece which you have now offered to the public and that he was pleased to favour you with his advice but found you obstinately bigoted to your own opinion in some points relating to those very passages which have not met with the approbation of the town as for his caresses there was nothing at all extraordinary in his behaviour by that time you have lived to my age you will not be surprised to see a courtiers promise and performance of a different complexion not but that i would willingly act as an auxiliary in your resentment the opinion of the president was strengthened by the concurrence of all the members and all other complaints and memorials being deferred till another sitting the college proceeded to an exercise of wit which was generally performed once every fortnight with a view to promote the expectoration of genius the subject was occasionally chosen by the chairman who opened the game with some shrewd remark naturally arising from the conversation and then the ball was tossed about from one corner of the room to the other according to the motions of the spirit that the reader may have a just idea of this sport and of the abilities of those who carried it on i shall repeat the sallies of this evening according to the order and succession in which they escaped one of the members observing that mr metaphor was absent was told by the person who sat next to him that the poet had foul weather at home and could not stir abroad what said the president interposing with the signal upon his countenance is he windbound in port winebound i suppose cried another hooped with wine a strange metaphor said the third not if he has got into a hogshead answered the fourth the hogshead will sooner get into him replied a fifth it must be a tun or an ocean no wonder then if he should be overwhelmed said a sixth if he should cried a seventh he will cast up when his gall breaks that must be very soon roared an eighth for it has been long ready to burst no no observed a ninth hell stick fast at the bottom take my word for it he has a natural alacrity in sinking and yet remarked a tenth i have seen him in the clouds then was he cloudy i suppose cried the eleventh so dark replied the other that his meaning could not be perceived for all that said the twelfth he is easily seen through you talk answered the thirteenth as if his head was made of glass no no cried the fourteenth his head is made of more durable stuff it will bend before it breaks yet i have seen it broken resumed the president did you perceive any wit come out at the whole said another his wit replied the chairman is too subtle to be perceived a third mouth was just open when the exercise was suddenly interrupted by the dreadful cry of fire which issued from the kitchen and involved the whole college in confusion every man endeavoured to be the first in making his exit the door and passage were blocked up each individual was pommelled by the person that happened to be behind him this communication produced noise and exclamation clouds of smoke rolled upwards into the apartment and terror sat on every brow when peregrine seeing no prospect of retreating by the door opened one of the windows and fairly leaped into the street where he found a crowd of people assembled to contribute their assistance in extinguishing the flames several members of the college followed his example and happily accomplished their escape the chairman himself being unwilling to use the same expedient stood trembling on the brink of descent dubious of his own agility and dreading the consequence of such a leap when a chair happening to pass he laid hold on the opportunity and by an exertion of his muscles pitched upon the top of the carriage which was immediately overturned in the kennel to the grievous annoyance of the fare which happened to be a certain effeminate beau in full dress on his way to a private assembly this phantom hearing the noise overhead and feeling the shock of being overthrown at the same time thought that some whole tenement had fallen upon the chair and in the terror of being crushed to pieces uttered a scream which the populace supposed to proceed from the mouth of a woman and therefore went to his assistance while the chairmen instead of ministering to his occasions no sooner recollected themselves than they ran in pursuit of their overthrower who being accustomed to escape from bailiffs dived into a dark alley and vanishing in a trice was not visible to any living soul until he appeared next day on towerhill the humane part of the mob who bestirred themselves for the relief of the supposed lady no sooner perceived their mistake in the appearance of the beau who stared around him with horror and affright than their compassion was changed into mirth and they began to pass a great many unsavoury jokes upon his misfortune which they now discovered no inclination to alleviate and he found himself very uncomfortably beset when pickle pitying his situation interposed in his behalf and prevailed upon the chairmen to carry him into the house of an apothecary in the neighbourhood to whom his mischance proved a very advantageous accident for the fright operated so violently upon his nerves that he was seized with a delirium and lay a whole fortnight deprived of his senses during which period he was not neglected in point of medicines food and attendance but royally regaled as appeared by the contents of his landlords bill our adventurer having seen this unfortunate beau safely housed returned to the scene of the other calamity which as it was no other than a foul chimney soon yielded to the endeavours of the family and was happily overcome without any other bad consequence than that of alarming the neighbours disturbing the college and disordering the brain of a beau eager to be acquainted with the particular constitutions of a society which seemed to open upon him by degrees mr pickle did not fail to appear at the next meeting when several petitions were laid before the board in behalf of those members who were confined in the prisons of the fleet marshalsea and kings bench as those unhappy authors expected nothing from their brethren but advice and good offices which did not concern the purse the memorials were considered with great care and humanity and upon this occasion peregrine had it in his power to manifest his importance to the community for he happened to be acquainted with the creditor of one of the prisoners and knew that gentlemans severity was owing to his resentment at the behaviour of the debtor who had lampooned him in print because he refused to comply with a fresh demand after he had lent him money to the amount of a considerable sum our young gentleman therefore understanding that the author was penitent and disposed to make a reasonable submission promised to employ his influence with the creditor towards an accommodation and in a few days actually obtained his release the social duties being discharged the conversation took a general turn and several new productions were freely criticised those especially which belonged to authors who were either unconnected with or unknown to the college nor did the profession of stageplaying escape the cognizance of the assembly a deputation of the most judicious members being sent weekly to each theatre with a view of making remarks upon the performance of the actors the censors for the preceding week were accordingly called upon to give in their report and the play which they had reviewed was the revenge mr q said the second censor take him all in all is certainly the most complete and unblemished performer that ever appeared on our stage notwithstanding the blind adoration which is paid to his rival i went two nights ago with an express design to criticise his action i could find no room for censure but infinite subject for admiration and applause in pierre he is great in othello excellent but in zanga beyond all imitation over and above the distinctness of pronunciation the dignity of attitude and expression of face his gestures are so just and significant that a man though utterly bereft of the sense of hearing might by seeing him only understand the meaning of every word he speaks sure nothing can be more exquisite than his manner of telling isabella how alonzo behaved when he found the incendiary letter which he had dropped by the moors direction and when to crown his vengeance he discovers himself to be the contriver of all the mischief that had happened he manifests a perfect masterpiece of action in pronouncing these four little monosyllables know then twas i peregrine having eyed the critic some minutes i fancy said he your praise must be ironical because in the very two situations you mention i think i have seen that player outherod herod or in other words exceed all his other extravagances the intention of the author is that the moor should communicate to his confidant a piece of information contained in a few lines which doubtless ought to be repeated with an air of eagerness and satisfaction not with the ridiculous grimace of a monkey to which methought his action bore an intimate resemblance in uttering this plain sentence he took it up but scarce was it unfolded to his sight when he as if an arrow piercd his eye started and trembling droppd it on the ground in pronouncing the first two words this egregious actor stoops down and seems to take up something from the stage then proceeding to repeat what follows mimics the manner of unfolding a letter when he mentions the simile of an arrow piercing the eye he darts his forefinger towards that organ then recoils with great violence when the word started is expressed and when he comes to trembling droppd it on the ground he throws all his limbs into a tremulous motion and shakes the imaginary paper from his hand the latter part of the description is carried on with the same minute gesticulation while he says pale and aghast awhile my victim stood disguisd a sigh or two and puffd them from him then rubbd his brow and took it up again the players countenance assumes a wild stare he sighs twice most piteously as if he were on the point of suffocation scrubs his forehead and bending his body apes the action of snatching an object from the floor nor is this dexterity of dumbshow omitted when he concludes his imitation in these three lines at first he lookd as if he meant to read it but checkd by rising fears he crushed it thus and thrust it like an adder in his bosom here the judicious performer imitates the confusion and concern of alonzo seems to cast his eyes upon something from which they are immediately withdrawn with horror and precipitation then shutting his fist with a violent squeeze as if he intended to make immediate application to isabellas nose he rams it in his own bosom with all the horror and agitation of a thief taken in the manner were the player debarred the use of speech and obliged to act to the eyes only of the audience this mimicry might be a necessary conveyance of his meaning but when he is at liberty to signify his ideas by language nothing can be more trivial forced unnatural and antic than this mummery not that i would exclude from the representation the graces of action without which the choicest sentiments clothed in the most exquisite expression would appear unanimated and insipid but these are as different from this ridiculous burlesque as is the demeanour of a tully in the rostrum from the tricks of a jackpudding on a mountebanks stage and for the truth of what i allege i appeal to the observation of any person who has considered the elegance of attitude and propriety of gesture as they are universally acknowledged in the real characters of life indeed i have known a gascon whose limbs were eloquent as his tongue he never mentioned the word sleep without reclining his head upon his hand when he had occasion to talk of a horse he always started up and trotted across the room except when he was so situated that he could not stir without incommoding the company and in that case he contented himself with neighing aloud if a dog happened to be the subject of his conversation he wagged his tail and grinned in a most significant manner and one day he expressed his desire of going backwards with such natural imitation of his purpose that everybody in the room firmly believed he had actually overshot himself and fortified their nostrils accordingly yet no man ever looked upon this virtuoso to be the standard of propriety in point of speaking and deportment for my own part i confess the player in question would by dint of these qualifications make a very good figure in the character of pantaloons lacquey in the entertainment of perseus and andromeda and perhaps might acquire some reputation by turning the revenge into a pantomime in which case i would advise him to come upon the stage provided with a handful of flour in order to besmear his face when he pronounces pale and aghast etc and methinks he ought to illustrate the adder with a hideous hiss but let us now come to the other situation in which this modern aesopus is supposed to distinguish himself so much i mean that same eclaircissement comprehended in know then twas i his manner i own may be altered since i was present at the representation of that performance but certain i am when i beheld him in that critical conjuncture his behaviour appeared to me so uncouth that i really imagined he was visited by some epileptic distemper for he stood tottering and gasping for the space of two minutes like a man suddenly struck with the palsy and after various distortions and sideshakings as if he had got fleas in his doublet heaved up from his lungs the letter i like a huge anchor from foul ground this criticism was acceptable to the majority of the college who had no great veneration for the player in question and his admirer without making any reply asked in a whisper of the gentleman who sat next to him if pickle had not offered some production to the stage and met with a repulse chapter xcv the young gentleman is introduced to a virtuoso of the first order and commences yelper hitherto peregrine had professed himself an author without reaping the fruits of that occupation except the little fame he had acquired by his late satire but now he thought it high time to weigh solid pudding against empty praise and therefore engaged with some booksellers in a certain translation which he obliged himself to perform for the consideration of two hundred pounds the articles of agreement being drawn he began his task with great eagerness rose early in the morning to his work at which he laboured all day long went abroad with the bats in the evening and appeared in the coffeehouse where he amused himself with the newspapers and conversation till nine oclock then he retired to his own apartment and after a slight repast betook himself to rest that he might be able to unroost with the cock this sudden change from his former way of life agreed so ill with his disposition that for the first time he was troubled with flatulencies and indigestion which produced anxiety and dejection of spirits and the nature of his situation began in some measure to discompose his brain a discovery which he no sooner made than he had recourse to the advice of a young physician who was a member of the college of authors at this time one of our heros most intimate acquaintance the son of esculapius having considered his case imputed his disorder to the right cause namely want of exercise dissuaded him from such close application to study until he should be gradually familiarized to a sedentary life advised him to enjoy his friend and his bottle in moderation and wean himself from his former customs by degrees and above all things to rise immediately after his first sleep and exercise himself in a mornings walk in order to render this last part of the prescription the more palatable the doctor promised to attend him in these early excursions and even to introduce him to a certain personage of note who gave a sort of public breakfasting to the minor virtuosi of the age and often employed his interest in behalf of those who properly cultivated his countenance and approbation this proposal was extremely acceptable to our young gentleman who besides the advantage which might accrue to him from such a valuable connection foresaw much entertainment and satisfaction in the discourse of so many learned guests the occasions of his health and interest moreover coincided in another circumstance the ministers levee being kept betimes in the morning so that he could perform his walk yield his attendance and breakfast at this philosophical board without encroaching a great deal upon his other avocations measures being thus preconcerted the physician conducted our adventurer to the house of this celebrated sage to whom he recommended him as a gentleman of genius and taste who craved the honour of his acquaintance but he had previously smoothed the way to his introduction by representing peregrine as a young fellow of great ambition spirit and address who could not fail to make a figure in the world that therefore he would be a creditable addition to the subordinates of such a patron and by his qualifications intrepidity and warmth of temper turn out a consummate herald of his fame upon these considerations he met with a most engaging reception from the entertainer who was a wellbred man of some learning generosity and taste but his foible was the desire of being thought the inimitable pattern of all three it was with a view to acquire and support this character that his house was open to all those who had any pretensions to literature consequently he was surrounded by a strange variety of pretenders but none were discouraged because he knew that even the most insignificant might in some shape conduce to the propagation of his praise a babbler though he cannot run upon the scent may spring the game and by his yelping help to fill up the cry no wonder then that a youth of pickles accomplishments was admitted and even invited into the pack after having enjoyed a very short private audience in the closet our young gentleman was shown into another room where half a dozen of his fellowadherents waited for the maecenas who in a few minutes appeared with a most gracious aspect received the compliments of the morning and sat down to breakfast in the midst of them without any further ceremony the conversation at first turned upon the weather which was investigated in a very philosophical manner by one of the company who seemed to have consulted all the barometers and thermometers that ever were invented before he would venture to affirm that it was a chill morning this subject being accurately discussed the chief inquired about the news of the learned world and his inclination was no sooner expressed than every guest opened his mouth in order to ratify his curiosity but he that first captivated his attention was a meagre shrivelled antiquary who looked like an animated mummy which had been scorched among the sands of the desert he told the patron that he had by accident met with a medal which though it was defaced by time he would venture to pronounce a genuine antique from the ringing and taste of the metal as well as from the colour and composition of the rust so saying he produced a piece of copper coin so consumed and disguised by age that scarce a vestige of the impression was to be perceived nevertheless this connoisseur pretended to distinguish a face in profile from which he concluded that the piece was of the upper empire and on the reverse he endeavoured to point out the bulb of the spear and part of the parazonium which were the insignia of the roman virtus together with the fragment of one fold of the multicium in which she was clothed he likewise had discovered an angle of the letter n and at some distance an entire i from these circumstances conjecturing and indeed concluding that the medal was struck by severus in honour of the victory he obtained over his rival niger after he had forced the passes of mount taurus this criticism seemed very satisfactory to the entertainer who having examined the coin by the help of his spectacles plainly discerned the particulars which the owner had mentioned and was pleased to term his account of the matter a very ingenious explanation the curiosity was circulated through the hands of all present and every virtuoso in his turn licked the copper and rung it upon the hearth declaring his assent to the judgment which had been pronounced at length it fell under the inspection of our young gentleman who though no antiquarian was very well acquainted with the current coin of his own country and no sooner cast his eyes upon the valuable antique than he affirmed without hesitation that it was no other than the ruins of an english farthing and that same spear parazonium and multicium the remains of the emblems and drapery with which the figure of britannia is delineated on our copper money this hardy asseveration seemed to disconcert the patron while it incensed the medallist who grinning like an enraged baboon what dye tell me of a brass farthing said he did you ever know modern brass of such a relish do but taste it young gentleman and sure i am if you have ever been conversant with subjects of this kind you will find as wide a difference in the savour between this and an english farthing as can possibly be perceived betwixt an onion and a turnip besides this medal has the true corinthian ring then the attitude is upright whereas that of britannia is reclining and how is it possible to mistake a branch of palm for a parazonium all the rest of the company espoused the virtuosos side of the question because the reputation of each was concerned the patron finding himself in the same circumstance assumed a solemnity of feature dashed with a small mixture of displeasure and told peregrine that as he had not made that branch of literature his particular study he was not surprised to see him mistaken in his opinion pickle immediately understood the reproof though he was shocked at the vanity or infatuation of his entertainer and fellowguests asked pardon for his presumption which was accordingly excused in consideration of his inexperience and the english farthing was dignified with the title of a true antique the next person that addressed himself to the chief was a gentleman of a very mathematical turn who valued himself upon the improvements he had made in several domestic machines and now presented the plan of a new contrivance for cutting cabbages in such a manner as would secure the stock against the rotting rain and enable it to produce a plenteous aftercrop of delicious sprouts in this important machine he had united the whole mechanic powers with such massy complication of iron and wood that it could not have been moved without the assistance of a horse and a road made for the convenience of the draught these objections were so obvious that they occurred at first sight to the inspectorgeneral who greatly commended the invention which he observed might be applied to several other useful purposes could it once be rendered a little more portable and commodious the inventor who had not foreseen these difficulties was not prepared to surmount them but he took the hint in good part and promised to task his abilities anew in altering the construction of his design not but that he underwent some severe irony from the rest of the virtuosi who complimented him upon the momentous improvement he had made by which a family might save a dish of greens in a quarter for so trifling an expense as that of purchasing working and maintaining such a stupendous machine but no man was ever more sarcastic in his remarks upon this piece of mechanism than the naturalist who next appealed to the patrons approbation for a curious disposition he had made touching the procreation of muckflies in which he had laid down a curious method of collecting preserving and hatching the eggs of these insects even in the winter by certain modifications of artificial heat the nature of this discovery was no sooner communicated than peregrine unable to contain himself was seized with a fit of laughter which infected every person at the table the landlord himself not excepted who found it impossible to preserve his wonted gravity of face such unmannerly mirth did not fail to mortify the philosopher who after some pause during which indignation and disdain were painted in his countenance reprehended our young gentleman for his unphilosophical behaviour and undertook to prove that the subject of his inquiry was of infinite consequence to the progress and increase of natural knowledge but he found no quarter from the vengeful engineer who now retorted his ironical compliments with great emphasis upon this hotbed for the generation of vermin and advised him to lay the whole process before the royal society which would doubtless present him with a medal and give him a place among their memoirs as a distinguished promoter of the useful arts if said he you had employed your studies in finding out some effectual method to destroy those insects which prejudice and annoy mankind in all probability you must have been contented with the contemplation of the good you had done but this curious expedient for multiplying maggots will surely entitle you to an honourable rank in the list of learned philosophers i dont wonder replied the naturalist that you should be so much averse to the propagation of insects because in all likelihood you are afraid that they will not leave you a cabbage to cut down with the same miraculous machine sir answered the mechanic with great bitterness of voice and aspect if the cabbage be as lightheaded as some muckworm philosophers it will not he worth cutting down i never dispute upon cabbage with the son of a cucumber said the flybreeder alluding to the pedigree of his antagonist who impatient of the affront started up with fury in his looks exclaiming sdeath meaning me sir here the patron perceiving things drawing towards a rupture interposed his authority rebuking them for their intemperance and recommending to them amity and concord against the goths and vandals of the age who took all opportunities of ridiculing and discouraging the adherents of knowledge and philosophy after this exhortation they had no pretence for carrying on the dispute which was dropped in all appearance though the mechanic still retained his resentment and after breakfast when the company broke up accosted his adversary in the street desiring to know how he durst be so insolent as to make that scurrilous reflection upon his family the flyfancier thus questioned accused the mathematician of having been the aggressor in likening his head to a light cabbage and here the altercation being renewed the engineer proceeded to the illustration of his mechanics tilting up his hand like a balance thrusting it forward by way of lever embracing the naturalists nose like a wedge betwixt two of his fingers and turning it round with the momentum of a screw or peritrochium had they been obliged to decide the dispute with equal arms the assailant would have had great advantage over the other who was very much his inferior in muscular strength but the philosopher being luckily provided with a cane no sooner disengaged himself from this opprobrious application than he handled his weapon with great dexterity about the head and shoulders of his antagonist who finding this shower of blows very disagreeable was fain to betake himself to his heels for shelter and was pursued by the angry victor who chased him from one end of the street to the other affording unspeakable satisfaction to the multitude as well as to our hero and to his introductor who were spectators of the whole scene thus was our adventurer initiated into the society of yelpers though he did not as yet fully understand the nature of his office which was explained by the young physician who chid him for his blunt behaviour in the case of the medal and gave him to understand that their patrons favour was neither to be gained nor preserved by any man that would pretend to convict him of a mistake he therefore counselled him to respect this foible and cultivate the old gentleman with all the zeal and veneration which a regard to his own character would permit him to say this task was the easier to one of our young gentlemans pliant disposition because the virtuosos behaviour was absolutely free from that insolent selfconceit which he could not bear without disgust the senior was on the contrary mild and beneficent and pickle was rather pleased than shocked at his weakness because it flattered his vanity with the supposition of his own superior sense cautioned in this manner peregrine profited so much by his insinuating qualifications that in a very little time he was looked upon as one of the chief favourites of the patron to whom he dedicated a small occasional poem and everybody believed he would reap the fruits of his attachment among the first of the old gentlemans dependents chapter xcvi peregrine finding himself neglected by sir steady steerwell expostulates with him in a letter in consequence of which he is forbid his house loses his pension and incurs the charge of lunacy this prospect of success together with his expectations from the minister whom he did not neglect helped to comfort him under the reverse of fortune which he had undergone and the uncertainty of the lawsuit which he still maintained for the recovery of his ten thousand pounds the lawyers indeed continued to drain his pocket of money while they filled his brain with unsubstantial hope and he was actually obliged to borrow money from his bookseller on the strength of the translation in order to satisfy the demands of those ravenous harpies rather than lay the misanthrope under any difficulties or have recourse to his friend hatchway who lived at the garrison entirely ignorant of his distress this was not at all alleviated by the arrival of the indiaman in which he had ventured seven hundred pounds as we have already observed for he was given to understand that the borrower was left dangerously ill at bombay when the ship sailed and that his chance for retrieving his money was extremely slender so situated it is not to be supposed that he led a life of tranquility though he made a shift to struggle with the remonstrances of misfortune yet such a gush of affliction would sometimes rush upon his thought as overwhelmed all the ideas of his hope and sunk him to the very bottom of despondence every equipage that passed him in the street every person of rank and fortune that occurred to his view recalled the gay images of his former life with such mortifying reflection as stabbed him to the very soul he lived therefore incessantly exposed to all the pangs of envy and disquiet when i say envy i do not mean that sordid passion in consequence of which a man repines at his neighbours success howsoever deserved but that selftormenting indignation which is inspired by the prosperity of folly ignorance and vice without the intervening gleams of enjoyment which he felt in the conversation of a few friends he could not have supported his existence or at least he must have suffered some violent discomposure of the brain but one is still finding some circumstance of alleviation even in the worst of conjunctures and pickle was so ingenious in these researches that he maintained a good battle with disappointment till the revolution of the term at which he had received his pension of three hundred pounds however seeing the day elapse without touching his allowance notwithstanding his significant method of presenting himself at the ministers levee when the year was expired he wrote a letter to sir steady reminding him of his situation and promise and giving him to understand that his occasions were such as compelled him to demand his salary for the ensuing year in the morning after this letter was conveyed the author went to his honours house in expectation of being admitted by particular order but was mistaken in his hope the minister not being visible he then made his appearance at the levee in hopes of being closeted but though he took all opportunities of watching sir steadys eyes he could not obtain one glance and had the pleasure of seeing him retire without being favoured with the least notice these circumstances of wilful neglect were not over and above agreeable to our young hero who in the agonies of vexation and resentment went home and composed a most acrimonious remonstrance to his honour in consequence of which he was not only deprived of all pretensions to a private audience but expressly denied admittance on a public day by sir steadys own order this prohibition which announced his total ruin filled him with rage horror and despair he insulted the porter who signified the ministers command threatening to chastise him upon the spot for his presumption and vented the most virulent imprecations upon his master to the astonishment of those who chanced to enter during this conference having exhausted himself in these vain exclamations he returned to his lodgings in a most frantic condition biting his lips so that the blood ran from his mouth dashing his head and fists against the sides of his chimney and weeping with the most bitter expressions of woe pipes whose perception had been just sufficient to let him see that there was some difference between the present and former situation of his master overhearing his transports essayed to enter his apartment with a view of administering consolation and finding the door locked on the inside desired admittance protesting that otherwise he would down with the bulkhead in the turning of a handspike peregrine ordered him to retire on pain of his displeasure and swore that if he should offer to break open the door he would instantly shoot him through the head tom without paying the least regard to this injunction set himself at work immediately his master exasperated at his want of reverence and respect which in his present paroxysm appeared with the most provoking aggravation flew into his closet and snatching up one of his pistols already loaded no sooner saw his valet enter the apartment in consequence of having forced the lock than he presented it full at his face and drew the trigger happily the priming flashed in the pan without communicating with the charge so that his furious purpose did not take effect upon the countenance of honest pipes who disregardful of the attempt though he knew the contents of the piece asked without the least alteration of feature if it must be foul weather through the whole voyage peregrine mad as he was repented of his mischievous intent against such a faithful adherent in the very moment of execution and had it proved fatal according to the design in all probability he would have applied another to his own head there are certain considerations that strike upon the mind with irresistible force even in the midst of its distraction the momentary recollection of some particular scene occasioned by the features of the devoted victim hath often struck the dagger from the assassins hand by such an impulse was pipes protected from any repeated effort of his masters rage the friendly cause of his present disobedience flashed upon the conviction of peregrine when he beheld the rugged front of his valet in which also stood disclosed his long and faithful service together with the recommendation of the deceased commodore though his wrath was immediately suppressed and his heart torn with remorse for what he had done his brows remained still contracted and darting a most ferocious regard at the intruder villain said he how dare you treat me with such disrespect why shouldnt i lend a hand for the preservation of the ship answered the unruffled pipes when there is more sail than ballast aboard and the pilot quits the helm in despair what signifies one or two broken voyages so long as our timbers are strong and our vessel in good trim if she loses upon one tack mayhap she may gain upon tother and ill be d d if one day or other we dont fetch up our leeway as for the matter of provision you have started a pretty good stock of money into my hold and you are welcome to hoist it up again when you wool here tom was interrupted by the arrival of mr crabtree who seeing peregrine with a pistol in his hand and such wild disorder in his looks his head hands and mouth besmeared with blood and moreover smelling the gunpowder which had been burnt actually believed he had either committed or was bent upon murder and accordingly retreated downstairs with infinite despatch all his speed could not convey him without the reach of pipes who overtaking him in his passage carried him back into his masters apartment observing by the way that this was no time to sheer off when his consort stood in need of his assistance there was something so ruefully severe in the countenance of cadwallader thus compelled that at any other time our hero would have laughed at his concern but at the present there was nothing risible in his disposition he had however laid aside his pistol and endeavoured though in vain to compose his internal disturbance for he could not utter one syllable to the misanthrope but stood staring at him in silence with a most delirious aspect this did not tend to dispel the dismay of his friend who after some recollection i wonder said he that you have never killed your man before pray how may you have disposed of the body pickle having recovered the faculty of speech ordered his lacquey out of the room and in a most incoherent detail made crabtree acquainted with the perfidious conduct of the minister the confidant was very glad to find his fears disappointed for he had really concluded that some life was lost perceiving the youth too much agitated to be treated by him in his usual style he owned that sir steady was a rascal and encouraged pickle with the hope of being one day able to make reprisals upon him in the mean time offered him money for his immediate occasions exhorted him to exert his own qualifications in rendering himself independent of such miscreants and finally counselled him to represent his wrongs to the nobleman whom he had formerly obliged with a view of interesting that peer in his behalf or at least of obtaining a satisfactory explanation from the minister that he might take no premature measures of revenge these admonitions were so much milder and more agreeable than our hero expected from the misanthrope that they had a very favourable effect upon his transports which gradually subsided until he became so tractable as to promise that he would conform to his advice in consequence of which he next morning waited upon his lordship who received him very politely as usual and with great patience heard his complaint which by the bye he could not repeat without some hasty ebullitions of passionate resentment this peer after having gently disapproved of the letter of expostulation which had produced such unfortunate effects kindly undertook to recommend his case to the minister and actually performed his promise that same day when sir steady informed him to his utter astonishment that the poor young gentleman was disordered in his brain so that he could not possibly be provided for in a place of importance with any regard to the service and it could not be expected that he sir steady would support his extravagance from his own private purse that he had indeed at the solicitation of a nobleman deceased made him a present of three hundred pounds in consideration of some loss that he pretended to have sustained in an election but since that time had perceived in him such indisputable marks of lunacy both by his distracted letters and personal behaviour as obliged him to give order that he should not be admitted into the house to corroborate this assertion the minister actually called in the evidence of his own porter and one of the gentlemen of his household who had heard the execrations that escaped our youth when he first found himself excluded in short the nobleman was convinced that peregrine was certainly and bona fide mad as a march hare and by the help of this intimation began to recollect some symptoms of distraction which appeared in his last visit he remembered a certain incoherence in his speech a violence of gesture and wildness of look that now evidently denoted a disturbed understanding and he determined for his own credit and security to disentangle himself from such a dangerous acquaintance with this view he in imitation of sir steady commanded his gate to be shut against our adventurer so that when he went to know the result of his lordships conference with the minister the door was flung in his face and the janitor told him through an iron grate that he needed not to give himself the trouble of calling again for his lord desired to be excused from seeing him he spoke not a word in answer to this declaration which he immediately imputed to the ill offices of the minister against whom he breathed defiance and revenge in his way to the lodgings of cadwallader who being made acquainted with the manner of his reception begged he would desist from all schemes of vengeance until he crabtree should be able to unriddle the mystery of the whole which he did not doubt of unveiling by means of his acquaintance with a family in which his lordship often spent the evening at whist it was not long before he had the desired opportunity the nobleman being under no injunctions or obligation to keep the affair secret discovered the young gentlemans misfortune by way of news to the first company in which he happened to be and peregrines name was not so obscure in the fashionable world but that his disorder became the general topic of conversation for a day so that his friend soon partook of the intelligence and found means to learn the particulars of the ministers information as above related nay he was in danger of becoming a proselyte to sir steadys opinion when he recalled and compared every circumstance which he knew of pickles impatience and impetuosity indeed nothing more easily gains credit than an imputation of madness fixed upon any person whatsoever for when the suspicion of the world is roused and its observation once set at work the wisest the coolest man upon earth will by some particulars in his behaviour convict himself of the charge every singularity in his dress and manner and such are observable in every person that before passed unheeded now rises up in judgment against him with all the exaggeration of the observers fancy and the sagacious examiner perceives distraction in every glance of the eye turn of the finger and motion of the head when he speaks there is a strange peculiarity in his argument and expression when he holds his tongue his imagination teems with some extravagant reverie his sobriety of demeanour is no other than a lucid interval and his passion mere delirium if people of the most sedate and insipid life and conversation are subject to such criticisms no wonder that they should take place upon a youth of peregrines fiery disposition which on some occasions would have actually justified any remarks of this kind which his greatest enemies could make he was accordingly represented as one of those enterprising bucks who after having spent their fortunes in riot and excess are happily bereft of their understanding and consequently insensible of the want and disgrace which they have entailed upon themselves cadwallader himself was so much affected with the report that for some time he hesitated in his deliberations upon our hero before he could prevail upon himself to communicate to him the information he had received or to treat him in other respects as a man of sound intellects at length however he ventured to make pickle acquainted with the particulars he had learned imparting them with such caution and circumlocution as he thought necessary to prevent the young gentleman from transgressing all bounds of temper and moderation but for once he was agreeably deceived in his prognostic incensed as our hero was at the conduct of the minister he could not help laughing at the ridiculous aspersion which he told his friend he would soon refute in a manner that should not be very agreeable to his calumniator observing that it was a common practice with the state pilot thus to slander those people to whom he lay under obligations which he had no mind to discharge true it is said peregrine he has succeeded more than once in contrivances of this kind having actually reduced divers people of weak heads to such extremity of despair as hath issued in downright distraction whereby he was rid of their importunities and his judgment confirmed at the same time but i have now thank heaven attained to such a pitch of philosophical resolution as will support me against all his machinations and i will forthwith exhibit the monster to the public in his true lineaments of craft perfidy and ingratitude this indeed was the plan with which mr pickle had amused himself during the researches of crabtree and by this time it so effectually flattered his imagination that he believed he should be able to bring his adversary in spite of all his power to his own terms of submission by distinguishing himself in the list of those who at that period wrote against the administration nor was this scheme so extravagant as it may seem to be had not he overlooked one material circumstance which cadwallader himself did not recollect when he approved of this project while he thus meditated vengeance the fame of his disorder in due course of circulation reached the ears of that lady of quality whose memoirs have already appeared in these adventures the correspondence with which she had honoured our hero had been long broke off for the reason already advanced namely his dread of being exposed to her infatuating charms he had been candid enough to make her acquainted with the cause of exiling himself from her presence and she admitted the prudence of selfrestraint although she would have very well satisfied with the continuance of his intimacy and conversation which were not at all beneath the desire of any lady in the kingdom notwithstanding this interruption she still retained a friendship and regard for his character and felt all the affliction of a humane heart at the news of his misfortunes and deplorable distemper she had seen him courted and cultivated in the sunshine of his prosperity but she knew from sad experience how all those insectfollowers shrink away in the winter of distress her compassion represented him as a poor unhappy lunatic destitute of all the necessaries of life dragging about the ruins of human nature and exhibiting the spectacle of blasted youth to the scorn and abhorrence of his fellowcreatures aching with these charitable considerations she found means to learn in what part of the town he lodged and laying aside all superfluous ceremony went in a hackneychair to his door which was opened by the everfaithful pipes her ladyship immediately recollected the features of his trusty follower whom she could not help loving in her heart for his attachment and fidelity which after she had applauded with a most gracious commendation she kindly inquired after the state of his masters health and asked if he was in a condition to be seen tom who could not suppose that the visit of a fine lady would be unacceptable to a youth of peregrines complexion made no verbal reply to the question but beckoning her ladyship with an arch significance of feature at which she could not forbear smiling walked softly upstairs and she in obedience to the signal followed her guide into the apartment of our hero whom she found at a writingtable in the very act of composing a eulogium upon his good friend sir steady the nature of his work had animated his countenance with an uncommon degree of vivacity and being dressed in a neat deshabille his figure could not have appeared to more advantage in the eye of a person who despised the tinsel of unnecessary ornament she was extremely well pleased to see her expectations so agreeably disappointed for instead of the squalid circumstances and wretched looks attending indigence and distraction everything was decent and genteel and the patients aspect such as betokened internal satisfaction hearing the rustling of silk in his room he lifted up his eyes from the paper and seeing her ladyship was struck with astonishment and awe as at the unexpected apparition of some supernatural being before he could recollect himself from his confusion which called the blood into his cheeks she told him that on the strength of old acquaintance she was come to visit him though it was a long time since he had given her good reason to believe he had absolutely forgot that there was such a person as she in being after having made the most warm acknowledgments for this unforeseen honour he assured her ladyship that the subject of her reproach was not his fault but rather his very great misfortune and that if it had been in his power to forget her so easily as she seemed to imagine he should never have given her cause to tax him with want of duty and respect still dubious of his situation she began to converse with him on different subjects and he acquitted himself so well in every particular that she no longer doubted his having been misrepresented by the malice of his enemies and candidly told him the cause and intent of her coming he was not deficient in expressions of gratitude for this instance of her generosity and friendship which even drew tears from his eyes as to the imputation of madness he explained it so much to her ladyships satisfaction that she evidently perceived he had been barbarously dealt with and that the charge was no other than a most villainous aspersion notwithstanding all his endeavours to conceal the true state of his finances it was impossible for him to give this detail without disclosing some of the difficulties under which he laboured and her ladyships sagacity divining the rest she not only made him a tender of assistance but presenting a banknote for a considerable sum insisted upon his acceptance of it as a trifling mark of her esteem and a specimen of what she was inclined to do in his behalf but this mark of her benevolence he would by no means receive assuring her that though his affairs were at present a little perplexed he had never felt the least circumstance of distress and begging that she would not subject him to the burden of such an unnecessary obligation being obliged to put up with this refusal she protested she would never forgive him should she ever hear that he rejected her offer when he stood in need of her aid or if in any time to come he should not apply to her friendship if ever he should find himself incommoded in point of fortune an overdelicacy in this respect said she i shall look upon as a disapprobation of my own conduct because i myself have been obliged to have recourse to my friends in such emergencies these generous remonstrances and marks of particular friendship could not fail to make a deep impression upon the heart of our hero which still smarted from the former impulse of her charms he not only felt all those transports which a man of honour and sensibility may be supposed to feel upon such an occasion but the sentiments of a more tender passion awaking in his breast he could not help expressing himself in terms adapted to the emotion of his soul and at length plainly told her that were he disposed to be a beggar he would ask something of infinitely more importance to his peace than the charitable assistance she had proffered her ladyship had too much penetration to mistake his meaning but as she did not choose to encourage his advances pretended to interpret his intimation into a general compliment of gallantry and in a jocose manner desired he would not give her any reason to believe his lucid interval was past in faith my lady said he i perceive the fit coming on and i dont see why i may not use the privilege of my distemper so far as to declare myself one of your most passionate admirers if you do replied her ladyship i shall not be fool enough to believe a madman unless i were assured that your disorder proceeded from your love and that this was the case i suppose you will find it difficult to prove nay madam cried the youth i have in this drawer what will convince you of my having been mad on that strain and since you doubt my pretension you must give me leave to produce my testimonials so saying he opened an escrutoire and taking out a paper presented her with the following song which he had written in her praise immediately after he was made acquainted with the particulars of her story i while with fond rapture and amaze on thy transcendent charms i gaze my cautious soul essays in vain her peace and freedom to maintain yet let that blooming form divine where grace and harmony combine those eyes like genial orbs that move dispensing gladness joy and love in all their pomp assail my view intent my bosom to subdue my breast by wary maxims steeld not all those charms shall force to yield ii but when invokd to beautys aid i see the enlightend soul displayd that soul so sensibly sedate amid the storms of froward fate thy genius active strong and clear thy wit sublime though not severe the social ardour void of art that glows within thy candid heart my spirits sense and strength decay my resolution dies away and every faculty oppressd almighty love invades my breast her ladyship having perused this production were i inclined to be suspicious said she i should believe that i had no share in producing this composition which seems to have been inspired by a much more amiable object however i will take your word for your intention and thank you for the unmerited compliment though i have met with it in such an accidental manner nevertheless i must be so free as to tell you it is now high time for you to contract that unbounded spirit of gallantry which you have indulged so long into a sincere attachment for the fair emilia who by all accounts deserves the whole of your attention and regard his nerves thrilled at mention of that name which he never heard pronounced without agitation rather than undergo the consequence of a conversation upon this subject he chose to drop the theme of love altogether and industriously introduced some other topic of discourse chapter xcvii he writes against the minister by whose instigation he is arrested and moves himself by habeas corpus into the fleet my lady having prolonged her stay beyond the period of a common visit and repeated her protestations in the most frank and obliging manner took her leave of our adventurer who promised to pay his respects to her in a few days at her own house meanwhile he resumed his task and having finished a most severe remonstrance against sir steady not only with regard to his private ingratitude but also to his maladministration of public affairs he sent it to the author of a weekly paper who had been long a professed reformer in politics and it appeared in a very few days with a note of the publisher desiring the favour of further correspondence with the author the animadversions contained in this small essay were so spirited and judicious and a great many new lights thrown upon the subject with such perspicuity as attracted the notice of the public in an extraordinary manner and helped to raise the character of the paper in which it was inserted the minister was not the last who examined the performance which in spite of all his boasted temper provoked him to such a degree that he set his emissaries at work and by dint of corruption procured a sight of the manuscript in peregrines own handwriting which he immediately recognised but for further confirmation of his opinion he compared it with the two letters which he had received from our adventurer had he known the young gentlemans talents for declamation were so acute perhaps he would never have given him cause to complain but employed him in the vindication of his own measures nay he might still have treated him like some other authors whom he had brought over from the opposition had not the keenness of this first assault incensed him to a desire of revenge he therefore no sooner made this discovery than he conveyed his directions to his dependent the receivergeneral who was possessed of pickles notes next day while our author stood within a circle of his acquaintance at a certain coffeehouse holding forth with great eloquence upon the diseases of the state he was accosted by a bailiff who entering the room with five or six followers told him aloud that he had a writ against him for twelve hundred pounds at the suit of mr ravage gleanum the whole company were astonished at this address which did not fail to discompose the defendant himself who as it were instinctively in the midst of his confusion saluted the officer across the head with his cane in consequence of which application he was surrounded and disarmed in an instant by the gang who carried him off to the next tavern in the most opprobrious manner nor did one of the spectators interpose in his behalf or visit him in his confinement with the least tender of advice or assistance such is the zeal of coffeehouse friendship this stroke was the more severe upon our hero as it was altogether unexpected for he had utterly forgot the debt for which he was arrested his present indignation was however chiefly kindled against the bailiff who had done his office in such a disrespectful manner and the first use he made of his recollection in the house to which they conducted him was to chastise him for the insolence and indecency of his behaviour this task he performed with his bare fists every other weapon being previously conveyed out of his reach and the delinquent underwent his discipline with surprising patience and resignation asking pardon with great humility and protesting before god that he had never willingly and wittingly used any gentleman with ill manners but had been commanded to arrest our adventurer according to the express direction of the creditor on pain of forfeiting his place by this declaration peregrine was appeased and out of a delirium of passion waked to all the horrors of reflection all the glory of his youth was now eclipsed all the blossoms of his hope were blasted and he saw himself doomed to the miseries of a jail without the least prospect of enlargement except in the issue of his lawsuit of which he had for some time past grown less and less confident every day what would become of the unfortunate if the constitution of the mind did not permit them to bring one passion into the field against another passions that operate in the human breast like poisons of a different nature extinguishing each others effect our heros grief reigned in full despotism until it was deposed by revenge during the predominancy of which he considered everything which had happened as a circumstance conducive to its gratification if i must be prisoner for life said he to himself if i must relinquish all my gay expectations let me at least have the satisfaction of clanking my chains so as to interrupt the repose of my adversary and let me search in my own breast for that peace and contentment which i have not been able to find in all the scenes of my success in being detached from the world i shall be delivered from folly and ingratitude as well as exempted from an expense which i should have found it very difficult if not impracticable to support i shall have little or no temptation to misspend my time and more undisturbed opportunity to earn my subsistence and prosecute revenge after all a jail is the best tub to which a cynic philosopher can retire in consequence of these comfortable reflections he sent a letter to mr crabtree with an account of his misfortune signifying his resolution to move himself immediately into the fleet and desiring that he would send him some understanding attorney of his acquaintance who would direct him into the steps necessary to be taken for that purpose the misanthrope upon the receipt of this intimation sent in person to a lawyer whom he accompanied to the spunginghouse whither the prisoner had by this time retired peregrine was under the auspices of his director conducted to the judges chamber where he was left in the custody of a tipstaff and after having paid for a warrant of habeas corpus by him conveyed to the fleet and delivered to the care of the warden here he was introduced to the lodge in which he was obliged to expose himself a full halfhour to the eyes of all the turnkeys and doorkeepers who took an accurate survey of his person that they might know him again at first sight and then he was turned loose into the place called the masters side having given a valuable consideration for that privilege this is a large range of building containing some hundreds of lodgingrooms for the convenience of the prisoners who pay so much per week for that accommodation in short this community is like a city detached from all communication with the neighbouring parts regulated by its own laws and furnished with peculiar conveniences for the use of the inhabitants there is a coffeehouse for the resort of gentlemen in which all sorts of liquors are kept and a public kitchen where any quantity of meat is sold at a very reasonable rate or any kind of provision boiled and roasted gratis for the poor prisoners nay there are certain servants of the public who are obliged to go to market at the pleasure of individuals without fee or reward from those who employ them nor are they cooped up so as to be excluded from the benefit of fresh air there being an open area of a considerable extent adjacent to the building on which they may exercise themselves in walking skittles bowls and a variety of other diversions according to the inclination of each our adventurer being admitted a denizen of this community found himself bewildered in the midst of strangers who by their appearance did not at all prepossess him in their favour and after having strolled about the place with his friend cadwallader repaired to the coffeehouse in order to be further informed of the peculiar customs which it was necessary for him to know there while he endeavoured to pick up intelligence from the barkeeper he was accosted by a person in canonicals who very civilly asked if he was a newcomer being answered in the affirmative he gave him the salutation of welcome to the society and with great hospitality undertook to initiate him in the constitutions of the brotherhood this humane clergyman gave him to understand that his first care ought to be that of securing a lodging telling him there was a certain number of apartments in the prison let at the same price though some were more commodious than others and that when the better sort became vacant by the removal of their possessors those who succeeded in point of seniority had the privilege of occupying the empty tenements preferable to the rest of the inhabitants howsoever respectable they might otherwise be that when the jail was very much crowded there was but one chamber allotted for two lodgers but this was not considered as any great hardship on the prisoners because in that case there was always a sufficient number of males who willingly admitted the females to a share in their apartments and beds not but the time had been when this expedient would not answer the occasion because after a couple had been quartered in every room there was a considerable residue still unprovided with lodging so that for the time being the lastcomers were obliged to take up their habitation in mount scoundrel an apartment most miserably furnished in which they lay promiscuously amidst filth and vermin until they could be better accommodated in due course of rotation peregrine hearing the description of this place began to be very impatient about his nights lodging and the parson perceiving his anxiety conducted him without loss of time to the warden who forthwith put him in possession of a paltry chamber for which he agreed to pay half a crown a week this point being settled his director gave him an account of the different methods of eating either singly in a mess or at an ordinary and advised him to choose the last as the most reputable offering to introduce him next day to the best company in the fleet who always dined together in public pickle having thanked this gentleman for his civilities and promised to be governed by his advice invited him to pass the evening at his apartment and in the meantime shut himself up with crabtree in order to deliberate upon the wreck of his affairs of all his ample fortune nothing now remained but his wardrobe which was not very sumptuous about thirty guineas in cash and the garrison which the misanthrope counselled him to convert into ready money for his present subsistence this advice however he absolutely rejected not only on account of his having already bestowed it upon hatchway during the term of his natural life but also with a view of retaining some memorial of the commodores generosity he proposed therefore to finish in this retreat the translation which he had undertaken and earn his future subsistence by labour of the same kind he desired cadwallader to take charge of his movables and send to him such linen and clothes as he should have occasion for in his confinement but among all his difficulties nothing embarrassed him so much as his faithful pipes whom he could no longer entertain in his service he knew tom had made shift to pick up a competency in the course of his ministration but that reflection though it in some measure alleviated could not wholly prevent the mortification he should suffer in parting with an affectionate adherent who was by this time become as necessary to him as one of his own members and who was so accustomed to live under his command and protection that he did not believe the fellow could reconcile himself to any other way of life crabtree in order to make him easy on that score offered to adopt him in the room of his own valet whom he would dismiss though he observed that pipes had been quite spoiled in our heros service but peregrine did not choose to lay his friend under that inconvenience knowing that his present lacquey understood and complied with all the peculiarities of his humour which pipes would never be able to study or regard he therefore determined to send him back to his shipmate hatchway with whom he had spent the fore part of his life these points being adjusted the two friends adjourned to the coffeehouse with a view of inquiring into the character of the clergyman to whose beneficence our adventurer was so much indebted they learned he was a person who had incurred the displeasure of the bishop in whose diocese he was settled and being unequal in power to his antagonist had been driven to the fleet in consequence of his obstinate opposition though he still found means to enjoy a pretty considerable income by certain irregular practices in the way of his function which income was chiefly consumed in acts of humanity to his fellowcreatures in distress his eulogium was scarce finished when he entered the room according to appointment with peregrine who ordering wine and something for supper to be carried to his apartment the triumvirate went thither and cadwallader taking his leave for the night the two fellowprisoners passed the evening very sociably our hero being entertained by his new companion with a private history of the place some particulars of which were extremely curious he told him that the person who attended them at supper bowing with the most abject servility and worshipping them every time he opened his mouth with the epithets of your lordship and your honour had a few years before been actually a captain in the guards who after having run his career in the great world had threaded every station in their community from that of a buck of the first order who swaggers about the fleet in a laced coat with a footman and w to the degree of a tapster in which he was now happily settled if you will take the trouble of going into the cooks kitchen said he you will perceive a beau metamorphosed into a turnspit and there are some hewers of wood and drawers of water in this microcosm who have had forests and fishponds of their own yet notwithstanding such a miserable reverse of fortune they are neither objects of regard nor compassion because their misfortunes are the fruits of the most vicious extravagance and they are absolutely insensible of the misery which is their lot those of our fellowsufferers who have been reduced by undeserved losses or the precipitation of inexperienced youth never fail to meet with the most brotherly assistance provided they behave with decorum and a due sense of their unhappy circumstances nor are we destitute of power to chastise the licentious who refuse to comply with the regulations of the place and disturb the peace of the community with riot and disorder justice is here impartially administered by a court of equity consisting of a select number of the most respectable inhabitants who punish all offenders with equal judgment and resolution after they have been fairly convicted of the crimes laid to their charge the clergyman having thus explained the economy of the place as well as the cause of his own confinement began to discover signs of curiosity touching our heros situation and pickle thinking he could do no less for the satisfaction of a man who had treated him in such a hospitable manner favoured him with a detail of the circumstances which produced his imprisonment at the same time gratifying his resentment against the minister which delighted in recapitulating the injuries he had received the parson who had been prepossessed in favour of our youth at first sight understanding what a considerable part he had acted on the stage of life felt his veneration increase and pleased with the opportunity of introducing a stranger of his consequence to the club left him to his repose or rather to ruminate on an event which he had not as yet seriously considered i might here in imitation of some celebrated writers furnish out a page or two with the reflections he made upon the instability of human affairs the treachery of the world and the temerity of youth and endeavour to decoy the reader into a smile by some quaint observation of my own touching the sagacious moraliser but besides that i look upon this practice as an impertinent anticipation of the perusers thoughts i have too much matter of importance upon my hands to give the reader the least reason to believe that i am driven to such paltry shifts in order to eke out the volume suffice it then to say our adventurer passed a very uneasy night not only from the thorny suggestions of his mind but likewise from the anguish of his body which suffered from the hardness of his couch as well as from the natural inhabitants thereof that did not tamely suffer his intrusion in the morning he was waked by pipes who brought upon his shoulder a portmanteau filled with necessaries according to the direction of cadwallader and tossing it down upon the floor regaled himself with a quid without the least manifestation of concern after some pause you see pipes said his master to what i have brought myself ey ey answered the valet once the vessel is ashore what signifies talking we must bear a hand to tow her off if we can if she wont budge for all the anchors and capstans aboard after we have lightened her by cutting away her masts and heaving our guns and cargo overboard why then mayhap a brisk gale of wind a tide or current setting from shore may float her again in the blast of a whistle here is two hundred and ten guineas by the tale in this here canvas bag and upon this scrap of paper no avast thats my discharge from the parish for moll trundle ey here it is an order for thirty pounds upon the whatdyecallem in the city and two tickets for twentyfive and eighteen which i lent dye see to sam studding to buy a cargo of rum when he hoisted the sign of the commodore at st catherines so saying he spread his whole stock upon the table for the acceptance of peregrine who being very much affected with this fresh instance of his attachment expressed his satisfaction at seeing he had been such a good economist and paid his wages up to that very day he thanked him for his faithful services and observing that he himself was no longer in a condition to maintain a domestic advised him to retire to the garrison where he would be kindly received by his friend hatchway to whom he would recommend him in the strongest terms pipes looked blank at this unexpected intimation to which he replied that he wanted neither pay nor provision but only to be employed as a tender and that he would not steer his course for the garrison unless his master would first take his lumber aboard pickle however peremptorily refused to touch a farthing of the money which he commanded him to put up and pipes was so mortified at his refusal that twisting the notes together he threw them into the fire without hesitation crying d the money the canvas bag with its contents would have shared the same fate had not peregrine started up and snatching the paper from the flames ordered his valet to forbear on pain of being banished for ever from his sight he told him that for the present there was a necessity for his being dismissed and he discharged him accordingly but if he would go and live quietly with the lieutenant he promised on the first favourable turn of his fortune to take him again into his service in the meantime he gave him to understand that he neither wanted nor would make use of his money which he insisted upon his pocketing immediately on pain of forfeiting all title to his favour pipes was very much chagrined at these injunctions to which he made no reply but sweeping the money into his bag stalked off in silence with a look of grief and mortification which his countenance had never exhibited before nor was the proud heart of pickle unmoved upon the occasion he could scarce suppress his sorrow in the presence of pipes and soon as he was gone it vented itself in tears having no great pleasure in conversing with his own thoughts he dressed himself with all convenient despatch being attended by one of the occasional valets of the place who had formerly been a rich mercer in the city and this operation being performed he went to breakfast at the coffeehouse where he happened to meet with his friend the clergyman and several persons of genteel appearance to whom the doctor introduced him as a new messmate by these gentlemen he was conducted to a place where they spent the forenoon in playing at fives an exercise in which our hero took singular delight and about one oclock a court was held for the trial of two delinquents who had transgressed the laws of honesty and good order the first who appeared at the bar was an attorney accused of having picked a gentlemans pocket of his handkerchief and the fact being proved by incontestable evidence he received sentence in consequence of which he was immediately carried to the public pump and subjected to a severe cascade of cold water this cause being discussed they proceeded to the trial of the other offender who was a lieutenant of a manofwar indicted for a riot which he had committed in company with a female not yet taken against the laws of the place and the peace of his fellowprisoners the culprit had been very obstreperous and absolutely refused to obey the summons with many expressions of contempt and defiance against the authority of the court upon which the constables were ordered to bring him to the bar vi et armis and he was accordingly brought before the judge after having made a most desperate resistance with a hanger by which one of the officers was dangerously wounded this outrage was such an aggravation of his crime that the court would not venture to decide upon it but remitted him to the sentence of the warden who by virtue of his dictatorial power ordered the rioter to be loaded with irons and confined in the strong room which is a dismal dungeon situated upon the side of the ditch infested with toads and vermin surcharged with noisome damps and impervious to the least ray of light justice being done upon these criminals our adventurer and his company adjourned to the ordinary which was kept at the coffeehouse and he found upon inquiry that his messmates consisted of one officer two underwriters three projectors an alchemist an attorney a parson a brace of poets a baronet and a knight of the bath the dinner though not sumptuous nor very elegantly served up was nevertheless substantial and pretty well dressed the wine was tolerable and all the guests as cheerful as if they had been utter strangers to calamity so that our adventurer began to relish the company and mix in the conversation with that sprightliness and ease which were peculiar to his disposition the repast being ended the reckoning paid and part of the gentlemen withdrawn to cards or other avocations those who remained among whom peregrine made one agreed to spend the afternoon in conversation over a bowl of punch and the liquor being produced they passed the time very socially in various topics of discourse including many curious anecdotes relating to their own affairs no man scrupled to own the nature of the debt for which he was confined unless it happened to be some piddling affair but on the contrary boasted of the importance of the sum as a circumstance that implied his having been a person of consequence in life and he who made the most remarkable escapes from bailiffs was looked upon as a man of superior genius and address among other extraordinary adventures of this kind none was more romantic than the last elopement achieved by the officer who told them he had been arrested for a debt of two hundred pounds at a time when he could not command as many pence and conveyed to the bailiffs house in which he continued a whole fortnight moving his lodgings higher and higher from time to time in proportion to the decay of his credit until from the parlour he had made a regular ascent to the garret there while he ruminated on his next step which would have been to the marshalsea and saw the night come on attended with hunger and cold the wind began to blow and the tiles of the house rattled with the storm his imagination was immediately struck with the idea of escaping unperceived amidst the darkness and noise of the tempest by creeping out of the window of his apartment and making his way over the tops of the adjoining houses glowing with this prospect he examined the passage which to his infinite mortification he found grated with iron bars on the outside but even this difficulty did not divert him from his purpose conscious of his own strength he believed himself able to make a hole through the roof which seemed to be slender and crazy and on this supposition he barricaded the door with the whole furniture of the room then setting himself to work with a poker he in a few minutes effected a passage for his hand with which he gradually stripped off the boards and tiling so as to open a sallyport for his whole body through which he fairly set himself free groping his way towards the next tenement here however he met with an unlucky accident his hat being blown off his head chanced to fall into the court just as one of the bailiffs followers was knocking at the door and this myrmidon recognizing it immediately gave the alarm to his chief who running upstairs to the garret forced open the door in a twinkling notwithstanding the precautions which the prisoner had taken and with his attendant pursued the fugitive through his own track after this chase had continued some time said the officer to the imminent danger of all three i found my progress suddenly stopped by a skylight through which i perceived seven tailors sitting at work upon a board without the least hesitation or previous notice i plunged among them with my backside foremost before they could recollect themselves from the consternation occasioned by such a strange visit i told them my situation and gave them to understand that there was no time to be lost one of the number taking the hint led me instantly downstairs and dismissed me at the street door while the bailiff and his follower arriving at the breach were deterred from entering by the brethren of my deliverer who presenting their shears like a range of chevaux de frise commanded them to retire on pain of immediate death and the catchpole rather than risk his carcase consented to discharge the debt comforting himself with the hope of making me prisoner again there however he was disappointed i kept snug and laughed at his escapewarrant until i was ordered abroad with the regiment when i conveyed myself in a hearse to gravesend where i embarked for flanders but being obliged to come over again on the recruiting service i was nabbed on another score and all the satisfaction my first captor has been able to obtain is a writ of detainer which i believe will fix me in this place until the parliament in its great goodness shall think proper to discharge my debts by a new act of insolvency everybody owned that the captains success was equal to the hardiness of his enterprise which was altogether in the style of a soldier but one of the merchants observed that he must have been a bailiff of small experience who would trust a prisoner of that consequence in such an unguarded place if the captain said he had fallen into the hands of such a cunning rascal as the fellow that arrested me he would not have found it such an easy matter to escape for the manner in which i was caught is perhaps the most extraordinary that ever was practised in these realms you must know gentlemen i suffered such losses by insuring vessels during the war that i was obliged to stop payment though my expectations were such as encouraged me to manage one branch of business without coming to an immediate composition with my creditors and in short i received consignments from abroad as usual that i might not be subject to the visits of those catchpoles i never stirred abroad but turning my first floor into a warehouse ordered all my goods to be hoisted up by a crane fixed to the upper story of my house divers were the stratagems practised by those ingenious ferrets with a view of decoying me from the walls of my fortification i received innumerable messages from people who wanted to see me at certain taverns upon particular business i was summoned into the country to see my own mother who was said to be at the point of death a gentlewoman one night was taken in labour on my threshold at another time i was disturbed with the cry of murder in the street and once i was alarmed by a false fire but being still upon my guard i baffled all their attempts and thought myself quite secure from their invention when one of those bloodhounds inspired i believe by the devil himself contrived a snare by which i was at last entrapped he made it his business to inquire into the particulars of my traffic and understanding that among other things there were several chests of florence entered at the custom house on my behalf he ordered himself to be enclosed in a box of the same dimensions with airholes in the bottom for the benefit of breathing and marked upon the cover and being conveyed to my door in a cart among other goods was in his turn hoisted up to my warehouse where i stood with a hammer in order to open the chests that i might compare the contents with the invoice you may guess my surprise and consternation when upon uncovering the box i saw a bailiff rearing up his head like lazarus from the grave and heard him declare that he had a writ against me for a thousand pounds indeed i aimed the hammer at his head but in the hurry of my confusion missed my mark before i could repeat the blow he started up with great agility and executed his office in sight of several evidences whom he had assembled in the street for that purpose so that i could not possibly disentangle myself from the toil without incurring an escapewarrant from which i had no protection but had i known the contents of the chest by all thats good i would have ordered my porter to raise it up as high as the crane would permit and then have cut the rope by accident that expedient said the knight with the red ribbon would have discouraged him from such hazardous attempts for the future and would have been an example in terrorem of all his brethren the story puts me in mind of a deliverance achieved by tom hackabout a very stout honest fellow an old acquaintance of mine who had been so famous for maiming bailiffs that another gentleman having been illused at a spunginghouse no sooner obtained his liberty than with a view of being revenged upon the landlord he for five shillings bought one of toms notes which sold at a very large discount and taking out a writ upon it put it into the hands of the bailiff who had used him ill the catchpole after a diligent search had an opportunity of executing the writ upon the defendant who without ceremony broke one of his arms fractured his skull and belaboured him in such a manner that he lay without sense or motion on the spot by such exploits this hero became so formidable that no single bailiff would undertake to arrest him so that he appeared in all public places untouched at length however several officers of the marshalsea court entered into a confederacy against him and two of the number attended by three desperate followers ventured to arrest him one day in the strand near hungerfordmarket he found it impossible to make resistance because the whole gang sprung upon him at once like so many tigers and pinioned his arms so fast that he could not wag a finger perceiving himself fairly overpowered he desired to be conducted forthwith to jail and was stowed in a boat accordingly by the time they had reached the middle of the river he found means to overset the wherry by accident and every man disregarding the prisoner consulted his own safety as for hackabout to whom that element was quite familiar he mounted astride upon the keel of the boat which was uppermost and exhorted the bailiffs to swim for their lives protesting before god that they had no other chance to be saved the watermen were immediately taken up by some of their own friends who far from yielding any assistance to the catchpoles kept aloof and exulted in their calamity in short two of the five went to the bottom and never saw the light of gods sun and the other three with great difficulty saved themselves by laying hold on the rudder of a dungbarge to which they were carried by the stream while tom with great deliberation swam across to the surrey shore after this achievement he was so much dreaded by the whole fraternity that they shivered at the very mention of his name and this character which some people would think an advantage to a man in debt was the greatest misfortune that could possibly happen to him because no tradesman would give him credit for the least trifle on the supposition that he could not indemnify himself in the common course of law the parson did not approve of mr hackabouts method of escaping which he considered as a very unchristian attempt upon the lives of his fellowsubjects it is enough said he that we elude the laws of our country without murdering the officers of justice for my own part i can lay my hand upon my heart and safely say that i forgive from my soul the fellow by whom i was made a prisoner although the circumstances of his behaviour were treacherous wicked and profane you must know mr pickle i was one day called into my chapel in order to join a couple in the holy bands of matrimony and my affairs being at that time so situated as to lay me under apprehensions of an arrest i cautiously surveyed the man through a lattice which was made for that purpose before i would venture to come within his reach he was clothed in a seamans jacket and trousers and had such an air of simplicity in his countenance as divested me of all suspicion i therefore without further scruple trusted myself in his presence began to exercise the duty of my function and had actually performed one half of the ceremony when the supposed woman pulling out a paper from her bosom exclaimed with a masculine voice sir you are my prisoner i have got a writ against you for five hundred pounds i was thunderstruck at this declaration not so much on account of my own misfortune which thank heaven i can bear with patience and resignation as at the impiety of the wretch first in disguising such a worldly aim under the cloak of religion and secondly in prostituting the service when there was no occasion for so doing his design having previously taken effect yet i forgive him poor soul because he knew not what he did and i hope you sir simple will exert the same christian virtue towards the man by whom you were likewise overreached oh d the rascal cried the knight were i his judge he should be condemned to flames everlasting a villain to disgrace me in such a manner before almost all the fashionable company in town our hero expressing a curiosity to know the particulars of this adventure the knight gratified his desire by telling him that one evening while he was engaged in a party of cards at a drum in the house of a certain lady of quality he was given to understand by one of the servants that a stranger very richly dressed was just arrived in a chair preceded by five footmen with flambeaux and that he refused to come upstairs until he should be introduced by sir simple upon this notice continued the knight i judged it was some of my quality friends and having obtained her ladyships permission to bring him up went down to the hall and perceived a person whom to the best of my recollection i had never seen before however his appearance was so magnificent that i could not harbour the least suspicion of his true quality and seeing me advance he saluted me with a very genteel bow observing that though he had not the honour of my acquaintance he could not dispense with waiting upon me even on that occasion in consequence of a letter which he had received from a particular friend so saying he put a paper into my hand intimating that he had got a writ against me for ten thousand pounds and that it would be my interest to submit without resistance for he was provided with a guard of twenty men who surrounded the door in different disguises determined to secure me against all opposition enraged at the scoundrels finesse and trusting to the assistance of the real footmen assembled in the hall so you are a rascally bailiff said i who have assumed the garb of a gentleman in order to disturb her ladyships company take this fellow my lads and roll him in the kennel here are ten guineas for your trouble these words were no sooner pronounced than i was seized lifted up placed in a chair and carried off in the twinkling of an eye not but that the servants of the house and some other footmen made a motion towards my rescue and alarmed all the company above but the bailiff affirming with undaunted effrontery that i was taken up upon an affair of state and so many people appearing in his behalf the countess would not suffer the supposed messenger to be insulted and he carried me to the county jail without further let or molestation chapter xcviii pickle seems tolerably well reconciled to his cage and is by the clergyman entertained with the memoirs of a noted personage whom he sees by accident in the fleet the knight had scarce finished his narrative when our hero was told that a gentleman in the coffeeroom wanted to see him and when he went thither he found his friend crabtree who had transacted all his affairs according to the determination of the preceding day and now gave him an account of the remarks he overheard on the subject of his misfortune for the manner of the arrest was so public and extraordinary that those who were present immediately propagated it among their acquaintance and it was that same evening discoursed upon at several tea and card tables with this variation from the truth that the debt amounted to twelve thousand instead of twelve hundred pounds from which circumstance it was conjectured that peregrine was a bite from the beginning who had found credit on account of his effrontery and appearance and imposed himself upon the town as a young gentleman of fortune they rejoiced therefore at his calamity which they considered as a just punishment for his fraud and presumption and began to review certain particulars of his conduct that plainly demonstrated him to be a rank adventurer long before he had arrived at this end of his career pickle who now believed his glory was set for ever received this intelligence with that disdain which enables a man to detach himself effectually from the world and with great tranquility gave the misanthrope an entertaining detail of what he had seen and heard since their last parting while they amused themselves in this manner over a dish of coffee they were joined by the parson who congratulated our hero upon his bearing mischance with such philosophic quite and began to regale the two friends with some curious circumstances relating to the private history of the several prisoners as they happened to come in at length a gentleman entered at sight of whom the clergyman rose up and saluted him with a most reverential bow which was graciously returned by the stranger who with a young man that attended him retired to the other end of the room they were no sooner out of hearing than the communicative priest desired his company to take particular notice of this person to whom he had paid his respects that man said he is this day one of the most flagrant instances of neglected virtue which the world can produce over and above a cool discerning head fraught with uncommon learning and experience he is possessed of such fortitude and resolution as no difficulties can discourage and no danger impair and so indefatigable in his humanity that even now while he is surrounded with such embarrassments as would distract the brain of an ordinary mortal he has added considerably to his encumbrances by taking under his protection that young gentleman who induced by his character appealed to his benevolence for redress of the grievances under which he labours from the villainy of guardian peregrines curiosity being excited by this encomium asked the name of this generous patron of which when he was informed i am no stranger said he to the fame of that gentleman who has made a considerable noise in the world on account of that great cause he undertook in defence of an unhappy orphan and since he is a person of such an amiable disposition i am heartily sorry to find that his endeavours have not met with that successful issue which their good fortune in the beginning seemed to promise indeed the circumstance of his espousing that cause was so uncommon and romantic and the depravity of the human heart so universal that some people unacquainted with his real character imagined his views were altogether selfish and some were not wanting who affirmed he was a mere adventurer nevertheless i must do him the justice to own i have heard some of the most virulent of those who were concerned on the other side of the question bear testimony in his favour observing that he was deceived into the expense of the whole by the plausible story which at first engaged his compassion your description of his character confirms me in the same opinion though i am quite ignorant of the affair the particulars of which i should be glad to learn as well as the genuine account of his own life many circumstances of which are by his enemies i believe egregiously misrepresented sir answered the priest that is a piece of satisfaction which i am glad to find myself capable of giving you i have had the pleasure of being acquainted with mr m from his youth and everything which i shall relate concerning him you may depend upon as a fact which hath fallen under my own cognizance or been vouched upon the credit of undoubted evidence mr m s father was a minister of the established church of scotland descended from a very ancient clan and his mother nearly related to a noble family in the northern part of that kingdom while the son was boarded at a public school where he made good progress in the latin tongue his father died and he was left an orphan to the care of an uncle who finding him determined against any servile employment kept him at school that he might prepare himself for the university with a view of being qualified for his fathers profession here his imagination was so heated by the warlike achievements he found recorded in the latin authors such as caesar curtius and buchanan that he was seized with an irresistible thirst of military glory and desire of trying his fortune in the army his majestys troops taking the field in consequence of the rebellion which happened in the year seventeen hundred and fifteen this young adventurer thinking no life equal to that of a soldier found means to furnish himself with a fusil and bayonet and leaving the school repaired to the camp near stirling with a view of signalizing himself in the field though he was at that time but just turned of thirteen he offered his service to several officers in hope of being enlisted in their companies but they would not receive him because they rightly concluded that he was some schoolboy broke loose without the knowledge or consent of his relations notwithstanding this discouragement he continued in camp curiously prying into every part of the service and such was the resolution conspicuous in him even at such a tender age that after his small finances were exhausted he persisted in his design and because he would not make his wants known actually subsisted for several days on hips haws and sloes and other spontaneous fruits which he gathered in the woods and fields meanwhile he never failed to be present when any regiment or corps of men were drawn out to be exercised and reviewed and accompanied them in all their evolutions which he had learned to great perfection by observing the companies which were quartered in the place where he was at school this eagerness and perseverance attracted the notice of many officers who after having commended his spirit and zeal pressed him to return to his parents and even threatened to expel him from the camp if he would not comply with their advice these remonstrances having no other effect than that of warning him to avoid his monitors they thought proper to alter their behaviour towards him took him into their protection and even into their mess and what above all other marks of favour pleased the young soldier most permitted him to incorporate in the battalion and take his turn of duty with the other men in this happy situation he was discovered by a relation of his mother who was a captain in the army and who used all his authority and influence in persuading m to return to school but finding him deaf to his admonitions and threats he took him under his own care and when the army marched to dumblane left him at stirling with express injunctions to keep himself within the walls he temporized with his kinsman fearing that should he seem refractory the captain would have ordered him to be shut up in the castle inflamed with the desire of seeing a battle his relation no sooner marched off the ground than he mixed in with another regiment to which his former patrons belonged and proceeded to the field where he distinguished himself even at that early time of life by his gallantry in helping to retrieve a pair of colours belonging to m ns regiment so that after the affair he was presented to the duke of argyll and recommended strongly to brigadier grant who invited him into his regiment and promised to provide for him with the first opportunity but that gentleman in a little time lost his command upon the dukes disgrace and the regiment was ordered for ireland being given to colonel nassau whose favour the young volunteer acquired to such a degree that he was recommended to the king for his ensigncy which in all probability he would have obtained had not the regiment been unluckily reduced in consequence of this reduction which happened in the most severe season of the year he was obliged to return to his own country through infinite hardships to which he was exposed from the narrowness of his circumstances and continuing still enamoured of a military life he entered into the regiment of scots greys at that time commanded by the late sir james campbell who being acquainted with his family and character encouraged him with a promise of speedy preferment in this corps he remained three years during which he had no opportunity of seeing actual service except at the affair of glensheel and this life of insipid quiet must have hung heavy upon a youth of m s active disposition had not he found exercise for the mind in reading books of amusement history voyages and geography together with those that treated of the art of war ancient and modem for which he contracted such an eager appetite that he used to spend sixteen hours a day in this employment about that time he became acquainted with a gentleman of learning and taste who observing his indefatigable application and insatiable thirst after knowledge took upon himself the charge of superintending his studies and by the direction of such an able guide the young soldier converted his attention to a more solid and profitable course of reading so inordinate was his desire of making speedy advances in the paths of learning that within the compass of three months he diligently perused the writings of locke and malebranche and made himself master of the first six and of the eleventh and twelfth books of euclids elements he considered puffendorf and grotius with uncommon care acquired a tolerable degree of knowledge in the french language and his imagination was so captivated with the desire of learning that seeing no prospect of a war or views of being provided for in the service he quitted the army and went through a regular course of university education having made such progress in his studies he resolved to qualify himself for the church and acquired such a stock of school divinity under the instructions of a learned professor at edinburgh that he more than once mounted the rostrum in the public hall and held forth with uncommon applause but being discouraged from a prosecution of his plan by the unreasonable austerity of some of the scotch clergy by whom the most indifferent and innocent words and actions were often misconstrued into levity and misconduct he resolved to embrace the first favourable opportunity of going abroad being inflamed with the desire of seeing foreign countries and actually set out for holland where for the space of two years he studied the roman law with the law of nature and nations under the famous professors tolieu and barbeyrac having thus finished his school education he set out for paris with a view to make himself perfect in the french language and learn such useful exercises as might be acquired with the wretched remnant of his slender estate which was by that time reduced very low in his journey through the netherlands he went to namur and paid his respects to bishop strickland and general collier by whom he was received with great civility in consequence of letters of recommendation with which he was provided from the hague and the old general assured him of his protection and interest for a pair of colours if he was disposed to enter into the dutch service though he was by that time pretty well cured of his military quixotism he would not totally decline the generous proffer for which he thanked him in the most grateful terms telling the general that he would pay his duty to him on his return from france and then if he could determine upon reengaging in the army should think himself highly honoured in being under his command after a stay of two months in flanders he proceeded to paris and far from taking up his habitation in the suburbs of st germain according to the custom of english travellers he hired a private lodging on the other side of the river and associated chiefly with french officers who their youthful sallies being over are allowed to be the politest gentlemen of that kingdom in this scheme he found his account so much that he could not but wonder at the folly of his countrymen who lose the main scope of their going abroad by spending their time and fortune idly with one another during his residence in holland he had made himself acquainted with the best authors in the french language so that he was able to share in their conversation a circumstance from which he found great benefit for it not only improved him in his knowledge of that tongue but also tended to the enlargement of his acquaintance in the course of which he contracted intimacies in some families of good fashion especially those of the long robe which would have enabled him to pass his time very agreeably had he been a little easier in point of fortune but his finances notwithstanding the most rigid economy being in a few months reduced to a very low ebb the prospect of indigence threw a damp upon all his pleasures though he never suffered himself to be thereby in any degree dispirited being in that respect of so happy a disposition that conscious poverty or abundance made very slight impressions upon his mind this consumption of his cash however involved him in some perplexity and he deliberated with himself whether he should return to general collier or repair to london where he might possibly fall into some business not unbecoming a gentleman though he was very much mortified to find himself incapable of gratifying an inordinate desire which possessed him of making the grand tour or at least of visiting the southern parts of france while he thus hesitated between different suggestions he was one morning visited by a gentleman who had sought and cultivated his friendship and for whom he had done a good office in supporting him with spirit against a brutal german with whom he had an affair of honour this gentleman came to propose a party for a fortnight to fontainebleau where the court then was and the proposal being declined by m with more than usual stiffness his friend was very urgent to know the reason of his refusal and at length with some confusion said perhaps your finances are low m replied that he had wherewithal to defray the expense of his journey to london where he could be furnished with a fresh supply and this answer was no sooner made than the other taking him by the hand my dear friend said he i am not unacquainted with your affairs and would have offered you my credit long ago if i had thought it would be acceptable even now i do not pretend to give you money but desire and insist upon it that you will accept of the loan of these two pieces of paper to be repaid when you marry a woman with a fortune of twenty thousand pounds or obtain an employment of a thousand a year so saying he presented him with two actions of above two thousand livres each m was astonished at this unexpected instance of generosity in a stranger and with suitable acknowledgment peremptorily refused to incur such an obligation but at length he was by dint of importunity and warm expostulation prevailed upon to accept one of the actions on condition that the gentleman would take his note for the sum and this he absolutely rejected until m promised to draw upon him for double the value or more in case he should at any time want a further supply this uncommon act of friendship and generosity afterwards had an opportunity to repay tenfold though he could not help regretting the occasion on his friends account that worthy man having by placing too much confidence in a villainous lawyer and a chain of other misfortunes involved himself and his amiable lady in a labyrinth of difficulties which threatened the total ruin of his family m felt the inexpressible satisfaction of delivering his benefactor from the snare being thus reinforced by the generosity of his friend m resolved to execute his former plan of seeing the south of france together with the seaports of spain as far as cadiz from whence he proposed to take a passage for london by sea and with this view sent forward his trunks by the diligence to lyons determined to ride post in order to enjoy a better view of the country and for the conveniency of stopping at those places where there was anything remarkable to be seen or inquired into while he was employed in taking leave of his parisian friends who furnished him with abundant recommendation a gentleman of his own country who spoke little or no french hearing of his intention begged the favour of accompanying him in his expedition with this new companion therefore he set out for lyons where he was perfectly well received by the intendant and some of the best families of the place in consequence of his letters of recommendation and after a short stay in that city proceeded down the rhone to avignon in what is called the coche deau then visiting the principal towns of dauphiny languedoc and provence he returned to the delightful city of marseilles where he and his fellowtraveller were so much captivated by the serenity of the air the goodnature and hospitality of the sprightly inhabitants that they never dreamed of changing their quarters during the whole winter and part of the spring here he acquired the acquaintance of the marquis dargens attorneygeneral in the parliament of aix and of his eldest son who now makes so great a figure in the literary world and when the affair of father girard and mademoiselle cadiere began to make a noise he accompanied these two gentlemen to toulon where the marquis was ordered to take a precognition of the facts on his return to marseilles he found a certain noble lord of great fortune under the direction of a swiss governor who had accommodated him with two of his own relations of the same country by way of companions together with five servants in his train they being absolute strangers in the place m introduced them to the intendant and several other good families and had the good fortune to be so agreeable to his lordship that he proposed and even pressed him to live with him in england as a friend and companion and to take upon him the superintendence of his affairs in which case he would settle upon him four hundred a year for life this proposal was too advantageous to be slighted by a person of no fortune or fixed establishment he therefore made no difficulty of closing with it but as his lordships departure was fixed to a short day and he urged him to accompany him to paris and from thence to england m thought it would be improper and indecent to interfere with the office of his governor who might take umbrage at his favour and therefore excused himself from a compliance with his lordships request until his minority should be expired as he was within a few months of being of age however he repeated his importunities so earnestly and the governor joined in the request with such appearance of cordiality that he was prevailed upon to comply with their joint desire and in a few days set out with them for paris by the way of lyons but before they had been three days in the city m perceived a total change in the behaviour of the swiss and his two relations who in all probability became jealous of his influence with his lordship and he no sooner made this discovery than he resolved to withdraw himself from such a disagreeable participation of that young noblemans favour he therefore in spite of all his lordships entreaties and remonstrances quitted him for the present alleging as a pretext that he had a longing desire to see switzerland and the banks of the rhine and promising to meet him again in england this his intention being made known to the governor and his friends their countenances immediately cleared up their courtesy and complaisance returned and they even furnished him with letters for geneva lausanne bern and soleures in consequence of which he met with unusual civilities at these places having made this tour with his scotch friend who came up to him before he left lyons and visited the most considerable towns on both sides of the rhine and the courts of the electors palatine mentz and cologne he arrived in holland and from thence through the netherlands repaired to london where he found my lord just returned from paris his lordship received him with expressions of uncommon joy would not suffer him to stir from him for several days and introduced him to his relations m accompanied his lordship from london to his country seat where he was indeed treated with great friendship and confidence and consulted in everything but the noble peer never once made mention of the annuity which he had promised to settle upon him nor did m remind him of it because he conceived it was his affair to fulfil his engagements of his own accord m being tired of the manner of living at this place made an excursion to bath where he stayed about a fortnight to partake of the diversions and upon his return found his lordship making dispositions for another journey to paris surprised at this sudden resolution he endeavoured to dissuade him from it but his remonstrances were rendered ineffectual by the insinuations of a foreigner who had come over with him and filled his imagination with extravagant notions of pleasure infinitely superior to any which he could enjoy while he was in the trammels and under the restraints of a governor he therefore turned a deaf ear to all m s arguments and entreated him to accompany him in the journey but this gentleman foreseeing that a young man like my lord of strong passions and easy to be misled would in all probability squander away great sums of money in a way that would neither do credit to himself or to those who were concerned with him resisted all his solicitations on pretence of having business of consequence at london and afterwards had reason to be extremely well pleased with his own conduct in this particular before he set out on this expedition m in justice to himself reminded him of the proposal which he had made to him at marseilles desiring to know if he had altered his design in that particular in which case he would turn his thoughts some other way as he would not in the least be thought to intrude or pin himself upon any man my lord protested in the most solemn manner that he still continued in his former resolution and again beseeching him to bear him company into france promised that everything should be settled to his satisfaction upon their return to england m however still persisted in his refusal for the abovementioned reasons and though he never heard more of the annuity he nevertheless continued to serve his lordship with his advice and good offices ever after particularly in directing his choice to an alliance with a lady of eminent virtue the daughter of a noble lord more conspicuous for his shining parts than the splendour of his titles a circumstance upon which he always reflected with particular satisfaction as well on account of the extraordinary merit of the lady as because it vested in her children a considerable part of that great estate which of right belonged to her grandmother and afterwards put him in a way to retrieve his estate from a heavy load of debt he had contracted when my lord set out on his paris expedition the money m had received from his generous friend at paris was almost reduced to the last guinea he had not yet reaped the least benefit from his engagements with his lordship and disdaining to ask for a supply from him he knew not how to subsist with any degree of credit till his return this uncomfortable prospect was the more disagreeable to him as at that time of life he was much inclined to appear in the gay world had contracted a taste for plays operas and other public diversions and acquired an acquaintance with many people of good fashion which could not be maintained without a considerable expense in this emergency he thought he could not employ his idle time more profitably than in translating from foreign languages such books as were then chiefly in vogue and upon application to a friend who was a man of letters he was furnished with as much business of that kind as he could possibly manage and wrote some pamphlets on the reigning controversies of that time that had the good fortune to please he was also concerned in a monthly journal of literature and the work was carried on by the two friends jointly though m did not at all appear in the partnership by these means he not only spent his mornings in useful exercise but supplied himself with money for what the french call the menus plaisirs during the whole summer he frequented all the assemblies in and about london and considerably enlarged his acquaintance among the fair sex he had upon his first arrival in england become acquainted with a lady at an assembly not far from london and though at that time he had no thoughts of extending his views farther than the usual gallantry of the place he met with such distinguishing marks of her regard in the sequel and was so particularly encouraged by the advice of another lady with whom he had been intimate in france and who was now of their parties that he could not help entertaining hopes of making an impression upon the heart of his agreeable partner who was a young lady of an ample fortune and great expectations he therefore cultivated her good graces with all the assiduity and address of which he was master and succeeded so well in his endeavours that after a due course of attendance and the death of an aunt by which she received an accession of fortune to the amount of three and twenty thousand pounds he ventured to declare his passion and she not only heard him with patience and approbation but also replied in terms adequate to his warmest wish finding himself so favourably received he pressed her to secure his happiness by marriage but to this proposal she objected the recency of her kinswomans death which would have rendered such a step highly indecent and the displeasure of her other relations from whom she had still greater expectations and who at that time importuned her to marry a cousin of her own whom she could not like however that m might have no cause to repine at her delay she freely entered with him into an intimacy of correspondence during which nothing could have added to their mutual felicity which was the more poignant and refined from the mysterious and romantic manner of their enjoying it for though he publicly visited her as an acquaintance his behaviour on these occasions was always so distant respectful and reserved that the rest of the company could not possibly suspect the nature of their reciprocal attachment in consequence of which they used to have private interviews unknown to every soul upon earth except her maid who was necessarily entrusted with the secret in this manner they enjoyed the conversation of each other for above twelve months without the least interruption and though the stability of mr m s fortune depended entirely upon their marriage yet as he perceived his mistress so averse to it he never urged it with vehemence nor was at all anxious on that score being easily induced to defer a ceremony which as he then thought could in no shape have added to their satisfaction though he hath since altered his sentiments be that as it will his indulgent mistress in order to set his mind at ease in that particular and in full confidence of his honour insisted on his accepting a deed of gift of her whole fortune in consideration of her intended marriage and after some difficulty he was prevailed upon to receive this proof of her esteem well knowing that it would still be in his power to return the obligation though she often entreated him to take upon himself the entire administration of her finances and upon divers occasions pressed him to accept of large sums he never once abused her generous disposition or solicited her for money except for some humane purpose which she was always more ready to fulfil than he to propose in the course of this correspondence he became acquainted with some of her female relations and among the rest with a young lady so eminently adorned with all the qualifications of mind and person that notwithstanding all his philosophy and caution he could not behold and converse with her without being deeply smitten with her charms he did all in his power to discourage this dangerous invasion in the beginning and to conceal the least symptom of it from her relation he summoned all his reflection to his aid and thinking it would be base and dishonest to cherish any sentiment repugnant to the affection which he owed to a mistress who had placed such unlimited confidence in him he attempted to stifle the infant flame by avoiding the amiable inspirer of it but the passion had taken too deep a root in his heart to be so easily extirpated his absence from the dear object increased the impatience of his love the intestine conflict between that and gratitude deprived him of his rest and appetite he was in a short time emaciated by continual watching anxiety and want of nourishment and so much altered from his usual cheerfulness that his mistress being surprised and alarmed at the change which from the symptoms she judged was owing to some uneasiness of mind took all imaginable pains to discover the cause in all probability it did not escape her penetration for she more than once asked if he was in love with her cousin protesting that far from being an obstacle to his happiness she would in that case be an advocate for his passion however this declaration was never made without manifest signs of anxiety and uneasiness which made such an impression upon the heart of m that he resolved to sacrifice his happiness and even his life rather than take any step which might be construed into an injury or insult to a person who had treated him with such generosity and goodness in consequence of this resolution he formed another which was to go abroad under pretence of recovering his health but in reality to avoid the temptation as well as the suspicion of being inconstant and in this design he was confirmed by his physician who actually thought him in the first stage of a consumption and therefore advised him to repair to the south of france he communicated his design with the doctors opinion to the lady who agreed to it with much less difficulty than he found in conquering his own reluctance at parting with the dear object of his love the consent of his generous mistress being obtained he waited upon her with the instrument whereby she had made the conveyance of her fortune to him and all his remonstrances being insufficient to persuade her to take it back he cancelled it in her presence and placed it in that state upon her toilet while she was dressing whereupon she shed a torrent of tears saying she now plainly perceived that he wanted to tear himself from her and that his affections were settled upon another he was sensibly affected by this proof of her concern and endeavoured to calm the perturbation of her mind by vowing eternal fidelity and pressing her to accept of his hand in due form before his departure by these means her transports were quieted for the present and the marriage deferred for the same prudential reasons which had hitherto prevented it matters being thus compromised and the day fixed for his departure she together with her faithful maid one morning visited him for the first time at his own lodgings and after breakfast desiring to speak with him in private he conducted her into another room where assuming an unusual gravity of aspect my dear m said she you are now going to leave me and god alone knows if ever we shall meet again therefore if you really love me with that tenderness which you profess you will accept of this mark of my friendship and unalterable affection it will at least be a provision for your journey and if an accident should befall me before i have the happiness of receiving you again into my arms i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that you are not altogether without resource so saying she put an embroidered pocketbook into his hand he expressed the high sense he had of her generosity and affection in the most pathetic terms and begged leave to suspend his acceptance until he should know the contents of her present which was so extraordinary that he absolutely refused to receive it he was however by her repeated entreaties in a manner compelled to receive about onehalf and she afterwards insisted upon his taking a reinforcement of a considerable sum for the expense of his journey having stayed with her ten days beyond the time he had fixed for his departure and settled the method of their correspondence he took his leave with a heart full of sorrow anxiety and distraction produced from the different suggestions of his duty and love he then set out for france and after a short stay at paris proceeded to aix in provence and from thence to marseilles at which two places he continued for some months but nothing he met with being able to dissipate those melancholy ideas which still preyed upon his imagination and affected his spirits he endeavoured to elude them with a succession of new objects and with that view persuaded a counsellor of the parliament of aix a man of great worth learning and goodhumour to accompany him in making a tour of those parts of france which he had not yet seen on their return from this excursion they found at aix an italian abbe a person of character and great knowledge of men and books who having travelled all over germany and france was so far on his return to his own country m having by means of his friend the counsellor contracted an acquaintance with this gentleman and being desirous of seeing some parts of italy particularly the carnival at venice they set out together from marseilles in a tartan for genoa coasting it all the way and lying on shore every night having shown him what was most remarkable in this city his friend the abbe was so obliging as to conduct him through tuscany and the most remarkable cities in lombardy to venice where m insisted upon defraying the expense of the whole tour in consideration of the abbes complaisance which had been of infinite service to him in the course of this expedition having remained five weeks at venice he was preparing to set out for rome with some english gentlemen whom he had met by accident when he was all of a sudden obliged to change his resolution by some disagreeable letters which he received from london he had from his first departure corresponded with his generous though inconstant mistress with a religious exactness and punctuality nor was she for some time less observant of the agreement they had made nevertheless she by degrees became so negligent and cold in her expression and so slack in her correspondence that he could not help observing and upbraiding her with such indifference and her endeavours to palliate it were supported by pretexts so frivolous as to be easily seen through by a lover of very little discernment while he tortured himself with conjectures about the cause of this unexpected change he received such intelligence from england as when joined with what he himself had perceived by her manner of writing left him little or no room to doubt of her fickleness and inconstancy nevertheless as he knew by experience that informations of that kind are not to be entirely relied upon he resolved to be more certainly apprised and for that end departed immediately for london by the way of tyrol bavaria alsace and paris on his arrival in england he learned with infinite concern that his intelligence had not been at all exaggerated and his sorrow was inexpressible to find a person endowed with so many other noble and amiable qualities seduced into an indiscretion that of necessity ruined the whole plan which had been concerted between them for their mutual happiness she made several attempts by letters and interviews to palliate her conduct and soften him into a reconciliation but his honour being concerned he remained deaf to all her entreaties and proposals nevertheless i have often heard him say that he could not help loving her and revering the memory of a person to whose generosity and goodness he owed his fortune and one whose foibles were overbalanced by a thousand good qualities he often insisted on making restitution but far from complying with that proposal she afterwards often endeavoured to lay him under yet greater obligations of the same kind and importuned him with the warmest solicitations to renew their former correspondence which he as often declined m took this instance of the inconstancy of the sex so much to heart that he had almost resolved for the future to keep clear of all engagements for life and returned to paris in order to dissipate his anxiety where he hired an apartment in one of the academies in the exercises whereof he took singular delight during his residence at this place he had the good fortune to ingratiate himself with a great general a descendant of one of the most ancient and illustrious families in france having attracted his notice by some remarks he had written on folards polybius which were accidentally shown to that great man by one of his aidesdecamp who was a particular friend of m the favour he had thus acquired was strengthened by his assiduities and attention upon his return to london he sent some of handels newest compositions to the prince who was particularly fond of that gentlemans productions together with clarks edition of caesar and in the spring of the same year before the french army took the field he was honoured with a most obliging letter from the prince inviting him to come over if he wanted to see the operations of the campaign and desiring he would give himself no trouble about his equipage m having still some remains of a military disposition and this to be a more favourable opportunity than any he should ever meet with again readily embraced the offer and sacrificed the soft delights of love which at that time he enjoyed without control to an eager laborious and dangerous curiosity in that and the following campaign during which he was present at the siege of philipsburgh and several other actions he enlarged his acquaintance among the french officers especially those of the graver sort who had a taste for books and literature and the friendship and interest of those gentlemen were afterwards of singular service to him though in an affair altogether foreign from their profession he had all along made diligent inquiry into the trade and manufactures of the countries through which he had occasion to travel more particularly those of holland england and france and as he was well acquainted with the revenue and farms of this last kingdom he saw with concern the great disadvantages under which our tobacco trade the most considerable branch of our commerce with that people was carried on what inconsiderable returns were made to the planters out of the low price given by the french company and how much it was in the power of that company to reduce it still lower m had formed a scheme to remedy this evil so far as it related to the national loss or gain by not permitting the duty of one penny in the pound old subsidy to be drawn back on tobacco reexported he demonstrated to the ministry of that time that so inconsiderable a duty could not in the least diminish the demand from abroad which was the only circumstance to be apprehended and that the yearly produce of that revenue would amount to one hundred and twenty thousand pounds without one shilling additional expense to the public but the ministry having the excise scheme then in contemplation could think of no other till that should be tried and that project having miscarried he renewed his application when they approved of his scheme in every particular but discovered a surprising backwardness to carry it into execution his expectations in this quarter being disappointed he by the interposition of his friends presented a plan to the french company in which he set forth the advantages that would accrue to themselves from fixing the price and securing that sort of tobacco which best suited the taste of the public and their manufacture and finally proposed to furnish them with any quantity at the price which they paid in the port of london after some dispute they agreed to this proposal and contracted with him for fifteen thousand hogsheads a year for which they obliged themselves to pay ready money on its arrival in any one or more convenient ports in the south or western coasts of great britain that he should please to fix upon for that purpose m no sooner obtained this contract than he immediately set out for america in order to put it in execution and by way of companion carried with him a little french abbe a man of humour wit and learning with whom he had been long acquainted and for whom he had done many good offices on his arrival in virginia which opportunely happened at a time when all the gentlemen were assembled in the capital of that province he published a memorial representing the disadvantages under which their trade was carried on the true method of redressing their own grievances in that respect and proposing to contract with them for the yearly quantity of fifteen thousand hogsheads of such tobacco as was fit for the french market at the price which he demonstrated to be considerably greater than that which they had formerly received this remonstrance met with all the success and encouragement he could expect the principal planters seeing their own interest concerned readily assented to the proposal which through their influence was also relished by the rest and the only difficulty that remained related to the security for payment of the bills on the arrival of the tobacco in england and to the time stipulated for the continuance of the contract in order to remove these objections mr m returned to europe and found the french company of farmers disposed to agree to everything he desired for facilitating the execution of the contract and perfectly well pleased with the sample which he had already sent but his good friend the abbe whom he had left behind him in america by an unparalleled piece of treachery found means to overturn the whole project he secretly wrote a memorial to the company importing that he found by experience m could afford to furnish them at a much lower price than that which they had agreed to give and that by being in possession of the contract for five years as was intended according to the proposal he would have the company so much in his power that they must afterwards submit to any price he should please to impose and that if they thought him worth of such a trust he would undertake to furnish them at an easier rate in conjunction with some of the leading men in virginia and maryland with whom he said he had already concerted measures for that purpose the company were so much alarmed at these insinuations that they declined complying with mr m s demands until the abbes return and though they afterwards used all their endeavours to persuade him to be concerned with that little traitor in his undertaking by which he might still have been a very considerable gainer he resisted all their solicitations and plainly told them in the abbes presence that he would never prostitute his own principles so far as to enter into engagements of any kind with a person of his character much less in a scheme that had a manifest tendency to lower the market price of tobacco in england thus ended a project the most extensive simple and easy and as appeared by the trial made the best calculated to raise an immense fortune of any that was ever undertaken or planned by a private person a project in the execution of which m had the good of the public and the glory of putting in a flourishing condition the valuable branch of our trade which gives employment to two great provinces and above two hundred sail of ships much more at heart than his own private interest it was reasonable to expect that a man whose debts m had paid more than once whom he had obliged in many other respects and whom he had carried with him at a very considerable expense on this expedition merely with a view of bettering his fortune would have acted with common honesty if not with gratitude but such was the depravity of this little monsters heart that on his deathbed he left a considerable fortune to mere strangers with whom he had little or no connection without the least thought of refunding the money advanced for him by m in order to prevent his rotting in a jail when m had once obtained a command of money he by his knowledge in several branches of trade as well as by the assistance of some intelligent friends at paris and london found means to employ it to very good purpose and had he been a man of that selfish disposition which too much prevails in the world he might have been at this day master of a very ample fortune but his ear was never deaf to the voice of distress nor his beneficent heart shut against the calamities of his fellowcreatures he was even ingenious in contriving the most delicate methods of relieving modest indigence and by his industrious benevolence often anticipated the requests of misery i could relate a number of examples to illustrate my assertions in some of which you would perceive the most disinterested generosity but such a detail would trespass too much upon your time and i do not pretend to dwell upon every minute circumstance of his conduct let it suffice to say that upon the declaration of war in spain he gave up all his commercial schemes and called in his money from all quarters with a view of sitting down for the rest of his life contented with what he had got and restraining his liberalities to what he could spare from his yearly income this was a very prudential resolution could he have kept it but upon the breaking out of the war he could not without concern see many gentlemen of merit who had been recommended to him disappointed of commissions merely for want of money to satisfy the expectations of the commissionbrokers of that time and therefore launched out considerable sums for them on their bare notes great part whereof was lost by the death of some in the unfortunate expedition to the west indies he at length after many other actions of the like nature from motives of pure humanity love of justice and abhorrence of oppression embarked in a cause every way the most important that ever came under the discussion of the courts of law in these kingdoms whether it be considered in relation to the extraordinary nature of the case or the immense property of no less than fifty thousand pounds a year and three peerages that depended upon it in the year the brave admiral who at that time commanded his majestys fleet in the west indies among the other transactions of his squadron transmitted to the duke of newcastle mentioned a young man who though in the capacity of a common sailor on board one of the ships under his command laid claim to the estate and titles of the earl of a these pretensions were no sooner communicated in the public papers than they became the subject of conversation in all companies and the person whom they chiefly affected being alarmed at the appearance of a competitor though at such a distance began to put himself in motion and take all the precautions which he thought necessary to defeat the endeavour of the young upstart indeed the early intelligence he received of mr a s making himself known in the west indies furnished him with numberless advantages over that unhappy young gentleman for being in possession of a splendid fortune and lord of many manors in the neighbourhood of the very place where the claimant was born he knew all the witnesses who could give the most material evidence of his legitimacy and if his probity did not restrain him had by his power and influence sufficient opportunity and means of applying to the passions and interests of the witnesses to silence many and gain over others to his side while his competitor by an absence of fifteen or sixteen years from his native country the want of education and friends together with his present helpless situation was rendered absolutely incapable of taking any step for his own advantage and although his worthy uncles conspicuous virtue and religious regard for justice and truth might possibly be an unconquerable restraint to his taking any undue advantages yet the consciences of that huge army of emissaries he kept in pay were not altogether so very tender and scrupulous this much however may be said without derogation from or impeachment of the noble earls nice virtue and honour that he took care to compromise all differences with the other branches of the family whose interests were in this affair connected with his own by sharing the estate with them and also retained most of the eminent counsel within the bar of both kingdoms against this formidable bastard before any suit was instituted by him while he was thus entrenching himself against the attack of a poor forlorn youth at the distance of fifteen hundred leagues continually exposed to the dangers of the sea the war and an unhealthy climate mr m in the common course of conversation chanced to ask some questions relating to this romantic pretender of one h who was at that time the present lord a s chief agent this man when pressed could not help owning that the late lord a actually left a son who had been spirited away into america soon after his fathers death but said he did not know whether this was the same person this information could not fail to make an impression on the humanity of mr m who being acquainted with the genius of the wicked party who had possessed themselves of this unhappy young mans estate and honours expressed no small anxiety and apprehension lest they should take him off by some means or other and even then seemed disposed to contribute towards the support of the friendless orphan and to inquire more circumstantially into the nature of his claim in the meantime his occasions called him to france and during his absence mr a arrived in london in the month of october l here the clergyman was interrupted by peregrine who said there was something so extraordinary not to call it improbable in the account he had heard of the young gentlemans being sent into exile that he would look upon himself as infinitely obliged to the doctor if he would favour him with a true representation of that transaction as well as of the manner in which he arrived and was known at the island of jamaica the parson in compliance with our heros request taking up the story from the beginning mr a said he is the son of arthur late lord baron of a by his wife mary s natural daughter to john duke of b and n whom he publicly married on the st day of july contrary to the inclination of his mother and all his other relations particularly of arthur late earl of a who bore an implacable enmity to the duke her father and for that reason did all that lay in his power to traverse the marriage but finding his endeavours ineffectual he was so much offended that he would never be perfectly reconciled to lord a though he was his presumptive heir after their nuptials they cohabited together in england for the space of two or three years during which she miscarried more than once and he being a man of levity and an extravagant disposition not only squandered away all that he had received of his wifes fortune but also contracted many considerable debts which obliged him to make a precipitate retreat into ireland leaving his lady behind him in the house with his mother and sister who having also been averse to the match had always looked upon her with eyes of disgust it was not likely that harmony should long subsist in this family especially as lady a was a woman of a lofty spirit who could not tamely bear insults and illusage from persons who she had reason to believe were her enemies at heart accordingly a misunderstanding soon happened among them which was fomented by the malice of one of her sistersinlaw divers scandalous reports of her misconduct to which the empty pretensions of a vain wretched coxcomb who was made use of as an infamous tool for that purpose gave a colourable pretext were trumped up and transmitted with many false and aggravating circumstances to her husband in ireland who being a giddy unthinking man was so much incensed at these insinuations that in the first transports of his passion he sent to his mother a power of attorney that she might sue for a divorce in his behalf a libel was thereupon exhibited containing many scandalous allegations void of any real foundation in truth but being unsupported by any manner of proof it was at length dismissed with costs after it had depended upwards of two years lord a finding himself abused by the misrepresentations of his mother and sister discovered an inclination to be reconciled to his lady in consequence of which she was sent over to dublin by her father to the care of a gentleman in that city in whose house she was received by her husband with all the demonstrations of love and esteem from thence he conducted her to his lodgings and thence to his country house where she had the misfortune to suffer a miscarriage through fear and resentment of my lords behaviour which was often brutal and indecent from the country they removed to dublin about the latter end of july or beginning of august where they had not long continued when her ladyship was known to be again with child lord a and his issue being next in remainder to the honours and estate of arthur earl of a was extremely solicitous to have a son and warned by the frequent miscarriages of his lady resolved to curb the natural impatience and rusticity of his disposition that she might not as formerly suffer by his outrageous conduct he accordingly cherished her with uncommon tenderness and care and her pregnancy being pretty far advanced conducted her to his country seat where she was delivered of mr a about the latter end of april or beginning of may for none of the witnesses have been able at this distance with absolute certainty to fix the precise time of his birth and there was no register kept in the parish as an additional misfortune no gentleman of fashion lived in that parish nor did those who lived at any considerable distance care to cultivate an acquaintance with a man of lord a s strange conduct be that as it will the occasion was celebrated by his lordships tenants and dependents upon the spot and in the neighbouring town of newr by bonfires illuminations and other rejoicings which have made such an impression upon the minds of the people that in the place where they happened and the contiguous parishes several hundred persons have already declared their knowledge and remembrance of this event in spite of the great power of the claimants adversary in that quarter and the great pains and indirect methods taken by his numberless agents and emissaries as well as by those who are interested with him in the event of the suit to corrupt and suppress the evidence lord a after the birth of his son who was sent to nurse in the neighbourhood according to the custom of the country where people of the highest distinction put their children out to nurse into farmhouses and cabins lived in harmony with his lady for the space of two years but having by his folly and extravagance reduced himself to great difficulties he demanded the remainder of her fortune from her father the duke of b who absolutely refused to part with a shilling until a proper settlement should be made on his daughter which by that time he had put out of his own power to make by his folly and extravagance as her ladyship by her endeavours to reform the economy of her house had incurred the displeasure of some idle profligate fellows who had fastened themselves upon her husband and helped to consume his substance they seized this opportunity of the dukes refusal and in order to be revenged upon the innocent lady persuaded lord a that the only means of extracting money from his grace would be to turn her away on pretence of infidelity to his bed for which they hinted there was but too much foundation at their suggestions a most infamous plan was projected in the execution of which one p a poor unbred simple country booby whom they had decoyed into a snare lost one of his ears and the injured lady retired that same day to newr where she continued several years she did not however leave the house without struggling hard to carry her child along with her but far from enjoying such indulgence strict orders were given that the boy should not for the future be brought within her sight this base inhuman treatment instead of answering the end proposed produced such a contrary effect that the duke of b by a codicil to his will in which he reflects upon lord a s evil temper directed his executors to pay to his daughter an annuity of one hundred pounds while her lord and she should continue to live separate and this allowance was to cease on lord a s death while she remained in this solitary situation the child was universally known and received as the legitimate son and heir of her lord whose affection for the boy was so conspicuous that in the midst of his own necessities he never failed to maintain him in the dress and equipage of a young nobleman in the course of his infancy his father having often changed his place of residence the child was put under the instructions of a great many different schoolmasters so that he was perfectly well known in a great many different parts of the kingdom and his mother seized all opportunities which were but rare on account of his fathers orders to the contrary of seeing and giving him proofs of her maternal tenderness until she set out for england after having been long in a declining state of health by a paralytical disorder upon the consequence of which such dependence was placed by her inconsiderate husband who was by this time reduced to extreme poverty that he actually married a woman whom he had long kept as a mistress this creature no sooner understood that lady a was departed from ireland than she openly avowed her marriage and went about publicly with lord a visiting his acquaintances in the character of his wife from this era may be dated the beginning of mr a s misfortune this artful woman who had formerly treated the child with an appearance of fondness in order to ingratiate herself with the father now looking upon herself as sufficiently established in the family thought it was high time to alter her behaviour with regard to the unfortunate boy and accordingly for obvious reasons employed a thousand artifices to alienate the heart of the weak father from his unhappy offspring yet notwithstanding all her insinuations nature still maintained her influence in his heart and though she often found means to irritate him by artful and malicious accusations his resentment never extended farther than fatherly correction she would have found it impossible to accomplish his ruin had not her efforts been reinforced by a new auxiliary who was no other than his uncle the present usurper of his title and estate yet even this confederacy was overawed in some measure by the fear of alarming the unfortunate mother until her distemper increased to a most deplorable degree of the dead palsy and the death of her father had reduced her to a most forlorn and abject state of distress then they ventured upon the execution of their projects and though their aims were widely different concurred in their endeavours to remove the hapless boy as the common obstacle to both lord a who as i have already observed was a man of weak intellects and utterly void of any fixed principle of action being by this time reduced to such a pitch of misery that he was often obliged to pawn his wearing apparel in order to procure the common necessaries of life and having no other fund remaining with which he could relieve his present necessities except a sale of the reversion of the a estate to which the nonage of his son was an effectual bar he was advised by his virtuous brother and the rest of his counsellors to surmount this difficulty by secreting his son and spreading a report of his death this honest project he the more readily embraced because he knew that no act of his could frustrate the childs succession accordingly the boy was removed from the school at which he was then boarded to the house of one k an agent and accomplice of the present earl of a where he was kept for several months closely confined and in the meantime it was industriously reported that he was dead this previous measure being taken lord a published advertisements in the gazettes offering reversions of the a estate to sale and emissaries of various kinds were employed to inveigle such as were ignorant of the nature of the settlement of these estates or strangers to the affairs of his family some people imposed upon by the report of the childs death were drawn in to purchase thinking themselves safe in the concurrence of his lordships brother upon presumption that he was next in remainder to the succession others tempted by the smallness of the price which rarely exceeded half a years purchase as appears by many deeds though they doubted the truth of the boys being dead ran small risks on the contingency of his dying before he should be of age or in hopes of his being prevailed upon to confirm the grants of his father and many more were treating with him on the same notions when their transactions were suddenly interrupted and the scheme of raising more money for the present defeated by the unexpected appearance of the boy who being naturally sprightly and impatient of restraint had found means to break from his confinement and wandered up and down the streets of dublin avoiding his fathers house and choosing to encounter all sorts of distress rather than subject himself again to the cruelty and malice of the woman who supplied his mothers place thus debarred his fathers protection and destitute of any fixed habitation he herded with all the loose idle and disorderly youths in dublin skulking chiefly about the college several members and students of which taking pity on his misfortunes supplied him at different times with clothes and money in this unsettled and uncomfortable way of life did he remain from the year to the latter end of november at which time his father died so miserably poor that he was actually buried at the public expense this unfortunate nobleman was no sooner dead than his brother richard now earl of a taking advantage of the nonage and helpless situation of his nephew seized upon all the papers of the defunct and afterwards usurped the title of lord a to the surprise of the servants and others who were acquainted with the affairs of the family this usurpation bold as it was produced no other effect than that of his being insulted by the populace as he went through the streets and the refusal of the kingatarms to enrol the certificate of his brothers having died without issue the first of these inconveniences he bore without any sense of shame though not without repining conscious that it would gradually vanish with the novelty of his invasion and as to the last he conquered it by means well known and obvious nor will it seem strange that he should thus invade the rights of an orphan with impunity if people will consider that the late lord a had not only squandered away his fortune with the most ridiculous extravagance but also associated himself with low company so that he was little known and less regarded by persons of any rank and figure in life and his child of consequence debarred of the advantages which might have accrued from valuable connections and though it was universally known that lady a had a son in ireland such was the obscurity in which the father had lived during the last years of his life that few of the nobility could be supposed to be acquainted with the particular circumstances of a transaction in which they had no concern and which had happened at the distance of twelve years before the date of this usurpation moreover as their first information was no other than common fame the public clamour occasioned by the separation might inspire such as were strangers to the family affairs with a mistaken notion of the childs having been born about or after the time of that event the hurry and bustle occasioned by the arrival of the lordlieutenant about this period the reports industriously propagated of the claimants death the obscurity and concealment in which the boy was obliged to live in order to elude the wicked attempts of his uncle might also contribute to his peaceable enjoyment of an empty title and lastly lord chancellor w whose immediate province it was to issue writs for parliament was an utter stranger in ireland unacquainted with the descents of families and consequently did not examine farther than the certificate enrolled in the books of the kingatarms over and above these circumstances which naturally account for the success of the imposture it may be observed that the hapless youth had not one relation alive on the side of his father whose interest it was not to forward or connive at his destruction that his grandfather the duke of b was dead and that his mother was then in england in a forlorn destitute dying condition secreted from the world and even from her own relations by her woman mary h who had a particular interest to secrete her and altogether dependent upon a miserable and precarious allowance from the duchess of b to whose caprice she was moreover a most wretched slave notwithstanding these concurring circumstances in favour of the usurper he did not think himself secure while the orphan had any chance of finding a friend who would undertake his cause and therefore laid a plan for his being kidnapped and sent to america as a slave his coadjutor in this inhuman scheme was a person who carried on the trade of transporting servants to our plantations and was deeply interested on this occasion having for a mere trifle purchased of the late lord a the reversion of a considerable part of the a estate which shameful bargain was confirmed by the brother but could never take place unless the boy could be effectually removed everything being settled with this auxiliary several ruffians were employed in search of the unhappy victim and the first attempt that was made upon him in which his uncle personally assisted happening near one of the great markets of the city of dublin an honest butcher with the assistance of his neighbours rescued him by force from their cruel hands this however was but a short respite for though warned by this adventure the boy seldom crept out of his lurkingplaces without the most cautious circumspection he was in march discovered by the diligence of his persecutors and forcibly dragged on board of a ship bound for newcastle on delaware river in america where he was sold as a slave and kept to hard labour much above his age or strength for the space of thirteen years during which he was transferred from one person to another while he remained in this servile situation he often mentioned to those in whom he thought such confidence might be placed the circumstances of his birth and title together with the manner of his being exiled from his native country although in this particular he neglected a caution which he had received in his passage importing that such a discovery would cost him his life meanwhile the usurper quietly enjoyed his right and to those who questioned him about his brothers son constantly replied that the boy had been dead for several years and arthur earl of a dying in april he upon pretence of being next heir succeeded to the honours and estate of that nobleman the term of the nephews bondage which had been lengthened out beyond the usual time on account of his repeated attempts to escape being expired in the year he hired himself as a common sailor in a trading vessel bound to jamaica and there being entered on board of one of his majestys ships under the command of admiral vernon openly declared his parentage and pretensions this extraordinary claim which made a great noise in the fleet reaching the ears of one lieutenant s nearly related to the usurpers irish wife he believed the young gentleman to be an impostor and thinking it was incumbent on him to discover the cheat he went on board the ship to which the claimant belonged and having heard the account which he gave of himself was notwithstanding his prepossessions convinced of the truth of what he alleged on his return to his own ship he chanced to mention this extraordinary affair upon the quarterdeck in the hearing of mr b one of the midshipmen who had formerly been at school with mr a this young gentleman not only told the lieutenant that he had been schoolfellow with lord a s son but also declared that he should know him again if not greatly altered as he still retained a perfect idea of his countenance upon this intimation the lieutenant proposed that the experiment should be tried and went with the midshipman on board the ship that the claimant was on for that purpose after all the sailors had been assembled upon deck mr b casting his eyes around immediately distinguished mr a in the crowd and laying his hand on his shoulder this is the man said he affirming at the same time that while he continued at school with him the claimant was reputed and respected as lord a s son and heir and maintained in all respects suitable to the dignity of his rank nay he was in like manner recognised by several other persons in the fleet who had known him in his infancy these things being reported to the admiral he generously ordered him to be supplied with necessaries and treated like a gentleman and in his next despatches transmitted an account of the affair to the duke of newcastle among the other transactions of the fleet in september or october mr a arrived in london and the first person to whom he applied for advice and assistance was a man of the law nearly related to the families of a and a and well acquainted with the particular affairs of each who far from treating him as a bastard and impostor received him with civility and seeming kindness asked him to eat presented him with a piece of money and excusing himself from meddling in the affair advised him to go to ireland as the most proper place for commencing a suit for the recovery of his right before the young gentleman had an opportunity or indeed any inclination to comply with this advice he was accidentally met in the street by that same h who as i have mentioned gave mr m the first insight into the affair this man immediately knew the claimant having been formerly an agent for his father and afterwards a creature of his uncles with whom he was not without reason suspected to be concerned in kidnapping and transporting his nephew be that as it will his connections with the usurper were now broken off by a quarrel in consequence of which he had thrown up his agency and he invited the hapless stranger to his house with a view of making all possible advantage of such a guest there he had not long remained when his treacherous landlord tampering with his inexperience effected a marriage between him and the daughter of one of his own friends who lodged in his house at the same time but afterwards seeing no person of consequence willing to espouse his cause he looked upon him as an encumbrance and wanted to rid his hands of him accordingly he remembered that mr m had expressed himself with all the humanity of apprehension in favour of the unfortunate young nobleman before his arrival in england and being well acquainted with the generosity of his disposition he no sooner understood that he was returned from france than he waited upon him with an account of mr a s being safely arrived mr m was sincerely rejoiced to find that a person who had been so cruelly injured and undergone so long and continued a scene of distress was restored to a country where he was sure of obtaining justice and where every good man as he imagined would make the cause his own and being informed that the youth was in want of necessaries he gave twenty guineas to h for his use and promised to do him all the service in his power but had no intention to take upon himself the whole weight of such an important affair or indeed to appear in the cause until he should be fully and thoroughly satisfied that the claimants pretensions were well founded in the meantime h insinuating that the young gentleman was not safe in his present lodging from the machinations of his enemies m accommodated him with an apartment in his own house where he was at great pains to remedy the defect in his education by rendering him fit to appear as a gentleman in the world having received from him all the intelligence he could give relating to his own affair he laid the case before counsel and despatched a person to ireland to make further inquiries upon the same subject who in his first arrival in that kingdom found the claimants birth was as publicly known as any circumstance of that kind could possibly be at so great a distance of time the usurper and his friends gave all the interruption in their power to any researches concerning that affair and had recourse to every art and expedient that could be invented to prevent its being brought to a legal discussion privilege bills in chancery orders of court surreptitiously and illegally obtained and every other invention was made use of to bar and prevent a fair and honest trial by a jury the usurper himself and his agents at the same time that they formed divers conspiracies against his life in vain endeavoured to detach mr m from the orphans cause by innumerable artifices insinuating cajoling and misrepresenting with surprising dexterity and perseverance his protector far from being satisfied with their reasons was not only deaf to their remonstrances but believing him in danger from their repeated efforts had him privately conveyed into the country where an unhappy accident which he hath ever since sincerely regretted furnished his adversary with a colourable pretext to cut him off in the beginning of his career a man happening to lose his life by the accidental discharge of a piece that chanced to be in a young gentlemans hands the account of this misfortune no sooner reached the ears of his uncle than he expressed the most immoderate joy at having found so good a handle for destroying him under colour of law he immediately constituted himself prosecutor set his emissaries at work to secure a coroners inquest suited to his cruel purposes set out for the place in person to take care that the prisoner should not escape insulted him in jail in the most inhuman manner employed a whole army of attorneys and agents to spirit up and carry on a most virulent prosecution practised all the unfair methods that could he invented in order that the unhappy gentleman should be transported to newgate from the healthy prison to which he was at first committed endeavoured to inveigle him into destructive confessions and not to mention other more infamous arts employed in the affair of evidence attempted to surprise him upon his trial in the absence of his witnesses and counsel contrary to a previous agreement with the prosecutors own attorney nay he even appeared in person upon the bench at the trial in order to intimidate the evidence and browbeat the unfortunate prisoner at the bar and expended above a thousand pounds in that prosecution in spite of all his wicked efforts however which were defeated by the spirit and indefatigable industry of mr m the young gentleman was honourably acquitted to the evident satisfaction of all the impartial the misfortune that gave a handle for that unnatural prosecution appearing to a demonstration to have been a mere accident in a few months his protector who had now openly espoused his cause taking with him two gentlemen to witness his transactions conducted him to his native country with a view to be better informed of the strength of his pretensions than he could be by the intelligence he had hitherto received or by the claimants own dark and almost obliterated remembrance of the facts which were essential to be known upon their arrival in dublin application was made to those persons whom mr a had named as his schoolmasters and companions together with the servants and neighbours of his father these though examined separately without having the least previous intimation of what the claimant had reported agreed in their accounts with him as well as with one another and mentioned many other people as acquainted with the same facts to whom mr m had recourse and still met with the same unvaried information by these means he made such progress in his inquiries that in less than two months no fewer than one hundred persons from different quarters of the kingdom either personally or by letters communicated their knowledge of the claimant in declarations consonant with one another as well as with the accounts he gave of himself several servants who had lived with his father and been deceived with the story of his death so industriously propagated by his uncle no sooner heard of his being in dublin than they came from different parts of the country to see him and though great pains were taken to deceive them they nevertheless knew him at first sight some of them fell upon their knees to thank for his preservation embraced his legs and shed tears of joy for his return although the conduct of his adversary particularly in the abovementioned prosecution together with the evidence that already appeared were sufficient to convince all mankind of the truth of the claimants pretensions mr m in order to be further satisfied resolved to see how he would be received upon the spot where he was born justly concluding that if he was really an impostor the bastard of a kitchenwench produced in a country entirely possessed by his enemy and his allies he must be looked upon in that place with the utmost detestation and contempt this his intention was no sooner known to the adverse party than their agents and friends from all quarters repaired to that place with all possible despatch and used all their influence with the people in remonstrances threats and all the other arts they could devise not only to discountenance the claimant upon his arrival but even to spirit up a mob to insult him notwithstanding these precautions and the servile awe and subjection in which tenants are kept by their landlords in that part of the country as soon as it was known that mr a approached the town the inhabitants crowded out in great multitudes to receive and welcome him and accompanied him into town with acclamations and other expressions of joy insomuch that the agents of his adversary durst not show their faces the sovereign of the corporation who was a particular creature and favourite of the usurper and whose all depended upon the issue of the cause was so conscious of the strangers right and so much awed by the behaviour of the people who knew that consciousness that he did not think it safe even to preserve the appearance of neutrality upon this occasion but actually held the stirrup while mr a dismounted from his horse this sense of conviction in the people manifested itself still more powerfully when he returned to the same place in the year about which time lord a being informed of his resolution determined again to be beforehand with him and set out in person with his agents and friends some of whom were detached before him to prepare for his reception and induced the people to meet him in a body and accompany him to town with such expressions of welcome as they had before bestowed on his nephew but in spite of all their art and interest he was suffered to pass through the street in a mournful silence and though several barrels of beer were produced to court the favour of the populace they had no other effect than that of drawing their ridicule upon the donor whereas when mr a two days afterwards appeared all the inhabitants with garlands streamers music and other ensigns of joy crowded out to meet him and ushered him into town with such demonstrations of pleasure and goodwill that the noble peer found it convenient to hide himself from the resentment of his own tenants the effects of which he must have severely felt had not he been screened by the timely remonstrances of mr m and the other gentlemen who accompanied his competitor nor did his apprehension vanish with the transaction of this day the town was again in uproar on the sunday following when it was known that mr a intended to come thither from dunmain to church they went out to meet him as before and conducted him to the church door with acclamations which terrified his uncle to such a degree that he fled with precipitation in a boat and soon after entirely quitted the place it would be almost an endless task to enumerate the particular steps that were taken by one side to promote and by the other to delay the trial the young gentlemans adversaries finding that they could not by all the subterfuges and arts they had used evade it repeated attempts were made to assassinate him and his protector and every obstruction thrown in the way of his cause which craft could invent villainy execute and undue influence confirm but all these difficulties were surmounted by the vigilance constancy courage and sagacity of m and at last the affair was brought to a very solemn trial at bar which being continued by several adjournments from the eleventh to the twentyfifth day of november a verdict was found for the claimant by a jury of gentlemen which in point of reputation and property cannot be easily paralleled in the annals of that or any other country a jury that could by no means be suspected of prepossessions in favour of mr a to whose person they were absolute strangers especially if we consider that a gentleman in their neighbourhood who was nephew to the foreman and nearly related to some of the rest of their number forfeited a considerable estate by their decision this verdict said the parson gave the highest satisfaction to all impartial persons that were within reach of being duly informed of their proceedings and of the different genius and conduct of the parties engaged in the contest but more especially to such as were in court as i was at the trial and had an opportunity of observing the characters and behaviour of the persons who appeared there to give evidence to such it was very apparent that all the witnesses produced there on the part of the uncle were either his tenants dependents potcompanions or persons some way or other interested in the issue of the suit and remarkable for a low kind of cunning that many of them were persons of profligate lives who deserved no credit that independent of the levity of their characters those of them who went under the denomination of colonels colonel l alone excepted who had nothing to say and was only brought there in order to give credit to that party made so ridiculous a figure and gave so absurd contradictory and inconsistent an evidence as no court or jury could give the least degree of credit to on the other hand it was observed that the nephew and mr m his chief manager being absolute strangers in that country and unacquainted with the characters of the persons they had to deal with were obliged to lay before the court and jury such evidence as came to their hand some of whom plainly appeared to have been put upon them by their adversaries with a design to hurt it was also manifest that the witnesses produced for mr a were such as could have no manner of connection with him nor any dependence whatsoever upon him to influence their evidence for the far greatest part of them had never seen him from his infancy till the trial began and many of them though poor and undignified with the title of colonels were people of unblemished character of great simplicity and such as no man in his senses would pitch upon to support a bad cause it is plain that the jury whose wellknown honour impartiality and penetration must be revered by all who are acquainted with them were not under the least difficulty about their verdict for they were not enclosed above half an hour when they returned with it these gentlemen could not help observing the great inequality of the parties engaged the great advantages that the uncle had in every other respect except the truth and justice of his case over the nephew by means of his vast possessions and of his power and influence all round the place of his birth nor could the contrast between the different geniuses of the two parties escape their observation they could not but see and conclude that a person who had confessedly transported and sold his orphan nephew into slavery who on his return had carried on so unwarrantable and cruel a prosecution to take away his life under colour of law and who had also given such glaring proofs of his skill and dexterity in the management of witnesses for that cruel purpose was in like manner capable of exerting the same happy talent on this occasion when his all was at stake more especially as he had so many others who were equally interested with himself and whose abilities in that respect fell nothing short of his own to second him in it the gentlemen of the jury had also a near view of the manner in which the witnesses delivered their testimonies and had from thence an opportunity of observing many circumstances and distinguishing characteristics of truth and falsehood from which a great deal could be gathered that could not be adequately conveyed by any printed account how exact soever consequently they must have been much better judges of the evidence on which they founded their verdict than any person who had not the same opportunity can possibly be these mr pickle were my reflections on what i had occasion to observe concerning that famous trial and on my return to england two years after i could not help pitying the selfsufficiency of some people who at this distance pretended to pass their judgment on that verdict with as great positiveness as if they had been in the secrets of the cause or upon the jury who tried it and that from no better authority than the declamations of lord a s emissaries and some falsified printed accounts artfully cooked up on purpose to mislead and deceive but to return from this digression lord a the defendant in that cause was so conscious of the strength and merits of his injured nephews case and that a verdict would go against him that he ordered a writ of error to be made out before the trial was ended and the verdict was no sooner given than he immediately lodged it though he well knew he had no manner of error to assign this expedient was practised merely for vexation and delay in order to keep mr a from the possession of the small estate he had recovered by the verdict that his slender funds being exhausted he might be deprived of other means to prosecute his right and by the most oppressive contrivances and scandalous chicanery it has been kept up to this day without his being able to assign the least shadow of any error lord a was not the only antagonist that mr a had to deal with all the different branches of the a family who had been worrying one another at law ever since the death of the late earl of a about the partition of his great estate were now firmly united in an association against this unfortunate gentleman mutual deeds were executed among them by which many great lordships and estates were given up by the uncle to persons who had no right to possess them in order to engage them to side with him against his nephew in withholding the unjust possession of the remainder these confederates having held several consultations against their common enemy and finding that his cause gathered daily strength since the trial by the accession of many witnesses of figure and reputation who had not been heard of before and that the only chance they had to prevent the speedy establishment of his right and their own destruction was by stripping mr m of the little money that yet remained and by stopping all further resources whereby he might be enabled to proceed they therefore came to a determined resolution to carry that hopeful scheme into execution and in pursuance thereof they have left no expedient or stratagem how extraordinary or scandalous soever unpractised to distress mr a and that gentleman for that end all the oppressive arts and dilatory expensive contrivances that the fertile invention of the lowest pettifoggers of the law could possibly devise have with dexterity been played off against them in fruitless quibbling and malicious suits entirely foreign to the merits of the cause not to mention numberless other acts of oppression the most extraordinary and unprecedented proceeding by means whereof this sham writ of error hath been kept on foot ever since november is to me said the doctor a most flagrant instance not only of the prevalency of power and money when employed as in the present case against an unfortunate helpless man disabled as he is of the means of ascertaining his right but of the badness of a cause that hath recourse to so many iniquitous expedients to support it in a word the whole conduct of lord a and his party from the beginning to this time hath been such as sufficiently manifests that it could proceed from no other motives than a consciousness of mr a s right and of their own illegal usurpations and from a terror of trusting the merits of their case to a fair discussion by the laws of their country and that the intention and main drift of all their proceedings plainly tends to stifle and smother the merits of the case from the knowledge of the world by oppressive arts and ingenious delays rather than trust it to the candid determination of an honest jury what else could be the motives of kidnapping the claimant and transporting him when an infant of the various attempts made upon his life since his return of the attempts to divest him of all assistance to ascertain his right by endeavouring so solicitously to prevail on mr m to abandon him in the beginning of retaining an army of counsel before any suit had been commenced of the many sinister attempts to prevent the trial at bar of the various arts made use of to terrify any one from appearing as witness for the claimant and to seduce those who had appeared of the shameless unprecedented low tricks now practised to keep him out of the possession of that estate for which he had obtained the verdict thereby to disable him from bringing his cause to a further hearing and of the attempts made to buy up mr m s debts and to spirit up suits against him is it not obvious from all these circumstances as well as from the obstruction they have given to the attorneygenerals proceeding to make a report to his majesty on the claimants petition to the king for the peerage which was referred by his majesty to that gentleman so far back as that all their efforts are bent to that one point of stifling rather than suffering the merits of this cause to come to a fair and candid hearing and that the sole consideration at present between them and this unfortunate man is not whether he is right or wrong but whether he shall or shall not find money to bring this cause to a final determination lord a and his confederates not thinking themselves safe with all these expedients while there was a possibility of their antagonists obtaining any assistance from such as humanity compassion generosity or a love of justice might induce to lay open their purses to his assistance in ascertaining his right have by themselves and their numerous emissaries employed all the arts of calumny slander and detraction against him by traducing his cause vilifying his person and most basely and cruelly tearing his character to pieces by a thousand misrepresentations purposely invented and industriously propagated in all places of resort which is a kind of cowardly assassination that there is no guarding against yet in spite of all these machinations and the shameful indifference of mankind who stand aloof unconcerned and see this unhappy gentleman most inhumanly oppressed by the weight of lawless power and faction m far from suffering himself to be dejected by the multiplying difficulties that crowd upon him still exerts himself with amazing fortitude and assiduity and will i doubt not bring the affair he began and carried on with so much spirit while his finances lasted to a happy conclusion it would exceed the bounds of my intention and perhaps trespass too much upon your time were i to enumerate the low artifices and shameful quibbles by which the usurper has found means to procrastinate the decision of the contest between him and his hapless nephew or to give a detail of the damage and perplexity which mr m has sustained and been involved in by the treachery and ingratitude of some who listed themselves under him in the prosecution of this affair and by the villainy of others who under various pretences of material discoveries they had to make etc had fastened themselves upon him and continued to do all the mischief in their power until the cloven foot was detected one instance however is so flagrantly flagitious that i cannot resist the inclination i feel to relate it as an example of the most infernal perfidy that perhaps ever entered the human heart i have already mentioned the part which h n acted in the beginning of m s connection with the unfortunate stranger and hinted that the said h lay under many obligations to that gentleman before mr a s arrival in england he had been chief agent to lord a and as it afterwards appeared received several payments of a secret pension which that lord enjoyed for which he either could not or would not account his lordship therefore in order to compel him to it took out writs against him and his house was continually surrounded with catchpoles for the space of two whole years mr m believing from h s own account of the matter that the poor man was greatly injured and prosecuted on account of his attachment to the unhappy young gentleman did him all the good offices in his power and became security for him on several occasions nay such was his opinion of his integrity that after mr a was cleared of the prosecution carried on against him by his uncle his person was entrusted to the care of this hypocrite who desired that the young gentleman might lodge at his house for the convenience of air m s own occasions calling him often into the country having thus by his consummate dissimulation acquired such a valuable charge he wrote a letter to one of lord a s attorneys offering to betray mr a provided his lordship would settle his account and give him a discharge for eight hundred pounds of the pension which he had received and not accounted for mr m informed of this treacherous proposal immediately removed his lodger from his house into his own without assigning his reasons for so doing until he was obliged to declare it in order to free himself from the importunities of h who earnestly solicited his return this miscreant finding himself detected and disappointed in his villainous design was so much enraged at his miscarriage that forgetting all the benefits he had received from m for a series of years he practised all the mischief that his malice could contrive against him and at length entered into a confederacy with one g and several other abandoned wretches who as before said under various pretences of being able to make material discoveries and otherwise to serve the cause had found means to be employed in some extra business relating to it though their real intention was to betray the claimant these confederates in conjunction with some other auxiliaries of infamous character being informed that mr m was on the point of securing a considerable sum to enable him to prosecute mr a s right and to bring it to a happy conclusion contrived a deeplaid scheme to disappoint him in it and at once to ruin the cause and previous measures being taken for that wicked purpose they imposed upon the young gentlemans inexperience and credulity by insinuations equally false plausible and malicious to which they at length gained his belief by the mention of some circumstances that gave what they alleged an air of probability and even of truth they swore that mr m had taken out an action against him for a very large sum of money that they had actually seen the writ that the intention of it was to throw him into prison for life and ruin his cause in consequence of an agreement made by him with lord a and his other enemies to retrieve the money that he had laid out in the cause this plausible tale was enforced with such an air of truth candour and earnest concern for his safety and was strengthened by so many imprecations and corroborating circumstances of their invention as would have staggered one of much greater experience and knowledge of mankind than mr a could be supposed at that time to possess the notion of perpetual imprisonment and the certain ruin they made him believe his cause was threatened with worked upon his imagination to such a degree that he suffered himself to be led like a lamb to the slaughter by this artful band of villains who secreted him at the lodgings of one p an intimate of g s for several days under colour of his being hunted by bailiffs employed by mr m where he was not only obliged by them to change his name but even his wife was not suffered to have access to him their design was to have sold him or drawn him into a ruinous compromise with his adversaries for a valuable consideration to themselves but as no ties are binding among such a knot of villains the rest of the conspirators were jockeyed by g who in order to monopolize the advantage to himself hurried his prize into the country and secreted him even from his confederates in a place of concealment one hundred miles from london under the same ridiculous pretence of m s having taken out a writ against him and of bailiffs being in pursuit of him everywhere round london he was no sooner there than g as a previous step to the other villainy he intended tricked him out of a bond for six thousand pounds under colour of his having a person ready to advance the like sum upon it as an immediate fund for carrying on his cause assuring him at the same time that he had a set of gentlemen ready who were willing to advance twentyfive thousand pounds more for the same purpose and to allow him five hundred pounds a year for his maintenance till his cause should be made an end of provided that mr m should have no further concern with him and his cause mr a having by this time received some intimations of the deceit that had been put upon him made answer that he should look upon himself as a very ungrateful monster indeed if he deserted a person who had saved his life and so generously ventured his own together with his fortune in his cause until he should first be certain of the truth of what was alleged of him and absolutely rejected the proposal g who had no other view in making it than to cover the secret villainy he meditated against him and to facilitate the execution thereof easily receded from it when he found mr a so averse to it and undertook nevertheless to raise the money adding that he might if he pleased return to mr m whenever it was secured the whole drift of this pretended undertaking to raise the twentyfive thousand pounds was only to lay a foundation for a dexterous contrivance to draw mr a unwarily into the execution of a deed relinquishing all his right and title under a notion of its being a deed to secure the repayment of that sum g having as he imagined so far paved the way for the execution of such a deed enters into an agreement with an agent employed for that purpose by mr a s adversaries purporting that in consideration of the payment of a bond for six thousand pounds which he g had as he pretended laid out in mr a s cause and of an annuity of seven hundred pounds a year he was to procure for them from mr a a deed ready executed relinquishing all right and title to the a estate and honours everything being prepared for the execution of this infernal scheme unknown to mr a g then thought proper to send for him to town from his retirement in order as he pretended to execute a security of twentyfive thousand pounds this intended victim to that villains avarice no sooner arrived in town full of hopes of money to carry on his cause and of agreeably surprising his friend and protector mr m with so seasonable and unexpected a reinforcement than an unforeseen difficulty arose concerning the payment of g s sixthousandpound bond that money was to have been raised out of the estate of a lunatic which could not be done without the leave of the court of chancery to whom an account must have been given of the intended application of it while preparations were making to rectify this omission g immediately carried mr a again into the country lest he should happen to be undeceived by some means or other in the meantime this wicked machination was providentially discovered by mr m before it could be carried into execution by means of the jealousies that arose among the conspirators themselves and was at the same time confirmed to him by a person whom the very agent for the a party had entrusted with the secret m no sooner detected it than he communicated his discovery to one of mr a s counsel a man of great worth and immediately thereupon took proper measures to defeat it he then found means to lay open to mr a himself the treacherous scheme that was laid for his destruction he was highly sensible of it and could never afterwards reflect on the snare that he had so unwarily been drawn into and had so narrowly escaped without a mixture of horror shame and gratitude to his deliverer the consummate assurance of the monsters who were engaged in this plot after they had been detected and upbraided with their treachery is scarce to be paralleled for they not only owned the fact of spiriting mr a away in the manner above mentioned but justified their doing it as tending to his service they also maintained that they had actually secured the twentyfive thousand pounds for him though they never could name any one person who was to have advanced the money no man was more active in this scheme than h nor any man more solicitous to keep mr a up in the false impressions he had received or in projecting methods to ruin his protector than he among many other expedients for that purpose a most malicious attempt was made to lodge an information against him for treasonable practices with the secretary of state notwithstanding the repeated proofs he had given of his loyalty and as a preparatory step to his accusation a letter which this traitor dictated was copied by another person and actually sent to the earl of c importing that the person who copied the letter had an affair of consequence to communicate to his lordship if he would appoint a time of receiving the information but that person upon full conviction of the villainy of the scheme absolutely refused to proceed further in it so that his malice once more proved abortive and before he had time to execute any other contrivance of the same nature he was imprisoned in this very jail for debt here finding his creditors inexorable and himself destitute of all other resource he made application to the very man whom he had injured in such an outrageous manner set forth his deplorable case in the most pathetic terms and entreated him with the most abject humility to use his influence in his behalf the distress of this varlet immediately disarmed m of his resentment and even excited his compassion without sending any answer to his remonstrances he interceded for him with his creditors and the person to whom he was chiefly indebted refusing to release him without security this unwearied benefactor joined with the prisoner in a bond for above two hundred and forty pounds for which he obtained his release he was no sooner discharged however than he entered into fresh combinations with g and others in order to thwart his deliverer in his schemes of raising money and otherwise to distress and deprive him of liberty for which purpose no art or industry perjury not excepted hath been spared and what is still more extraordinary this perfidious monster having found money to take up the bond in consequence of which he regained his freedom hath procured a writ against m upon that very obligation and taken assignments to some other debts of that gentleman with the same christian intention but hitherto he hath by surprising sagacity and unshaken resolution baffled all their infernal contrivances and retorted some of their machinations on their own heads at this time when he is supposed by some and represented by others as under the circumstances of oblivion and despondence he proceeds in his design with the utmost calmness and intrepidity meditating schemes and ripening measures that will one day confound his enemies and attract the notice and admiration of mankind peregrine having thanked the priest for his obliging information expressed his surprise at the scandalous inattention of the world to an affair of such importance observing that by such inhuman neglect this unfortunate young gentleman mr a was absolutely deprived of all the benefit of society the sole end of which is to protect the rights redress the grievances and promote the happiness of individuals as for the character of m he said it was so romantically singular in all its circumstances that though other motives were wanting curiosity alone would induce him to seek his acquaintance but he did not at all wonder at the ungrateful returns which had been made to his generosity by h and many others whom he had served in a manner that few besides himself would have done for he had been long convinced of the truth conveyed in these lines of a celebrated italian author li beneficii che per la loro grandezza non ponno esser guiderdonati con la scelerata moneta dell ingratitudine sono pagati the story which you have related of that young gentleman said he bears a very strong resemblance to the fate of a spanish nobleman as it was communicated to me by one of his own intimate friends at paris the countess dalvarez died immediately after the birth of a son and the husband surviving her but three years the child was left sole heir to the honours and estate under the guardianship of his uncle who had a small fortune and a great many children this inhuman relation coveting the wealth of his infant ward formed a design against the life of the helpless orphan and trusted the execution of it to his valetdechambre who was tempted to undertake the murder by the promise of a considerable reward he accordingly stabbed the boy with a knife in three different places on the right side of his neck but as he was not used to such barbarous attempts his hand failed in the performance and he was seized with such remorse that perceiving the wounds were not mortal he carried the hapless victim to the house of a surgeon by whose care they were healed and in the meantime that he might not forfeit his recompense found means to persuade his employer that his orders were performed a bundle being made up for the purpose was publicly interred as the body of the child who was said to have been suddenly carried off by a convulsion and the uncle without opposition succeeded to his honours and estate the boy being cured of his hurts was about the age of six delivered with a small sum of money to a merchant just embarking for turkey who was given to understand that he was the bastard of a man of quality and that for family reasons it was necessary to conceal his birth while the unfortunate orphan remained in this deplorable state of bondage all the children of the usurper died one after another and he himself being taken dangerously ill attributed all his afflictions to the just judgment of god and communicated his anxiety on that subject to the valetdechambre who had been employed in the murder of his nephew that domestic in order to quiet his masters conscience and calm the perturbation of his spirits confessed what he had done and gave him hopes of still finding the boy by dint of industry and expense the unhappy child being the only hope of the family of alvarez the uncle immediately ordered a minute inquiry to be set on foot in consequence of which he was informed that the orphan had been sold to a turk who had afterwards transferred him to an english merchant by whom he was conveyed to london an express was immediately despatched to this capital where he understood that the unhappy exile had in consideration of his faithful services been bound apprentice to a french barbersurgeon and after he had sufficiently qualified himself in that profession been received into the family of the count de gallas at that time the emperors ambassador at the court of london from the house of this nobleman he was traced into the service of count doberstorf where he had married his ladys chambermaid and then gone to settle as a surgeon in bohemia in the course of these inquiries several years elapsed his uncle who was very much attached to the house of austria lived at barcelona when the father of this empressqueen resided in that city and lent him a very considerable sum of money in the most pressing emergency of his affairs and when that prince was on the point of returning to germany the old count finding his end approaching sent his father confessor to his majesty with a circumstantial account of the barbarity he had practised against his nephew for which he implored forgiveness and begged he would give orders that the orphan when found should inherit the dignities and fortune which he had unjustly usurped his majesty assured the old man that he might make himself easy on that score and ordered the confessor to follow him to vienna immediately after the counts death in order to assist his endeavours in finding out the injured heir the priest did not fail to yield obedience to this command he informed himself of certain natural marks on the young counts body which were known to the nurse and women who attended him in his infancy and with a gentleman whom the emperor ordered to accompany him set out for bohemia where he soon found the object of his inquiry in the capacity of majordomo to a nobleman of that country he having quitted his profession of surgery for that office he was not a little surprised when he found himself circumstantially catechised about the particulars of his life by persons commissioned for that purpose by the emperor he told them that he was absolutely ignorant of his own birth though he had been informed during his residence in turkey that he was the bastard of a spanish grandee and gave them a minute detail of the pilgrimage he had undergone this information agreeing with the intelligence which the priest had already received and being corroborated by the marks upon his body and the very scars of the wounds which had been inflicted upon him in his infancy the confessor without further hesitation saluted him by the name of count dalvarez grandee of spain and explained the whole mystery of his fortune if he was agreeably amazed at this explanation the case was otherwise with his wife who thought herself in great danger of being abandoned by a husband of such high rank but he immediately dispelled her apprehension by assuring her that as she had shared in his adversity she should also partake of his good fortune he set out immediately for vienna to make his acknowledgments to the emperor who favoured him with a very gracious reception promised to use his influence so that he might enjoy the honours and estate of his family and in the meantime acknowledged himself his debtor for four hundred thousand florins which he had borrowed from his uncle he threw himself at the feet of his august protector expressed the most grateful sense of his goodness and begged he might be permitted to settle in some of his imperial majestys dominions this request was immediately granted he was allowed to purchase land in any part of the hereditary dominions of the house of austria to the amount of the sum i have mentioned and made choice of the country of ratibor in silesia where in all probability he still resides peregrine had scarce finished the narrative when he perceived mr m slip something into the hand of the young man with whom he had been conversing at the other end of the room and rise up from the table in order to take his leave he at once understood the meaning of this conveyance and longed for an opportunity to be acquainted with such a rare instance of primitive benevolence but the consciousness of his present situation hindered him from making any advance that might be construed into forwardness or presumption chapter xcix he is surprised with the appearance of hatchway and pipes who take up their habitation in his neighbourhood contrary to his inclination and express desire being now regularly initiated in the mysteries of the fleet and reconciled in some measure to the customs of the place he began to bear the edge of reflection without wincing and thinking it would be highly imprudent in him to defer any longer the purposes by which only he could enjoy any ease and satisfaction in his confinement he resolved to resume his task of translating and every week compose an occasional paper by way of revenge upon the minister against whom he had denounced eternal war with this view he locked himself up in his chamber and went to work with great eagerness and application when he was interrupted by a ticket porter who putting a letter in his hand vanished in a moment before he had time to peruse the contents our hero opening the billet was not a little surprised to find a banknote for fifty pounds enclosed in a blank sheet of paper and having exercised his memory and penetration on the subject of this unexpected windfall had just concluded that it could come from no other hand than the lady who had so kindly visited him a few days before when his ears were suddenly invaded by the wellknown sound of that whistle which always hung about the neck of pipes as a memorial of his former occupation this tune being performed he heard the noise of a wooden leg ascending the stair upon which he opened his door and beheld his friend hatchway with his old shipmate at his back after a cordial shake of the hand with the usual salutation of what cheer cousin pickle honest jack seated himself without ceremony and casting his eyes around the apartment split my topstaysail said he with an arch sneer you have got into a snug berth cousin here you may sit all weathers without being turned out to take your watch and no fear of the ships dragging her anchor you hant much room to spare tis true an i had known as how you stowed so close tom should have slung my own hammock for you and then you mought have knocked down this great lubberly hurricane house but mayhap you turn in double and so you dont choose to trust yourself and your doxy to a clue and canvas pickle bore his jokes with great goodhumour rallied him in his turn about the dairymaid at the garrison inquiring about his friends in the country asked if he had been to visit his niece and finally expressed a desire of knowing the cause of his journey to london the lieutenant satisfied his curiosity in all these particulars and in answer to the last question observed that from the information of pipes understanding he was landlocked he had come from the country in order to tow him into the offing i know not how the wind sets said he but if so be as three thousand pounds will bring you clear of the cape say the word and you shant lie windbound another glass for want of the money this was an offer which few people in our heros situation would have altogether refused especially as he had all the reason in the world to believe that far from being a vain unmeaning compliment it was the genuine tribute of friendship which the lieutenant would have willingly ay and with pleasure paid nevertheless peregrine peremptorily refused his assistance though not without expressing himself in terms of acknowledgment suitable to the occasion he told him it would be time enough to make use of his generosity when he should find himself destitute of all other resource jack employed all his rhetoric with a view of persuading him to take this opportunity to procure his own enlargement and finding his arguments ineffectual insisted upon his accepting an immediate supply for his necessary occasions swearing with great vehemence that he would never return to the garrison unless he would put him upon the footing of any other tenant and receive his rent accordingly our young gentleman as positively swore that he never would consider him in that light remonstrating that he had long ago settled the house upon him for life as a pledge of his own esteem as well as in conformity with the commodores desire and beseeching him to return to his usual avocations protested that if ever his situation should subject him to the necessity of borrowing from his friends mr hatchway should be the first man to whom he would apply himself for succour to convince him that this was not the case at present he produced the banknote which he had received in the letter together with his own ready money and mentioned some other funds which he invented extempore in order to amuse the lieutenants concern in the close of this expostulation he desired pipes to conduct mr hatchway to the coffeehouse where he might amuse himself with the newspaper for half an hour during which he would put on his clothes and bespeak something for dinner that they might enjoy each others company as long as his occasions would permit him to stay in that place the two sailors were no sooner gone than he took up the pen and wrote the following letter in which he enclosed the banknote to his generous benefactress madam your humanity is not more ingenious than my suspicion in vain you attempt to impose upon me by an act of generosity which no person on earth but your ladyship is capable of committing though your name was not subscribed on the paper your sentiments were fully displayed in the contents which i must beg leave to restore with the same sense of gratitude and for the same reasons i expressed when last i had the honour to converse with you upon this subject though i am deprived of my liberty by the villainy and ingratitude of mankind i am not yet destitute of the other conveniences of life and therefore beg to be excused for incurring an unnecessary addition to that load of obligation you have already laid upon madam your ladyships most devoted humble servant peregrine pickle having dressed himself and repaired to the place of appointment he despatched this epistle by the hands of pipes who was ordered to leave it at her ladyships house without staying for an answer and in the meantime gave directions for dinner which he and his friend hatchway ate very cheerfully in his own apartment after he had entertained him with a sight of all the curiosities in the place during their repast jack repeated his kind offers to our adventurer who declined them with his former obstinacy and begged he might be no more importuned on that subject but if he insisted upon giving some fresh proofs of his friendship he might have an opportunity of exhibiting it in taking pipes under his care and protection for nothing affected him so much as his inability to provide for such a faithful adherent the lieutenant desired he would give himself no trouble upon that score he being of his own accord perfectly well disposed to befriend his old shipmate who should never want while he had a shilling to spare but he began to drop some hints of an intention to fix his quarters in the fleet observing that the air seemed to be very good in that place and that he was tired of living in the country what he said did not amount to a plain declaration and therefore peregrine did not answer it as such though he perceived his drift and took an opportunity of describing the inconveniences of the place in such a manner as he hoped would deter him from putting such an extravagant plan in execution this expedient however far from answering the end proposed had a quite contrary effect and furnished hatchway with an argument against his own unwillingness to quit such a disagreeable place in all probability jack would have been more explicit with regard to the scheme he had proposed if the conversation had not been interrupted by the arrival of cadwallader who never failed in the performance of his diurnal visit hatchway conjecturing that this stranger might have some private business with his friend quitted the apartment on pretence of taking a turn and meeting pipes at the door desired his company to the bare by which name the open space is distinguished where during a course of perambulation these two companions held a council upon pickle in consequence of which it was determined since he obstinately persisted to refuse their assistance that they should take lodgings in his neighbourhood with a view of being at hand to minister unto his occasions in spite of his false delicacy according to the emergency of his affairs this resolution being taken they consulted the barkeeper of the coffeehouse about lodging and she directed them to the warden to whom the lieutenant in his great wisdom represented himself as a kinsman to peregrine who rather than leave that young gentleman by himself to the unavoidable discomforts of a prison was inclined to keep him company till such time as his affairs could be put in order this measure he the more anxiously desired to take because the prisoner was sometimes subject to a disordered imagination upon which occasion he stood in need of extraordinary attendance and therefore he the lieutenant entreated the warden to accommodate him with a lodging for himself and his servant for which he was ready to make any reasonable acknowledgment the warden who was a sensible and humane man could not help applauding his resolution and several rooms being at that time unoccupied he put him immediately in possession of a couple which were forthwith prepared for his reception this affair being settled to his satisfaction he despatched pipes for his portmanteau and returning to the coffeehouse found peregrine with whom he spent the remaining part of the evening our hero taking it for granted that he proposed to set out for the garrison next day wrote a memorandum of some books which he had left in that habitation and which he now desired jack to send up to town by the waggon directed for mr crabtree he cautioned him against giving the least hint of his misfortune in the neighbourhood that it might remain as long as possible concealed from the knowledge of his sister who he knew would afflict herself immoderately at the news nor reach the ears of the rest of his family who would exult and triumph over his distress hatchway listened to his injunctions with great attention and promised to demean himself accordingly then the discourse shifted to an agreeable recapitulation of the merry scenes they had formerly acted together and the evening being pretty far advanced peregrine with seeming reluctance told him that the gates of the fleet would in a few minutes be shut for the night and that there was an absolute necessity for his withdrawing to his lodging jack replied that he could not think of parting with him so soon after such a long separation and that he was determined to stay with him an hour or two longer if he should be obliged to take up his lodging in the streets pickle rather than disoblige his guest indulged him in his desire and resolved to give him a share of his own bed a pair of chickens and asparagus were bespoke for supper at which pipes attended with an air of internal satisfaction and the bottle was bandied about in a jovial manner till midnight when the lieutenant rose up to take his leave observing that being fatigued with riding he was inclined to turn in pipes upon this intimation produced a lanthorn ready lighted and jack shaking his entertainer by the hand wished him good night and promised to visit him again betimes in the morning peregrine imagining that his behaviour proceeded from the wine which he had plentifully drunk told him that if he was disposed to sleep his bed was ready prepared in the room and ordered his attendant to undress his master upon which mr hatchway gave him to understand that he had no occasion to incommode his friend having already provided a lodging for himself and the young gentleman demanding an explanation he frankly owned what he had done saying you gave me such a dismal account of the place that i could not think of leaving you in it without company our young gentleman who was naturally impatient of benefits and foresaw that this uncommon instance of hatchways friendship would encroach upon the plan which he had formed for his own subsistence by engrossing his time and attention so as that he should not be able to prosecute his labours closeted the lieutenant next day and demonstrated to him the folly and ill consequences of the step he had taken he observed that the world in general would look upon it as the effect of mere madness and if his relations were so disposed they might make it the foundation for a statute of lunacy against him that his absence from the garrison must be a very great detriment to his private affairs and lastly that his presence in the fleet would be a very great hindrance to pickle himself whose hope of regaining his liberty altogether depended upon his being detached from all company and interruption to these remonstrances jack replied that as to the opinion of the world it was no more to him than a rotten netline and if his relations had a mind to have his upper works condemned he did not doubt but he should be able to stand the survey without being declared unfit for service that he had no affairs at the garrison but such as would keep cold and with regard to pickles being interrupted by his presence he gave him his word that he would never come alongside of him except when he should give him the signal for holding discourse in conclusion he signified his resolution to stay where he was at all events without making himself accountable to any person whatsoever peregrine seeing him determined desisted from any further importunity resolving however to tire him out of his plan by reserve and supercilious neglect for he could not bear the thought of being so notoriously obliged by any person upon earth with this view he quitted the lieutenant upon some slight pretence after having told him that he could not have the pleasure of his company at dinner because he was engaged with a particular club of his fellowprisoners jack was a stranger to the punctilios of behaviour and therefore did not take this declaration amiss but had immediate recourse to the advice of his counsellor mr pipes who proposed that he should go to the coffeehouse and kitchen and give the people to understand that he would pay for all such liquor and provisions as mr pickle should order to be sent to his lodging this expedient was immediately practised and as there was no credit in the place hatchway deposited a sum of money by way of security to the cook and the vintner intimating that there was a necessity for taking that method of befriending his cousin peregrine who was subject to strange whims that rendered it impossible to serve him any other way in consequence of these insinuations it was that same day rumoured about the fleet that mr pickle was an unhappy gentleman disordered in his understanding and that the lieutenant was his near relation who had subjected himself to the inconvenience of living in a jail with the sole view of keeping a strict eye over his conduct this report however did not reach the ears of our hero till the next day when he sent one of the runners of the fleet who attended him to bespeak and pay for a couple of pullets and something else for dinner to which he had already invited his friend hatchway in hope of being able to persuade him to retire into the country after he had undergone a whole days mortification in the place the messenger returned with an assurance that the dinner should be made ready according to his directions and restored the money observing that his kinsman had paid for what was bespoke peregrine was equally surprised and disgusted at this information and resolved to chide the lieutenant severely for his unseasonable treat which he considered as a thing repugnant to his reputation meanwhile he despatched his attendant for wine to the coffeehouse and finding his credit bolstered up in that place by the same means was enraged at the presumption of jacks friendship he questioned the valet about it with such manifestation of displeasure that the fellow afraid of disobliging such a good master frankly communicated the story which was circulated at his expense the young gentleman was so much incensed at this piece of intelligence that he wrote a bitter expostulation to the lieutenant where he not only retracted his invitation but declared that he would never converse with him while he should remain within the place having thus obeyed the dictates of his anger he gave notice to the cook that he should not have occasion for what was ordered repairing to the coffeehouse he told the landlord that whereas he understood the stranger with the wooden leg had prepossessed him and others with ridiculous notions tending to bring the sanity of his intellects in question and to confirm this imputation had under the pretence of consanguinity undertaken to defray his expenses he could not help in justice to himself declaring that the same person was in reality the madman who had given his keepers the slip that therefore he the landlord would not find his account in complying with his orders and encouraging him to frequent his house and that for his own part he would never enter the door or favour him with the least trifle of his custom if ever he should for the future find himself anticipated in his payments by that unhappy lunatic the vintner was confounded at this retorted charge and after much perplexity and deliberation concluded that both parties were distracted the stranger in paying a mans debts against his will and pickle in being offended at such forwardness of friendship chapter c these associates commit an assault upon crabtree for which they are banished from the fleet peregrine begins to feel the effects of confinement our adventurer having dined at an ordinary and in the afternoon retired to his own apartment as usual with his friend cadwallader hatchway and his associate after they had been obliged to discuss the provision for which they had paid renewed their conference upon the old subject pipes giving his messmate to understand that peregrines chief confidant was the old deaf bachelor whom he had seen at his lodging the preceding day mr hatchway in his great penetration discovered that the young gentlemans obstinacy proceeded from the advice of the misanthrope whom for that reason it was their business to chastise pipes entered into this opinion the more willingly as he had all along believed the senior to be a sort of wizard or some cacodaemon whom it was not very creditable to be acquainted with indeed he had been inspired with this notion by the insinuations of hadgi who had formerly dropped some hints touching crabtrees profound knowledge in the magic art mentioning in particular his being possessed of the philosophers stone an assertion to which tom had given implicit credit until his master was sent to prison for debt when he could no longer suppose cadwallader lord of such a valuable secret or else he would have certainly procured the enlargement of his most intimate friend with these sentiments he espoused the resentment of hatchway they determined to seize the supposed conjurer with the first opportunity on his return from his visit to peregrine and without hesitation exercise upon him the discipline of the pump this plan they would have executed that same evening had not the misanthrope luckily withdrawn himself by accident before it was dark and even before they had intelligence of his retreat but next day they kept themselves upon the watch till he appeared and pipes lifting his hat as crabtree passed o d ye old dunny said he you and i must grapple by and by and agad i shall lie so near your quarter that your earports will let in the sound thof they are double caulked with oakum the misanthropes ears were not quite so fast closed but that they received this intimation which though delivered in terms that he did not well understand had such an effect upon his apprehension that he signified his doubts to peregrine observing that he did not much like the looks of that same ruffian with the wooden leg pickle assured him he had nothing to fear from the two sailors who could have no cause of resentment against him or if they had would not venture to take any step which they knew must block up all the avenues to that reconcilement about which they were so anxious and moreover give such offence to the governor of the place as would infallibly induce him to expel them both from his territories notwithstanding this assurance the young gentleman was not so confident of the lieutenants discretion as to believe that crabtrees fears were altogether without foundation he forthwith conjectured that jack had taken umbrage at an intimacy from which he found himself excluded and imputed his disgrace to the insinuations of cadwallader whom in all likelihood he intended to punish for his supposed advice he knew his friend could sustain no great damage from the lieutenants resentment in a place which he could immediately alarm with his cries and therefore wished he might fall into the snare because it would furnish him with a pretence of complaint in consequence of which the sailors would be obliged to shift their quarters so as that he should be rid of their company in which he at present could find no enjoyment everything happened as he had foreseen the misanthrope in his retreat from peregrines chamber was assaulted by hatchway and his associate who seized him by the collar without ceremony and began to drag him towards the pump at which they would have certainly complimented him with a very disagreeable bath had not he exalted his voice in such a manner as in a moment brought a number of the inhabitants and pickle himself to his aid the assailants would have persisted in their design had the opposition been such as they could have faced with any possibility of success nor did they quit their prey before a dozen at least had come to his rescue and peregrine with a menacing aspect and air of authority commanded his old valet to withdraw then they thought proper to sheer off and betake themselves to close quarters while our hero accompanied the affrighted cadwallader to the gate and exhibited to the warden a formal complaint against the rioters upon whom he retorted the charge of lunacy which was supported by the evidence of twenty persons who had been eyewitnesses of the outrage committed against the old gentleman the governor in consequence of this information sent a message to mr hatchway warning him to move his lodging next day on pain of being expelled the lieutenant contumaciously refusing to comply with this intimation was in the morning while he amused himself in walking upon the bare suddenly surrounded by the constables of the court who took him and his adherent prisoners before they were aware and delivered them into the hands of the turnkeys by whom they were immediately dismissed and their baggage conveyed to the side of the ditch this expulsion was not performed without an obstinate opposition on the part of the delinquents who had they not been surprised would have set the whole fleet at defiance and in all probability have acted divers tragedies before they could have been overpowered things being circumstanced as they were the lieutenant did not part with his conductor without tweaking his nose by way of farewell and pipes in imitation of such a laudable example communicated a token of remembrance in an application to the sole eye of his attendant who scorning to be outdone in this kind of courtesy returned the compliment with such goodwill that toms organ performed the office of a multiplyingglass these were mutual hints for stripping and accordingly each was naked from the waist upwards in a trice a ring of butchers from the market was immediately formed a couple of the reverend flamens who in morning gowns ply for marriages in that quarter of the town constituted themselves seconds and umpires of the approaching contest and the battle began without further preparation the combatants were in point of strength and agility pretty equally matched but the jailor had been regularly trained in the art of bruising he had more than once signalized himself in public by his prowess and skill in this exercise and lost one eye upon the stage in the course of his exploits this was a misfortune of which pipes did not fail to take the advantage he had already sustained several hard knocks upon his temples and jaws and found it impracticable to smite his antagonist upon the victuallingoffice so dexterously was it defended against assault he then changed his battery and being ambidexter raised such a clatter upon the turnkeys blind side that this hero believing him lefthanded converted his attention that way and opposed the unenlightened side of his face to the right hand of pipes which being thus unprovided against slyly bestowed upon him a peg under the fifth rib that in an instant laid him senseless on the pavement at the feet of his conqueror pipes was congratulated upon his victory not only by his friend hatchway but also by all the bystanders particularly the priest who had espoused his cause and now invited the strangers to his lodgings in a neighbouring alehouse where they were entertained so much to their liking that they determined to seek no other habitation while they should continue in town and notwithstanding the disgrace and discouragement they had met with in their endeavours to serve our adventurer they were still resolved to persevere in their good offices or in the vulgar phrase to see him out while they settled themselves in this manner and acquired familiar connections round all the purlieus of the ditch peregrine found himself deprived of the company of cadwallader who signified by letter that he did not choose to hazard his person again in visiting him while such assassins occupied the avenues through which he must pass for he had been at pains to inquire into the motions of the seamen and informed himself exactly of the harbour in which they were moored our hero had been so much accustomed to the conversation of crabtree which was altogether suitable to the singularity of his own disposition that he could very ill afford to be debarred of it at this juncture when almost every other source of enjoyment was stopped he was however obliged to submit to the hardships of his situation and as the characters of his fellowprisoners did not at all improve upon him he was compelled to seek for satisfaction within himself not but that he had an opportunity of conversing with some people who neither wanted sense nor were deficient in point of principle yet there appeared in the behaviour of them all without exception a certain want of decorum a squalor of sentiment a sort of jailish cast contracted in the course of confinement which disgusted the delicacy of our heros observation he therefore detached himself from their parties as much as he could without giving offence to those among whom he was obliged to live and resumed his labours with incredible eagerness and perseverance his spirits being supported by the success of some severe philippics which he occasionally published against the author of his misfortune nor was his humanity unemployed in the vacations of his revenge a man must be void of all sympathy and compassion who can reside among so many miserable objects without feeling an inclination to relieve their distress every day almost presented to his view such lamentable scenes as were most likely to attract his notice and engage his benevolence reverses of fortune attended with the most deplorable circumstances of domestic woe were continually intruding upon his acquaintance his ears were invaded with the cries of the hapless wife who from the enjoyment of affluence and pleasure was forced to follow her husband to this abode of wretchedness and want his eyes were every minute assailed with the naked and meagre appearances of hunger and cold and his fancy teemed with a thousand aggravations of their misery thus situated his purse was never shut while his heart remained open without reflecting upon the slenderness of his store he exercised his charity to all the children of distress and acquired a popularity which though pleasing was far from being profitable in short his bounty kept no pace with his circumstances and in a little time he was utterly exhausted he had recourse to his bookseller from whom with great difficulty he obtained a small reinforcement and immediately relapsed into the same want of retention he was conscious of his infirmity and found it incurable he foresaw that by his own industry he should never be able to defray the expense of these occasions and this reflection sunk deep into his mind the approbation of the public which he had earned or might acquire like a cordial often repeated began to lose its effect upon his imagination his health suffered by his sedentary life and austere application his eyesight failed his appetite forsook him his spirits decayed so that he became melancholy listless and altogether incapable of prosecuting the only means he had left for his subsistence and what did not at all contribute to the alleviation of these particulars he was given to understand by his lawyer that he had lost his cause and was condemned in costs even this was not the most mortifying piece of intelligence he received he at the same time learned that his bookseller was bankrupt and his friend crabtree at the point of death these were comfortable considerations to a youth of peregrines disposition which was so capricious that the more his misery increased the more haughty and inflexible he became rather than be beholden to hatchway who still hovered about the gate eager for an opportunity to assist him he chose to undergo the want of almost every convenience of life and actually pledged his wearing apparel to an irish pawnbroker in the fleet for money to purchase those things without which he must have absolutely perished he was gradually irritated by his misfortunes into a rancorous resentment against mankind in general and his heart so alienated from the enjoyments of life that he did not care how soon he quitted his miserable existence though he had shocking examples of the vicissitudes of fortune continually before his eyes he could never be reconciled to the idea of living like his fellowsufferers in the most abject degree of dependence if he refused to accept of favours from his own allies and intimate friends whom he had formerly obliged it is not to be supposed that he would listen to proposals of that kind from any of his fellowprisoners with whom he had contracted acquaintance he was even more cautious than ever of incurring obligations he now shunned his former messmates in order to avoid disagreeable tenders of friendship imagining that he perceived an inclination in the clergyman to learn the state of his finances he discouraged and declined the explanation and at length secluded himself from all society chapter ci he receives an unexpected visit and the clouds of misfortune begin to separate while he pined in this forlorn condition with an equal abhorrence of the world and himself captain gauntlet arrived in town in order to employ his interest for promotion in the army and in consequence of his wifes particular desire made it his business to inquire for peregrine to whom he longed to be reconciled even though at the expense of a slight submission but he could hear no tidings of him at the place to which he was directed and on the supposition that our hero had gone to reside in the country applied himself to his own business with intention to renew his inquiries after that affair should be transacted he communicated his demands to his supposed patron who had assumed the merit of making him a captain and been gratified with a valuable present on that consideration and was cajoled with hopes of succeeding in his present aim by the same interest meanwhile he became acquainted with one of the clerks belonging to the war office whose advice and assistance he was told would be a furtherance to his scheme as he had occasion to discourse with this gentleman upon the circumstances of his expectation he learned that the nobleman upon whom he depended was a person of no consequence in the state and altogether incapable of assisting him in his advancement at the same time his counsellor expressed his surprise that captain gauntlet did not rather interest in his cause the noble peer to whose good offices he owed his last commission this remark introduced an explanation by which godfrey discovered to his infinite astonishment the mistake in which he had continued so long with regard to his patron though he could not divine the motive which induced a nobleman with whom he had no acquaintance or connection to interpose his influence in his behalf whatsoever that might be he thought it was his duty to make his acknowledgment and for that purpose went next morning to his house where he was politely received and given to understand that mr pickle was the person to whose friendship he was indebted for his last promotion inexpressible were the transports of gratitude affection and remorse that took possession of the soul of gauntlet when this mystery was unfolded good heaven cried he lifting up his hands have i lived so long in a state of animosity with my benefactor i intended to have reconciled myself at any rate before i was sensible of this obligation but now i shall not enjoy a moments quiet until i have an opportunity of expressing to him my sense of his heroic friendship i presume from the nature of the favour conferred upon him in my behalf that mr pickle is well known to your lordship and i should think myself extremely happy if you could inform me in what part of the country he is to be found for the person with whom he lodged some time ago could give me no intelligence of his motions the nobleman touched with this instance of generous selfdenial in peregrine as well as with the sensibility of his friend lamented the unhappiness of our hero while he gave gauntlet to understand that he had been long disordered in his intellects in consequence of having squandered away his fortune and that his creditors had thrown him into the fleet prison but whether he still continued in that confinement or was released from his misfortunes by death his lordship did not know because he had never inquired godfrey no sooner received this intimation than his blood boiling with grief and impatience he craved pardon for his abrupt departure then quitting his informer on the instant reembarked in his hackneycoach and ordered himself to be conveyed directly to the fleet as the vehicle proceeded along one side of the market he was surprised with the appearance of hatchway and pipes who stood cheapening cauliflowers at a greenstall their heads being cased in worsted nightcaps half covered with their hats and a short tobaccopipe in the mouth of each he was rejoiced at sight of the two seamen which he took for a happy omen of finding his friend and ordering the coachman to stop the carriage called to the lieutenant by his name jack replying with an hilloah looking behind him and recognizing the face of his old acquaintance ran up to the coach with great eagerness shaking the captain heartily by the hand odds heart said he i am glad thou hast fallen in with us we shall now be able to find the trim of the vessel and lay her about on tother tack for my own part i have had many a consort in my time that is in the way of good fellowship and i always made a shift to ware em at one time or another but this headstrong toad will neither obey the helm nor the sheet and for aught i know will founder where a lies at anchor gauntlet who conceived part of his meaning alighted immediately and being conducted to the sailors lodging was informed of everything that had passed between the lieutenant and pickle he in his turn communicated to jack the discovery which he had made with regard to his commission at which the other gave no signs of surprise but taking the pipe from his mouth why look ye captain said he thats not the only good turn you have owed him that same money you received from the commodore as an old debt was all a sham contrived by pickle for your service but a wool drive under his bare poles without sails and rigging or a mess of provision on board rather than take the same assistance from another man godfrey was not only amazed but chagrined at the knowledge of this anecdote which gave umbrage to his pride while it stimulated his desire of doing something in return for the obligation he inquired into the present circumstances of the prisoner and understanding that he was indisposed and but indifferently provided with the common necessaries of life though still deaf to all offers of assistance began to be extremely concerned at the account of this savage obstinacy and pride which would he feared exclude him from the privilege of relieving him in his distress however he resolved to leave no expedient untried that might have any tendency to surmount such destructive prejudice and entering the jail was directed to the apartment of the wretched prisoner he knocked softly at the door and when it was opened started back with horror and astonishment the figure that presented itself to his view was the remains of his once happy friend but so miserably altered and disguised that his features were scarce cognisable the florid the sprightly the gay the elevated youth was now metamorphosed into a wan dejected meagre squalid spectre the holloweyed representative of distemper indigence and despair yet his eyes retained a certain ferocity which threw a dismal gleam athwart the cloudiness of his aspect and he in silence viewed his old companion with a look betokening confusion and disdain as for gauntlet he could not without emotion behold such a woeful reverse of fate in a person for whom he entertained the noblest sentiments of friendship gratitude and esteem his sorrow was at first too big for utterance and he shed a flood of tears before he could pronounce one word peregrine in spite of his misanthropy could not help being affected with this uncommon testimony of regard but he strove to stifle his sensations his brows contracted themselves into a severe frown his eyes kindled into the appearance of live coals he waved with his hand in signal for godfrey to be gone and leave such a wretch as him to the miseries of his fate and finding nature too strong to be suppressed uttered a deep groan and wept aloud the soldier seeing him thus melted unable to restrain the strong impulse of his affection sprung towards and clasping him in his arms my dearest friend and best benefactor said he i am come hither to humble myself for the offence i was so unhappy as to give at our last parting to beg a reconciliation to thank you for the case and affluence i have enjoyed through your means and to rescue you in spite of yourself from this melancholy situation of which but an hour ago i was utterly ignorant do not deny me the satisfaction of acquitting myself in point of duty and obligation you must certainly have had some regard for a person in whose favour you have exerted yourself so much and if any part of that esteem remains you will not refuse him an opportunity of approving himself in some measure worthy of it let me not suffer the most mortifying of all repulses that of slighted friendship but kindly sacrifice your resentment and inflexibility to the request of one who is at all times ready to sacrifice his life for your honour and advantage if you will not yield to my entreaties have some regard to the wishes of my sophy who laid me under the strongest injunctions to solicit your forgiveness even before she knew how much i was indebted to your generosity or if that consideration should be of no weight i hope you will relax a little for the sake of poor emilia whose resentment hath been long subdued by her affection and who now droops in secret at your neglect every word of this address delivered in the most pathetic manner made an impression upon the mind of peregrine he was affected with the submission of his friend who in reality had given him no just cause to complain he knew that no ordinary motive had swayed him to a condescension so extraordinary in a man of his punctilious temper he considered it therefore as the genuine effect of eager gratitude and disinterested love and his heart began to relent accordingly when he heard himself conjured in the name of the gentle sophy his obstinacy was quite overcome and when emilia was recalled to his remembrance his whole frame underwent a violent agitation he took his friend by the hand with a softened look and as soon as he recovered the faculty of speech which had been overpowered in the conflict of passions that transported him protested that he retained no vestige of animosity but considered him in the light of an affectionate comrade the ties of whose friendship adversity could not unbind he mentioned sophy in the most respectful terms spoke of emilia with the most reverential awe as the object of his inviolable love and veneration but disclaimed all hope of ever more attracting her regard and excused himself from profiting by godfreys kind intention declaring with a resolute air that he had broken off all connection with mankind and that he impatiently longed for the hour of his dissolution which if it should not soon arrive by the course of nature he was resolved to hasten with his own hands rather than be exposed to the contempt and more intolerable pity of a rascally world gauntlet argued against this frantic determination with all the vehemence of expostulating friendship but his remonstrances did not produce the desired effect upon our desperate hero who calmly refuted all his arguments and asserted the rectitude of his design from the pretended maxims of reason and true philosophy while this dispute was carried on with eagerness on one side and deliberation on the other a letter was brought to peregrine who threw it carelessly aside unopened though the superscription was in a handwriting to which he was a stranger and in all probability the contents would never have been perused had not gauntlet insisted upon his waiving all ceremony and reading it forthwith thus solicited pickle unsealed the billet which to his no small surprise contained the following intimation sir this comes to inform you that after many dangers and disappointments i am by the blessing of god safely arrived in the downs on board of the gomberoon indiaman having made a tolerable voyage by which i hope i shall be enabled to repay with interest the seven hundred pounds which i borrowed of you before my departure from england i take this opportunity of writing by our purser who goes express with despatches for the company that you may have this satisfactory notice as soon as possible relating to one whom i suppose you have long given over as lost i have enclosed it in a letter to my broker who i hope knows your address and will forward it accordingly and i am with respect sir your most humble servant benjamin chintz he had no sooner taken a cursory view of this agreeable epistle than his countenance cleared up and reaching it to his friend with a smile there said he is a more convincing argument on your side of the question than all the casuists in the universe can advance gauntlet wondering at this observation took the paper and casting his eyes greedily upon the contents congratulated him upon the receipt of it with extravagant demonstrations of joy not on account of the sum said he which upon my honour i would with pleasure pay three times over for your convenience and satisfaction but because it seems to have reconciled you to life and disposed your mind for enjoying the comforts of society the instantaneous effect which this unexpected smile of fortune produced in the appearance of our adventurer is altogether inconceivable it plumped up his cheeks in a moment unbended and enlightened every feature of his face elevated his head which had begun to sink as it were between his shoulders and from a squeaking dispirited tone swelled up his voice to a clear manly accent godfrey taking advantage of this favourable change began to regale him with prospects of future success he reminded him of his youth and qualifications which were certainly designed for better days than those he had as yet seen he pointed out various paths by which he might arrive at wealth and reputation he importuned him to accept of a sum for his immediate occasions and earnestly begged that he would allow him to discharge the debt for which he was confined observing that sophys fortune had enabled him to exhibit that proof of his gratitude without any detriment to his affairs and protesting that he should not believe himself in possession of mr pickles esteem unless he was permitted to make some such return of goodwill to the man who had not only raised him from indigence and scorn to competence and reputable rank but also empowered him to obtain the possession of an excellent woman who had filled up the measure of his felicity peregrine declared himself already overpaid for all his good offices by the pleasure he enjoyed in employing them and the happy effects they had produced in the mutual satisfaction of two persons so dear to his affection and assured his friend that one time or other he would set his conscience at ease and remove the scruples of his honour by having recourse to his assistance but at present he could not make use of his friendship without giving just cause of offence to honest hatchway who was prior to him in point of solicitation and had manifested his attachment with surprising obstinacy and perseverance chapter cii peregrine reconciles himself to the lieutenant and renews his connection with society divers plans are projected in his behalf and he has occasion to exhibit a remarkable proof of selfdenial the captain with reluctance yielded the preference in this particular to jack who was immediately invited to a conference by a note subscribed with pickles own hand he was found at the prisongate waiting for gauntlet to know the issue of his negotiation he no sooner received this summons than he set all his sails and made the best of his way to his friends apartment being admitted by the turnkey in consequence of peregrines request communicated by the messenger who carried the billet pipes followed close in the wake of his shipmate and in a few minutes after the note had been despatched peregrine and gauntlet heard the sound of the stump ascending the wooden staircase with such velocity that they at first mistook it for the application of drumsticks to the head of an empty barrel this uncommon speed however was attended with a misfortune he chanced to overlook a small defect in one of the steps and his prop plunging into a hole he fell backwards to the imminent danger of his life tom was luckily at his back and sustained him in his arms so as that he escaped without any other damage than the loss of his wooden leg which was snapped in the middle by the weight of his body in falling and such was his impatience that he would not give himself the trouble to disengage the fractured member unbuckling the whole equipage in a trice he left it sticking in the crevice saying a rotten cable was not worth heaving up and in this natural state of mutilation hopped into the room with infinite expedition peregrine taking him cordially by the hand seated him upon one side of his bed and after having made an apology for that reserve of which he had so justly complained asked if he could conveniently accommodate him with the loan of twenty guineas the lieutenant without opening his mouth pulled out his purse and pipes who overheard the demand applying the whistle to his lips performed a loud overture in token of his joy matters being thus brought to an accommodation our hero told the captain that he should be glad of his company at dinner with their common friend hatchway if he would in the meantime leave him to the ministry of pipes and the soldier went away for the present in order to pay a short visit to his uncle who at that time languished in a declining state of health promising to return at the appointed hour the lieutenant having surveyed the dismal appearance of his friend could not help being moved at the spectacle and began to upbraid him with his obstinate pride which he swore was no better than selfmurder but the young gentleman interrupted him in the course of his moralizing by telling him he had reasons for his conduct which perhaps he would impart in due season but at present his design was to alter that plan of behaviour and make himself some amends for the misery he had undergone he accordingly sent pipes to redeem his clothes from the pawnbrokers wardrobe and bespeak something comfortable for dinner when godfrey came back he was very agreeably surprised to see such a favourable alteration in his externals for by the assistance of his valet he had purified himself from the dregs of his distress and now appeared in a decent suit with clean linen while his face was disencumbered of the hair that overshadowed it and his apartment prepared for the reception of company they enjoyed their meal with great satisfaction entertaining one another with a recapitulation of their former adventures at the garrison in the afternoon gauntlet taking his leave in order to write a letter to his sister at the desire of his uncle who finding his end approaching wanted to see her without loss of time peregrine made his appearance on the bare and was complimented on his coming abroad again not only by his old messmates who had not seen him for many weeks but by a number of those objects whom his liberality had fed before his funds were exhausted hatchway was by his interest with the warden put in possession of his former quarters and pipes despatched to make inquiry about crabtree at his former lodging where he learned that the misanthrope after a very severe fit of illness was removed to kensington gravelpits for the convenience of breathing a purer air than that of london in consequence of this information peregrine who knew the narrowness of the old gentlemans fortune next day desired his friend gauntlet to take the trouble of visiting him in his name with a letter in which he expressed great concern for his indisposition gave him notice of the fortunate intelligence he had received from the downs and conjured him to make use of his purse if he was in the least hampered in his circumstances the captain took coach immediately and set out for the place according to the direction which pipes had procured cadwallader having seen him at bath knew him again at first sight and though reduced to a skeleton believed himself in such a fair way of doing well that he would have accompanied him to the fleet immediately had he not been restrained by his nurse who was by his physician invested with full authority to dispute and oppose his will in everything that she should think prejudicial to his health for he was considered by those who had the care of him as an old humourist not a little distempered in his brain he inquired particularly about the sailors who he said had deterred him from carrying on his usual correspondence with pickle and been the immediate cause of his indisposition by terrifying him into a fever understanding that the breach between pickle and hatchway was happily cemented and that he was no longer in any danger from the lieutenants resentment he promised to be at the fleet with the first convenient opportunity and in the meantime wrote an answer to peregrines letter importing that he was obliged to him for his offer but had not the least occasion for his assistance in a few days our adventurer recovered his vigour complexion and vivacity he mingled again in the diversions and parties of the place and he received in a little time the money he had lent upon bottomry which together with the interest amounted to upwards of eleven hundred pounds the possession of this sum while it buoyed up his spirits involved him in perplexity sometimes he thought it was incumbent on him as a man of honour to employ the greatest part of it in diminishing the debt for which he suffered on the other hand he considered that obligation effaced by the treacherous behaviour of his creditor who had injured him to ten times the value of the sum and in these sentiments entertained thoughts of attempting his escape from prison with a view of conveying himself with the shipwreck of his fortune to another country in which he might use it to better advantage both suggestions were attended with such doubts and difficulties that he hesitated between them and for the present laid out a thousand pounds in stock the interest of which together with the fruits of his own industry he hoped would support him above want in his confinement until something should occur that would point out the expediency of some other determination gauntlet still insisted upon having the honour of obtaining his liberty at the expense of taking up his notes to gleanum and exhorted him to purchase a commission with part of the money which he had retrieved the lieutenant affirmed that it was his privilege to procure the release of his cousin pickle because he enjoyed a very handsome sum by his aunt which of right belonged to the young gentleman to whom he was moreover indebted for the use of his furniture and for the very house that stood over his head and that although he had already made a will in his favour he should never be satisfied nor easy in his mind so long as he remained deprived of his liberty and wanted any of the conveniences of life cadwallader who by this time assisted at their councils and was best acquainted with the peculiarity and unbending disposition of the youth proposed that seeing he was so averse to obligations mr hatchway should purchase of him the garrison with its appendages which at a moderate price would sell for more money than would be sufficient to discharge his debts that if the servile subordination of the army did not suit his inclinations he might with his reversion buy a comfortable annuity and retire with him to the country where he might live absolutely independent and entertain himself as usual with the ridiculous characters of mankind this plan was to pickle less disagreeable than any other project which as yet had been suggested and the lieutenant declared himself ready to execute his part of it without delay but the soldier was mortified at the thoughts of seeing his assistance unnecessary and eagerly objected to the retirement as a scheme that would blast the fairest promises of fame and fortune and bury his youth and talents in solitude and obscurity this earnest opposition on the part of gauntlet hindered our adventurer from forming any immediate resolution which was also retarded by his unwillingness to part with the garrison upon any terms because he looked upon it as a part of his inheritance which he could not dispose of without committing an insult upon the memory of the deceased commodore chapter ciii he is engaged in a very extraordinary correspondence which is interrupted by a very unexpected event while this affair was in agitation the captain told him in the course of conversation that emilia was arrived in town and had inquired about mr pickle with such an eagerness of concern as seemed to proclaim that she was in some measure informed of his misfortune he therefore desired to know if he might be allowed to make her acquainted with his situation provided he should be again importuned by her on that subject which he had at first industriously waived this proof or rather presumption of her sympathizing regard did not fail to operate powerfully upon the bosom of peregrine which was immediately filled with those tumults which love illstifled frequently excites he observed that his disgrace was such as could not be effectually concealed therefore he saw no reason for depriving himself of emilias compassion since he was for ever excluded from her affection and desired godfrey to present to his sister the lowly respects of a despairing lover but notwithstanding his declaration of despondence on this head his imagination involuntarily teemed with more agreeable ideas the proposal of crabtree had taken root in his reflection and he could not help forming plans of pastoral felicity in the arms of the lovely emilia remote from those pompous scenes which he now detested and despised he amused his fancy with the prospect of being able to support her in a state of independency by means of the slender annuity which it was in his power to purchase together with the fruits of those endeavours which would profitably employ his vacant hours and foresaw provision for his growing family in the friendship of the lieutenant who had already constituted him his heir he even parcelled out his hours among the necessary cares of the world the pleasures of domestic bliss and the enjoyments of a country life and spent the night in ideal parties with his charming bride sometimes walking by the sedgy bank of some transparent stream sometimes pruning the luxuriant vine and sometimes sitting in social converse with her in a shady grove of his own planting these however were no more than the shadowy phantoms of imagination which he well knew would never be realized not that he believed such happiness unattainable by a person in his circumstances but because he would not stoop to propose a scheme which might in any shape seem to interfere with the interest of emilia or subject himself to a repulse from that young lady who had rejected his addresses in the zenith of his fortune while he diverted himself with these agreeable reveries an unexpected event intervened in which she and her brother were deeply interested the uncle was tapped for the dropsy and died in a few days after the operation having bequeathed in his will five thousand pounds to his nephew and twice that sum to his niece who had always enjoyed the greatest share of his favour if our adventurer before this occurrence looked upon his love for emilia as a passion which it was necessary at any rate to conquer or suppress he now considered her accession of fortune as a circumstance which confirmed that necessity and resolved to discourage every thought on that subject which should tend to the propagation of hope one day in the midst of a conversation calculated for the purpose godfrey put into his hand a letter directed to mr pickle in the handwriting of emilia which the youth no sooner recognized than his cheeks were covered with a crimson dye and he began to tremble with violent agitation for he at once guessed the import of the billet which he kissed with great reverence and devotion and was not at all surprised when he read the following words sir l have performed a sufficient sacrifice to my reputation in retaining hitherto the appearance of that resentment which i had long ago dismissed and as the late favourable change in my situation empowers me to avow my genuine sentiments without fear of censure or suspicion of mercenary design i take this opportunity to assure you that if i still maintain that place in your heart which i was vain enough to think i once possessed i am willing to make the first advances to an accommodation and have actually furnished my brother with full powers to conclude it in the name of your appeased emilia pickle having kissed the subscription with great ardour fell upon his knees and lifting up his eyes thank heaven cried he with an air of transport i have not been mistaken in my opinion of that generous maid i believed her inspired with the most dignified and heroic sentiments and now she gives me a convincing proof of her magnanimity it is now my business to approve myself worthy of her regard may heaven inflict upon me the keenest arrows of its vengeance if i do not at this instant contemplate the character of emilia with the most perfect love and adoration yet amiable and enchanting as she is i am more than ever determined to sacrifice the interest of my passion to my glory though my life should fail in the contest and even to refuse an offer which otherwise the whole universe should not bribe me to forego this declaration was not so unexpected as unwelcome to his friend gauntlet who represented that his glory was not at all interested in the affair because he had already vindicated his generosity in repeated proffers to lay his whole fortune at emilias feet when it was impossible that anything selfish could enter into the proposal but that in rejecting her present purpose he would give the world an opportunity to say that his pride was capricious his obstinacy invincible and his sister would have undeniable reason to believe that either his passion for her was dissembled or the ardour of it considerably abated in answer to these remonstrances pickle observed that he had long set the world at defiance and as to the opinion of emilia he did not doubt that she would applaud in her heart the resolution he had taken and do justice to the purity of his intention it was not an easy task to divert our hero from his designs at any time of life but since his confinement his inflexibility was become almost insurmountable the captain therefore after having discharged his conscience in assuring him that his sisters happiness was at stake that his mother had approved of the step she had taken and that he himself should be extremely mortified at his refusal forbore to press him with further argument which served only to rivet him the more strongly in his own opinion and undertook to deliver this answer to emilias letter madam that i revere the dignity of your virtue with the utmost veneration and love you infinitely more than life i am at all times ready to demonstrate but the sacrifice to honour it is now my turn to pay and such is the rigour of my destiny that in order to justify your generosity i must refuse to profit by your condescension madam i am doomed to be for ever wretched and to sigh without ceasing for the possession of that jewel which though now in my offer i dare not enjoy i shall not pretend to express the anguish that tears my heart whilst i communicate this fatal renunciation but appeal to the delicacy of your own sentiments which can judge of my sufferings and will doubtless do justice to the selfdenial of your forlorn p pickle emilia who knew the nicety of our heros pride had foreseen the purport of this epistle before it came to her hands she did not therefore despair of success nor desist from the prosecution of her plan which was no other than that of securing her own happiness in espousing the man upon whom she had fixed her unalterable affection confident of his honour and fully satisfied of the mutual passion with which they were inspired she gradually decoyed him into a literary correspondence wherein she attempted to refute the arguments on which he grounded his refusal and without doubt the young gentleman was not a little pleased with the enjoyment of such delightful commerce in the course of which he had more than ever an opportunity of admiring the poignancy of her wit and the elegance of her understanding the contemplation of such excellency while it strengthened the chains with which she held him enslaved added emulation to the other motives that induced him to maintain the dispute and much subtlety of reasoning was expended upon both sides of this very particular question without any prospect of conviction on either part till at last she began to despair of making him a proselyte to her opinion by dint of argument and resolved for the future to apply herself chiefly to the irresistible prepossessions of his love which were not at all diminished or impaired by the essays of her pen with this view she proposed a conference pretending that it was impossible to convey all her reflections upon this subject in a series of short letters and godfrey undertook to bail him for the day but conscious of her power he would not trust himself in her presence though his heart throbbed with all the eagerness of desire to see her fair eyes disrobed of that resentment which they had worn so long and to enjoy the ravishing sweets of a fond reconciliation nature could not have held out against such powerful attacks had not the pride and caprice of his disposition been gratified to the full in the triumph of his resistance he looked upon the contest as altogether original and persevered with obstinacy because he thought himself sure of favourable terms whenever he should be disposed to capitulate perhaps he might have overshot himself in the course of his perseverance a young lady of emilias fortune and attractions could not fail to find herself surrounded by temptations which few women can resist she might have misinterpreted the meaning of some paragraph or taken umbrage at an unguarded expression in one of peregrines letters she might have been tired out by his obstinate peculiarity or at the long run construed it into madness slight or indifference or rather than waste her prime in fruitless endeavours to subdue the pride of a headstrong humourist she might have listened to the voice of some admirer fraught with qualifications sufficient to engage her esteem and affection but all these possibilities were providentially prevented by an accident attended with more important consequences than any we have hitherto recounted early one morning pipes was disturbed by the arrival of a messenger who had been sent express from the country by mr clover with a packet for the lieutenant and arrived in town overnight but as he was obliged to have recourse to the information of jacks correspondent in the city touching the place of his abode before he demanded entrance at the fleet the gate was shut nor would the turnkeys admit him although he told them that he was charged with a message of the utmost consequence so that he was fain to tarry till daybreak when he at his earnest solicitation was allowed to enter hatchway opening the packet found a letter enclosed for peregrine with an earnest request that he should forward it to the hands of that young gentleman with all possible despatch jack who could not dive into the meaning of this extraordinary injunction began to imagine that mrs clover lay at the point of death and wanted to take a last farewell of her brother and this conceit worked so strongly upon his imagination that while he huddled on his clothes and made the best of his way to the apartment of our hero he could not help cursing within himself the folly of the husband in sending such disagreeable messages to a man of peregrines impatient temper already soured by his own uneasy situation this reflection would have induced him to suppress the letter had not he been afraid to tamper with the ticklish disposition of his friend to whom while he delivered it as for my own part said he mayhap i may have as much natural affection as another but when my spouse parted i bore my misfortune like a british man and a christian for why hes no better than a freshwater sailor who knows not how to stem the current of mischance pickle being waked from a pleasant dream in which the fair emilia was principally concerned and hearing this strange preamble sat up in his bed and unsealed the letter in a state of mortification and disgust but what were the emotions of his soul when he read the following intimation dear brother it hath pleased god to take your father suddenly off by a fit of apoplexy and as he has died intestate i give you this notice that you may with all speed come down and take possession of your right in despite of master gam and his mother who you may be sure do not sit easy under this unexpected dispensation of providence i have by virtue of being a justice of the peace taken such precautions as i thought necessary for your advantage and the funeral shall be deferred until your pleasure be known your sister though sincerely afflicted by her fathers fate submits to the will of heaven with laudable resignation and begs you will set out for this place without delay in which request she is joined by sir your affectionate brother and humble servant charles clover peregrine at first looked upon this epistle as a mere illusion of the brain and a continuation of the reverie in which he had been engaged he read it ten times over without being persuaded that he was actually awake he rubbed his eyes and shook his head in order to shake off the drowsy vapours that surrounded him he hemmed thrice with great vociferation snapped his fingers tweaked his nose started up from his bed and opening the casement took a survey of the wellknown objects that appeared on each side of his habitation everything seemed congruous and connected and he said within himself sure this is the most distinct dream that ever sleep produced then he had recourse again to the paper which he carefully perused without finding any variation from his first notion of the contents hatchway seeing all his extravagances of action accompanied with a wild stare of distraction began to believe that his head was at length fairly turned and was really meditating means for securing his person when pickle in a tone of surprise exclaimed good god am i or am i not awake why look ye cousin pickle replied the lieutenant that is a question which the deep sealine of my understanding is not long enough to sound but howsomever thof i cant trust to the observation i have taken it shall go hard but i will fall upon a way to guess whereabouts we are so saying he lifted up a pitcher full of cold water that stood behind the outward door and discharged it in the face of peregrine without ceremony or hesitation this remedy produced the desired effect unpalatable as it was the young gentleman no sooner recovered his breath which was endangered by such a sudden application than he thanked his friend jack for the seasonable operation he had performed having no longer any just reason to doubt the reality of what appeared so convincingly to his senses he shifted himself on the instant not without hurry and trepidation and putting on his morning dress sallied forth to the bare in order to deliberate with himself on the important intelligence he had received hatchway not yet fully convinced of his sanity and curious to know the purport of the letter which had affected him in such an extraordinary manner carefully attended his footsteps in this excursion in hope of being favoured with his confidence in the course of their perambulation our hero no sooner appeared at the street door than he was saluted by the messenger who having posted himself in the way for that purpose god bless your noble honour squire pickle cried he and give you joy of succeeding to your fathers estate these words had scarce proceeded from his mouth when the lieutenant hopping eagerly towards the countryman squeezed his hand with great affection and asked if the old gentleman had actually taken his departure ay master hatchway replied the other in such a woundy haste that he forgot to make a will body of me exclaimed the seaman these are the best tidings i have ever heard since i first went to sea here my lad take my purse and stow thyself chuck full of the best liquor in the land so saying he tipped the peasant with ten pieces and immediately the whole place echoed the sound of toms instrument peregrine repairing to the walk communicated the billet to his honest friend who at his desire went forthwith to the lodgings of captain gauntlet and returned in less than an hour with that gentleman who i need not say was heartily rejoiced at the occasion chapter civ peregrine holds a consultation with his friends in consequence of which he bids adieu to the fleet he arrives at his fathers house and asserts his right of inheritance nor did our hero keep the misanthrope in ignorance of this happy turn of fortune pipes was despatched to the senior with a message requesting his immediate presence and he accordingly appeared in obedience to the summons growling with discontent for having been deprived of several hours of his natural rest his mouth was immediately stopped with the letter at which he smiled horribly a ghastly grin and after a compliment of gratulation they entered into close divan about the measures to be taken in consequence of this event there was no room for much debate it was unanimously agreed that pickle should set out with all possible despatch for the garrison to which gauntlet and hatchway resolved to attend him pipes was accordingly ordered to prepare a couple of postchaises while godfrey went to procure bail for his friend and provide them with money for the expense of the expedition but not before he was desired by peregrine to conceal this piece of news from his sister that our youth might have an opportunity to surprise her in a more interesting manner after he should have settled his affairs all these previous steps being taken in less than an hour our hero took his leave of the fleet after he had left twenty guineas with the warden for the relief of the poor prisoners a great number of whom conveyed him to the gate pouring forth prayers for his long life and prosperity and he took the road to the garrison in the most elevated transports of joy unallayed with the least mixture of grief at the death of a parent whose paternal tenderness he had never known his breast was absolutely a stranger to that boasted storyn or instinct of affection by which the charities are supposed to subsist of all the journeys he had ever made this sure was the most delightful he felt all the ecstasy that must naturally be produced in a young man of his imagination from such a sudden transition in point of circumstance he found himself delivered from confinement and disgrace without being obliged to any person upon earth for his deliverance he had it now in his power to retort the contempt of the world in a manner suited to his most sanguine wish he was reconciled to his friend and enabled to gratify his love even upon his own terms and saw himself in possession of a fortune more ample than his first inheritance with a stock of experience that would steer him clear of all those quicksands among which he had been formerly wrecked in the middle of their journey while they halted at an inn for a short refreshment and change of horses a postilion running up to peregrine in the yard fell at his feet clasped his knees with great eagerness and agitation and presented to him the individual face of his old valetdechambre the youth perceiving him in such an abject garb and attitude commanded him to rise and tell the cause of such a miserable reverse in his fortune upon which hadgi gave him to understand that he had been ruined by his wife who having robbed him of all his cash and valuable effects had eloped from his house with one of his own customers who appeared in the character of a french count but was in reality no other than an italian fiddler that in consequence of this retreat he the husband was disabled from paying a considerable sum which he had set apart for his wine merchant who being disappointed in his expectation took out an execution against his effects and the rest of his creditors following his example hunted him out of house and home so that finding his person in danger at london he had been obliged to escape into the country skulking about from one village to another till being quite destitute of all support he had undertaken his present office to save himself from starving peregrine listened with compassion to his lamentable tale which too well accounted for his not appearing in the fleet with offers of service to his master in distress a circumstance that pickle had all along imputed to his avarice and ingratitude he assured him that as he had been the means of throwing in his way the temptation to which he fell a sacrifice he would charge himself with the retrieval of his affairs in the meantime he made him taste of his bounty and desired him to continue in his present employment until he should return from the garrison when he would consider his situation and do something for his immediate relief hadgi attempted to kiss his shoe and wept or affected to weep with sensibility at this gracious reception he even made a merit of his unwillingness to exercise his new occupation and earnestly begged that he might be allowed to give immediate attendance upon his dear master from whom he could not bear the thoughts of a second parting his entreaties were reinforced by the intercession of his two friends in consequence of which the swiss was permitted to follow them at his own leisure while they set forward after a slight repast and reached the place of their destination before ten oclock at night peregrine instead of alighting at the garrison rode straightway to his fathers house and no person appearing to receive him not even a servant to take care of his chaise he dismounted without assistance being followed by his two friends he advanced into the hall where perceiving a bellrope he made immediate application to it in such a manner as brought a couple of footmen into his presence after having reprimanded them with a stern look for their neglect in point of attendance he commanded them to show him into an apartment and as they seemed unwilling to yield obedience to his orders asked if they did not belong to the family one of them who took upon himself the office of spokesman replied with a sullen air that they had been in the service of old mr pickle and now that he was dead thought themselves bound to obey nobody but their lady and her son mr gamaliel this declaration had scarce proceeded from his mouth when our hero gave them to understand that since they were not disposed to own any other master they must change their quarters immediately he ordered them to decamp without further preparation and as they still continued restive they were kicked out of doors by the captain and his friend hatchway squire gam who overheard everything that passed and was now more than ever inflamed with that rancour which he had sucked with his mothers milk flew to the assistance of his adherents with a pistol in each hand bellowing thieves thieves with great vociferation as if he had mistaken the business of the strangers and actually believed himself in danger of being robbed under this pretence he discharged a piece at his brother who luckily escaped the shot closed with him in a moment and wresting the other pistol from his grip turned him out into the courtyard to the consolation of his two dependents by this time pipes and the two postilions had taken possession of the stables without being opposed by the coachman and his deputy who quietly submitted to the authority of their new sovereign but the noise of the pistol had alarmed mrs pickle who running downstairs with the most frantic appearance attended by two maids and the curate who still maintained his place of chaplain and ghostly director in the family would have assaulted our hero with her nails had not she been restrained by her attendants though they prevented her from using her hands they could not hinder her from exercising her tongue which she wagged against him with all the virulence of malice she asked if he were come to butcher his brother to insult his fathers corpse and triumph in her affliction she bestowed upon him the epithets of spendthrift jailbird and unnatural ruffian she begged pardon of god for having brought such a monster into the world accused him of having brought his fathers grey hairs with sorrow to the grave and affirmed that were he to touch the body it would bleed at his approach without pretending to refute the articles of this ridiculous charge he allowed her to ring out her alarm and then calmly replied that if she did not quietly retire to her chamber and behave as became a person in her present situation he should insist upon her removing to another lodging without delay for he was determined to be master in his own family the lady who in all probability expected that he would endeavour to appease her with all the tenderness of filial submission was so much exasperated at his cavalier behaviour that her constitution could not support the transports of her spirits and she was carried off by her women in a fit while the officious clergyman was dismissed after his pupil with all the circumstances of disgrace our hero having thus made his quarters good took possession of the best apartment in the house and sent notice of his arrival to mr clover who with his wife visited him in less than an hour and was not a little surprised to find him so suddenly settled in his fathers house the meeting of julia and her brother was extremely pathetic she had always loved him with uncommon tenderness and looked upon him as the ornament of her family but she had heard of his extravagances with regret and though she considered the stories that were circulated at his expense as the malicious exaggerations of his mother and her darling son her apprehension had been grievously alarmed by an account of his imprisonment and distress which had been accidentally conveyed to that country by a gentleman from london who had been formerly of his acquaintance she could not therefore without the most tender emotions of joy see him as it were restored to his rightful inheritance and reestablished in that station of life which she thought he could fill with dignity and importance after their mutual expressions of affection she retired to her mothers chamber with a view to make a second offer of her service and attendance which had been already rejected with scorn since her fathers death while peregrine consulted his brotherinlaw about the affairs of the family so far as they had fallen within his cognizance and observation mr clover told him that though he was never favoured with the confidence of the defunct he knew some of his intimates who had been tampered with by mrs pickle and even engaged to second the remonstrances by which she had often endeavoured to persuade her husband to settle his affairs by a formal will but that he had from time to time evaded their importunities with surprising excuses of procrastination that plainly appeared to be the result of invention and design far above the supposed pitch of his capacity a circumstance from which mr clover concluded that the old gentleman imagined his life would not have been secure had he once taken such a step as would have rendered it unnecessary to the independence of his second son he moreover observed that in consequence of this information he no sooner heard of mr pickles death which happened at the club than he went directly with a lawyer to his house before any cabal or conspiracy could be formed against the rightful heir and in presence of witnesses provided for the purpose sealed up all the papers of the deceased after the widow had in the first transports of her sorrow and vexation fairly owned that her husband had died intestate peregrine was extremely well satisfied with this intelligence by which all his doubts were dispelled and having cheerfully supped with his friends on a cold collation which his brotherinlaw had brought in his chariot they retired to rest in different chambers after julia had met with another repulse from her capricious mother whose overflowing rage had now subsided into the former channel of calm inveteracy next morning the house was supplied with some servants from the garrison and preparations were made for the funeral of the deceased gam having taken lodgings in the neighbourhood came with a chaise and cart to demand his mother together with his own clothes and her personal effects our hero though he would not suffer him to enter the door allowed his proposal to be communicated to the widow who eagerly embraced the opportunity of removing and was with her own baggage and that of her beloved son conveyed to the place which he had prepared for her reception thither she was followed by her woman who was desired by peregrine to assure her mistress that until a regular provision could be settled upon her she might command him in point of money or any other accommodation in his power chapter cv he performs the last offices to his father and returns to london upon a very interesting design suits of mourning being provided for himself his friends and adherents and every other previous measure taken suitable to the occasion his father was interred in a private manner in the parish church and his papers being examined in presence of many persons of honour and integrity invited for that purpose no will was found or any other deed in favour of the second son though it appeared by the marriage settlement that the widow was entitled to a jointure of five hundred pounds a year the rest of his papers consisted of east india bonds south sea annuities mortgages notes and assignments to the amount of four score thousand seven hundred and sixty pounds exclusive of the house plate and furniture horses equipage and cattle with the garden and park adjacent to a very considerable extent this was a sum that even exceeded his expectation and could not fail to entertain his fancy with the most agreeable ideas he found himself immediately a man of vast consequence among his country neighbours who visited him with compliments of congratulation and treated him with such respect as would have effectually spoiled any young man of his disposition who had not the same advantages of experience as he had already purchased at a very extravagant price thus shielded with caution he bore his prosperity with surprising temperance everybody was charmed with his affability and moderation when he made a circuit round the gentlemen of the district in order to repay the courtesy which he owed he was caressed by them with uncommon assiduity and advised to offer himself as a candidate for the county at the next election which they supposed would soon happen because the present member was in a declining state of health nor did his person and address escape unheeded by the ladies many of whom did not scruple to spread their attractions before him with a view of captivating such a valuable prize nay such an impression did this legacy make upon a certain peer who resided in this part of the country that he cultivated pickles acquaintance with great eagerness and without circumlocution offered to him in marriage his only daughter with a very considerable fortune our hero expressed himself upon this occasion as became a man of honour sensibility and politeness and frankly gave his lordship to understand that his heart was already engaged he was pleased with the opportunity of making such a sacrifice of his passion for emilia which by this time inflamed his thoughts to such a degree of impatience that he resolved to depart for london with all possible speed and for that purpose industriously employed almost every hour of his time in regulating his domestic affairs he paid off all his fathers servants and hired others at the recommendation of his sister who promised to superintend his household in his absence he advanced the first halfyearly payment of his mothers jointure and as for his brother gam he gave him divers opportunities of acknowledging his faults so that he might have answered to his own conscience for taking any step in his favour but that young gentleman was not yet sufficiently humbled by misfortune and not only forbore to make any overtures of peace but also took all occasions to slander the conduct and revile the person of our hero being in this practice comforted and abetted by his righteous mamma everything being thus settled for the present the triumvirate set out on their return to town in the same manner with that in which they had arrived in the country except in this small variation that hatchways chaisecompanion was now the valetdechambre refitted instead of pipes who with another lacquey attended them on horseback when they had performed twothirds of their way to london they chanced to overtake a country squire on his return from a visit to one of his neighbours who had entertained him with such hospitality that as the lieutenant observed he rolled himself almost gunwale to every motion of his horse which was a fine hunter and when the chaise passed him at full speed he set up the sportsmans halloo in a voice that sounded like a french horn clapping spurs to sorrel at the same time in order to keep up with the pace of the machine peregrine who was animated with an uncommon flow of spirits ordered his postilion to proceed more softly and entered into conversation with the stranger touching the make and mettle of his horse upon which he descanted with so much learning that the squire was astonished at his knowledge when they approached his habitation he invited the young gentleman and his company to halt and drink a bottle of his ale and was so pressing in his solicitation that they complied with his request he accordingly conducted them through a spacious avenue that extended as far as the highway to the gate of a large chateau of a most noble and venerable appearance which induced them to alight and view the apartments contrary to their first intention of drinking a glass of his october at the door the rooms were every way suitable to the magnificence of the outside and our hero imagined they had made a tour through the whole sweep when the landlord gave him to understand that they had not yet seen the best apartment of the house and immediately led them into a spacious diningroom which peregrine did not enter without giving manifest signs of uncommon astonishment the panels all round were covered with portraits at full length by vandyke and not one of them appeared without a ridiculous tieperiwig in the style of those that usually hang over the shops of twopenny barbers the straight boots in which the figures had been originally painted and the other circumstances of attitude and drapery so inconsistent with this monstrous furniture of the head exhibited such a ludicrous appearance that pickles wonder in a little time gave way to his mirth and he was seized with a violent fit of laughter which had wellnigh deprived him of his breath the squire halfpleased and halfoffended at this expression of ridicule i know said he what makes you laugh so woefully you think it strange to zee my vorefathers booted and spurred with huge threetailed periwigs on their pates the truth of the matter is this i could not abide to zee the pictures of my vamily with a parcel of loose hair hanging about their eyes like zo many colts and zo i employed a painter vellow from lundon to clap decent periwigs upon their skulls at the rate of vive shillings a head and offered him three shillings a piece to furnish each with a handsome pair of shoes and stockings but the rascal thinking i must have em done at any price after their heads were covered haggled with me for vour shillings a picture and zo rather than be imposed upon i turned him off and shall let em stand as they are till zome more reasonable brother of the brush comes round the country pickle commended his resolution though in his heart he blessed himself from such a barbarous goth and after they had despatched two or three bottles of his beer they proceeded on their journey and arrived in town about eleven at night chapter cvi he enjoys an interview with emilia and makes himself ample amends for all the mortifications of his life godfrey who had taken leave of his sister on pretence of making a short excursion with peregrine whose health required the enjoyment of fresh air after his long confinement sent a message to her that same night announcing his arrival and giving her notice that he would breakfast with her next morning when he and our hero who had dressed himself for the purpose taking a hackneycoach repaired to her lodging and were introduced into a parlour adjoining to that in which the teatable was set here they had not waited many minutes when they heard the sound of feet coming downstairs upon which our heros heart began to beat the alarm he concealed himself behind the screen by the direction of his friend whose ears being saluted with sophys voice from the next room he flew into it with great ardour and enjoyed upon her lips the sweet transports of a meeting so unexpected for he had left her in her fathers house at windsor amidst these emotions he had almost forgotten the situation of peregrine when emilia assuming her enchanting air is not this said she a most provoking scene to a young woman like me who am doomed to wear the willow by the strange caprice of my lover upon my word brother you have done me infinite prejudice in promoting this jaunt with my obstinate correspondent who i suppose is so ravished with this transient glimpse of liberty that be will never be persuaded to incur unnecessary confinement for the future my dear sister replied the captain tauntingly your own pride set him the example so you must een stand to the consequence of his imitation tis a hard case however answered the fair offender that i should suffer all my life by one venial trespass heigh ho who would imagine that a sprightly girl such as i with ten thousand pounds should go a begging i have a good mind to marry the next person that asks me the question in order to be revenged upon this unyielding humourist did the dear fellow discover no inclination to see me in all the term of his releasement well if ever i can catch the fugitive again he shall sing in his cage for life it is impossible to convey to the reader a just idea of peregrines transports while he overheard this declaration which was no sooner pronounced than unable to resist the impetuosity of his passion he sprung from his lurkingplace exclaiming here i surrender and rushing into her presence was so dazzled with her beauty that his speech failed he was fixed like a statue to the floor and all his faculties were absorbed in admiration indeed she was now in the full bloom of her charms and it was nearly impossible to look upon her without emotion what then must have been the ecstasy of our youth whose passion was whetted with all the incitements which could stimulate the human heart the ladies screamed with surprise at his appearance and emilia underwent such agitation as flushed every charm with irresistible energy her cheeks glowed with a most delicate suffusion and her bosom heaved with such bewitching undulation that the cambric could not conceal or contain the snowy hemispheres that rose like a vision of paradise to his view while he was almost fainting with unutterable delight she seemed to sink under the tumults of tenderness and confusion when our hero perceiving her condition obeyed the impulse of his love and circled the charmer in his arms without suffering the least frown or symptom of displeasure not all the pleasures of his life had amounted to the ineffable joy of this embrace in which he continued for some minutes totally entranced he fastened upon her pouting lips with all the eagerness of rapture and while his brain seemed to whirl round with transport exclaimed in a delirium of bliss heaven and earth this is too much to bear his imagination was accordingly relieved and his attention in some measure divided by the interposition of sophy who kindly chid him for his having overlooked his old friends thus accosted he quitted his delicious armful and saluting mrs gauntlet asked pardon for his neglect observing that such rudeness was excusable considering the long and unhappy exile which he had suffered from the jewel of his soul then turning to emilia i am come madam said he to claim the performance of your promise which i can produce under your own fair hand you may therefore lay aside all superfluous ceremony and shyness and crown my happiness without further delay for upon my soul my thoughts are wound up to the last pitch of expectation and i shall certainly run distracted if i am doomed to any term of probation his mistress having by this time recollected herself replied with a most exhilarating smile i ought to punish you for your obstinacy with the mortification of a twelvemonths trial but it is dangerous to tamper with an admirer of your disposition and therefore i think i must make sure of you while it is in my power you are willing then to take me for better for worse in presence of heaven and these witnesses cried peregrine kneeling and applying her hand to his lips at this interrogation her features softened into an amazing expression of condescending love and while she darted a side glance that thrilled to his marrow and heaved a sigh more soft than zephyrs balmy wing her answer was why ay and heaven grant me patience to bear the humours of such a yokefellow and may the same powers replied the youth grant me life and opportunity to manifest the immensity of my love meanwhile i have eighty thousand pounds which shall be laid immediately in your lap so saying he sealed the contract upon her lips and explained the mystery of his last words which had begun to operate upon the wonder of the two sisters sophy was agreeably surprised with the account of his good fortune nor was it in all probability unacceptable to the lovely emilia though from this information she took an opportunity to upbraid her admirer with the inflexibility of his pride which she scrupled not to say would have baffled all the suggestions of his passion had it not been gratified by this providential event matters being thus happily matured the lover begged that immediate recourse might be had to the church and his happiness ascertained before night but the bride objected with great vehemence to such precipitation being desirous of her mothers presence at the ceremony and she was seconded in her opinion by her brothers wife peregrine maddening with desire assaulted her with the most earnest entreaties representing that as her mothers consent was already obtained there was surely no necessity for delay that must infallibly make a dangerous impression upon his brain and constitution he fell at her feet in all the agony of impatience and swore his life and intellects would actually be in jeopardy by her refusal and when she attempted to argue him out of his demand began to rage with such extravagance that sophy was frightened into conviction and godfrey enforcing the remonstrances of his friend the amiable emilia was teased into compliance after breakfast the bridegroom and his companion set out for the commons for a licence having first agreed upon the house at which the ceremony should be performed in the lodgings of the bride and the permission being obtained they found means to engage a clergyman who undertook to attend them at their own time and place then a ring was purchased for the occasion and they went in search of the lieutenant with whom they dined at a tavern and not only made him acquainted with the steps they had taken but desired that he would stand godfather to the bride an employment which jack accepted with demonstrations of particular satisfaction till chancing to look into the street and seeing cadwallader approach the door in consequence of a message they had sent to him by pipes be declined the office in favour of the senior who was accordingly ordained for that purpose on the supposition that such a mark of regard might facilitate his concurrence with a match which otherwise he would certainly oppose as he was a professed enemy to wedlock and as yet ignorant of peregrines intention after having congratulated pickle upon his succession and shook his two friends by the hand the misanthrope asked whose mare was dead that he was summoned in such a plaguy hurry from his dinner which he had been fain to gobble up like a cannibal our hero gave him to understand that they had made an appointment to drink tea with two agreeable ladies and were unwilling that he should lose the opportunity of enjoying an entertainment which he loved so much crabtree shrivelling up his face like an autumn leaf at this intimation cursed his complaisance and swore they should keep their assignation without him for he and lechery had shook bands many years ago the bridegroom however likening him unto an old coachman who still delights in the smack of the whip and dropping some flattering hints of his manhood even at these years he was gradually prevailed upon to accompany them to the place of rendezvous where being ushered into a diningroom they had not waited three minutes when they were joined by the parson who had observed the hour with great punctuality this gentleman no sooner entered the room than cadwallader in a whisper to gauntlet asked if that was not the cockb d and before the captain could make any reply what an unconscionable w master the rogue is said he scarce discharged from confinement and sweetened with a little fresh air when he wenches with a pimp in canonicals in his pay the door again opened and emilia broke in upon them with such dignity of mien and divinity of aspect as inspired every spectator with astonishment and admiration the lieutenant who had not seen her since her charms were ripened into such perfection expressed his wonder and approbation in an exclamation of adds zooks what a glorious galley and the misanthropes visage was instantly metamorphosed into the face of a mountain goat he licked his lips instinctively snuffed the air and squinted with a most horrible obliquity of vision the bride and her sister being seated and hatchway having renewed his acquaintance with the former who recognized him with particular civility peregrine withdrew into another apartment with his friend crabtree to whom he imparted the design of his meeting which the latter no sooner understood than he attempted to retreat without making any other reply than that of pshaw rot your matrimony cant you put your neck in the noose without my being a witness of your folly the young gentleman in order to vanquish this aversion stepped to the door of the next room and begged the favour of speaking with emilia to whom he introduced the testy old bachelor as one of his particular friends who desired to have the honour of giving her away the bewitching smile with which she received his salute and granted his request at once overcame the disapprobation of the misanthrope who with a relaxation in his countenance which had never been perceived before that instant thanked her in the most polite terms for such an agreeable mark of distinction he accordingly led her to the diningroom where the ceremony was performed without delay and after the husband had asserted his prerogative on her lips the whole company saluted her by the name of mrs pickle i shall leave the sensible reader to judge what passed at this juncture within the bosoms of the newmarried couple peregrines heart was fired with inexpressible ardour and impatience while the transports of the bride were mingled with a dash of diffidence and apprehension gauntlet saw it would be too much for both to bear their present tantalizing situation till night without some amusement to divert their thoughts and therefore proposed to pass part of the evening at the public entertainments in marylebone gardens which were at that time frequented by the best company in town the scheme was relished by the discreet sophy who saw the meaning of the proposal and the bride submitted to the persuasion of her sister so that after tea two coaches were called and peregrine was forcibly separated from his charmer during the conveyance the newmarried couple and their company having made shift to spend the evening and supped on a slight collation in one of the boxes peregrines patience was almost quite exhausted and taking godfrey aside he imparted his intention to withdraw in private from the seawit of his friend hatchway who would otherwise retard his bliss with unseasonable impediments which at present he could not possibly bear gauntlet who sympathized with his impatience undertook to intoxicate the lieutenant with bumpers to the joy of the bride and in the meantime desired sophy to retire with his sister under the auspices of cadwallader who promised to squire them home the ladies were accordingly conducted to the coach and jack proposed to the captain that for the sake of the joke the bridegroom should be plied with liquor in such a manner as would effectually disable him from enjoying the fruits of his goodfortune for one night at least gauntlet seemed to relish the scheme and they prevailed upon pickle to accompany them to a certain tavern on pretence of drinking a farewell glass to a single life there the bottle was circulated till hatchways brain began to suffer innovation as he had secured our heros hat and sword he felt no apprehension of an elopement which however was effected and the youth hastened on the wings of love to the arms of his enchanting bride he found crabtree in a parlour waiting for his return and disposed to entertain him with a lecture upon temperance to which he paid very little attention but ringing for emilias maid desired to know if her mistress was in bed being answered in the affirmative he sent her upstairs to announce his arrival undressed himself to a loose gown and slippers and wishing the misanthrope good night after having desired to see him next day followed in person to the delicious scene where he found her elegantly dished out the fairest daughter of chastity and love when he approached she was overwhelmed with confusion and hid her lovely face from his transporting view mrs gauntlet seeing his eyes kindled at the occasion kissed her charming sister who throwing her snowy arms about her neck would have detained her in the room had not peregrine gently disengaged her confidante from her embrace and conducted her trembling to the door which having bolted and barricadoed he profited by his good fortune and his felicity was perfect next day he rose about noon and found his three friends assembled when he learned that jack had fallen in his own snare and been obliged to lie in the same tavern where he fell a circumstance of which he was so much ashamed that peregrine and his wife escaped many jokes which he would have certainly cracked had he not lain under the imputation of this disgrace in half an hour after he came down mrs pickle appeared with sophy blushing like aurora or the goddess of health and sending forth emanations of beauty unparalleled she was complimented upon her change of situation by all present and by none more warmly than by old crabtree who declared himself so well satisfied with his friends fortune as to be almost reconciled to that institution against which he had declaimed during the best part of his life an express was immediately despatched to mrs gauntlet with an account of her daughters marriage a townhouse was hired and a handsome equipage set up in which the newmarried pair appeared at all public places to the astonishment of our adventurers fairweather friends and the admiration of all the world for in point of figure such another couple was not to be found in the whole united kingdom envy despaired and detraction was struck dumb when our heros new accession of fortune was consigned to the celebration of public fame emilia attracted the notice of all observers from the pert templar to the sovereign himself who was pleased to bestow encomiums upon the excellence of her beauty many persons of consequence who had dropped the acquaintance of peregrine in the beginning of his decline now made open efforts to cultivate his friendship anew but he discouraged all these advances with the most mortifying disdain and one day when the nobleman whom he had formerly obliged came up to him in the drawingroom with the salutation of your servant mr pickle he eyed him with a look of ineffable contempt saying i suppose your lordship is mistaken in your man and turned his head another way in presence of the whole court when he had made a circuit round all the places frequented by the beaumonde to the utter confusion of those against whom his resentment was kindled paid off his debts and settled his money matters in town hatchway was dismissed to the country in order to prepare for the reception of his fair emilia in a few days after his departure the whole company cadwallader himself included set out for his fathers house and in their way took up mrs gauntlet the mother who was sincerely rejoiced to see our hero in the capacity of her soninlaw from her habitation they proceeded homewards at an easy pace and amidst the acclamations of the whole parish entered their own house where emilia was received in the most tender manner by mr clovers wife who had provided everything for her ease and accommodation and next day surrendered unto her the management of her own household affairs
