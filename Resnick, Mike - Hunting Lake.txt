hunting lake by mike resnick in my life i have written a grand total of three fan letters to writers one of the recipients barry malzberg became my closest friend and occasional collaborator another humorist ross spencer also became a good friend the third was african writer alexander lake who died on christmas day a month before i wrote to him ive always regretted not meetiing lake who has been virtually forgotten by the american reading public despite a number of bestsellers i recently moved the resnick library of african adventure from st martins press over to alexander books an offshoot of worldcomm press the primary reason was to bring lake back into print sounds simple right i mean hell all editors do is sit on their judgment all day and see what comes in the mail well sometimes its not quite that easy take lake for example hell take the whole damned chronology i buy the paperback edition of killers in africa at age take it to summer camp with me read it in its entirety once a week for two months from that day to this i am fascinated by all things african i take safaris i write books and short stories set in africa and i never forget that it is alexander lake who awakened this passion in me st martins press buys tor books st martins also publishes peter capsticks library of african hunting a series of classic reprints ivory becomes a nebula and clarke nominee for tor right after santiago hits on the bestseller list and the nice people at tor look about for ways to keep me happily in their stable i tell them that if capstick ever dies or gives up editing the library i want to take it over st martins informs me that capstick has moved to a different publisher and i can edit the library i tell them that the first two authors i want to bring back theyve each written two books are alexander lake and john boyes a scalawag who was one of the kenya pioneers and at one time was the white king of the kikuyu they reply that theyll reprint the boyes books which were written in and and are in the public domain but with so many classics available for free they wont spend a penny to purchase the lakes which we all assume are still under copyright i reluctantly agree after all no one else is beating down my door to edit books about killing animals in this politically correct year of and i select three books by boyes f c selous and arthur neumann for publication writing new introductions for each worldcomm press which specializes in small editions of trade paperbacks is feeling expansive and approaches me about writing a mystery novel and editing a line of mass market science fiction i agree and suggest that id also like to bring the reprint series over from st martins press which isnt making any money on them anyway and would probably be happy to let them go so that we can at least make an attempt to get lakes books back into print the publisher ralph roberts has never heard of alexander lake i loan him copies of killers in africa and hunters choice he calls back two nights later he loves them and hell start up the african reprint line as soon as im ready january in an attempt to find out who owns the rights to lakes books i write to doubledays accounting department and ask who they are sending his royalty checks to their records only go back to the s and no royalties have been paid out since then it takes them a mere months to tell me that april ray feist suggests that i write to the doubleday legal department to find out what literary agent represented lake during the contract negotiations if he did it himself im out of luck and the search and project ends here doubleday takes four months to respond that lake was represented by the mcintosh and otis agency august i write mcintosh and otis and ask who owns the rights to lakes books they write back to tell me that theyve never heard of lake i write back and suggest they check their files back to the s they write back to say that they did and theyve still never heard of him this correspondence takes nine weeks october once more i write to the doubleday legal department and tell them that mcintosh and otis has no record of representing alexander lake and could they please check the contracts again they do and finally direct me to elizabeth mckee of mcintosh mckee and dodds i write to her and ask who owns the rights to lakes books no answer i write again no answer i phone shes out of town on an extended vacation january ms mckee writes to tell me that yes she did indeed represent alexander lake in the early s but she has had no word from him or his literary estate in more than a third of a century she no longer has any records telling her who his literary heirs are she has no idea where to look february i call my own literary agent eleanor wood explain the problem and ask for suggestions she gives me the number of the copyright department of the library of congress maybe she suggests the books are public domain if killers in africas copyright wasnt renewed in its mine for the taking if it was renewed at least ill be able to find out who renewed it march i call the copyright department they ask what years the two books were originally published then tell me to send them for each title to track down the copyright status i send them a check for on my birthday march june it is now two years since worldcomm has agreed to publish the resnick library of african adventure and ralph understandably wants to know where it is i tell him that i moved it from st martins for the express purpose of publishing alexander lake and im not giving him any other titles until i know beyond all doubt the lake is unobtainable he runs his own copyright check evidently publishers have access to the copyright departments data and cant find a renewal i agree that if theyre public domain well publish them but i wont be satisfied until i get it in blackandwhite from the copyright department ralph mutters and grumbles but agrees to postpone the library until july and august i call the copyright department weekly trying to find out what happened to my request i never get the same person twice and no one there seems to know whats going on september i give up trying to get a response out of the copyright department i promise worldcomm that if i still havent determined lakes copyright status by the end of the year ill give them a different title to kick off the new line october finally the copyright department tells me that lakes children storm alexis lakebartel and richard k nelson renewed the copyrights and gives me their addresses as of storm is at a post office box in la honda richard is in san mateo i call ralph roberts to tell him the news now comes the tricky part if either of them say no thats the end of it and my dream of bringing alexander lake back into print is dead so i have to decide which of them is more likely to say yes all i have to go on is their names theres a son richard who should be called lake and isnt i dont know at the time that hes a stepson for all i know hes a blood son who hated lake and took on a stepfathers last name to spite him and theres a daughter obviously married who could reasonably be expected to have dumped lakes name but chose to keep it lakebartel easy choice i write to the daughter and two weeks later the letter comes back address unknown november my very last chance is to make contact with the son i write to the san mateo address it comes back address unknown i am so close and so far away i hate to think of what its doing to my blood pressure i try to get storms phone number from the la honda operator no record of a lakebartel it turns out that she got divorced sometime after and is once again going under the name of lake then i try to get richards phone number from the san mateo operator i dont have much hope its a common name there are probably ten richard nelsons in any fair sized city but just for once fate is on my side thank goodness he uses that middle initial because while the operator doesnt have a richard k nelson at the address the copyright department gave me she does have one in the area code i take the number call leave a message on richards answering machine he calls back and five years after i start jockeying to bring killers in africa and hunters choice back into print i finally make contact with the two people who can make it possible and a week later were in business easy job being an editor right if i make a dime an hour for the time i put in i think ill be ahead of the game anyway as i write these words killers in africa is in print and hunters choice is a month from publication and will be in print long before any of you read this twothirds of my good samaritan work is done i got lake back into print and i got all of barry malzbergs recursive science fiction back into print in one big volume passage of the light written by barry edited by me and tony lewis published by nesfa and you should all run right out and buy it if i can just get ross spencers hilarious chance perdue novels back into print and im working on it it may even be a fait accompli by the time you read this ill feel like ive paid my dues in full since some of you may be wondering what all the fuss is about heres the introduction i wrote for hunters choice which will hopefully whet your appetites when we reprinted alexander lakes first book killers in africa last spring we promised you that if it sold at all well wed be following it up with his hunters choice the sales figures are in the readers have spoken and here it is another book by that most readable of all authors of africana encountering an alexander lake book is very much like sitting around an african campfire and letting an old pro spin tales of his youth but while killers in africa was strictly about hunting and was divided into chapters about various animals hunters choice is a true potpourri of tales guaranteed to tweak anyones sense of wonder and adventure it even has a chapter unique to african books every hunter will happily tell you about the chase and the kill and then regale you with how wonderful that kudu or impala tasted but only alexander lake tells you delightfully how to cook that beast once youve killed it ever wonder how to trap sixty monkeys armed with nothing but twenty gallons of bad booze trust lake to supply the hilarious answer could anyone even lakes brilliant tracker ubusuku possibly kill the big five armed only with a hand axe lake describes the hunt that was initiated by a two thousand pound bet between an american hunter and lakes employer nicobar jones lake even recounts a jungle murder and the recovery of three of king johns emeralds and of course he tells these tales within the framework of his life an american with american attitudes and an american way of looking at things who made his way across the african continent as a professional hunter he recalls his clients both good and bad humorous and tragic with a contagious fondness it is amazing to me that this book could have remained out of print for close to forty years for it is a pure delight from the first page to the last still while lake was obviously a happy and contented man true fame eluded him until the last decade of his life he was born alexander james lake in chicago illinois on july his father was a methodist minister and the family moved to south africa in lake went to jeppestown high school in johannesburg and then attended the marist brothers college where he captained the rifle team that represented the transvaal at the allbritish empire shumaker cup his team came in second but he himself set a record of bullseyes in seconds which brought him to the attention of the famed trader nicobar jones who hired him as a meat hunter a job that took him to portugese east africa tanganyika kenya uganda northern rhodesia and german southwest africa within a couple of years he was a fully fledged and licensed white hunter he took time off from his hunting career to fight for the american forces as a pilot in europe during world war i then went back to his beloved africa for another twelve years after which he returned to the united states working as a reporter and editor for a number of newspapers in the pacific northwest then africa called to him once again and he returned there in for three more years when he came back to the states in this time to stay he met and married his wife mildred and began writing anything that would sell african reminiscences business articles even some pulp fiction says his daughter storm alexis lake he loved being the center of attention and he was fascinating and fun to be around he loved life and lived it to its fullest with a very wild first years when he met and fell in love with my mother he became tamed and settled down for the first time in his life its amazing what a good woman can do for a man once a heavy drinker after meeting my mother he never touched alcohol again after world war ii ended he and mildred bought a home on the pacific coast near the california oregon border and he finally started cracking the major markets look colliers time readers digest with his accounts of africa and hunting his main markets however were field and stream and argosy where he delighted in debunking the myths of african hunting and setting the record straight killers in africa became a bestseller in and hunters choice also made the bestseller lists a year later these led lake to a job as a consultant and writer for sol lesser producer of the tarzan films in fact lake may well be the reason that gordon scott was allowed to speak in sentences rather than monosyllables at least id like to think so finally in his last few years lake began researching his fathers missionary work in africa this in turn led him to investigate reported answers to prayer and that led to two more bestsellers your prayers are always answered and you need never walk alone he died on christmas day while working on a biography of his father i discovered alexander lake when i was eleven years old i picked up a copy of killers in africa and had read half of it in the bookstore before my mother realized she was either going to have to buy the book or leave me in the store overnight a few months later i bought hunters choice with money i had earned mowing lawns and from that day forward i knew two things that someday i would visit the wonderful continent that lake had made come alive on the printed page i have times now with more trips planned and that i would find some way to make my living from africa that took a little longer and considering that i became a science fiction writer it was a lot more difficult but i managed i would confidently suggest that no other science fiction writer dead or alive has set books and works of short fiction in africa or african analogs or received as many major and minor awards for them and of course a lot of lakes reminiscences have been appropriated thinlydisguised in my fiction before we go any further i want to tell you a little something about the cover to this edition of hunters choice at first glance it appears to be a scene from chapter dont spoil the heads of this book but if youll look at it closely youll see its really from killers in africas chapter on elephants the giveaway is the figure of lake himself on the ground beneath the elephant the african with the axe is of course ubusuku so why didnt we run it on killers in africa simple i didnt know storm alexis lake then over the past few months she has graciously gone through her fathers old notes and magazine articles as we try to find enough uncollected material to create a brandnew alexander lake book during one of our phone conversations she mentioned that she and her brother owned this remarkable painting of her fathers miraculous escape from a wounded elephant rendered by an artist named kahn before she was through describing it i knew we had the cover for hunters choice by the way as the editor of this series i do try to be thorough and when it came time to publish hunters choice i thought i would see if i could find a negative opinion since mine is one of unmitigated praise well i checked every review ever written and i finally found one in the september issue of african wild life published by the south african wild life society of which less than copies were printed hows that for thorough the reviewer who uses only his initials den takes lake rather severely to task for two misstatements that lions charge in fortyfoot leaps and that the lion is the fastest animal on earth well they once measured the stride of the great race horse swaps and it turned out to be feet inches so i have to assume that lake who probably did not have a measuring tape handy when charged by lions was wrong as for his statement that the lion is the fastest animal on earth im sure he was as aware of the cheetahs mileperhour speed as everyone else what you have to remember is that we arent the only creatures who know lions have very little stamina lions know it too hence unlike the cheetah who spots his meal a quarter mile away and then runs it down across open territory the lion rarely charges more than sixty yards if he hasnt caught his prey by then he usually gives up now there is no question that the cheetah is the fastest animal on earth but it takes him a little time to work up to his top speed whereas the lion is going full speed at his first stride ive seen them both in action and id be willing to bet lake was right if you limit it to the length of ground a lion charges and since lake was more aware of a lions limitations than most men why would he describe a longer race so much for den whoever he or she was okay ive gone on long enough and youve got a wonderful book to read i think if i were to choose a single word to describe hunters choice it would be evocative lakes description of his office or ubusukus hunt or the mystic power of a zulu witch doctor or the sunday baseball games in johannesburg or a lonely christmas eve in the bush well if they dont make you wish youd been there then somebody shorted your soul in the areas of romance and adventure
