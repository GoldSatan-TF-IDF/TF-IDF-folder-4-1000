chapter one a terrible secret school was finished and mark had four cigarettes in his pocket other bays drank beer and some tried drugs but mark just liked cigarettes now his little brother ricky wanted his first smoke and mark felt terrible the boys walked down a narrow path into the trees behind their home home was a trailer in a trailer park in memphis tennessee mom wasnt back from work yet dad wasnt there either mom left him five years ago because he was always drunk and often violent now mark seemed like rickys father an elevenyearold father he taught ricky to play football to ride a bike and everything he knew about sex but he didnt want to teach him to smoke sit there said mark when they reached his secret hiding place and lets hear the rules again ricky knew them both if i tell anyone youll hit me thats right and i can smoke only one a day thats right if i catch you smoking more or if you start drinking beer youll hit me harder right said mark now watch me its really easy ricky was soon busy blowing smoke like a man mark sat next to him and lit another cigarette i was nine when i started he said youre only eight youre too young ricky didnt answer he was listening to something then mark heard it too and they stopped smoking just sit still mark said softly through the trees they could see an old road which nobody used any more a long black car appeared on the road and came slowly across the rough ground it made a circle then stopped soon the engine stopped too hidden in the long grass behind the car the boys watched the car after a few minutes a fat man got out whats he doing ricky whispered the man had a rubber tube he put one end into the tail pipe of the car and the other end through a window he got into the car closed the window as tight as he could and started the engine again hes trying to kill himself said mark i saw a man do it like this in a film once how long does it take not very long said mark but im going to stop him mark crawled to the car pulled away the tube and crawled back quick lets get out of here said ricky suddenly the man got out of the car again he had a bottle of whisky and a gun and he was crying lets get out of here said ricky again urgently mark watched quietly the man looked at the tube he looked around then he put the tube back into the tail pipe he got back into the car with his whisky mark please lets go said ricky and began to cry ill try one more time said mark ricky watched his brother crawl forward again and then the man saw mark he fell out of the car and grabbed him you little he shouted as he hit mark get into the car ricky in shock and fear wet himself the man pushed mark into the car and hit him again then he laughed my names jerome clifford romey to my friends whats yours mark said mark romey laughed here he said take the whisky son lets die together mark took the bottle and pretended to drink he smelled gas he looked at the gun on the seat well be dead in five minutes said the man mark looked in the mirror and saw ricky crawling towards the back of the car why are you doing this he asked give me the whisky said the man mark looked at the man if he gets drunk he might go to sleep he thought he passed the whisky its because of the body said the man its at my house im a lawyer my client killed a senator the fbi is looking everywhere for his body and my client hid it in my garage can you believe it right there under my boat mark smelled the air again no gas now thanks to ricky whos your client romey he asked barry the blade said romey hes a member of the mafia in new orleans now he wants to kill me because i know about the body but he cant because the gas will kill us first he laughed and drank more whisky soon he was drunk and asleep mark gently opened the car door and ran to where ricky was hiding i pulled the tube out said ricky in a high voice mark lit a cigarette and watched the car suddenly the door fell open and the lawyer came out with the gun in his hand he saw the tube and started screaming his wild red eyes looked round for mark but mark was well hidden in the long grass then he stood still put the gun in his mouth closed his eyes and fired ricky made a low noise like an animal in pain and ran mark looked at the dead man and thought heres trouble he followed ricky home when he got there he called for the police he knew that every call was recorded theres a body on the old road behind tucker trailer park on highway he said we need your name son mark said nothing and put the phone down chapter two in trouble with the cops ricky was sick he seemed to be crying but there were no tears his skin was cold and wet his thumb was in his mouth his eyes were open and his body was shaking mark was worried he remembered a television programme about some kids who saw a horrible accident after that their thumbs were in their mouths like babies for a year mark said his mother how did you cut your face mark didnt want to lie to his mother but he didnt want to tell her about the man with the gun either its a long story mom he said dianne sighed and bit her nails they were sitting in a small room in st peters hospital she lit a cigarette and watched her younger son when she got home from work and saw ricky she had called the family doctor he had called an ambulance immediately now they were waiting for a hospital doctor to look at ricky it was past supper time and mark was restless he opened the door ill go and get us a hamburger mom he said mark stepped outside the room and a hand grabbed him he looked up into the face of a cop mark sway asked the cop mark nodded weve found the body said the cop what body said mark come on mark we know you live in tucker trailer park you made the call didnt you mark wanted to lie but he said yes sir well mark lets go and get those hamburgers said the cop and he took mark down to the hospital cafe how did you find the body mark my brother and i were playing in the trees did you take any drugs no sir but you were smoking said the cop we found your dead cigarettes stay away from drugs son yes sir did you see the man before he shot himself no sir so you just found him dead have you ever seen a dead body before only on tv the cop smiled kids saw everything on television these days what happened to your face he asked i got in a fight at school the other kid started it the other kid always does whats his name you dont know him said mark well i might want to talk to him said the cop now tell me why didnt you give your name to i dont know come on mark you must know why i dont know afraid i guess mark tried to look very young and innocent do you think im lying i dont know kid your story is full of holes said the cop i think you were there smoking in the trees and i think you saw the whole thing thats why your brothers in shock isnt it thats why youre afraid marks heart stopped and his blood ran cold he tried to seem calm his hands were shaking so he sat on them things were happening too fast could he go to prison could ricky go mad he needed time to think eat your food now said the cop wed better get back to your mom you can bring your coke with you chapter three evidence news of jerome cliffords death travelled fast to the mafia in new orleans his client barry muldanno was not sorry but he was worried barry the blade or simply the blade as he liked to be called wore shiny suits and a lot of gold barry enjoyed a fast life and liked people to be afraid of him his lawyer certainly was and thats why he killed himself barry liked to spend hours on his long black hair his face was often in the newspapers these days because of the trial he had killed a senator and his trial for murder was to take place in four weeks barry was not worried about the trial because nobody could find the senators body without the body who could prove a murder jerome clifford was a good mafia lawyer but barry had frightened him he told romey where the body was hidden he told him the body was under romeys own boat in his own garage what a joke but then romey had disappeared and now he was dead barry needed a new lawyer quickly roy foltrigg also knew about the death and was already on his way to memphis to find out more he hated flying so his car was fitted with phones and television and even a fax machine he had a driver too so that he could work as he travelled he hoped to arrive in memphis by midnight foltrigg was a us government lawyer his job was to prove that barry muldanno killed the senator but where was the body maybe there would be some evidence in memphis maybe clifford had known something said something another man wanted to know more about jerome cliffords death too he was a crime reporter who worked on the memphis press he wanted a story for the morning newspaper and he didnt care how he got it slick moellers real name was alfred but nobody knew it everyone called him slick crime was his life he knew everyone talked to everyone and never named anyone who trusted him with secrets he often knew about a crime before the cops he knew them all and drank coffee with them in allnight coffee bars he had spent the morning at their head office and now he was in st peters hospital slick knew there was something interesting about this death he knew clifford was barry muldannos lawyer he knew roy foltrigg was coming to town he knew about the two boys and that one of them was in shock and he knew some things that mark didnt know jerome clifford had left a note which nobody could read and there were strange fingerprints on his whisky bottle the fbi now controlled the case two fbi detectives waited for roy foltrigg one was jason mcthune fbi memphis and the other was larry trumann fbi new orleans they had the dead mans car and all the other evidence they knew someone had been in the car with jerome clifford because there were fingerprints on the whisky bottle whose are they said trumann maybe the kids said mcthune how can we check ill get you his coke bottle said one of the cops you can check that chapter four lawyers and fbi men mark was a thinker and a worrier when he couldnt sleep he went for long secret walks it started when his mother and father were fighting he wore dark clothes and left the trailer to move like a thief through the night he saw lovers and he saw crime he learned much but he never told he loved to sit on the hill above the trailer park and enjoy a quiet smoke he was glad to find peace when he got home now his mother and his brother were asleep in the hospital room but mark was still awake he watched them sleep for twenty minutes and then got bored he was not afraid of strange places he quietly covered his mother with a blanket and left the room the hall was quiet and empty he took the lift down to the cafe there were two people at one of the tables one was in a wheelchair the other was offering him a white card my names gill teal he said with a big smile did you have an accident maybe i can help you the other man didnt smile road accident he said two broken legs mark could see he was in pain well said gill teal im a lawyer and maybe you have a case who hit you the other man looked at the lawyer carefully it was an exxon lorry he said he didnt stop at a red light great said gill teal ive got money from exxon before what have you got two broken legs i can get you six hundred thousand dollars for that i talked to another lawyer today he said he could get me a million hes lying said gill teal trust me but maybe we can get more are you married have you got kids three kids said the man he looked tired great said gill teal for a family we can get more five hundred a month until you get back to work look choose me and youll get the best i promise ill think about it said the man can i call you tomorrow said the lawyer no said the man i said id think about it gill teal got up ok he said you think about it youve got my card he shook hands and left the man in the wheelchair pushed himself away leaving the card on the table when he had gone mark took the card he looked at the name and the address he put the card in his pocket and sat back to watch the television roy foltrigg liked to be on television he really enjoyed those moments when the cameras were waiting for him just at the right moment he would arrive walking quickly holding his hand up like a very important man who would love to answer questions but just didnt have the time he spent many pleasant moments watching videos of himself arriving at important places tonight however there were no cameras and no reporters when he arrived at the fbi offices in memphis it was after midnight jason mcthune and larry trumann introduced themselves there was only one chair and foltrigg took it mcthune explained the facts quickly he told foltrigg about finding the car what was in it the gun the time of death and about mark sway mark and his younger brother found the body and told the police they live about half a mile away in a trailer park the younger kid is in hospital now hes in shock his mother dianne is with him and mark is there too hes lying whats he lying about asked foltrigg he says he arrived after clifford shot himself but we dont believe him said mcthune first his fingerprints are all over the car inside and out theyre on jeromes whisky bottle and theyre on the tail pipe too how did you check his prints asked foltrigg off a bottle of coke he drank tonight said mcthune next we found three cigarettes near the car we think the boys were having a quiet smoke when clifford arrived they hid and watched him maybe they pulled his tube from the tail pipe were not sure and the kids arent telling the little boy cant talk just now but were sure mark is lying what about clifford asked foltrigg we checked his blood continued mcthune he was drunk and full of drugs too we cant know what he was thinking we know he left new orleans in the morning and we think he bought the gun here in memphis why memphis he was born here said mcthune maybe he wanted to die where he was born he left a note he added picking up a piece of paper it tells his secretary what to do after his death we couldnt find the pen that wrote it foltrigg took it from him and read it whats this at the bottom he asked the ink is different it says mark mark where are but i cant read the rest right said mcthune we cant read that bit either we found the second pen in the car so maybe clifford used it there but he was too drunk to write clearly foltrigg listened with his mouth open so what does it mean he asked theres no mark in cliffords family said mcthune we checked so we think the note is for mark sway but how did he know marks name unless he talked to him why would the kid lie because hes afraid said mcthune we think he was in the car we think he and clifford talked about something at some point the kid left the car clifford tried to add something to the note and then shot himself foltriggs mouth was open again maybe the kids afraid because clifford told him something he doesnt need to know finished mcthune foltrigg shut his mouth put the note on the desk and cleared his throat have you talked to the kid he asked not yet said mcthune well do that first thing in the morning wed like to talk to his little brother too but well have to ask his doctor id like to be there said foltrigg thinking about the body we must know everything mark sway knows chapter five in the hospital mark was asleep in front of the television when a nurse found him next morning she gave him some orange juice and took him to rickys room dr greenway is here she said and he wants to see you dianne looked tired she stood at the foot of rickys bed and her hands were shaking mark stood next to her and she put her arm on his shoulder they watched as the doctor touched rickys head and spoke to him rickys eyes were closed he doesnt hear you doctor dianne said finally she didnt like the way greenway was using baby talk greenway continued touching and talking dianne had tears in her eyes mark smelled fresh soap and noticed her hair was wet she had changed her clothes too but there was no makeup greenway stood straight a very bad case he said staring at rickys closed eyes whats next said dianne we wait said the doctor hell wake up and when he does its very important that you are in this room he must see his mother when he opens his eyes do you understand im not leaving said dianne greenway looked at mark you can come and go a bit but its best if you stay here as much as possible too mark nodded his head but he knew he would get bored have you seen cases like this before asked dianne greenway looked at ricky and decided to tell the truth he shook his head not quite this bad he said but im not worried ricky will be all right itll just take some time he took a card and a newspaper from his bag heres my phone number he said if ricky wakes up tell the nurses and theyll call me immediately okay dianne took the card and nodded greenway opened the newspaper have you seen this he asked no she answered well youd better read it its about mr clifford mark looked at the paper and saw a big photo of romey underneath the photo he read mafia lawyer shoots himself the word mafia jumped at mark and suddenly he felt sick greenway leaned forward and spoke softly to dianne it seems that mr clifford was a wellknown lawyer in new orleans he was working on a murder case the police and the fbi are downstairs they want to talk to mark why asked dianne its a big case the murdered man was a senator youll understand more when you read this story then you can talk to them no said mark suddenly dianne and greenway looked at him i dont want to talk to them said mark i i might get like ricky if i have to talk about he added keep them away for now said dianne all right said the doctor ill keep them away until twelve now dont worry just stay by this bed until i come back greenway left dianne ran to the bathroom with the newspaper and lit a cigarette mark turned on the television by rickys bed and found the news programme nothing but weather and sports dianne came back into the room cliffords client killed a united states senator she said slowly i wonder why he did that said mark because he could think of nothing different to say it says jerome clifford worked for the new orleans mafia and they think his client is a member mark had seen film about the mafia on television his heart jumped and he felt pains in his stomach im hungry mom are you hungry why didnt you tell me the truth mark im sorry mom i planned to tell you when we were alone dianne looked sad and tired you never lie to me mark im really hungry mom can we talk about this later give me some money and ill run down to the cafe and get us something to eat dont you want some coffee luckily dianne wasnt ready for a serious talk yet she opened her purse and gave him five dollars mark took the money and put it in his pocket you know where the cafe is asked dianne he nodded be careful she said and sat down again to watch ricky mark left the room he needed time to think chapter six reggie love as mark ate his breakfast in the cafe he looked at gill teals card he knew what he needed to do he took some coffee back to his mother and gave her a kiss im going to look around the hospital for a bit he told her and left the room again he asked the nurses for a phone book and looked at the city map gill teals office was not far away then he went downstairs again and left the hospital by a back door mark walked quickly it was tuesday and he was the only kid on the street he didnt want anyone to ask why he wasnt at school gill teals building was old and very tall he entered the lift with a crowd of others and went to the third floor when he got out he was in a long hall with a lot of doors he tried to walk calmly looking at the names on the doors they were all lawyers but he wanted gill teal at the end of the hall he found the right door the words gill teal the peoples lawyer were painted on it three people waited by the door mark entered the office it was crowded with sad sick people just like the hospital mr teal certainly had a lot of clients what do you want said someone rudely mark answered softly id like to see mr teal does he know you no maam did you have an accident no maam well youre in the wrong place why do you need a lawyer its private said mark look kid you see all these people theyre all waiting to see mr teal hes a very busy man and he only takes accident cases okay said mark he was glad to leave the crowded office he took the stairs and walked around the second floor more lawyers he passed a few of them in the hall they were too busy to notice him suddenly he saw a policeman coming towards him the next door had reggie love lawyer painted on it in small letters mark quickly opened the door and stepped inside there was a glass table some magazines soft music and three chairs and nobody waiting a young man with a tie but no jacket sat behind a desk may i help you he said quite pleasantly id like to see a lawyer arent you a bit young yes but im having some

reggie love was fiftytwo years old and had been a lawyer for only five years the first thing that mark noticed about her was her hair it was gray and very short shorter than his her eyes were green

and the man reggie asked questions and wrote everything down mark told her everything except what romey had said about the body an hour after they started reggie took a break clint brought a newspaper and she read the story twice then she read her notes again mark walked around the office as she read his lawyer looked very worried and he nearly felt sorry for her he really liked her he sat down again what are you afraid of mark she said at last lots of things ive lied to the police and i think they know it my little brothers very sick because of me i havent told the truth to his doctor

mark pulled down his shirt perfect said reggie lets go down the meeting was on the second floor in room reggie checked the recorder again and turned it on now go she said ill wait out here just

fbi wanting to talk to him youre famous said a nurse giving mark the newspaper what is it said mark suddenly seeing his own face he read the story slowly this is bad he thought now the mafia knows where to find me mark was on his way to the cafe for breakfast he gave the paper back and walked to the lift the door opened and he stepped in it was empty it was still early at floor number eight the lift stopped and a man stepped in he wore a white coat and jeans mark didnt look at him he was tired of meeting new people the door closed and suddenly the man grabbed mark he had a knife he pushed his horrible face near marks listen to me mark sway he said i dont know what jerome clifford told you but if you repeat a single word of it even to your lawyer ill kill you and ill kill your mother and your little brother gronke was doing his job well mark was white with fear i know where you live continued the man and i know where you go to school you cant escape me understand marks eyes were suddenly wet he nodded yes yes yes the lift was stopping again and if you tell anyone about me ill get you said the man and he disappeared reggie reached her office at nine clint made her a cup of coffee and gave her the morning newspaper coffees excellent she said as she opened the paper and saw marks picture suddenly mark himself was in the room wet from the rain and out of breath whats the matter mark she asked hows ricky hes okay said mark have you seen todays paper ive just read it she said does it worry you of course it does clint came into the room with a hot drink for mark mark thanked him and warmed his hands on the cup are you ready to meet the fbi at ten asked reggie im not sure i want to talk to them okay you dont have to you look frightened why what would happen to me if i never told anyone what i know youve told me yes but youre my lawyer and i havent told you everything not where the body is i know mark so what happens if i never tell reggie had been thinking about this all night but she still had no answer yesterday afternoon when she met foltrigg she saw that he would try everything possible to get mark to talk a lie could save mark one simple lie but she was a lawyer and she could not advise him to lie poor kid i think theyll try to make you talk she said at last its very rare but i think the law can make you tell what you know to a judge and if i refuse good question mark if you were an adult you could go to prison i dont know what theyd do with a child but if you lie to the judge you could be in big trouble if i tell the truth im in bigger trouble why mark didnt answer mark at the hospital last night you told me you were ready to talk to the fbi and tell them your story now youve changed your mind why whats happened mark gently put his cup on the table covered his face and began to cry until ten oclock roy foltrigg was in an excellent mood all yesterday afternoon his men had been finding information about reggie love they knew she used to be married to a rich doctor they knew the doctor had left her and they knew that she had started drinking heavily and taking drugs so the doctor was able to take her children from her now she had no husband no children and no money and a new name roy foltrigg thought he could use this information against reggie foltriggs job was to prove that barry muldanno had killed the senator he was sure that mark knew something that would help him then he would win the case and have his face on the front pages of the newspapers again at ten oclock foltrigg returned to reggies office ready for the promised meeting with mark clint opened the door to him im sorry mr foltrigg he said reggie and mark have nothing to discuss today foltrigg shouted angrily then left banging the door he went straight to the fbi office and shouted some more i want the kid followed he said angrily we know gronkes in town he mustnt get to the kid watch the lawyer too and i want you to prepare papers to take to a judge were going to make mark sway talk chapter eleven momma love when reggie and mark returned to the hospital there were reporters everywhere ms love ms love they called just a few questions please she took marks hand and walked faster is it true your client is refusing to speak to the fbi did your client talk to jerome clifford before he died is it true your client knows where the senators body is reggie said quickly to mark dont look at them and dont say a word in room ricky was sitting on the end of the bed dr greenway told mark to sit next to him and hold his hand ricky he said i would like to talk about the other day when you and mark were hiding in the trees its okay ricky said mark he knows we were smoking moms not angry with us im really cold said ricky ricky its very warm in here said dr greenway now do you remember seeing the big black car yes said ricky quietly what did the big black car do ricky ricky shut his eyes tightly put his head on marks knee and his thumb went into his mouth he didnt speak another word for twentyfour hours reggie asked dianne if mark could spend the night at her house dianne agreed so when ricky was asleep again they left the hospital in reggies sports car it was old but reggie liked to drive fast and that was fine with mark mark watched the mirror closely to see if anyone was following them you think mom and ricky are safe he asked yes dont worry about them the hospital promised to keep guards at the door now i wonder what momma love is giving us for dinner momma love was reggies mother she often had young guests to dinner most of reggies work was with children some had family problems some had drug problems and some had already started a life of crime reggie often decided that they needed good food at momma loves momma loves cooking is the best she told mark and it was momma love was half italian and she cooked food the old way everything was fresh and smelled perfect they spent an hour at the table talking and eating dinner in the trailer never took more than ten minutes after dinner momma love showed mark some photographs reggies children she said i never see them now ones on drugs and the other has big money problems their father took them and spoiled them reggie felt angry at first but shes got a new life now and tries not to think about it marks bed was comfortable and he fell asleep quickly but around two oclock he woke up and found himself worrying about mom and ricky why was he here his place was with them at the hospital he got up and stood at the window thinking about the past two days it had all started on monday after school now he had missed two days of school when would it all end as mark looked into the dark night he suddenly noticed a small red light a cigarette someone was out there in the street smoking a cigarette though he couldnt be seen mark held his breath someone was watching the house gronke put out his cigarette and went to his car the kid was not going to move tonight and he had something to do he drove to tucker trailer park chapter twelve things get worse seventhirty am was too early for reggie but she had to get mark back to dianne clint called before they left bad news reggie he said marks picture is on the front page again slick moeller has written another story when they got to the hospital they could see the reporters waiting outside the front door follow me said mark and led reggie through a side door to the kitchens and up the back stairs i know this hospital well now dont i he said proudly his smile dropped when he saw his mother she was sitting in the hall with a cop next to her she was crying hard mark ran to her she grabbed him and held him tight mark she said our trailer burned down last night thats right said the cop just a few hours ago dianne was still crying everythings gone mark what started the fire reggie asked dont know yet said the cop hows ricky mom asked mark hes okay said dianne he had a good night look mom said mark can we go inside and talk dianne nodded and took him into the room when the door closed the tiny homeless sway family was all alone foltrigg had a plan maybe we can get a judge to take mark into custody get the law to keep him safe for us the others looked interested here are the advantages said foltrigg first it will protect mark from the mafia at the same time it will frighten mark and make him ready to talk well tell the judge we need mark safe so he can talk in court if you want to do that said mcthune you need to see judge harry roosevelt hes the chief judge for the childrens courts here in memphis but dont tell him you want to frighten mark the best way to get him to agree to custody is to show him that mark is in danger and if you want to get mark into court you will have to say he knows something that will help the muldanno case he knows something all right said foltrigg im sure of it when judge harry roosevelt became a judge twentytwo years ago he was the first black judge of the childrens court in tennessee he was clever he was kind and he was wise when he heard about the danger to mark sway he thought carefully he didnt like to do it but he agreed to hear mark in court and to take him into custody until then he signed an order take him into the childrens prison he said give him a private room do not frighten him ill speak to his lawyer later today mark and dianne were in their room talking about the fire and all the things they had lost they whispered because they didnt want ricky to know about the fire yet ricky was awake his eyes were open but he was staring at the ceiling without saying a word or moving at all there was something mark didnt say to dianne something that worried him maybe the fire wasnt an accident could it be another message from the man with the knife trailers didnt usually burn down at four oclock in the morning there was a knock at the door mark opened it two men entered the room memphis police here detective nassar and detective klickman looking for dianne sway and they handed dianne some papers these are from the childrens court ms sway said nassar were here to take mark sway into custody now maam the judge wants to see him in court this afternoon what dianne shouted at nassar dropping the papers judges orders said nassar picking up the papers you cant take my son shouted dianne but they could and they did pulling him into the hall dianne ran after them grabbed mark and screamed nassar held dianne and klickman tried to pull mark away dianne kicked klickman and there was more screaming and fighting in the middle of all this ricky appeared at the door he stared at mark who was held by klickman he stared at his mother who was held by nassar everyone stared at ricky his face was white and his mouth was open its okay mom ill go said mark look after ricky and call reggie tell her to come to the prison a lady in a uniform with doreen on the pocket met them at the prison she gave nassar a paper to sign and asked mark to empty his pockets everything went into a metal box then she took him to a small room it wasnt too bad but mark felt very lonely can i use a phone he asked to call my mom doreen brought him a phone and a phone book you can have it for ten minutes she said and locked the door mark found the number for st peters and asked for room number isnt taking calls just now he was told ricky must be asleep thought mark he tried reggie no luck then he had an idea he called a pizza restaurant this is detective klickman memphis police he said in a deep voice please send me forty pizzas for a surprise party here in the police station ill pay when they come when doreen came back for the phone mark looked much happier chapter thirteen back to prison reggie didnt hear about mark until lunchtime on thursday she often worked in the childrens courts and she knew judge roosevelt well she rushed to his office im not surprised to see you reggie he said i cant understand why you did this harry she said mark has done nothing wrong ive agreed to see him in court this afternoon said the judge and im keeping him safe until then wait here ill ask the guards to bring him here to see you now when mark arrived he smiled at reggie dont worry he said im okay but what should i say in court reggie explained carefully no one can make you talk she said but the judge can keep you in custody if you dont but ive done nothing wrong no said reggie but if the judge asks you questions and you dont answer then that would be wrong the law is very clear on this if you know something that will help a murder case you cant keep quiet even if you think youre in danger its a stupid law said mark maybe said reggie but we cant change it today i could tell them i dont know anything said mark reggie wanted to say yes but she kept silent at last she said firmly you cant he in court mark slick moeller was waiting outside the courtroom he saw mark go in with two guards he saw reggie go in next and then the fbi men with foltrigg he smiled to himself in the childrens court there could be no cameras and no reporters he knew foltrigg wouldnt like that the courtroom door was locked and slick waited patiently when it was unlocked again he walked quickly into the mens toilets and waited there soon one of the guards joined him what happened asked slick be quick the kid wouldnt talk said the guard so hes going back to prison what does he know the judge asked him if he knew where the senators body is but he wouldnt answer what next asked slick the judge wants to see him again tomorrow hes given him one night to change his mind slick passed the guard one hundred dollars you didnt hear it from me said the guard trust me said slick foltrigg was shouting again that nogood judge he said again and again that nogood judge hes too soft im going back to new orleans this murder case is a new orleans job i can get mark called to the courts in new orleans then we can really make him talk but the fbi had other ideas when foltrigg had left they asked for another meeting with the judge and reggie they wanted to explain how the government could protect mark and his family if he gave evidence against the mafia its called the witness protection programme said mcthune ive heard of it mr mcthune said the judge tell us more about it its quite simple we move the family to another city we give them new names we find a good job for the mother and get them a nice place to live we make sure the boys are in a good school we give them some money and we stay close by well reggie said the judge it sounds good it certainly did at the moment the sways had no home dianne had a poor job they had no relations in memphis they cant move just now she said ricky must stay in hospital weve found a childrens hospital in phoenix that can take him right away said mcthune its a private hospital and of course well pay for it what do you think reggie asked judge roosevelt ill talk to dianne about it said reggie good said the judge and see if she can come to court tomorrow id like her to be there ill try said reggie mark was also thinking about how to save his family doreen was surprised to see him back at the prison how long are you back for she asked the judge didnt say i have to go to court again tomorrow hows your little brother mark put on a very sad face hes probably going to die he said no yes said mark in a small voice he doesnt talk he makes terrible noises and he doesnt eat im sorry its bad i dont feel so good myself poor kid anything i can get you no i just need to lie down poor kid she said again ill keep an eye on you chapter fourteen no other way slick s story of marks courtroom appearance was in the newspaper on friday morning front page news again gronke took the first plane to new orleans and called the blade look barry he said i cant do much when the kids in prison can i but he hasnt talked yet think about it i got to him with a knife i burned the trailer the kids too frightened to speak i dont know gronke said muldanno the kid knows something sure you cant get to him we cant kill the kid barry everyones watching him what about his mother or brother gronke said nothing he was tired of muldannos game what about his lawyer why do you want to kill his lawyer because i hate lawyers said the blade wildly no barry said gronke wondering if muldanno was going mad im not in the mood to kill anyone just now thats fine said muldanno another man can do it when judge roosevelt read slicks story his eyes grew cold in the childrens court everything was private how did moeller get his information he would call moeller to the court today to explain it was going to be another busy day but at the end of it his sons would take him fishing for the weekend he smiled at this pleasant thought the courtroom story made foltrigg angry again but the papers to call mark to the court in new orleans were nearly ready he took a call from the local fbi mr foltrigg we thought youd like to know that gronkes back in town he arrived this morning and we have a recording of a phone conversation with muldanno let me hear it said foltrigg good he said when hed heard it send it to memphis i want judge roosevelt to hear it today it will make him keep mark sway in custody for the weekend tonight well send papers to call mark to new orleans the courts are closed until monday and by that time well have the kid here where we want him slicks story made reggie sad with newspaper reports like this the mafia knew everything that was going on she sat with mark now trying to explain about the witness protection programme what does mom think asked mark shes not sure said reggie im not sure either said mark i saw this once in a film someone told the truth about the mafia and the fbi helped him to disappear he got a new face even a new wife he went to brazil what happened it took the mafia a year to find him they killed his wife too it was just a film mark theres no other way its the safest thing to do of course i have to tell them what i know before theyll do all these wonderful things for us thats part of the agreement mark the mafia never forgets reggie youve watched too many films mark its easy for you reggie youll be fine but well live in fear for the rest of our lives theres no other way mark yes there is i could lie chapter fifteen escape mark didnt lie but he wasnt ready yet to tell the truth when the court met again on friday afternoon no one was really surprised when he again refused to answer the judges questions im not going to answer that he said time after time but everyone was shocked by the recording that was played reggies eyes opened wide when she heard muldanno speak of killing her the judge agreed that mark was in great danger and returned him to custody there was a surprise though when slick moeller came before the judge true to his word the reporter refused to name the person who gave him private information well mr moeller said the judge if i can send a child to prison for refusing to tell what he knows i can do the same for you slick knew more than anyone about crime in memphis but he had never been inside a prison now it was his turn back in his prison room mark was ready for his plan for half an hour he ran around his room until his heart was going very fast and his face was red and hot when he heard doreens key he lay on the floor closed his eyes and put his thumb in his mouth mark shouted doreen when she saw him mark oh you poor kid she ran from the room to get help and was back in a few seconds with another guard mark was worried about this said doreen hes in shock like his little brother look his skin is all wet and his heart is going so fast stay here ill call an ambulance said the other guard we need to get him to hospital everything was confused after that nobody wanted a boy to die in prison when the ambulance came the guards signed papers to send mark to hospital and he was taken at once to st peters more papers there were nurses everywhere and everyone was in a hurry a nurse moved mark to a bed sign this said the ambulance men and be quick we have another case waiting the nurse signed the men left and the nurse went to answer a phone mark opened his eyes and saw he was alone he jumped off the bed and ran into a hall nobody noticed him he disappeared into an empty office and found a phone reggie he said quickly when she answered the phone im in st peters i cant talk now please come and get me dont tell anyone ill be in the car park mark knew how to hide in the hospital he moved quickly and quietly and found his way to the car park when reggies car arrived he climbed in and hid on the floor drive reggie he said drive anywhere lets go ill explain later when the nurse came back mark was not there someones moved him she thought and hurried off to another job when foltriggs men arrived with papers to take mark to new orleans they checked the prison and then checked the hospital only then did people realise that he was gone hes what cried dianne go find him said mcthune but by then mark and reggie were on the road where are we going asked reggie listen reggie said mark ive been thinking what if romey told me a lie what if the body isnt where he said then id be safe we need to check we need to go to new orleans chapter suxteen new orleans on saturday the news was out everyone was looking for mark when barry muldanno heard he was wild with fear he went straight to tell his uncle the kids disappeared he said whats he going to do now i need to move the body help me give me two men youre stupid stupid stupid said uncle johnny ill give you two men but dont get caught ill do it tonight said barry when its dark reggie and mark reached new orleans on saturday afternoon they drove all night stopping only to sleep a few hours in the car reggie knew it was wrong she knew the cops

it was time to move slowly they crawled through the grass towards the garage reggie was shaking she was afraid of snakes suddenly mark stopped theres a light in there he whispered theres someone there stay here reggie he crawled silently to a window there was the boat and it was moving he saw the shapes of three men okay muldanno said one of the men where do we dig marks heart was in his mouth he crawled back to reggie its muldanno he whispered theyre digging up the body what do we do now oh no said reggie i told you this was crazy let me think and suddenly she knew what to do she crawled in the other direction towards the house next door with her shoe she broke a window suddenly the night was no longer silent bells rang everywhere lights went on in the house next door voices were shouting a man appeared with a gun he shot wildly into the dark look called mark theyre leaving muldanno and his men ran out of the garage and disappeared reggie crawled back it was another hour before the confusion ended police came to the house next door more shouting more lights mark and reggie stayed hidden behind cliffords garage then all was silent again come on said mark we have to look the lock on the garage door was broken in the dark they moved towards the boat next to it there was a hole in the hole was a plastic bag we have to look said mark again and they opened the bag
