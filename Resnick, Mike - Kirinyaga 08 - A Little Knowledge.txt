there was a time when animals could speak lions and zebras elephants and leopards birds and men all shared the earth they labored side by side they met and spoke of many things they exchanged visits and gifts then one day ngai who rules the universe from his throne atop kirinyaga which men now call mount kenya summoned all of his creations to meet with him i have done everything i can to make life good for all my creatures said ngai the assembled animals and men began to sing his praises but ngai held up his hand and they immediately stopped i have made life too good for you he continued none among you has died for the past year what is wrong with that asked the zebra just as you are constrained by your natures said ngai just as the elephant cannot fly and the impala cannot climb trees so i cannot be dishonest since no one has died i cannot feel compassion for you and without compassion i cannot water the savannah and the forest with my tears and without water the grasses and the trees will shrivel and die there was much moaning and wailing from the creatures but again ngai silenced them i will tell you a story he said and you must learn from it once there were two colonies of ants one colony was very wise and one colony was very foolish and they lived next to each other one day they received word that an aardvark a creature that eats ants was coming to their land the foolish colony went about their business hoping that the aardvark would ignore them and attack their neighbors but the wise colony built a mound that could withstand even the efforts of an aardvark and they gathered sugar and honey and stockpiled it in the mound when the aardvark reached the kingdom of the ants he immediately attacked the wise ants but the mound withstood his greatest efforts and the ants within survived by eating their sugar and honey finally after many fruitless days the aardvark wandered over to the kingdom of the foolish ants and dined well that evening ngai fell silent and none of his creatures dared ask him to speak further instead they returned to their homes and discussed his story and made their preparations for the coming drought a year passed and finally the men decided to sacrifice an innocent goat and that very day ngais tears fell upon the parched and barren land the next morning ngai again summoned his creatures to the holy mountain how have you fared during the past year he asked each of them very badly moaned the elephant who was very thin and weak we did as you instructed us and built a mound and gathered sugar and honey but we grew hot and uncomfortable within the mound and there is not enough sugar and honey in all the world to feed a family of elephants we have fared even worse wailed the lion who was even thinner for lions cannot eat sugar and honey at all but must have meat and so it went as each animal poured out its misery finally ngai turned to the man and ask him the same question we have fared very well replied the man we built a container for water and filled it before the drought came and we stockpiled enough grain to last us to this day i am very proud of you said ngai of all my creatures only you understood my story it is not fair protested the other animals we built mounds and saved sugar and honey as you told us to what i told you was a parable said ngai and you have mistaken the facts of it for the truth that lay beneath i gave you the power to think but since you have not used it i hereby take it away and as a further punishment you will no longer have the ability to speak for creatures that do not think have nothing to say and from that day forth only man among all ngais creations has had the power to think and speak for only man can pierce through the facts to find the truth you think you know a person when you have worked with him and trained him and guided his thinking since he was a small boy you think you can foresee his reactions to various situations you think you know how his mind works and if the person in question has been chosen by you selected from the mass of his companions and groomed for something special as young ndemi was selected and groomed by me to be my successor as the mundumugu the witch doctor to our terraformed world of kirinyaga the one thing you think above all else is that you possess his loyalty and his gratitude but even a mundumugu can be wrong i do not know exactly when or how it began i had chosen ndemi to be my assistant when he was still a kehee an uncircumcized child and i had worked diligently with him to prepare him for the position he would one day inherit from me i chose him not for his boldness though he feared nothing nor for his enthusiasm which was boundless but rather for his intellect for with the exception of one small girl long since dead he was by far the brightest of the children on kirinyaga and since we had emigrated to this world to create a kikuyu paradise far from the corrupt imitation of europe that kenya had become it was imperative that the mundumugu be the wisest of men for the mundumugu not only reads omens and casts spells but is also the repository for the collected wisdom and culture of his tribe day by day i added to ndemis limited storehouse of knowledge i taught him how to make medicine from the bark and pods of the acacia tree i showed him how to create the ointments that would ease the discomfort of the aged when the weather turned cold and wet i made him memorize the hundred spells that were used to bless the scarecrows in the field i told him a thousand parables for the kikuyu have a parable for every need and every occasion and the wise mundumugu is the one who finds the right parable for each situation and finally after he had served me faithfully for six long years coming up my hill every morning feeding my chickens and goats lighting the fire in my boma and filling my empty water gourds before his daily lessons began i took him into my hut and showed him how my computer worked there are only four computers on all of kirinyaga the others belong to koinnage the paramount chief of our village and to two chiefs of distant clans but their computers can do nothing but send and receive messages only mine is tied into the data banks of the eutopian council the ruling body that had given kirinyaga its charter for only the mundumugu has the strength and the vision to be exposed to european culture without becoming corrupted by it one of the primary purposes of my computer was to plot the orbital adjustments that would bring seasonal changes to kirinyaga so that the rains would come on schedule and the crops would flourish and the harvest would be successful it was perhaps the mundumugus most important obligation to his people since it assured their survival i spent many long days teaching ndemi all the many intracacies of the computer until he knew its workings as well as i myself did and could speak to it with perfect ease the morning that i first noticed the change in him began like any other i awoke wrapped my blanket around my withered shoulders and walked painfully out of my hut to sit by my fire until the warming rays of the sun took the chill from the air and as always there was no fire ndemi came up the path to my hill a few minutes later jambo koriba he said greeting me with his usual smile jambo ndemi i said how many times have i explained to you that i am an old man and that i must sit by my fire until the air becomes warmer i am sorry koriba he said but as i was leaving my fathers shamba i saw a hyena stalking one of our goats and i had to drive it off he held his spear up as if that were proof of his statement i could not help but admire his ingenuity it was perhaps the thousandth time he had been late and never had he given the same excuse twice still the situation was becoming intolerable and when he finished his chores and the fire had warmed my bones and eased my pain i told him to sit down opposite me what is our lesson for today he asked as he squatted down the lesson will come later i said finally letting my blanket fall from my shoulders as the first warm breeze of the day blew a fine cloud of dust past my face but first i will tell you a story he nodded and stared intently at me as i began speaking once there was a kikuyu chief i said he had many admirable qualities he was a mighty warrior and in council his words carried great weight but along with his many good qualities he also had a flaw one day he saw a maiden tilling the fields in her fathers shamba and he was smitten with her he meant to tell her of his love the very next day but as he set out to see her his way was blocked by an elephant and he retreated and waited until the elephant had passed when he finally arrived at the maidens boma he discovered that a young warrior was paying her court nevertheless she smiled at him when their eyes met and undiscouraged he made up his mind to visit her the following day this time a deadly snake blocked his way and once again when he arrived he found the maiden being courted by his rival once more she gave him an encouraging smile and so he decided to come back a third time on the morning of the third day he lay on his blanket in his hut and thought about all the many things he wanted to tell her to impress her with his ardor by the time he had decided upon the best approach to win her favor the sun was setting he ran all the way from his boma to that of the maiden only to find that his rival had just paid her father five cattle and thirty goats for her hand in marriage he managed to get the maiden alone for a moment and poured forth his litany of love i love you too she answered but although i waited for you each day and hoped that you would come you were always late i have excuses to offer he said on the first day i encountered an elephant and on the second day a killer snake was in my path he did not dare tell her the real reason he was late a third time so he said and today a leopard confronted me and i had to kill it with my spear before i could continue on my way i am sorry said the maiden but i am still promised to another do you not believe me he demanded it makes no difference whether you are telling the truth or not she replied for whether the lion and the snake and the leopard are real or whether they are lies the result is the same you have lost your hearts desire because you were late i stopped and stared at ndemi do you understand the moral of my story i asked he nodded it does not matter to you whether a hyena was stalking my fathers goat or not all that matters is that i was late that is correct i said this is where such things had always ended and then we would begin his lessons but not this day it is a foolish story he said looking out across the vast savannah oh i asked why because it begins with a lie what lie the kikuyu had no chiefs until the british created them he answered who told you that i asked i learned it from the box that glows with life he said finally meeting my gaze my computer he nodded again i have had many long discussions about the kikuyu with it and i have learned many things he paused we did not even live in villages until the time of the mau mau and then the british made us live together so that we could be more easily watched and it was the british who created our tribal chiefs so that they could rule us through them that is true i acknowledged but it is unimportant to my story but your story was untrue with its first line he said so why should the rest of it be true why did you not just say ndemi if you are late again i will not care whether your reason is true or false i will punish you because it is important for you to understand why you must not be late but the story is a lie everyone knows that it takes more than three days to court and purchase a wife so it began with a lie and it ended with a lie you are looking at the surface of things i said watching a small insect crawl over my foot and finally flicking it off the truth lies beneath the truth is that you do not want me to be late what has that to do with the elephant and the leopard which were extinct before we came to kirinyaga listen to me ndemi i said when you become the mundumugu you will have to impart certain values certain lessons to your people and you must do so in a way that they understand this is especially true of the children who are the clay that you will mold into the next generation of kikuyu ndemi was silent for a long moment i think you are wrong koriba he said at last not only will the people understand you if you speak plainly to them but stories like the one you just told me are filled with lies which they will think are true simply because they come from the mundumugus lips no i said sharply we came to kirinyaga to live as the kikuyu lived before the europeans tried to change us into that characterless tribe known as kenyans there is a poetry to my stories a tradition to them they reach out to our racial memory of the way things were and the way we hope to make them again i paused to consider which path to follow for never before had ndemi so bluntly opposed my teachings you yourself used to beg me for stories and of all the children you were the quickest to find the true meaning of them i was younger then he said you were a kikuyu then i said i am still a kikuyu you are a kikuyu who has been exposed to european knowledge and european history i said this is unavoidable if you are to succeed me as the mundumugu for we hold our charter at the whim of the europeans and you must be able to speak to them and work their machine but your greatest challenge as a kikuyu and a mundumugu is to avoid becoming corrupted by them i do not feel corrupted he said i have learned many things from the computer so you have i agreed as a fish eagle circled lazily overhead and the breeze brought the smell of a nearby herd of wildebeest and you have forgotten many things what have i forgotten he demanded watching the fish eagle swoop down and grab a fish from the river you may test me and see how good my memory is you have forgotten that the true value of a story is that the listener must bring something to it i said i could simply order you not to be late as you suggest but the purpose of the story is to make you use your brain to understand why you should not be late i paused you are also forgetting that the reason we do not try to become like the europeans is because we tried once before and became only kenyans he was silent for a long time finally he looked up at me may we skip todays lesson he asked you have given me much to think about i nodded my acquiesence come back tomorrow and we will discuss your thoughts he stood up and walked down the long winding path that led from my hill to the village but though i waited for him until the sun was high in the sky the next day he did not come back just as it is good for fledgling birds to test their wings it is good for young people to test their powers by questioning authority i bore ndemi no malice but simply waited until the day that he returned somewhat humbled to resume his studies but the fact that i now had no assistant did not absolve me of my duties and so each day i walked down to the village and blessed the scarecrows and took my place alongside koinnage in the council of elders i brought new ointment for old sibokis joints which were causing him discomfort and i sacrificed a goat so that ngai would look with favor upon the pending marriage of maruta with a man of another clan as always when i made my rounds i was followed everywhere by the village children who begged me to stop what i was doing and tell them a story for two days i was too busy for a mundumugu has many tasks to perform but on the morning of the third day i had some time to spare and i gathered them around me in the shade of an acacia tree what kind of story would you like to hear i asked tell us of the old days when we still lived in kenya said a girl i smiled they always asked for stories of kenya not that they knew where kenya was or what it meant to the kikuyu but when we lived in kenya the lion and the rhinoceros and the elephant were not yet extinct and they loved stories in which animals spoke and displayed greater wisdom than men a wisdom that they themselves assimilated as i repeated the stories very well i said i will tell you the story of the foolish lion they all sat or squatted down in a semicircle facing me with rapt attention and i continued once there was a foolish lion who lived on the slopes of kirinyaga the holy mountain and because he was a foolish lion he did not believe that ngai had given the mountain to gikuyu the very first man then one morning that is wrong koriba said one of the boys i focused my weak eyes on him and saw that it was mdutu the son of karenja you have interrupted your mundumugu i noted harshly and even worse you have contradicted him why ngai did not give kirinyaga to gikuyu said mdutu getting to his feet he most certainly did i replied kirinyaga belongs to the kikuyu that cannot be so he persisted for kirinyaga is not a kikuyu name but a maasai name kiri means mountain in the language of maa and nyaga means light is it not more likely that ngai gave the mountain to the maasai and that our warriors took it away from them how do you know what these words mean in the language of the maasai i demanded that language is not known to anyone on kirinyaga ndemi told us said mdutu well ndemi is wrong i shouted the truth has been passed on from gikuyu through his nine daughters and his nine sonsinlaw all the way down to me and never has it varied the kikuyu are ngais chosen people just as he gave the spear and kilimanjaro to the maasai he gave the diggingstick and kirinyaga to us kirinyaga has always belonged to the kikuyu and it always will no koriba you are wrong said a soft highpitched voice and i turned to face my new assailant it was tiny thimi the daughter of njomu barely seven years old who rose to contradict me ndemi told us that many years ago the kikuyu sold kirinyaga to a european named john boyes for six goats and it was the british government that made him return it to us who do you believe i demanded severely a young boy who has lived for only fifteen long rains or your mundumugu i do not know she answered with no sign of fear he tells us dates and places and you speak of wise elephants and foolish lions it is very hard to decide then perhaps instead of the story of the foolish lion i said i will tell you the story of the arrogant boy no no the lion shouted some of the children be quiet i snapped you will hear what i want to tell you their protests subsided and thimi sat down again once there was a bright young boy i began was his name ndemi asked mdutu with a smile his name was legion i answered do not interrupt again or i shall leave and there will be no more stories until the next rains the smile vanished from mdutus face and he lowered his head as i said this was a very bright boy and he worked on his fathers shamba herding the goats and cattle and because he was a bright young boy he was always thinking and one day he thought of a way to make his chores easier so he went to his father and said that he had had a dream and in this dream they had built a wire enclosure with sharp barbs on the wire to keep the cattle in and the hyenas out and he was sure that if he were to build such an enclosure he would no longer have to herd the cattle but would be free to do other things i am glad to see that you are using your brain said the boys father but that idea has been tried before by the europeans if you wish to free yourself from your duties you must think of some other way but why said the boy just because the europeans thought of it does not make it bad after all it must work for them or they would not use it that is true said his father but what works for the europeans does not necessarily work for the kikuyu now do your chores and keep thinking and if you think hard enough i am sure you will come up with a better idea but along with being bright the boy was also arrogant and he refused to listen to his father even though his father was older and wiser and more experienced so he spent all his spare time attaching sharp little barbs to the wire and when he was done he built an enclosure and put his fathers cattle into it sure that they could not get out and the hyenas could not find a way in and when the enclosure was completed he went to sleep for the night i paused and surveyed my audience most of them were staring raptly at me trying to figure out what came next he awoke to screams of anger from his father and wails of anguish from his mother and sisters and ran out to see what had happened he found all of his fathers cattle dead during the night the hyenas whose jaws can crush a bone had bitten through the posts to which the wire was attached and the cattle in their panic ran into the wire and were held motionless by the barbs while the hyenas killed and ate them the arrogant boy looked upon the carnage with puzzlement how can this have happened he said the europeans have used this wire and it never happened to them there are no hyenas in europe said his father i told you that we are different from the europeans and that what works for them will not work for us but you refused to listen and now we must live our lives in poverty for in a single night your arrogance cost me the cattle that it has taken me a lifetime to accumulate i fell silent and waited for a response is that all asked mdutu at last that is all what did it mean asked another of the boys you tell me i said nobody answered for a few moments then balimi thimis older sister stood up it means that only europeans can use wire with barbs on it no i said you must not only listen child but think it means that what works for the europeans will not work for the kikuyu said mdutu and that it is arrogant to believe that it will that is correct i said that is not correct said a familiar voice from behind me and i turned to see ndemi standing there all it means is that the boy was too foolish to cover the posts with the wire the children looked at him and began nodding their heads in agreement no i said firmly it means that we must reject all things european including their ideas for they were not meant for the kikuyu but why koriba asked mdutu what is wrong with what ndemi says ndemi tells you only the facts of things i said but because he too is an arrogant boy he fails to see the truth what truth does he fail to see persisted mdutu that if the wire enclosure were to work then the next day the arrogant boy would borrow another idea from the europeans and yet another until he had no kikuyu ideas left and he had turned his shamba into a european farm europe is an exporter of food said ndemi kenya is an importer what does that mean asked thimi it means that ndemi has a little knowledge and does not yet know that that is a dangerous thing i answered it means responded ndemi that european farms produce more than enough to feed their tribes and kenyan farms do not produce enough and if that is the case it means that some european ideas may be good for the kikuyu perhaps you should wear shoes like the europeans i said angrily since you have decided to become one he shook his head i am a kikuyu not a european but i do not wish to be an ignorant kikuyu how can we remain true to what we were when your fables hide what we were from us no i said they reveal it i am sorry koriba said ndemi for you are a great mundumugu and i respect you above all men but in this matter you are wrong he paused and stared at me why did you never tell us that the only time in our history the kikuyu were united under the leadership of a single king the king was a white man named john boyes the children gasped in amazement if we do not know how it happened continued ndemi how can we prevent it from happening again you tell us stories of our wars the maasai and they are wonderful tales of courage and victory but according to the computer we lost every war we ever fought against them shouldnt we know that so if the maasai ever come to kirinyaga we are not deluded into fighting them because of the fables we have heard koriba is that true asked mdutu was our only king a european did we never defeat the maasai asked another of the children leave us for a moment i said and then i will answer you the children reluctantly got up and walked away until they were out of earshot then stood and stared at ndemi and myself why have you done this i said to ndemi you will destroy their pride in being kikuyu i am not less proud for knowing the truth said ndemi why should they be the stories i tell them are designed to make them distrust european ways and to make them happy they are kikuyu i explained trying to control my temper you will undermine the confidence they must have if kirinyaga is to remain our utopia most of us have never even seen a european answered ndemi when i was younger i used to dream about them and in my dreams they had claws like a lion and shook the earth like an elephant when they walked how does that prepare us for the day that we actually meet with them you will never meet them on kirinyaga i said and the purpose of my stories is to keep us on kirinyaga i paused once before we had never seen europeans and we were so taken by their machines and their medicines and their religions that we tried to become europeans ourselves and succeeded only in becoming something other than kikuyu that must never happen again but isnt it less likely to happen if you tell the children the truth persisted ndemi i do tell them the truth i said it is you who are confusing them with facts facts that you got from european historians and a european computer are the facts wrong that is not the issue ndemi i said these are children they must learn as children do as you yourself did and after their circumcision rituals when they become adults will you tell them the facts then that sentence was as close to rebellion as he had ever come indeed as anyone on kirinyaga had ever come never had i been more fond of a young man than i was of ndemi not even of my own son who had chosen to remain in kenya ndemi was bright he was bold and it was hardly unusual for one of his age to question authority therefore i decided to make another attempt to reason to him rather than risk a permanent rift in our relationship you are still the brightest young man on kirinyaga i said truthfully so i will pose you a question and i will expect an honest answer you seek after history and i seek after truth which do you suppose is the more important he frowned they are the same he answered history is truth no i replied history is a compilation of facts and events which is subject to constant reinterpretation it begins with truth and evolves into fable my stories begin with fable and evolve into truth if you are right he said thoughtfully then your stories are more important than history very well then i said hoping that the matter was closed but he added i am not sure that you are right i will have to think more about it do that i said you are an intelligent boy you will come to the right conclusion ndemi turned and began walking off in the direction of his familys shamba the children rushed back as soon as he was out of sight and once more squatted in a tight semicircle have you an answer to my question koriba asked mdutu i cannot recall your question i said was our only king a white man yes how could that be i considered my response for a long moment i will answer that by telling you the story of the little kikuyu girl who became very briefly the queen of all the elephants i said what has that to do with the white man who became our king persisted mdutu listen carefully i instructed him for when i am done i shall ask you many questions about my story and before we are through you will have the answer to your own question he leaned forward attentively and i began reciting my fable i returned to my boma to take the noon meal after i had finished it i decided to take a nap during the heat of the day for i am an old man and it had been a long wearing morning i let my goats and chickens loose on my hillside secure in the knowledge that no one would take them away since they each carried the mundumugus mark i had just spread my sleeping blanket out beneath the branches of my acacia tree when i saw two figures at the foot of my hill at first i thought they were two village boys looking for cattle that had strayed from their pastures but when the figures began walking up the slopes of my hill i was finally able to focus my eyes on them the larger figure was shima ndemis mother and the smaller was a goat that she led by a rope that she had tied around its neck finally she reached my boma somewhat out of breath for the goat was unused to the rope and constantly pulled against it and opened the gate jambo shima i said as she entered the boma why have you brought your goat to my hill you know that only my own goats may graze here it is a gift for you koriba she replied for me i said but i have done you no service in exchange for it you can though you can take ndemi back he is a good boy koriba but he will never be late again she promised he truly did save our goat from a hyena he would never lie to his mundumugu he is young but he can become a great mundumugu someday i know he can if you will just teach him you are a wise man koriba and you have made a wise choice in ndemi i do not know why you have banished him but if you will just take him back he will never misbehave again he wants only to become a great mundumugu like yourself though of course she added hastily he could never be as great as you will finally you let me speak i asked irritably certainly koriba i did not cast ndemi out he left of his own volition her eyes widened he left you he is young and rebellion is part of youth so is foolishness she exclaimed furiously he has always been foolish and late he was even two weeks late being born when i carried him he is always thinking instead of doing his chores for the longest time i thought we had been cursed but then you made him your assistant and i was to become the mother of the mundumugu and now he has ruined everything she let go of the rope and the goat wandered around my boma as she began beating her breasts with her fists why am i so cursed she demanded why does ngai give me a fool for a son and then stir my hopes by sending him to you and then curse me doubly by returning him almost a man and unable to perform any of the chores on our shamba what will become of him who will accept a brideprice from such a fool he will be late to plant our seed and late to harvest it he will be late to choose a bride and late to make the payment on her and he will end up living with the unmarried men at the edge of the forest and begging for food with my luck he will even be late to die she paused for breath then began wailing again and finally screamed why does ngai hate me so calm yourself shima i said it is easy for you to say she sobbed you have not lost all hope for your future my future is of very limited duration i said it is kirinyagas future that concerns me see she said wailing and beating her breasts again see i am the mother of the boy who will destroy kirinyaga i did not say that what has he done koriba she said tell me and i will have his father and brothers beat him until he behaves beating him is not the solution i said he is young and he rebels against my authority it is the way of things before long he will realize that he is wrong i will explain to him all that he can lose and he will know that he should never disagree with you and he will come back you might suggest it i encouraged her i am an old man and i have much left to teach him i will do as you say koriba she promised good i said now go back to your shamba and speak to ndemi for i have other things to do it was not until i awoke from my nap and returned to the village to sit at the council of elders that i realized just how many things i had to do our daily business is always conducted in late afternoon when the heat of the day has passed at the boma of koinnage the paramount chief one by one the elders place their mats in a semicircle and sit on them with my place being at koinnages right hand the boma is cleared of all women children and animals and when the last of us has arrived koinnage calls us into session he announces what problems are to be considered and then i ask ngai to guide our judgment and allow us to come to just decisions on this particular day two of the villagers had asked the council of elders to determine the ownership of a calf that was born to a cow they jointly owned sebana wanted permission to divorce his youngest wife who had now been barren for three years and kijos three sons were unhappy with the way his estate had been divided among them koinnage consulted with me in low whispers after each petition had been heard and took my advice as always the calf went to the man who had fed the cow during her pregnancy with the understanding that the other man should own the next calf sebana was told that he could divorce his wife but would not receive the bride price back and he elected to keep her kijos sons were told that they could accept the division as it was or if two of them agreed i would place three colored stones in a gourd and they could each withdraw a stone and own the shamba that it represented since each faced the possibility of ending up with the smallest shamba only one brother voted for our solution as i had foreseen and the petition was dismissed at this point koinnages senior wife wambu would usually appear with a large gourd of pombe and we would drink it and then return to our bomas but this day wambu did not come and koinnage turned nervously to me there is one thing more koriba he said oh he nodded and i could see the muscles in his face tensing as he worked up the courage to confront his mundumugu you have told us that ngai handed the burning spear to jomo kenyatta that he might create mau mau and drive the europeans from kenya that is true i said is it he replied i have been told that he himself married a european woman that mau mau did not succeed in driving the europeans from the holy mountain and that jomo kenyatta was not even his real name that he was actually born with the european name johnstone he stared at me halfaccusing halfterrified of arousing my wrath what have you to say to this koriba i met his gaze and held it for a long time until he finally dropped his eyes then one by one i looked coldly at each member of the council so you prefer to believe a foolish young boy to your own mundumugu i demanded we do not believe the boy but the computer said karenja and have you spoken to the computer yourselves no said koinnage that is another thing we must discuss ndemi tells me that your computer speaks to him and tells him many things while my computer can do nothing but send messages to the other chiefs it is a mundumugus tool not to be used by other men i replied why asked karenja it knows many things that we do not know we could learn much from it you have learned much from it i said it speaks to me and i speak to you but it also speaks to ndemi continued karenja and if it can speak to a boy barely past circumcision age why can it not speak directly to the elders of the village i turned to karenja and held my two hands in front of me palms up in my left hand is the meat of an impala that i killed today i said in my right is the meat of an impala that i killed five days ago and left to sit in the sun it is covered with ants worms crawl through it and it stinks i paused which of the two pieces of meat will you eat the meat in your left hand he answered but both pieces of meat came from the same herd of impala i pointed out both animals were equally fat and healthy when they died but the meat in your right hand is rotten he said that is true i agreed and just as there can be good and bad meat so there can be good and bad facts the facts ndemi has related to you come from books written by the europeans and facts can mean different things to them than they mean to us i paused while they considered what i had said and then continued a european may look upon the savannah and envision a city while a kikuyu may look at the same savannah and see a shamba a european may look at an elephant and see ivory trinkets while a kikuyu may look at the same elephant and see food for his village or destruction for his crops and yet they are looking at the same land and the same animal now i said once again looking at each of them in turn i have been to school in europe and in america and only i of all the men and women on kirinyaga have lived among the white man and i tell you that only i your mundumugu am capable of separating the good facts from the bad facts it was a mistake to allow ndemi to speak with my computer i will not allow it again until i have given him more of my wisdom i had thought my statement would put an end to the matter but as i looked around i saw signs of discomfort as if they wished to argue with me but lacked the courage finally koinnage leaned forward and without looking directly at me said do you not see what you are saying koriba if the mundumugu can make a mistake by allowing a young boy to speak with his computer can he not also make a mistake by not allowing the elders to speak to it i shook my head it is a mistake to allow any kikuyu except the mundumugu to speak to it but there is much that we can learn from it persisted koinnage what i asked bluntly he shrugged helplessly if i knew then i would already have learned it how many times must i repeat this to you there is nothing to be learned from the europeans the more you try to become like them the less you remain kikuyu this is our utopia a kikuyu utopia we must fight to preserve it and yet said karenja even the word utopia is european is it not you heard that from ndemi too i asked without hiding the annoyance from my voice he nodded his head yes utopia is just a word i said it is the idea that counts if the kikuyu have no word for it and the europeans do perhaps it is a european idea said karenja and if we have built our world upon a european idea perhaps there are other european ideas that we can also use i looked at their faces and realized for perhaps the first time that most of the original elders of kirinyaga had died old siboki remained and i could tell by his face that he found european ideas even more abhorrent than i myself did and there were two or three others but this was a new generation of elders men who had come to maturity on kirinyaga and could not remember the reasons we had fought so hard to come here if you want to become black europeans go back to kenya i snapped in disgust it is filled with them we are not black europeans said karenja refusing to let the matter drop we are kikuyu who think it is possible that not all european ideas are harmful any idea that changes us is harmful i said why asked koinnage his courage to oppose me growing as he realized that many of the elders supported him where is it written that a utopia cannot grow and change if that were the case we would have ceased to be a utopia the day the first baby was born on kirinyaga there are as many utopias as there are races i said none among you would argue that a kikuyu utopia is the same as a maasai utopia or a samburu utopia by the same token a kikuyu utopia cannot be a european utopia the closer you come to the one the farther you move from the other they had no answer to that and i got to my feet i am your mundumugu i said i have never misled you you have always trusted my judgment in the past you must trust in it in this instance as i began walking out of the boma i heard karenjas voice behind me if you were to die tomorrow ndemi would become our mundumugu are you saying we should trust his judgment as we trust yours i turned to face him ndemi is very young and inexperienced you as the elders of the village would have to use your wisdom to decide whether or not what he says is correct a bird that has been caged all its life cannot fly said karenja just as a flower that has been kept from the sun will not blossom what is your point i asked shouldnt we begin using our wisdom now lest we forget how when ndemi has become the mundumugu this time it was i who had no answer so i turned on my heel and began the long walk back to my hill for five days i fetched my own water and made my own fires and then ndemi returned as i had known he would i was sitting in my boma idly watching a herd of gazelles grazing across the river when he trudged up the path to my hill looking distinctly uncomfortable jambo ndemi i said it is good to see you again jambo koriba he replied and how was your vacation i asked but there is no swahili word for vacation so i used the english term and the humor and sarcasm were lost on him my father urged me to come back he said bending over to pet one of my goats and i saw the welts on his back that constituted his urging i am glad to have you back ndemi i said we have become like father and son and it pains me when we argue as i am sure it pains you it does pain me he admitted i do not like to disagree with you koriba we have both made mistakes i continued you argued with your mundumugu and i allowed you access to all that information before you were mature enough to know what to do with it we are both intelligent enough to learn from our mistakes you are still my chosen successor it shall be as if it never happened but it did happen koriba he said we shall pretend it did not i do not think i can do that said ndemi unhappily protecting his eyes as a sudden wind blew dust across the boma i learned many things when i spoke to the computer how can i unlearn them if you cannot unlearn them then you will have to ignore them until you are older i said i am your teacher the computer is just a tool you will use it to bring the rains and to send an occasional message to maintenance and that is all a black kite swooped down and made off with a scrap of my morning meal that had fallen beside the embers of my fire i watched it while i waited for ndemi to speak you appear troubled i said when it became apparent that he would not speak first tell me what bothers you it was you who taught me to think koriba he said as various emotions played across his handsome young face would you have me stop thinking now just because i think differently than you do of course i do not want you to stop thinking ndemi i said not without sympathy for i understood the forces at war within him what good would a mundumugu be if he could not think but just as there are right and wrong ways to throw a spear there are right and wrong ways to think i wish only to see you take the path of true wisdom it will be greater wisdom if i come upon it myself he said i must learn as many facts as i can so that i can properly decide which are helpful and which are harmful you are still too young i said you must trust me until you are older and better able to make those decisions the facts will not change no but you will but how can i know that change is for the good he asked what if you are wrong and by listening to you until i become like you i will be wrong too if you think i am wrong why have you come back to listen and decide he said and to speak to the computer again i cannot permit that i said you have already caused great mischief among the tribe because of you they are questioning everything i say there is a reason for that perhaps you will tell me what it is i said trying to keep the sarcasm from my voice for i truly loved this boy and wished to win him back to my side i have listened to your stories for many years now koriba he said and i believe that i can use your method to show you the reason i nodded my head and waited for him to continue this should be called the story of ndemi he said but because i am pretending to be koriba i shall call it the story of the unborn lion i plucked an insect from my cheek and rolled it between my fingers until the carapace cracked i am listening once there was an unborn lion who was very anxious to see the world began ndemi he spent much time talking about it to his unborn brothers the world will be a wonderful place he assured them the sun will always be shining and the plains will be filled with fat lazy impala and all other animals will bow before us for there shall be no animal mightier than us his brothers urged him to stay where he was why are you so anxious to be born they asked him here it is warm and safe and we never hunger who knows what awaits us in the world but the unborn lion would hear none of it and one night while his mother and brethren slept he stole out into the world he could not see so he nudged his mother and said where is the sun and she told him that the sun vanishes every evening leaving the world cold and dark at least when it comes back tomorrow it will shine on fat lazy impala that we will catch and eat he said trying to console himself but his mother said there are no impala here for they have migrated with the rains to the far side of the world all that is left for us to eat is the buffalo their flesh is tough and tasteless and they kill as many of us as we kill of them if my stomach is empty at least my spirit will be full said the newlyborn lion for all other animals will look upon us with fear and envy you are very foolish even for a newlyborn cub said his mother the leopard and the hyena and the eagle look upon you not as an object of envy but rather as a tasty meal at least all of them will fear me when i am fullygrown said the newlyborn lion the rhinoceros will gore you with his horn said his mother and the elephant will toss you high into the trees with his trunk even the black mamba will not step aside for you and will kill you if you try to approach it the mother continued her list of all the animals that would neither fear nor envy the lion when he grew up and finally he told her to speak no more i have made a terrible mistake by being born he said the world is not as i pictured it and i will rejoin my brothers where they are warm and safe and comfortable but his mother merely smiled at him oh no she said not without compassion once you are born whether it is of your own choosing or mine you cannot ever go back to being an unborn lion here you are and here you shall stay ndemi looked at me his story finished it is a very wise story i said i could not have done better myself i knew the day i first made you my pupil that you would make a fine mundumugu you still do not understand he said unhappily i understand the story perfectly i replied but it is a lie said ndemi i told it only to show you how easy it is to make up such lies it is not easy at all i corrected him it is an art mastered only by a few and now that i see that you have mastered it it would be doubly hurtful to lose you art or not it is a lie he repeated if a child heard and believed it he would be sure that lions could speak and that babies can be born whenever they chose to be he paused it would have been much simpler to tell you that once i have obtained knowledge whether is was freely given or not i cannot empty my mind and give it back lions have nothing to do with that he paused for a long moment furthermore i do not want to give my knowledge back i want to learn more things not forget those that i already know you must not say that ndemi i urged him especially now that i see that my teachings have taken root and that your abilities as a creator of fables will someday surpass my own you can be a great mundumugu if you will just allow me to guide you i love and respect you as i do my own father koriba he replied i have always listened and tried to learn from you and i will continue to do so for as long as you will permit me but you are not the only source of knowledge i also wish to learn what your computer can teach me when i decide you are ready i am ready now you are not his face reflected an enormous inner battle and i could only watch until it was resolved finally he took a deep breath and let it out slowly i am sorry koriba but i cannot continue to tell lies when there are truths to be learned he laid a hand on my shoulder kwaheri mwalimu goodbye my teacher what will you do i cannot work on my fathers shamba he said not after all that i have learned nor do i wish to live in isolation with the bachelors at the edge of the forest what is left for you i asked i shall walk to that area of kirinyaga called haven and await the next maintenance ship i will go to kenya and learn to read and write and when i am ready i will study to become an historian and when i am a good enough historian i will return to kirinyaga and teach what i have learned i am powerless to stop you from leaving i said for the right to emigrate is guaranteed to all our citizens by our charter but if you return know that despite what we have been to one another i will oppose you i do not wish to be your enemy koriba he said i do not wish to have you as an enemy i replied the bond between us has been a strong one but the things i have learned are too important to my people they are my people too i pointed out and i have led them to this point by always doing what i think is best for them perhaps it is time for them to choose what is best they are incapable of making that choice i said if they are incapable of making that choice it is only because you have hoarded knowledge to which they have as much right as you do think very carefully before you do this thing i said despite my love for you if you do anything to harm kirinyaga i will crush you like an insect he smiled sadly for six years i have asked you to teach me how to turn my enemies into insects so that i may crush them is this how i am finally to learn i could not help but return his smile i had an urge to stand up and throw my arms around him and hug him but such behavior is unacceptable in a mundumugu so i merely looked at him for a long moment and then said kwaheri ndemi you were the best of them i had the best teacher he replied and with that he turned and began the long walk toward haven the problems caused by ndemi did not end with his departure njoro dug a borehole near his hut and when i explained that the kikuyu did not dig boreholes but carried their water from the river he replied that surely this borehole must be acceptable for the idea came not from the europeans but rather the tswana people far to the south of kenya i ordered the boreholes to be filled in when koinnage argued that there were crocodiles in the river and that he would not risk the lives of our women simply to maintain what he felt was a useless tradition i had to threaten him with a powerful thahu or curse that of impotency before he agreed then there was kidogo who has named his firstborn jomo after jomo kenyatta the burning spear one day he announced that the boy was henceforth to be known as johnstone and i had to threaten him with banishment to another village before he relented but even as he gave in mbura changed his own name to johnstone and moved to a distant village even before i could order it shima continued to tell anyone who would listen that i had forced ndemi to leave kirinyaga because he was occasionally late for his lessons and koinnage kept requesting a computer that was the equal of my own finally young mdutu created his own version of a barbedwire enclosure for his fathers cattle using woven grasses and thorns making sure he wrapped them around the fenceposts i had it torn down and thereafter he always walked away when the other children circled around me to hear a story i began to feel like the dutch boy in hans christian andersons fairy tale as quickly as i put my finger in the dike to staunch the flow of european ideas they would break through in another place and then a strange thing happened certain ideas that were not european that ndemi could not possibly have transmitted to the members of the village began cropping up on their own kibo the youngest of koinnages three wives rendered the fat from a dead warthog and began burning it at night creating kirinyagas first lamp ngobe whose arm was not strong enough to throw a spear with any accuracy devised a very primitive bow and arrow the first kikuyu ever to use such a weapon karenja created a wooden plow so that his ox could drag it through the fields while his wives simply guided it and soon all the other villagers were improvising plows and strangelyshaped digging tools indeed alien ideas that had been dormant since the creation of kirinyaga were now springing forth on all fronts ndemis words had opened a pandoras box and i did not know how to close it i spent many long days sitting alone on my hill staring down at the village and wondering if a utopia can evolve and still remain a utopia and the answer was always the same yes but it will not be the same utopia and it was my sacred duty to keep kirinyaga a kikuyu utopia when i was convinced that ndemi was not going to return i began going down to the village each day trying to decide which of the children was the brightest and most forceful for it would take both brilliance and force to deflect the alien ideas which were infecting our world and turning it into something it was never meant to be i spoke only to the boys for no female may be a mundumugu some like mdutu had already been corrupted by listening to ndemi but those who had not been corrupted by ndemi were even more hopeless for a mind cannot open and close at will and those who were unmoved by what he had to say were not bright enough for the tasks a mundumugu must perform i expanded my search to other villages convinced that somewhere on kirinyaga i would find the boy i sought a boy who grasped the difference between facts which merely informed and parables which not only informed but instructed i needed a homer a jesus a shakespeare someone who could touch mens souls and gently guide them down the path that must be taken but the more i searched the more i came to the realization that a utopia does not lend itself to such tellers of tales kirinyaga seemed divided into two totally separate groups those who were content with their lives and had no need to think and those whose every thought led them farther and farther from the society we had labored to build the unimaginative would never be capable of creating parables and the imaginative would create their own parables parables that would not reaffirm a belief in kirinyaga and a distrust of alien ideas after some months i was finally forced to concede that for whatever reason there were no potential mundumugus waiting to be found and groomed i began wondering if ndemi had been truly unique or if he would have eventually rejected my teachings even without exposure to the european influence of the computer was it possible that a true utopia could not outlast the generation that founded it that it was the nature of man to reject the values of the society into which he is born even when those values are sacred or was it just conceivable that kirinyaga had never been a utopia that somehow we had deluded ourselves into believing that we could go back to a way of life that had forever vanished i considered that possibility for a long time but eventually i rejected it for if it were true then the only logical conclusion was that it had vanished because the europeans values were more pleasing to ngai than our own and this i knew to be false no if there was a truth anywhere in the universe it was that kirinyaga was exactly as it was meant to be and if ngai felt obligated to test us by presenting us with these heresies that would make our ultimate victory over the lies of the europeans all the more sweet if minds were worth anything they were worth fighting for and when ndemi returned armed with his facts and his data and his numbers he would find me waiting for him it would be a lonely battle i thought as i carried my empty water gourds down to the river but having given his people a second chance to build their utopia ngai would not allow us to fail let ndemi tempt our people with his history and his passionless statistics ngai had his own weapon the oldest and truest weapon he possessed the weapon that had created kirinyaga and kept it pure and intact despite all the many challenges it had encountered i looked into the water and studied the weapon critically it appeared old and frail but i could also see hidden reservoirs of strength for although the future appeared bleak it could not fail as long as it was used in ngais service it stared back at me bold and unblinking secure in the rightness of its cause it was the face of koriba last storyteller among the kikuyu who stood ready to battle once again for the soul of his people
