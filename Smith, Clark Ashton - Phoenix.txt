phoenix clark ashton smith rodis and hilar had climbed from their natal caverns to the top chamber of the high observatory tower pressed close together for warmth as well as love they stood at an eastern window looking forth on hills and valleys dim with perennial starlight they had come up to watch the rising of the sun that sun which they had never seen except as an orb of blackness occluding the zodiacal stars in its course from horizon to horizon thus their ancestors had seen it for millenniums by some freak of cosmic law unforeseen and inexplicable to astronomers and physicists the suns cooling had been comparatively sudden and the earth had not suffered the longdrawn complete desiccation of such planets as mercury and mars rivers lakes seas had frozen solid and the air itself had congealed all in a term of years historic rather than geologic millions of the earths inhabitants had perished trapped by the glacial ice the centigrade cold the rest armed with all the resources of science had found time to entrench themselves against the cosmic night in a world of ramified caverns dug by atomic excavators far below the surface here by the light of artificial orbs and the heat drawn from the planets stillmolten depths life went on much as it had done in the outer world trees fruits grasses grains vegetables were grown in isotopestimulated soil or hydroroponic gardens affording food renewing a breathable atmosphere domestic animals were kept and birds flew and insects crawled or fluttered the rays considered necessary for life and health were afforded by the sunbright lamps that shone eternally in all the caverns little of the old science was lost but on the other hand there was now little advance existence had become the conserving of a fire menaced by inexorable night generation by generation a mysterious sterility had lessened the numbers of the race from millions to a few thousands as time went on a similar sterility began to affect animals and even plants no longer flourished with their first abundance no biologist could determine the cause with certainty perhaps man as well as other terrestrial lifeforms was past his crime and had begun to undergo collectively the inevitable senility that comes to the individual or perhaps having been a surfacedweller throughout most of his evolution he was inadaptable to the cribbed and prisoned life the caverned light and air and was dying slowly from the deprivation of things he had almost forgotten indeed the world that had once flourished beneath a living sun was little more than a legend now a tradition preserved by art and literature and history its heeding babelian cities its fecund hills and plains were swathed impenetrably in snow and ice and solidified air no living man and gazed upon it except from the nightbound towers maintained as observatories still however the dreams of men were often lit by primordial memories in which the sun shone on rippling waters and waving trees and grass and their waking hours were sometimes touched by an undying nostalgia for the lost earth alarmed by the prospect of racial extinction the most able and brilliant savants had conceived a project that was seemingly no less desperate than fantastic the plan if executed might lead to failure or even the planets destruction but all the necessary steps had now been taken toward its launching it was of this plan that rodis and hilar spoke standing clasped in each others arms as they waited for the rising of the dead sun and you must go said rodis with averted eyes and voice that quavered a little of course it is a duty and an honor i am regarded as the foremost of the younger atomicists the actual placing and timing of the bombs will devolve largely upon me but are you sure of success there are so many risks hilar the girl shuddered clasping her lover with convulsive tightness we are not sure of anything hilar admitted but granting that our calculations are correct the multiple charges of fissionable materials including more than half the solar elements should start chainreactions that will restore the sun to its former incandescence of course the explosion may be too sudden and too violent involving the nearer planets in the formation of a nova but we do not believe that this will happen since an explosion of such magnitude would require instant disruption of all the suns elements such disruption should not occur without a starter for each separate atomic structure science has never been able to break down all the known elements if it had been the earth itself would undoubtedly have suffered destruction in the old atomic wars hilar paused and his eyes dilated kindling with a visionary fire how glorious he went on to use for a purpose of cosmic renovation the deadly projectiles designed by our forefathers only to blast and destroy stored in sealed caverns they have not been used since man abandoned the earths surface so many millenniums ago nor have the old spaceships been used either an interstellar drive was never perfected and our voyagings were always limited to the other worlds of our own system none of which was inhabited or inhabitable since the suns cooling and darkening there has been no object in visiting any of them but the ships too were stored away and the newest and speediest one powered with antigravity magnets has been made ready for our voyage to the sun rodis listened silently with an awe that seemed to have subdued her misgivings while hilar continued to speak of the tremendous project upon which he with six other chosen technicians was about to embark in the meanwhile the black sun rose slowly into heavens thronged with the cold ironic blazing of innumerable stars among which no planet shone it blotted out the sting of the scorpion poised at that hour above the eastern hills it was smaller but nearer than the igneous orb of history and legend in its center like a cyclopean eye there burned a single spot of dusky red fire believed to mark the eruption of some immense volcano amid the measureless and cinderblackened landscape to one standing in the icebound valley below the observatory it would have seemed that the towers litten window was a yellow eye that stared back from the deadearth to that crimson eye of the dead sun soon said hilar you will climb to this chamber and see the morning that none has seen for a century of centuries the thick ice will thaw from the peaks and valleys running in streams to remolten lakes and oceans the liquefied air will rise in clouds and vapors touched with the spectrumtinted splendor of the light again across earth will blow the winds of the four quarters and grass and flowers will grow and trees burgeon from tiny saplings and man the dweller in closed caves and abysses will return to his proper heritage how wonderful it all sounds murmured rodis but you will come back to me i will come back to you in the sunlight said hilar the spacevessel phosphor lay in a huge cavern beneath that region which had once been known as the atlas mountains the caverns milethick roof had been partly blasted away by atomic disintegrators a great circular shaft slanted upward to the surface forming a mouth in the mountainside through which the stars of the zodiac were visible the prow of the phosphor pointed at the stars all was now ready for its launching a score of dignitaries and savants looking like strange ungainly monsters in suits and helmets worn against the spatial cold that had invaded the cavern were present for the occasion hilar and his six companions had already gone aboard the phosphor and had closed its airlocks inscrutable and silent behind their metalloid helmets the watchers waited there was no ceremony no speaking or waving of farewells nothing to indicate that a worlds destiny impended on the mission of the vessel like mouths of firebelching dragons the sternrockets flared and the phosphor like a wingless bird soared upward through the great shaft and vanished hilar gazing through a rear port saw for a few moments the lamp bright window of that tower in which he had stood so recently with rodis the window was a golden spark that swirled donward in abysses of devouring night and was extinguished behind it he knew his beloved stood watching the phosphors departure it was a symbol he mused a symbol of life of memory of the suns themselves of all things that flash briefly and fall into oblivion but such thoughts he felt should be dismissed they were unworthy of one whom his fellows had appointed as a lightbringer a prometheus who should rekindle the dead sun and relumine the dark world there were no days only hours of eternal starlight to measure the time in which they sped outward through the void the rockets used for initial propulsion no longer flamed astern and the vessel flew in darkness except for the gleaming argus eyes of its ports drawn now by the mighty gravitational drag of the blind sun testflights had been considered unnecessary for the phosphor all its machinery was in perfect condition and the mechanics involved were simple and easily mastered none of its crew had ever been in extraterrestrial space before but all were welltrained in astronomy mathematics and the various techniques essential to a voyage between worlds there were two navigators one rocketengineer and two engineers who would operate the powerful generators charged with a negative magnetism reverse to that of gravity with which they hoped to approach circumnavigate and eventually depart in safety from an orb enormously heavier than the systems nine planets merged into one hilar and his assistant han joas completed the personnel their sole task was the timing landing and distribution of the bombs all were descendants of a mixed race with latin semitic hamitic and negroid ancestry a race that had dwelt before the suns cooling in countries south of the mediterranean where the former deserts had been rendered fertile by a vast irrigationsystem of lakes and canals this mixture after so many centuries of cavern life had produced a characteristically slender wellknit type of short or medium stature and pale olive complexion the features were often of negroid softness the general physique was marked by a delicacy verging upon decadence to an extent surprising in view of the vast intermediate eras of historic and geographic change this people had preserved many preatomic traditions and even something of the old classic mediterranean cultures their language bore distinct traces of latin greek spanish and arabic remnants of other peoples those of subequatorial asia and america had survived the universal glaciation by burrowing underground radio communication had been maintained with these peoples till within fairly recent times and had then ceased it was believed that they had died out or had retrograded into savagery losing the civilization to which they had once attained hour after hour intervaled only by sleep and eating the phosphor sped onward through the black unvarying void to hilar it seemed at times that they flew merely through a darker and vaster cavern whose remote walls were spangled by the stars as if by radiant orbs he had thought to feel the overwhelming vertigo of unbottomed and undiretioned space instead there was a weird sense of circumscription by the ambient night and emptiness together with a sense of cyclic repetition as if all that was happening had happened many times before and must recur often through endless future kalpas had he and his companions gone forth in former cycles to the relighting of former perished suns would they go forth again to rekindle suns that would flame and die in some posterior universe had there always been would there always be a rodis who awaited his return of these thoughts he spoke only to han joas who shared something of his innate mysticism and his trend toward cosmic speculation but mostly the two talked of the mysteries of the atom and its typhonic powers and discussed the problems with which they would shortly be confronted the ship carried several hundred disruption bombs many of untried potency the unused heritage of ancient wars that had left chasm scars and lethal radioactive areas some a thousand miles or more in extent for the planetary glaciers to cover there were bombs of iron calcium sodium helium hydrogen sulphur potassium magnesium copper chromium strontium barium zinc elements that had all been ancientily revealed in the solar spectrum even at the apex of their madness the warring nations had wisely refrained from employing more than a few such bombs at any one time chainreactions had sometimes been started but fortunately had died out hilar and han joas hoped to distribute the bombs at intervals over the suns entire circumference preferably in large deposits of the same elements as those of which they were composed the vessel was equipped with radar apparatus by which the various elements could be detected and located the bombs would be timed to explode with as much simultaneity as possible if all went well the phosphor would have fulfilled its mission and traveled most of the return distance to earth before the explosions occurred it had been conjectured that the suns interior was composed of still molten magma covered by a relatively thin crust a seething flux of matter that manifested itself in volcanic activities only one of the volcanoes was visible from earth to the naked eye but numerous others had been revealed to telescopic study now as the phosphor drew near to its destination the others flamed out on the huge slowly rotating orb that had darkened a fourth of the ecliptic and had blotted libra scorpio and sagittarius wholly from view for a long time it had seemed to hang above the voyagers now suddenly as if through some prodigious legerdemain it lay beneath them a monstrous everbroadening disk of ebon eyed with fiery craters veined and spotted and blotched with unknown pallid radioactives it was like the buckler of some macrososmic giant of the night who had entrenched himself in the abyss lying between the worlds the phosphor plunged toward it like a steel splinter drawn by some tremendous lodestone each member of the crew had been trained beforehand for the part he was to play and everything had been timed with the utmost precision sybal and samac the engineers of the antigravity magnets began to manipulate the switches that would build up resistance to the solar drag the generators bulking to the height of three men with inductioncoils that suggested some colossal laocoon could draw from cosmic space a negative force capable of counteracting many earthgravities in past ages they had defied easily the pull of jupiter and the ship had even coasted as near to the blazing sun as its insulation and refrigeration systems would safely permit therefore it seemed reasonable to expect that the voyagers could accomplish their purpose of approaching closely to the darkened globe of circling it and pulling away when the disruptioncharges had all been planted a dull subsonic vibration felt rather than heard began to emanate from the magnets it shook the vessel ached in the voyagers tissues intently with anxiety unbetrayed by their impassive features they watched the slow gradual buildingup of power shown by gaugedials on which giant needles crept like horologic hands registering the reversed gravities one after one till a drag equivalent to that of fifteen earths had been neutralized the clamp of the solar gravitation drawing them on with projectilelike velocity crushing them to their seats with relentless increase of weight was loosened the needles crept on more slowly now to sixteen to seventeen and stopped the phosphors fall had been retarded but not arrested and the switches stood at their last notch sybal spoke in answer to the unuttered questions of his companions something is wrong perhaps there has been some unforeseen deterioration of the coils in whose composition strange and complex alloy were used some of the elements may have been unstable or have developed instability through age or perhaps there is some interfering force born of the suns decay at any rate it is impossible to build more power toward the twentyseven antigravities we will require close to the solar surface samac added the decelerative jets will increase our resistance to nineteen antigravities it will still be far from enough even at our present distance how much time have we inquired hilar turning to the navigators calaf and caramod the two conferred and calculated by using the decelerative jets it will be two hours before we reach the sun announced calaf finally as if his announcement had been an order eibano the jetengineer promptly jerked the levers that fired to full power the reversing rockets banked in the phosphors nose and sides there was a slight further deceleration of their descent a further lightening of the grievious weight that oppressed them but the phosphor still plunged irreversibly sunward hilar and han joas exchanged a glance of understanding and agreement they rose stiffly from their seats and moved heavily toward the magazine occupying fully half the ships interior in which the hundreds of disruptionbombs were racked it was unnecessary to announce their purpose and no one spoke either in approval or demur hilar opened the magazines door and he and han joas paused on the threshold looking back they saw for the last time the faces of their fellowvoyagers expressing no other emotion than resignation vignetted as it were on the verge of destruction then they entered the magazine closing its door behind them they set to work methodically moving back to back along a narrow aisle between the racks in which the immerse ovoid bombs were piled in strict order according to their respective elements because of various coцrdinated dials and switches involved it was a matter of minutes to prepare a single bomb for the explosion therefore hilar and han joas in the time at their disposal could do no more than set the timing and detonating mechanism of one bomb of each element a great chronometer ticking at the magazines farther end enabled them to accomplish this task with precision the bombs were thus timed to explode simultaneously detonating the others through chainreaction at the moment when the phosphor should touch the suns surface the solar pull strengthening as the phosphor fell to its doom had now made their movements slow and difficult it would they feared immobilize them before they could finish preparing a second series of bombs for detonation laboriously beneath the burden of a weight already trebled they made their way to seats that faced a reflector in which the external cosmos was imaged it was an awesome and stupendous scene on which they gazed the suns globe had broadened vastly filling the nether heavens halfseen a dim unhorizoned landscape fitfully lit by the crimson farsundered flares of volcanoes by bluish zones and patches of strange radioactive minerals it deepened beneath them abysmally disclosing mountains that would have made the himalayas seem like hillocks revealing chasms that might have engulfed asteroids and planets at the center of this cyclopean landscape burned the great volcano that had been called hephaestus by astronomers it was the same volcano watched by hilar and rodis from the observatory window tongues of flame a hundred miles in length arose and licked skyward from a crater that seemed the mouth of some ultramundane hell hilar and han joas no longer heard the chronometers portentous ticking and had no eyes for the watching of its ominous hands such watching was needless now there was nothing more to be done and nothing before them but eternity they measured their descent by the broadening of the dim solar plain the leaping into salience of new mountains the deepening of new chasms and gulfs in the globe that had now lost all semblance of a sphere it was plain now that the phosphor would fall directly into the flaming and yawning crater of hephaestus faster and faster it plunged heavier grew the piled chains of gravity that giants could not have lifted at the very last the reflector of which hilar and han joas peered was filled entirely by the tongued volcanic fires that enveloped the phosphor then without eyes to see or ears to apprehend they were part of the pyre from which the sun like a phoenix was reborn rodis climbing to the tower after a period of fitful sleep and troublous dreams saw from its window the rising of the rekindled orb it dazzled her though its glory was halfdimmed by rainbowcolored mists that fumed from the icy mountaintops it was a sight filled with marvel and with portent thin rills of downwardthreading water had already begun to fret the glacial armor on slopes and scarps and later they would swell to cataracts laying bare the buried soil and stone vapors that seemed to flow and fluctuate on renascent winds swam sunward from lakes of congealed air at the valleys bottom it was a visible resumption of the elemental life and activity so long suspended in hibernal night even through the towers insulating walls rodis felt the solar warmth that later would awaken the seeds and spores of plants that had lain dormant for cycles her heart was stirred to wonder by the spectacle but beneath the wonder was a great numbness and a sadness like unmelting ice hilar she knew would never return to her except as a ray of the light a spark of the vital heat that he had helped to relumine for the nonce there was irony rather than comfort in the memory of his promise i will come back to you in the sunlight
