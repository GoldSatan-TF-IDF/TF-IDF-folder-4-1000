theater of cruelty a discworld short story by terry pratchett copyright terry pratchett it was a fine summer morning the kind to make a man happy to be alive and probably the man would have been happier to be alive he was in fact dead it would be hard to be deader without special training well now said sergeant colon consulting his notebook so far we have cause of death as a being beaten with at least one blunt instrument b being strangled with a string of sausages and c being savaged by at least two animals with big sharp teeth what do we do now nobby arrest the suspect sarge said corporal nobbs saluting smartly suspect nobby him said nobby prodding the corpse with his boot i call it highly suspicious being dead like that hes been drinking too we could do him for being dead and disorderly colon scratched his head arresting the corpse offered of course certain advantages but i reckon he said slowly that captain vimesll want this one sorted out youd better bring it back to the watch house nobby and then can we eat the sausages sarge said corporal nobbs it wasnt easy being the senior policeman in ankhmorpork greatest of cities of the discworld there were probably worlds captain vimes mused in his gloomier moments where there werent wizards or zombies and where dogs could be relied on to do nothing in the night time and not go around chatting to people captain vimes believed in logic in much the same way as a man in a desert believed in ice ie it was something he really needed but this just wasnt the world for it just once he thought itd be nice to solve something he looked at the bluefaced body on the slab and felt a tiny flicker of excitement there were clues hed never seen proper clues before couldnt have been a robber captain said sergeant colon the reason being his pockets were full of money eleven dollars i wouldnt call that full said captain vimes it was all in pennies and hapennies sir im amazed his trousers stood the strain and i have cunningly detected the fact that he was a showman sir he had some cards in his pocket sir chas slumber childrens entertainer i suppose no one saw anything said vimes well sir said sergeant colon helpfully i told young constable carrot to find some witnesses you asked corporal carrot to investigate a murder all by himself said vimes the sergeant scratched his head and he said to me did i know anyone very old and seriously ill and on the magical discworld there is always one guaranteed witness to any homicide its his job constable carrot the watchs youngest member often struck people as simple and he was he was incredibly simple but in the same way that a sword is simple or an ambush is simple he was also possibly the most linear thinker in the history of the universe hed been waiting by the bedside of an old man whod quite enjoyed the company and now it was time to take out his notebook now i know you saw something sir he said you were there well yes said death i have to be you know but this is very irregular you see sir said corporal carrot as i understand the law you are an accessory after the fact or possibly before the fact young man i am the fact and i am an officer of the law said corporal carrot theres got to be a law you know you want me to er grass someone up drop a dime on someone sing like a pigeon no noone killed mr slumber i cant help you there oh i dont know sir said carrot i think you have damn death watched carrot leave ducking his head as he went down the narrow stairs of the hovel now then where was i excuse me said the wizened old man in the bed i happen to be you know i havent got all day ah yes correct death sharpened his scythe it was the first time hed ever helped the police with their enquiries still everyone had a job to do corporal carrot strolled easily around the town he had a theory hed read a book about theories you added up all the clues and you got a theory everything had to fit there were sausages someone had to buy sausages and then there were pennies normally only one subsection of the human race paid for things in pennies he called in at a sausage maker he found a group of children and chatted to them for a while then he ambled back to the alley where corporal nobbs had chalked the outline of the corpse on the ground he paid some attention to the heap of rubbish at the far end and then sat down on a busted barrel all right you can come out now he said to the world at large i didnt know there were any gnomes left in the world the rubbish rustled they trooped out the little man with the red hat the hunched back and the hooked nose the little woman in the mob cap carrying the even smaller baby the little policeman the dog with the ruff around its neck and the very small alligator corporal carrot sat and listened he made us do it said the little man he had a surprisingly deep voice he used to beat us even the alligator that was all he understood hitting things with sticks and he used to take all the money the dog toby collected and get drunk and then we ran away and he caught us in the alley and started on judy and the baby and he fell over and who hit him first said carrot all of us but not very hard said carrot youre all too small you didnt kill him i have a very convincing statement about that so i went and had another look at him hed choked to death whats this he held up a little leather disc its a swozzle said the little policeman he used it for the voices he said ours werent funny enough thats the way to do it said the one called judy it was stuck in his throat said carrot i suggest you run away just as far as you can we thought we could start a peoples cooperative said the leading gnome you know experimental drama street theatre that sort of thing not hitting each other with sticks you did that for children said carrot he said it was a new sort of entertainment he said itd catch on carrot stood up and flicked the swozzle into the rubbish peoplell never stand for it he said thats not the way to do it which is flat and goes through space on the back of an enormous turtle and why not theatre of cruelty was originally written for the w h smith bookcase magazine the
