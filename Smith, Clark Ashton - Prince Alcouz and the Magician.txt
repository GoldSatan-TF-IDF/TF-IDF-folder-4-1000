prince alcouz and the magician clark ashton smith alcouz khan was the only son of yakoob ullah sultan of balkh unruly and vicious by nature he was anything but improved by the luxury and power of his position he grew up overbearing cruel and dissolute and with mature years his faults and vices only became more pronounced he was exactly the opposite of his father who was a wise and just ruler and had endeared himself to the people the prince spent his time in reprehensible sports and dissipation and kept evil companions his father often remonstrated with him but without effect he sighed when he thought of the day not far distant for he was growing old when alcouz would come to the throne the princes succession indeed was universally dreaded for well the people knew what manner of sultan the cruel dissipated youth would make there came to balkh from hindustan a noted magician by name amaroo he soon became famous for his skill in foretelling the future his patrons were many and of all stations in life for the desire to tear aside the veil of the future is universal alcouz actuated by the common impulse visited him the magician a small man with fiery gleaming eyes who wore flowing robes arose from the couch whereon he had been sitting wrapped in meditation and salaamed low i have come to thee said alcouz that thou mayest read for me the hidden and inscrutable decrees of fate in so far as lies my ability i will serve thee replied the hindu he motioned his visitor to be seated and proceeded with his preparations he spoke a few words in a tongue alcouz could not understand and the room became darkened except for the dim flickering light of a brazier of burning coals into this amaroo cast various perfumed woods which he had at hand a thick black smoke arose and standing in it his figure halfhidden and seemingly grown taller and more impressive he recited incantations in the strange and unknown tongue the room lightened and seemed to widen out indefinitely with it the black vapor alcouz could no longer see the walls and the room seemed some vast cavern shut in at a distance by darkness the smoke formed itself into curling fantastic shapes which took on rapidly the semblance of human beings at the same time the walls of the darkness contracted till they limited a space as large as the sultans throne room more smoke arose from the brazier and grew to longs rows of pillars and to a dais and a throne a shadowy figure sat upon the throne before which the other figures assembled and knelt they rapidly became clearer and more distinct and alcouz recognized them the place was the royal throne room and the seated figure was himself the others were officers of the court and his personal friends a crown was placed on alcouzs head and his courtiers knelt down in homage the scene was maintained awhile and then the shapes redissolved into black vapor amaroo stood at the princes side what thou hast beheld will in time come to pass he said now thou shalt look upon another event again he stood in the whirling smoke and chanted incantations and again the vapor grew to pillars and a throne occupied by the solitary figure of alcouz he was sitting with unseeing eyes absorbed in meditation anon a slave and seemed to speak to him then withdrew then came a figure which alcouz recognized as that of amaroo the hindu magician he knelt before the throne and seemed to present some petition the seated shape was apparently about to reply when the hindu springing ddenly to his feet drew a long knife from his bosom and stabbed him almost at the same instant alcouz who was watching horrorstricken gave a wild cry and fell dead stabbed to the heart by the magician who had crept up behind him unobserved notes smith on the other hand was more excited by the arabian nights and imitations such as beckfords astonishing novel vathek than by the norse myths as he ably demonstrates in the tale which follows only recently discovered in manuscript and published by roy squires this brief fable is considered one of the very earliest experiments in fiction to have survived squires is of the opinion that it was written around about the same time as his first tales it may indeed be his very first fantasy who knows anyway in its brevity and extreme almost poetic precision of phrase it seems to demonstrate that smith was feeling his way from verse to prose narrative a minor work obviously but even the minor work of a major fantasist is of interest lc
