centaur aisle by piers anthony synopsis a xanth fantasy prince dor must rescue king trent from of all places mundania the only way he can do this is to travel to centaur isle and find the magician calliber centaur no easy task since centaurs abhorr magic and would never admit to possessing it poor prince dor could have saved himself a lot of trouble if he could have looked at the title of the book c e n t a u r a i s l e but then prince dor has a terrible time with spelling at the best of times and certainly could be forgiven for a i s l e and i s l e will mundania as we all know and despise it survive this magical group a del rey book published by ballantine books copyright by piers anthony all rights reserved under international and panamerican copyright conventions published in

the author thanks jerome brown for the notion of the spelling bee used in the first chapter and the many other fans whose letters of encouragement have caused the xanth trilogy to be expanded may those who feel xanth is sexist have pleasure in this novel wherein mundania is shown to be worse dor was trying to write an essay because the king had decreed that any future monarchs of xanth should be literate it was an awful chore he knew how to read but his imagination tended to go blank when challenged to produce an essay and he had never mastered conventional spelling the land of xanth he muttered with deep disgust what the table asked the title of my awful old essay dor explained dispiritedly my tutor cherie on whom be a muted anonymous curse assigned me a onehundredword essay telling all about xanth i dont think its possible there isnt that much to tell after twentyfive words ill probably have to start repeating how can i ever stretch it to a whole hundred im not even sure there are that many words in the language who wants to know about xanth the table asked im bored already i know youre a board i guess cherie may a hundred curseburrs tangle in her tail wants to know she must be pretty dumb dor considered no shes infernally smart all centaurs are thats why theyre the historians and poets and tutors of xanth may all their highiq feet founder how come they dont rule xanth then well most of them dont do magic and only a magician can rule xanth brains have nothing to do with itand neither do essays dor scowled at his blank paper only a magician can rule any land the table said smugly but what about you youre a magician arent you why arent you king well i will be king some day dor said defensively aware that he was talking with the table only to postpone a little longer the inevitable struggle with the essay when king trent uh steps down thats why i have to be educated he says he wished all kinds of maledictions on cherie centaur but never on king trent he resumed his morose stare at the paper where he had now printed thu lanned uv zanth somehow it didnt look right though he was sure he had put the tus in the right places something tittered dor glanced up and discovered that the hanging picture of queen iris was smirking that was one problem about working in castle roogna he was always under the baleful eye of the queen whose principal business was snooping with special effort dor refrained from sticking out his tongue at the picture seeing herself observed the queen spoke the mouth of the image moving her talent was illusion and she could make the illusion of sound when she wanted to you may be a magician but you arent a scholar viously spelling is not your forte never claimed it was dor retorted he did not know what the word forte meantperhaps it was a kind of small castlebut whatever it meant spelling was not there he did not much like the queen and the feeling was mutual but both of them were constrained by order of the king to be reasonably polite to one another surely a woman of your extraordinary talents has more interesting things to do than peek at my stupid essay he said then grudgingly he added your majesty indeed i do the picture agreed its background clouding she had of course noted the pause before he gave her title it was not technically an insult but the message was clear enough the cloud m the picture had become a veritable thunderstorm with jags of ughtning shooting out like sparks she would get back at him somehow but you would never get your homework done if not supervised dor grimaced into the surface of the table she was right on target there then he saw that ink had smeared all across his essaypaper ruining it with an angry grunt he picked it upand the ink slid off pooled on the surface of the table bunched together sprouted legs and scurried away it leaped off the table like a gross bug and puffed into momentary vapor it had been an musion the queen had gotten back at him already she could be extraordinarily clever in ugly ettle ways dor could not admit being angry about being fooledand that made him angrier than ever i dont see why anyone has to be male to rule xanth the picture said that was of course a chronic sore point with the queen she was a sorceress fully as talented as any magician but by xanth lawcustom no woman could be king i live in the land of xanth dor said slowly voicing his essay as he wrote ignoring the queen with what he hoped was insulting politeness which is distinct from mundania in that there is magic in xanth and none in mundania it was amazing how creative he became when there was a negative aspect to it he had twentythree words already dor cracked an eyelid sneaking a peek at the picture it had reverted to neutral good the queen had tuned out if she couldnt bug him with crawling illusions she wasnt interested but now his inspiration dehydrated he had an impossible one hundred whole words to do eix times his present total maybe five times he was not particularly apt at higher mathematics either four more words if he counted the title a significant fraction of the way through but only a fraction what a dreary chore irene wandered in she was king trent and queen iriss daughter the palace brat often a nuisancebut sometimes not it griped dor to admit it but irene was an extremely pretty girl getting more so and that exerted an increasing leverage upon him it made fighting with her awkward hi dor she said bouncing experimentally what are you doing dor distracted momentarily by the bounce lost track of the sharp response he had planned oh come on he grumped you know your mother got tired of snooping on me so she assigned you to do it instead irene did not deny it well somebody has to snoop on you dummy id rather be out playing with zilch zilch was a young sea cow that had been conjured for her fifteenth bkffiday irene had set her up in the moat and used her magic to promote the growth of sturdy wallflowers to wall off a section of water protecting zilch from the moatmonsters while she grazed dor regarded zilch as a great blubbery slob of an animal but anything that distracted irene was to some extent worthwhile she took after her mother in certain annoying ways go ahead and play with the cow dor suggested disparagingly i wont ten no a princess has to do her duty irene never spoke of duty unless it was something she wanted to do anyway she picked up his essaypaper hey give that backl dor protested reaching for it you heard him snit the paper agreed give me backl that only made irene omery she backed away hanging on to the paper her eyes scanning the writing her bosom heaved with barely suppressed laughter oh say this is something i didnt think anybody could misspell mundania that badly dor leaped for her his face hot but she danced back again putting the paper behind her this was her notion of entertainmentteasing him making him react one way or another he tried to reach around herand found himself embracing her unintentionally irene had always been a cute girl and socially precocious in recent years nature had rushed to endow her generously and this was quite evident at close range now she was a greeneyed greentinthairedoccurring naturally she did not color her hairbuxom beauty what was worse she knew it and constantly sought new ways to use it to her advantage today she was dressed in a green blouse and skirt that accentuated her figure and wore green slippers that enhanced her fine legs and feet in short she had prepared well for this encounter and had no intention of letting him write his essay in peace she took a deep breath inflating herself against him ill scream she breathed in his ear taunting him but dor knew how to handle her ill tickle he breathed back thats not fair for she could not scream realistically while giggling and she was hyperticklish perhaps because she thought it was fashionable for young ladies to be so she had heard somewhere that ticklishness made girls more appealing irenes hand moved swiftly trying to tuck the paper into her bosom where she knew he wouldnt dare go for it but dor had encountered this ploy before too and he caught her wrist en route he finally got his fingers on the essaypaper for he was stronger than she and she also deemed it unladylike to fight too hard image was almost as important to her as mischief she let the paper go but tried yet another ploy she put her arms around him ill kiss but he was ready even for that her kisses could change to bites without notice depending on her mercurial mood she was not to be trusted though in truth the close struggle had whetted his appetite for some such diversion she was scoring on him better than she knew your mothers watching irene turned him loose instantly she was a constant tease but in her mothers presence she always behaved angelically dor wasnt sure why this was so but suspected that the queens desire to see irene become queen after her had something to do with it irene didnt want to oblige her mother any more than she wanted to oblige anyone else and expressing overt interest in dor would constitute a compromising attitude the queen resented dor because he was a full magician while her daughter was not but she was not about to let him make anyone elses daughter queen irene ironically did want to be queen but also wanted to spite her mother so she always tried to make it seem that dor was chasing her while she resisted the various facets of this cynical game became complex on occasion dor himself wasnt sure how he felt about it all four years ago when he was twelve he had gone on an extraordinary adventure into xanths past and had occupied the body of a grown muscular and highly coordinated barbarian he had learned something about the ways of men and women since he had had an opportunity to play with adult equipment before getting there himself he had an inkling that the little games irene played were more chancy than she knew so he stayed somewhat clear rejecting her teasing advances though this was not always easy sometimes he had strange wicked dreams wherein he called one of her bluffs and it wasnt exactly a bluff and then the hand of an anonymous censor blotted out a scene of impending fascination dumbo irene exclaimed irately staring at the still picture on the wall my mother isnt watching us got you off my case though didnt it dor said smugly you want to make like millie the ghost and you dont have the stuff that was a doublebarreled insult for milliewho had stopped being a ghost before dor was born but retained the identificationwas gifted with magical sex appeal which she had used to snare one of the few magicians of xanth the somber zombie master dor himself had helped bring that magician back to life for her and now they had threeyearold twins so dor was suggesting to irene that she lacked sex appeal and womanliness the very things she was so assiduously striving for but it was a hard charge to make stick because irene was really not far off the mark if he ever forgot she was the palace brat he would be in trouble for what hidden censor would blot out a dreamturnedreal irene could be awfully nice when she tried or maybe it was when she stopped trying he wasnt sure well you better get that dumb essay done or cherie centaur will step on you irene said putting on a new mood ill help you spell the words if you want dor didnt trust that either id better struggle through on my oyn youll flunk cherie doesnt put up with your kind of ignorance i know he agreed glumly the centaur was a harsh taskmistress which was of course why she had been given the job had her mate chester done the tutoring dor would have learned much about archery swordplay and bareknuckle boxing but his spelling would have sunk to amazing new depths king trent had a sure hand in delegating authority i know what irene exclaimed you need a spelling bee a what ill fetch one she said eagerly now she was in her helpful guise and this was especially hard to resist since he did need help they are attracted by letter plants let me get one from my collection she was off in a swirl of sweet scent it seemed she had started wearing perfume dor by dint of phenomenal effort squeezed out another sentence everyone in xanth has his one magic talent no two are the same he said as he wrote thirteen more words what a deadly chore thats not true the table said my talent is talking lots of things talk youre not a person youre a thing dor informed it brusquely talking isnt your talent its mine i make inanimate things talk aw the table said sullenly irene breezed back in with a seed from her collection and an earthfilled flowerpot here it is in a moment she had the seed plantedit was in the shape of the letter land had given it the magic command grow it sprouted and grew at a rate nature could not duplicate for that was her talentthe green thumb she could grow a giant acorn tree from a tiny seed in minutes when she concentrated or cause an existing plant to swell into monstrous proportions because she could not transform a plant into a totally different creature as could her father or give animation to lifeless things as dor and the zombie master could she was deemed to be less than a sorceress and this had been her lifelong annoyance but what she could do she could do well and that was to grow plants the letter plant sent its main stalk up the breadth of a hand then it branched and flowered each blossom in the form of a letter of the alphabet all the letters haphazardly represented the flowers emitted a faint odd odor a bit like ink and a bit like musty old tomes sure enough a big bee in a checkered furry jacket arrived to service the plant it buzzed from letter to letter harvesting each and tucking it into little baskets on its six legs in a few minutes it had collected them all and was ready to fly away but irene had closed the door and all the windows that was my letter plant she informed the bee your have to pay for those letters bbbbbb the bee buzzed angrily but acceded it knew the rules soon she had it spelling for dor all he had to do was say a word and the bee would lay down its flowerletters to spell it out there was nothing a spelling bee couldnt spell all right ive done my good deed for the day irene said im going out and swim with zilch dont let the bee out until youve finished your essay and dont tell my mother i stopped bugging you and check with me when youre done why should i check with you he demanded youre not my tutor because i have to be able to say i nagged you until you got your stupid homework done idiot she said sensibly once you clear with me were both safe for the day got it straight now knothead essentially she was proffering a deal she would leave him alone if he didnt turn her in for doing it it behooved him to acquiesce straight greermose he agreed and watch that bee she warned as she slipped out the door its got to spell each word right but it wont tell you if you have the wrong word the bee zoomed for the aperture but she closed it quickly behind her all right spelling bee dor said i dont enjoy this any more than you do the faster we get through the faster we both get out of here the bee was not satisfied but buzzed with resignation it was accustomed to nonoring rules for there were no rules more finicky and senseless than those for spelling words dor read aloud his first two sentences pausing after every word to get the spelling he did not trust the bee but knew it was incapable of misspelling a word however much it might wish to to spite him some can conjure things he continued slowly and others can make a hole or illusions or can soar through the air but in mundania no one does magic so its very dull there are not any dragons there instead there are bear and horse and a great many other monsters he stopped to count the words all the way up to eightytwo only eight more to gono more than that his fingers had run out twentyeight to go but he had already covered the subject what now well maybe some specifics our ruler is king trent who has reigned for seventeen years he transforms people into other creatures there were another seventeen words bringing the total tosay it was ninetynine words he must have miscalculated before one more word and hed be done but what one word would finish it he couldnt think of one finally he made a special effort and squeezed out another whole sentence no one gets chased here we fare in peace but that was nine more wordseight more than he needed it really hurt him to waste energy like that sigh there was no help for it he would have to use the words now that he had ground them out he wrote them down as the bee spelled them pronouncing each carefully so the bee would get it right he was sure the bee had little or no sense of continuity it merely spelled on an individual basis in a fit of foolish generosity he fired off four more valuable words my tale is done that made the essay one hundred and twelve words cherie centaur should give him a top grade for thatl okay spelling bee he said youve done your part youre free with your letters he opened the window and the bee buzzed out with a happy bbbbbb now i need to deliver it to my beloved female tutor may reas gnaw her coat he said to himself how can i do that without her catching me for more homework for he knew as all students did that the basic purpose of instruction was not so much to teach young people good things as to fiu up all their time unpleasantly adults had the notion that juveniles needed to suffer only when they had suffered enough to wipe out most of their naturally joyous spirits and innocence were they staid enough to be considered mature an adult was essentially a brokendown child are you asking me the floor asked inanimate things seldom had much wit which was why he hadnt asked any for help in his spelling no im just talking to myself good then i dont have to tell you to get a paper wasp i couldnt catch a paper wasp anyway id get stung you wouldnt have to catch it its trapped under me the fool dered in during the night and cant find the way out its dark down there this was a positive break ten it ill take it safely out if itll deliver one paper for me there was a mumble as the floor conversed with the wasp then the floor spoke to dor again its a fair sting it says very well tell it where theres a crack big enough to let it through to this room soon the wasp appeared it was large with a narrow waist and fine reddishbrown color an attractive female of her species marred only by shreds of dust on her wings wwwwww she buzzed making the dust fly off so that she was completely pretty again dor gave her the paper and opened the window again take this to the lady centaur cherie after that youre on your own she perched momentarily on the sill holding the paper wwwwww she asked again dor did not understand wasp language and his friend grundy the golem who did was not around but he had a fair notion what the wasp was thinking of no i wouldnt advise trying to sting cherie she can crack her tail about like a whip and she never misses a fly or the seat of someones pants he added mentally when someone was foolish enough to backtalk about an assignment dor had learned the hard way the wasp carried the paper out the window with a satisfied hum dor knew it would deliver like the spelling bee it had to be true to its nature a paper wasp could not mishandle a paper dor went out to report to irene he found her on the south side of the castle in a bathing suit swimming with a contented sea cow and feeding the cow handfuls of sea oats she was magically growing on the bank zilch mooed when she saw dor alerting irene hi dorcome in sm ming irene called in the moat with the monsters he retorted i grew a row of blackjack oaks across it to buttress th wallflowers she said the monsters cant pass dor looked sure enough a moatmonster was pacing the line stay just c e of the blac a s andngot taggledar ki ek it nudged too close at one point those trees by a wellswung blackjack there was no passing still dor decided to stay clear he didnt trust what zilch might have done in the water i meant the monsters on this side he said i just came to report that the paper is finished and off to the tutor monsters on this side irene repeated glancing down at herself sic him weedles a tendril reached out of the water and caught his ankle another one of her playful plants cut that out dor cried windmilling as the vine yanked at his leg it was no good he lost his balance and fell into the moat with a great splash ho ho ho the water laughed guess that doused your fire dor struck at the surface furiously with his fist but it did no good like it or not he was swimming in all his clothes hey i just thought of something irene called that spelling beedid you define the words for it no of course not dor spluttered trying to scramble out of the water but getting tangled in the tendrils of the plant that had pulled him in pride prevented him from asking irene for help though one word from her would tame the plant she saw the need however easy weedless she said and the plant eased off then she returned to her subject there may be trouble if you used any homonyms no i couldnt have i never heard of them weedies was no longer attacking but each time dor tried to swim to the bank the plant moved to intercept him he had antagonized irene by his monsters crack and she was getting back at him mercilessly she was like her mother in that respect sometimes dor felt the world would be better off if the entire species of female were abolished different words that sound the same duncel she said with maidenly arrogance different spellings the spelling bee isnt that smart if you dont tell it exactly which word different spellings he asked experiencing a premonitory chill like wood and would she said showing off her vocabulary in the annoying way girls had woodtree wouldcould or isle and aisle meaning a bit of land in a lake or a cleared space between ob jects no connection between the two except they happen to sound the same did you use any of those dor concentrated on the essay already half forgotten i think i mentioned a bear you know the fantastic mundane monster itll come out barenaked she exclaimed laughing that bee may not be smart but it wasnt happy about having to work for its letters oh are you ever in trouble dor waitll cherie centaur reads that paper oh forget it he snapped disgruntled how many homonyms had he used bear bare she cried swimming close and tugging at his cloth ing the material not intended for water tore readily exposing half his chest bare bare bare he retorted furiously hooking two fingers into the top of her suit and ripping it down this material too came apart with surprising ease showing that her body was fully as devel oped as suggested by the contours of her clothing her mother the queen often made herself pretty through illusion irene needed no such enhancement eeeeek she screamed enthusiastically ill get you and she ripped more of his clothing off not stopping at his shirt dor retal iated his anger mitigated by his intrigue with the flashes of her that showed between splashes in a moment they were both thoroughly bare and laughing it was as if they had done in anger something they had not dared to do by agreement but had nevertheless wanted to do at this point cherie centaur trotted up she had the forepart of a remarkably fullfigured woman and the rearpart of a beautiful horse it was said that mundania was the land of beautiful women and fast horses or maybe vice versa on the adjectives xanth was the land where the two were one cheries brown human hair trailed back to rest against her brown equine coat with her lovely tail matching she wore no clothing as centaurs did not believe in such affectations and she was old despite her appearance of doris fa thers generation such things made her far less interesting than irene about this paper dor cherie began dar and irene froze in place both suddenly conscious of their condition they were naked half embraced in the water weedles was idly playing with fragments of their clothing this was definitely not proper behavior and was bound to be misunderstood but cherie was intent on the paper she shook her head so that her hair fell down along her breastsa mannerism that indicated something serious if you can interrupt your sexplay a moment she said i would like to review the spelling in this essay centaurs did not really care what human beings did with each other in the water to them such interaction was natural but if cherie reported it to the queenuh well dor said wishing he could sink under the water but before i go into detailed analysis lets obtain another opinion cherie held the paper down so irene could see it irene was fully as embarrassed by her condition as dor was about his she exhaled to decrease her buoyancy and lower herself in the water but in a moment she was gasping and had to breathe againwhich caused her to rise once more especially since her most prominent attributes tended to float anyway but as her eyes scanned the paper her mood changed oh no she exclaimed what a disaster she chortled youve outdone yourself this time dor she tittered oh this is the worst that ever was she cried gleefully whats so funny the water asked and its curiosity was echoed by the rocks sand and other inanimate things within range of doris talent cherie disapproved of magic in centaursshe was of the oldfashioned conservative school that considered magic obscene in the civilized species of xanthbut appreciated its uses in human beings i will read the essay to you attempting to present the mords as they are spelled she said she didand somehow the new meanings came through even though the actual pronunciation of the words had not changed dor quailed it was even worse than he had feared tbb land of xanth buy door eye live inn the land of xanth witch is disstinked from mundania inn that their is magic inn xanth and nun inn mundania every won inn xanth has his own magic talent know to are the same sum khan conjure things and others khan make a whole ore illusions ore khan sore threw the heir butt inn mundania know won does magic sew its very dull theyre are knot any dragons their instead their are bare and hoarse and a grate many other monsters hour ruler is king trent whoo has rained four seventeen years he transforms people two other creatures know won gets chaste hear oui fair inn piece my tail is dun by the end of it irene was in tears from helpless laughter the sea cow was bellowing bovine mirth the water beach and stones were chortling the blackjack oaks were zapping each other on the branches and the moatmonsters were guffawing even cherie cen taur was barely controlling a rebellious smirk dor was the only one who was unable to appreciate the excruciatingly funny nature of it he wished he could tunnel through the bottom of the earth o doesnt that beet awl irene gasped lets go two mundania and sea a hoarse bare ore whatever and the creatures and land scape relapsed into a cacophony of fresh laughter the stones them selves were squeezing out helpless tears of hilarity cherie controlled her levity enough to form a proper frown now i fliffik you had better report to the king dor oh no how much trouble could he get into in one afternoon hed be lucky if king trent didnt transform him into a slug and drop him back in the moat as if flunking his essay wasnt bad enough getting caught naked with the kings daughter dor wrapped his tatters of clothing about his midsection and scrambled out of the water he would simply have to go and take his medicine he stopped off at home to get quickly into fresh clothing he hoped his mother would be elsewhere but she was cleaning house fortunately she was in her nymph state looking like a lovely doll though in fact she was in the vicinity of forty there was no one pret tier than chameleon when she was up and no one uglier when she was down but her intelligence varied inversely so right now she was quite stupid thus she lacked the wit to inquire why he was wearing his clothing tied about his middle sopping wet while the objects in his path sniggered but she was sensitive to the water dont drip on the floor dear she warned ill be dry in a moment he called reassuringly i was swim with irene ibats nice she said soon he was on his way to the king who always interviewed him in the library doris heart was beating as he hurried up the stairs cherie centaur must have shown king trent the paper before she came for dor maybe the king didnt know about the disaster in the moat king trent was awaiting him the king was a solid graying handsome man nearing sixty when he died dor would probably assume the crown of xanth some how he was not eager for the post hello dor the king said shaking his hand warmly as he always did you look fresh and clean today because of the episode in the moat that was one way to take a bath was the king teasing him no that was not trents way yes sir dor said uncomfortably i have serious news for you dor fidgeted yes sir im sorry trent smiled oh it has nothing to do with that essay the truth is i was none too apt in spelling in my own youth that sort of thing is mastered in time his face turned grave and dor quailed know ing it had to be the other thing that perturbed the iing dor considered offering an explanation but realized it would sound too much like an excuse kings and potential lungs he understood did not excuse themselves it was bad for the image so he waited in dreading silence please dor be at ease the king said this is important it was an accident dor blurted his guilt overriding his resolve it was so difficult to be kingly are you by chance referring to that fall into the moat confirmation was as bad as suspicion yes sir dor realized that anything more he said could only put the blame on irene and that wouldnt be wise funniest splash ive seen in years king trent said smiling gravely i saw it all from the embrasure she pulled you in of course and then tore into your clothes this is ever the way of the distaff youre not angry dor i trust you you tend to come to grief in minor particulars but you are generally sound in the major ones and i have to admit my daughter is a provocative brat at times but mainly it is good to get into mischief while youre still young enough to profit from the experience once you are king you are unlikely to have that luxury ilen thats not why you summoned me dor asked relieved if i had the time and privacy i would be splashing in that moat too then the kings smile faded as he turned to business dor the queen and i are making an official trip to mundania the excursion is scheduled to last one week we have to go through a black body of water up a great river up to a beleaguered kingdom in the mountains surrounded by hostile as bs and ivs normal trade has been largely cut off they cant get outor so my scout informs me they have sent a message of welcome for our offer of trade but the details remain obscure i will have to work them out personally i am the only one in authority here who has had sufficient experience in mundania to cope it is a small beginning a cautious onebut if we establish a liraited viable continuing trade with a section of mundania it will prove well worthwhile if only for the experience so were investing this time now while there is no crisis in xanth you will have to be king in that period of my absence and rainah reign over xanth this caught dor completely by surprise me king commencing one week from today i thought it best to give you warning but i cant be king i dont know anything about i would say this is an excellent time to learn dor the kingdom is at peace and you are well regarded and there are two other magicians available to advise you he winked solemnly the queen offered to remain here to advise you but i insisted i wanted the pleasure of her companionship myself it is essential that you be prepared in case the duty should come on you suddenly despite his shock at this abmpt onset of responsibility dor appredated the logic if the queen remained in xanth she would run the whole show and dor would get no experience the two remaining magicians humfrey and the zombie master would not interfere at all neither participated voluntarily in the routine matters of xanth so dor would have a free handwhich was exactly what king trent wanted but the other referencethe duty coming on him suddenly was this a suggestion that something was amiss with king trent dor was appalled at the thought but itll be a long time beforei mean do not be unduly concerned king trent said comprehending dojs poorly expressed notion as he always did i wn not yet sixty i daresay you will be thirty before the onus falls on you i remain in good health but we must always be ready for the unexpected now is there anything you will need to prepare yourself uh dor remained numbed can it be secret kingship is hardly secret dor i meandoes everyone have to know youre gone from xanth i mean if they thought you were near that it was just a trial run king trent frowned you do not feel up to it yes sir i dont the king sighed dor i am disappointed but not surprised i believe you underestimate yourself but you are young yet and it is not my purpose to cause you unnecessary difficulties we shall announce that the queen and i are taking a weeks vacationa working vacationand are allowing you to practice your future craft i do not believe that is too great a deviation from the truth we shall be working and for me a visit to mundania is a vacation the queen has never been there it will be a novel experience for her but you will know privately that we shall not be available to help you if there is any problem only the council of elders and the other magicians will know where i am doris knees felt weak thank you sir ill try not to mess up do tzy that see that you do not fall into the moat king trent said smiling and dont let my daughter boss you around it ill befits a king he shook his head hasnt she become a vixen though when you pulled her suit down uh dor said blushing he had hoped they were safely beyond this subject she certainly asked for it the queen and i are entirely too lenient with her i had to threaten to turn iris into a cactus to keep her from interfering and i proved correct you two worked it out satisfactorily to yourselves actually cherie centaur had interrupted the struggle otherwise there was no guessing where it might have led for one of the few times in his life dor was thankful in retrospect for cheries intervention perhaps the king knew that too uh thanks i mean yes sir dor agreed weakly this was almost too much understanding the queen would certainly have dealt with him more harshly than this yet he knew the king had not been joking about the cactus easygoing as he seemed he tolerated absolutely no insubordination from anyonewhich was of course one of his prime qualities of kingship unfortunately doris own talent was not that forceful he could not transform those who opposed him if he gave an order and someone refused to obey what would he do he had no idea at any rate you will work it out king trent said i am de pending on you to carry through despite whatever hazards my daugh ter interposes yes sir dor agreed without enthusiasm do you really have to go we do have to go dor i feel this can be an excellent opportu nity for continuing trade mundania has vast and largely unexploited resources that would do us a great deal of good while we have magic abilities that could help them equivalently to date our trade with mundania has been sporadic owing to difficulties of communication we require a reliable private connection but we must exercise ex treme caution for we do not want the mundanes invading xanth again so we are deliberately dealing with a small kingdom one un likely to be able to mount such an offensive should it ever choose to dor could appreciate that xanth had a long history of being in vaded by waves of mundanes until preventive measures had been taken actually there was no firm route from mundania to xanth mundanian time seemed to be different so that contacts were bap hazard amy xanth citizen in contrast could go to mundania merely by stepping beyond the region of magic if he kept close track of his route he could theoretically find his way back that was academic however no one wanted to leave xanth for he would leave his magic talent behind no dor had to qualify that thought his mother chameleon had once sought to leave xanth before she met his father bink to elimi nate her changes of phase also the gorgon had spent some years in mundania where her face did not turn people to stone perhaps there had been others but that was a strategy of desperation xanth was so obviously the best place to be that very few would leave it voluntarily uh suppose you get lost your majesty dor asked worriedly you forget dor i have been to mundania before i know the route but mundania changes you cant go back to where you were probably true certainly i would not take the queen to the site of my first marriage the king was silent a moment and dor knew there was a secret side to trent who once had a wife and child whom he preferred not to discuss living in mundania but they had died so he had returned to xanth and become king had his family lived trent would never have come back to xanth but i believe i can manage yet dor was nervous mundania is a dangerous place with bears and horses and things so your essay advised me i do not pretend this trip is entirely without risk dor but i believe the potential benefits make the risk worthwhile i am an cellent swordsman and did have twenty years to perfect survival techniques based on other things than magic but i must confess that i do miss mundania somewhat perhaps that is the underlying motive for this excursionthe kin pondered again then broached a new aspect more tricky is the nagture of the inter face you see when we step through to mundania we may find our selves at any point in its history until very recently we could not se lect the point this much has been chance the queen believes she has found a way to alle viate this problem that is one reason i must negotiate a trade agreement personally i can trust no one else to handle the vagaries of the transition we may fail to reach our target kingdom or may reach it and return emptyhanded in that case i will have no one to blame except myself but if you dont know where youll arrive in mundania how do you know theres an opportunity i mean you raight land somewhere else entirely as i said i do have a hint i believe the time is now propitious to enter mundanias medieval age and the queen has studied the mat ter and believes she can as it were finetune our entry to match the particular placetime our scout scouted this spot should have co pious natural resources like wood and cloth that we can work by magic into carvings and clothing they cant match perhaps some thing else will offer perhaps nothing i believe a week will suffice to explore the situation we cannot afford to stand still we must keep working to improve our situation magic is not enough to keep xanth prosperous the land also requires alert administration i guess so dor agreed but it seemed to him he would never be able to do the job king trent was doing xanth was indeed doing well now and the improvement had been steady from the time of trents ascension to power the kingdom was well disciplined and well ordered even the dragons no longer dared to maraud where men had staked their territory dor had a morbid fear that at such time as he dor became king the golden age would deteriorate i wish you well in mundania sir i know you do dor king trent said affably i ask you to bear in mind this before all elsehonesty honesty when you are in doubt honesty is generally the best course whatever may happen you will not have cause for shame if you ad here scrupulously to that ill remember dor said honesty honesty king trent repeated with peculiar emphasis thats it in an instant it seemed the dread day came dor found himself huddled on the throne feeling terribly alone king trent and queen iris had announced their vacation and disappeared into a cloud when the cloud dissipated they were gone iris power of illusion had made them invisible she had always liked dramatic entrances and exits dor gritted his teeth and got into it actually the business of governing was mostly routine there was a trained palace staff quite competent whose members dor had always known they did whatever he asked and answered any questions he had but they did not make important decisionsand dor discovered that every decision no matter how minor seemed vitally important to the people it concerned so he let the routine handle itself and concentrated on those areas that demanded the decision of the king hoping his voluminous royal robe would conceal any tremor of his knees the first case concerned two peasants who had a difference about a plantation of light bulbs each claimed to be entitled to the brightest bulbs of the current crop dor questioned their wooden belt buckles and got the straight story while both peasants stood amazed at this magic dor did this deliberately so they could see that he was indeed a magician they respected that caliber ofinagic and would be more likely to pay attention to him now qr peasant a had fanned the field for many years with indifferent success it belonged to him peasant b had been hired to help this seasonand the field had brightened into the best crop in years so that it never saw darkness to whom then did the first choice of bulbs belong dor saw that some diplomacy was called for here he could of course make an arbitrary decision but that would surely leave one party unsatisfied that could lead to future trouble he didnt want any of his decisions coming back to haunt king trent in future months peasant b obviously has the special touch that made this crop of bulbs glow so well he said so he should be given his choice of the best as many as he wants after all without him the crop would not be worth much peasant b looked pleased however peasant a does own the field he can hire whomever he wants next year so he can get to keep more of his crop peasant a nodded grim agreement of course dor continued blithely peasant a wont have much of a crop and peasant b wont have a job the bulbs wont grow elsewhere and wont brighten as well for anyone else so both peasants will lose too bad it would have been so simple to share the best bulbs equally taking turns selecting each bulb sharing the profit of the joint effort and setting up for an even better future season dor shrugged sadly the two peasants looked at each other a notion dawning wasnt it after all more important to share many future harvests than run off with the best of only one maybe they could work this out themselves they departed discussing the prospects with animation dor relaxed his muscles unknotting had he done it the right way he knew he could not make everyone happy in every case but he did want to come as close as possible dor woke next morning to discover a ghost standing beside the royal bed it was doreen the kitchen maid there had been half a dozen recognizable ghosts on the premises each with his or her sad story but most were closemouthed about their living pasts dor had always liked doreen because of the coincidence of namesdor doreenthough apart from that they had little in common maybe he had been named after her since she was a friend of millie the ghost who had been his nursemaid during his early years no one had seen fit to tell him and the local furniture didnt know there were many moderate little mysteries like that around this castle it was part of its atmosphere at any rate doreen was middleaged and portly and often snappish not having much to do with the eving thus it was a surprise to find her here what can i do for you doreen he asked sir your majesty king dor she said diffidently dor smiled doreen always found it hard to pinpoint the point out with it blithe spirit well we you know we havent really quite seen very much of afillie since she passed on to the ghosts millies return to life was passing on she had been one of their number for several centuries and now was mortal again you miss her yes certainly in a way we do your majesty she used to come see us every day right after she you know but since she got herself in the matrimonial way she hasntshe millie had married the zombie master and gone to share the castle now possessed by good magician humfrey it had been the zombie masters castle eight hundred years before youd like to see her again dor finished yes sir your majesty you were her friend in efe and now that youre in the way of being the royal king she hardly needs the icings approval to visit her old compan ions dor smiled not that such approval would ever be withheld but even if it were how could anyone stop a ghost from going any where oh sir we cant go anywhere doreen protested we are for ever bound by the site of our cruel demise until our you might say to put it politely our onuses are abated well if youd tell me your onuses maybe i could help dor suggested it was the first time he had ever seen a ghost blush oh no no rmever she stammered evidently he had struck a sensitive area well mirie can cer tainly come to see you sut she never she doesnt she wont seem to come doreen wailed we have heard had information we believe she became a mother of twins dor agreed a boy and a girl it was bound to hap pen considering her talent prtidish doreen let that pass so of course naturally shes busy but if the lung suggested intimated asked her to visit dor smiled millie was my governess for a dozen years i had a crush on her she never took orders from me it was the other way around nobody who knows me takes me seriously as he spoke dor feared he had just said something significant and damaging or damning he would have to think about that in private but now that youre king doreen said not debating his point dor smiled again very well i will invite millie and her family here for a visit so you can meet the children i cant guarantee theyll come but i will extend the invitation oh thank you your majesty sir doreen faded gratefully out dor shook his head he hadnt realized the ghosts liked children but of course one of them was a child button so that could account for it millies babies were only three years old while button was six but of course in time the twins would grow to his age while the ghost would not change he had been six for six hundred years chil dren were children dor had not met millies twins himself a visit should be interesting he wondered whether millie retained her talent of sex appeal now that she was happily married did any wife keep up with that sort of thing he feared that by the time he found out it would be too late later that day perhaps by no coincidence dor was approached by a zombie the decrepit creatures normally remained comfortably buried in their graveyard near the castle but any threat to the castle would bring them charging gruesomely forth this one dropped stinking clods of earth and goo as it walked and its face was a mass of pus and rot but somehow it managed to talk yhoor mhajustee it pleaded loathsomely spitting out a decayed tooth dor had known the zombies well in his day including zombie ani mals and a zombie ogre named egor so they no longer repulsed him as badly as they might have done yes he said politely the best way to deal with a zombie was to give it what it wanted since it could not be killed or discouraged theoretically it was possible to dismember one and bury the pieces separately but that was hardly worth the trouble and still was not guaranteed effective besides zombies were all right in their place ohur masssteff dor caught on you have not seen the zombie master in some time i will ask him to visit here so you can get together and rehash old times must be many a graveyard youve patronized with him i cant promise hell comehe does like his privacybut ill make the effort thaaanks the zombie whistled losing part of its moldy tongue around nobody who knows me takes me seriously as he spoke dor feared he had just said something significant and damaging or damning he would have to think about that in private but now that youre king doreen said not debating his point dor smiled again very well i will invite millie and her family here for a visit so you can meet the children i cant guarantee theyll come but i will extend the invitation oh thank you your majesty sir doreen faded gratefully out dor shook his head

make the effort thaaanks the zombie whistled losing part of its moldy tongue uhs rememberhe has a family now two little children you might find them scooping sand out of graves playing with stray bones but the zombie didnt seem concerned lie maggots squirmed alertly in its sunken eyes as it turned to depart maybe it was fun to have children play with ones bones meanwhile the daily chores continued another case concerned a sea monster invading a river and terrorizing the fish there which caused a slack harvest dor had to travel there and make the ground in the vicinity rumble as if shaken by the passage of a giant the in animate objects went to it with a will they liked conspiring to frighten a monster and the sea monster none too smart and not re ally looking for trouble decided it was more at home in the deep sea innocently gobbling down shipwrecked sailors and flashing at voyeuristic mundane investigators of the supernatural it made a youll be sorry when you dont have c monster to kick around any more honk and departed again dor relaxed weakly this device would not work against a smart monster he had been lucky he was highly conscious of the potential for some colossal foulup and felt it was only a matter of time before it occurred he knew he didnt have any special talent for governing at night he had nightmares not the usual kind wherein black fe male mundanetype horses chased him but the worse kind wherein he thought he was awake and made some disastrous decision and all xanth went up in magic flames was overrun by wiggleworms or worst of all lost its magic and became like drear mundania all somehow his fault he had heard it said that the head that wore the crown was uneasy in truth not only was that crown wearing a blis ter into his scalp makin him quite uneasy that head was terrified b y the responsibility of governing xanth another day there was a serious theft in a northern village dor had himself conjured there naturally castle roogna had a resident conjurer the problem village was in central xanth near the incog nito territory largely unexplored by man where dragons remained unchastened and that made dor nervous there were many devasta ing monsters in xanth but as a class the dragons were the worst be t cause there were many varieties and sizes of them and their numbers were large but actually it turned out to be a pleasant region with most of the modern magic conveniences like sodawater springs and scented soapstones for laundry this was furharvesting country and this year there had been a fine harvest from the local stand of ever green far trees the green furs had been seasoning in the sun and curing in the moon and sparkling in the stars until one morning they were gone without trace dor questioned the platform on which the furs had been piled and learned that a contingent from another village had sneaked in and stolen them this was one time his magic talent was superior to that of king trentthe gathering of information he then arranged to have the furs conjured back no action was taken against the other village those people would know their deed had been discovered and would probably lie low for some time through all this irene was a constant nag she resented doris as cension to the throne though she knew it was temporary and she kept hoping he would foul up my father could have done it better she muttered darkly when dor solved a problem and was hardly mollified when he agreed you should have punished that thieving village and dor wondered whether he had in fact been wishy washy there taking the expedient route instead of the proper one yet what could he do except whatever seemed best at the time of de cision the crushing responsibility for error made him painstakingly cautious only experience he suspected could provide the necessary confidence to make excellent decisions under pressure and that was exactly what king trent in his own experienced wisdom had ar ranged for dor to obtain here dor to his surprise did not quite foul up but the variety of prob lems he encountered strained his ingenuity and the foreboding grew that his luck had to turn he counted the passing days praying that no serious problem would arise before king trent returned maybe when dor was trents age hed be competent to run a kingdom full time right now it was such nervous business it was driving him to distraction irene at length perceiving this flipflopped in girlish fashion and started offering support after all she said consolingly its not forever even though it seems like it only two more days before the dangers over then we can all faint with relief dor appreciated the support though he might have preferred a less pointed summation of his inadequacy he made it the day of king trents return came to doris im mense relief and irenes mixed gratification and subdued dismay she wanted her father back but had expected dor to make more of a mess of fliffigs dor had escaped more or less unscratched which she felt was not quite fair both of them dressed carefully and made sure the castle roogna grounds were clean they were ready to greet the returning royalty m proper style the expectant hours passed but the king and queen did not appear dor quelled his nervousness of course it took time to travel especially if a quantity of mundane trade goods was being moved irene joined dor for a lunch of number noodles and milk shakes they tried to divert themselves by spelling words with numbers but the milk kept shaking so violently that nothing held together that fitted their mood where are they irene demanded as the afternoon wore on she was really getting worried now that she had a genuine concern so that she wasnt concentrating her energy to embarrass dor she manerested as the infemally pretty girl she could be even the green tint of her hair was attractive it did match her eyes and after all there was nothing wrong with plants probably they had stuff to carry so had to go slow dor said not for the first time but a qualm was gnawing at him he cuffed it away but it kept returding as was the nature of its kind irene did not argue but the green was spreading to her face and that was less pretty evening came and night without trent and iriss return now irene turned to dor in genuine apprehension oh dor im scared whats happened to them he could bluff neither her nor himself he put his arm about her shoulders i dont know im scared too she clung to him for a moment all soft and sweet in her anxiety then she drew away and ran to her own apartment i dont want you to see me cry she explained as she disappeared dor was touched if only she could be like that when things were going well there was a good deal more to her than mischief and sexual suggestion if she ever let it show he retired and slept uneasily the real nightmares came this time not the sleek and rather pretty equines he had sometimes befriended but huge nebulous misshapen creatures with gleaming white eyes and glinting teeth he had to shake himself violently awake to make them leave he used the royal chambers for he was king nowbut since his week was over he felt more than ever like an imposter he stared morosely at the dark hoofprints on the floor knowing the mares were waiting only for him to sleep again he was defenseless he had geared himself emotionally for relief when the week expired and now that relief had been negated if the king and queen did not return today what would he do they did not return dor continued to settle differences and solve problems in the kingly routine what else could he do but a restlessness was growing in the palace and his own dread intensified as each hour dragged by everyone knew king trents vacation had been scheduled for one week why hadnt he returned in the evening irene approached dor privately there was no mischief about her now she was conservatively garbed in a voluminous green robe and her hair was in disorder as if overrun by weeds her eyes were pretematurally bright as if she had been crying more than was good for her and had used vanishing cream to make the signs of it disappear somethings happened she said i know it we must go check on them we cant do that dor said miserably cant that concept is not in my lexicon she had grown so used to using fancy words she now did it even when distracted dor hoped he never deteriorated to that extent i can do anything i want except except rule xanth dor said and fmd your parents where are they she demanded she didnt know of course she had not been part of the secret he saw no way to avoid telling her now for she was after all king trents daughter and the situation had become serious she did have the right to know in mundania mundania she cried horrified a trade mission he explained quickly to make a deal so xanth can benefit for progress oh this is twice as awful as i feared oh woe mundania the awfullest of places they cant do magic there theyre helpless that was an exaggeration but she was prone to it when excited neither trent nor iris was helpless in nonmagical terms the king was an expert swordsman and the queen had a wonderfully devious mind remember he spent twenty years there before he was king he knows his way around but he didnt come back dor could not refute that i dont know what to do he confessed well have to go find them she said dont tell me no again and there was such a ghut in her bright eyes that dor dared not defy her actually it seemed so simple anything was better than the present doubt all right but ill have to tell the council of elders for the elders were responsible for the kingdom during the absence of the king they took care of routine administrative chores and had to select a new king if anything happened to the old one they had chosen trent back when the prior monarch the storm king had died doris grandfather roland was a leading elder first thing in the morning she said her gaze daring him to demur first thing in the morning he agreed she had forced this action upon him but he was glad for the decision shall i stay with you tonight i saw the hoofprints dor considered the surest way to banish nightmares was to have compatible company while sleeping but irene was too pretty now and too accommodating if he kissed her this night she wouldnt bite that made him cautious once good magician humfrey had suggested to him that it might be more manly to decline a womans offer than to accept it dor had not quite understood that suggestion but now he had a better inkling of its meaning no he said regretfully i fear the nightmares but i fear you more gee she said pleased then she kissed him without biting and left in her swirl of perfume dor sat for some time wishing irene were that way all the time no tantrums no artful flashes of torso no pretended misunderstandings just a sincere and fairly mature caring but of course her niceness came only in phases always wiped out by other phases his decision had one beneficial effect the nightmares foraged elsewhere that night letting him sleep in peace cover for me he told irene in the morning i would rather people didnt know where i am except for the conjurer certainly she agreed if people knew he was consulting privately with an elder they would know something was wrong he went to see his grandfather roland who lived in the north village several days walk beyond the gap chasm kings of xanth had once resided here before trent restored castle roogna he marched up the neat walk and knocked on the humble door oh grandfatherl dor cried the moment the strong old man appeared something has happened to king trent and i must go look for him impossible roland said sternly the king may not leave castie roogna for more than a day without appointing another magician as successor at the moment there are no other magicians who would assume the crown so you must remain there until trent returns that is the law of xanth but king trent and queen iris went to mundanial mundania roland was as surprised as irene had been no wonder he did not consult with usl we would never have permitted that so there had been method in the manner king trent had set dor up for this practice week trent had bypassed the council of elders but that was not doris immediate concern im not fit to govern grandfather im too young ive got to get king trent back absolutely not i am only one member of the council but i know their reaction you must remain here until trent returns but then how can i rescue him from mundania you cant he will have to extricate himself from whatever situation he is in assuming he lives he lives dor repeated emphatically he had to believe that the alternative was unthinkable but i dont know how long i can keep governing xanth the people know im not really king they think king trent is nearby just giving me more practice they wont obey me much longer perhaps you should get help roland suggested i disapprove on principle of deception but i think it best in this case that the people not know the gravity of the situation perhaps it is not grave at ab trent may return in good order at any time meanwhile the kingdom need not be governed solely by one young man i could get help i guess dor said uncertainly but what about king trent he must return by himselfor fail to none of us can locate him in mundania let alone help him this is the obvious consequence of his neglect in obtaining the prior advice of the council of elders we must simply wait he is a resourceful man who will surely prevau if that is humanly possible with that dor had to be satisfied he was king but he could not go against the elders he realized now that this was not merely a matter of law or custom but of common sense any situation in mundania that was too much for king trent to handle would be several times too much for dor irene was more positive than he had expected when he gave her the news on his return of course the elders would say that theyre old and conservative and right i guess well just have to make do until my father gets back dor didnt quite trust her change of heart but knew better than to inquire who can we get to help he knew it would be impossible to exclude irene from any such activity king trent was after all her father the one person to whom her loyalty was unfailing oh all the kids chet smash gruntly to run a kingdom he asked dubiously would you rather leave it to the elders she had a point i hope the situation doesnt last long he said you certainly dont hope it more than i do she agreed and he knew that was straight from her heart irene went off to locate the people mentioned so that dor would not arouse suspicion by doing it himself the first she found was grundy the golem grundy was older than the others and different in several respects he had been created as a golem animated wood and clay and string and later converted to fullperson status he was only a handspan tall and spoke all the languages of all living things which was the useful talent for which he had been created grundy could certainly help in solving the routine problems of xanth but he tended to speak too often and intemperately in other words he was mouthy that could be trouble now this is a secret dor explained king trent is lost in mundania and i must run the kingdom until he returns xanth is in trouble grundy exclaimed thats why i need your help i dont know how much longer ih have to be king and i dont want things to get out of control you generally have good information i snoop a lot grundy agreed very well ill snoop for you first thing i have to tell you is that the whole palace is sniggering about a certain essay someone wrote for a certain female tutor that news i can dispense with dor said ilen theres the gossip about how a certain girl went swimming in her birthday suit which suit seems to have stretched some since her birth along with that too dor said smuing lm sure you comprehend my needs whats in it for me your head hes king ab right the golem muttered one of the walls chuckled irene brought in chet he was a centaur a little older than dor but he seemed younger because centaurs matured more slowly he was cheries son which meant he was highly educated but very cautious about showing any magic talent for a long time centaurs had believed they lacked magical talents because most creatures of xanth either had magic or were magic modern information had dissipated such superstitions chet did have a magic talent he could make large things small it was a perfectly decent ability and many people had fine miniatures he had reduced for them but it had one drawback he could not reverse the process his father was chester centaur which meant chet tended to be omery when challenged and was unhandsome in his human portion when he reached his full stature which would not be for some years yet he would be a pretty solid animal dor despite the maledictions he heaped on the race of centaurs while sweating over one of cheries assignments did like chet and had always gotten along with him dor explained the situation certainly i will help chet said he always spoke in an educated manner partly because he was unconscionably smart but mostly because his mother insisted technically cherie was chets dam but dor refrained from using that term for fear cherie would perceive the n he mentally added to it dor had sympathy for chet it was probably almost as hard being cheries son as it was trying to be king chet would not dare nasspell any words but i am uncertain how i might assist stlve just barely figured out decent answers to the problems ive already dealt with dor said earnestly im bound to foul up before long i need good advice then you should apply to my mother her advice is irrefutable i know thats too authoritative chet smiled i suspect i understand that was as close as he would come to criticizing his dam later in the day irene managed to bring in smash he was the offspring of crunch the ogre and also not yet at full growthbut he was already about twice doris mass and strong in proportion like all ogres he was ugly and not smart his smile would spook a gargoyle and he could barely pronounce most words let alone spen them that quality endeared him to dor but the ogres association with human beings had made him more intelligible and sociable than others of his kind and he was loyal to his friends dor had been his friend for years dor approached this meeting diplomatically smash i need your help the gross mouth cracked open like caked mud in a dehydrated pond sure me help who me pulp to kelp no one yet dor said quickly again like all ogres smash was prone to rhymes and violence but if you could sort of stay within call in case someone tries to pulp me pulp me who he dor realized he had presented too convoluted a thought when i yell you come help okay help whelp smash agreed finally getting it straight doris choice of helpers proved fortuitous because they were all his peers and friends they understood his situation better than adults would have and kept his confidences it was a kind of gamerun this kingdom as if king trent were merely dallying out of sight watching them grading them it was important not to foul up a basilisk wandered into a village terrorizing the people because its stare caused them to turn to stone dor wasnt sure he could scare it away as he had the sea monster though it was surely a stupid creature for basilisks had exceedingly omery personalities he couldnt have a boulder conjured to squish it for king trent decreed the basilisk to be an endangered species this was an alien concept the king had brought with him from mundaniathe notion that rare creatures however horrible should be protected dor did not quite understand this but he was trying to preserve the kingdom for trents return so did it trents way he needed some harmless way to persuade the creature to leave human villages aloneand he couldnt even talk its language but grundy the golem could grundy used a hehnet and periscopethat was a magic device that bent vision around a cornerto look indirectly at the little monster and told it about the most bale fid shebask he had ever heard of who was lurldng somewhere in the dead forest southeast of castle roogna since the one grundy addressed happened to be a cockatrice the notion of such a hena trice appealed to it it was no lie there was a palace guard named crombic who had the abuity to point to things and he had pointed toward that forest when asked where the most baleful female basilisk resided of course sex was mostly illusion among basilisks since each was generated from the egg of a rooster laid in a dungheap under the dog star and hatched by a toad that was why this was an endangered species since very few roosters laid eggs in dungheaps under the dog starthey tended to get confused and do it under the cat starand most toads had little patience with the seven years it normally required to hatch the egg but like human beings the basi lisks pursued such illusions avidly so this cockbask took off in all haste e a fast snails pacefor the dead forest where the lone some hen basked and the problem had been solved then there was an altercation in the barracksthe village set up by the old soldiers of trents erstwhile mundane army dismantled when he came to power each had a farmstead and many had mun dane wives imported to balance the sexual ratio they could not do magic but their children had talents just like the real citizens of xanth the old soldiers entertained themselves by setting up a war games spectacular using wooden swords and engaging in complex maneuvers king trent allowed this sort of exercise so long as no one was hurt soldiers unable to stifle their murderous propensities were issued genuine bayonets from bayonet plants cultured for the purpose and were assigned to dragonhunting duty they went after those dragons who insisted on raiding human settlements this tended to eliminate some of the dragons and most of the violent sol diers it all worked out but this time there was a difference of opin ion concerning a score made by the red team on the green team the reds had set up a catapult and fired off a puffball that puffed into lovely smoke at the apex of its flight in the games soldiers were not permitted to hurl actual rocks or other dangerous things at each other to their frustration the reds claimed a direct score on the greens headquarters tent wiping out the green bean and his floo zie of the day the greens insisted that the reds aim had been off so that they had not after all puffed bean and floozie since the floozie was the brains of the outfit this was a significant distinction the reds countered that they had surveyed in the positions of their catapult and the target tent allowed for windage humidity air pressure and stray magic doublechecked the azimuth elevation and charge with their red pepper and his doll of the day and fired off the mockshot in excellent faith the victory should be theirs dor had no idea how to verify the accuracy of the shot but chet centaur did lower middle and higher math had been pounded into his skull by the flick of a horsewhip at his tail he reviewed all the figures of the survey including the floozie and doll figures spoke with the military experts about corrected azimuths and trigonometric functionswhich made dor nervous it wasnt nice to talk dirty in publicand concluded that the shot had been offtarget by seven point three lengths of the red peppers left foot presented with formal protests he engaged in a brief debate in which obscure mathematical spells radiated like little whirlpools and nebulae from his head to clash with those of the reds a purple tangent spun into a yellow vector breaking it in two an orange cosine ground up a dangling cube root the red surveyors impressed by chets competence conceded the point however since the target tent had been twelve pepperfoots in diameter it was recognized that the probability of a glancing strike was high even with due margin for error the greens were adjudged to have lost the services of the floozie and therefore to be at a serious disadvantage in the engagement the maneuvers resumed and chet returned to castle roogna problem solved then a huge old rockmaple tree fell across one of the magic paths leading to castle roogna this was a welltraveled path and it was not safe to leave it for beyond its protection the nickelpedes lurked no one would risk setting foot into a nickelpede nest for the vicious little creatures five times the size and ferocity of centipedes would instantly gouge out nickels of flesh the tree had to be clearedbut the rock was far too heavy for any ordinary person to move smash the ogre took a hammer marched down the path and blasted away at the fallen trunk he was as yet a child ogre not more than hall again as tall as dor so possessed of only a fraction of his eventual strength but an ogre was an ogre at any age the hammer clanged resoundingly the welkin rang the stone cracked asunder dust flew up in clouds that formed a small dust storm wherein dust devils played and fragments of maple shot out like shrapnel soon the little ogre had hewn a pathsized section through the trunk so that people could pass again the job had been simple enough for him though as an adult he would not have needed the hammer he would merely have picked up the whole trunk and heaved it far away so it went another week passedand still king trent and queen iris did not return irenes nervousness was contagious youve got to do something dorl she screamed and several ornamental plants in the vicinity swelled up and burst responding to her frustration the elders wont let me go after him he said as nervous as she you do something right now dor or ill make your life completely miserable dor quailed anew this was no empty bluff she could make him miserable on her good days how bad would it be when she really tried ill consult with crombie he said what good will that do she demanded my father is in mundania crombie cant point out his location beyond the realm of magic i have a feeble notion dor said when crombie arrived dor put it to him how about pointing out something that would help them locate king trent crombie could point to anything even an idea if there were some device or some person with special information crombie closed his eyes spuia about flung out one arm and pointed south dor was almost afraid to believe it there really is something that will help i never point wrong crombie said with certainty he was a stout graying soldier of the old school who had a wife named jewel who lived in the nether caves of xanth and a daughter named tandy of whom no one knew anything jewel had been a nymph of the rock it was her job to salt the earth with all the diamonds emeralds sapphires rubies opals spinels and other gemstones that prospectors were destined eventually to find she was said to be a lovely sweet and tolerant woman now satisfied to see crombie on those irregular occasions when he got around to visiting her dor understood that jewel had once loved his father bink or vice versathat had never been made quite clearbut that crombie had captured her heart with a wishspell love had transformed her from nymph to woman that process too was not quite within doris comprehension what was the distinction between a nymph and a girl like irene sometimes people interpret it wrong but the point is always right crombic finished uh do you have any idea how far it is cant really tell but pretty far i think i could triangulate for you maybe he went to another room of the castle and tried again the point remained due south too far to get a proper fix down beyond lake ogrechobee id say dor knew about that lake it had been part of the geography cherie centaur had drilled into him a tribe of fiends lived beneath it who hurled curses at anyone who bothered them they had driven off most of the ogres who had once resided on its shores a number of those displaced ogres had migrated north settling in the ogrefenogre fen woe betide the cursefiend who tried to follow them there he didnt want to go to that lake anything that could drive away a tribe of ogres was certainly too much for him to handle but youre sure it will help us dor asked nervously not curse us you hard of hearing your majesty i said so before crombie was a friend of doris father and of king trent he did not put up with much nonsense from youngsters who had not even existed when he was sowing his wild oats all he sowed now were tame oats jewel saw to that how will it help us irene asked how should i know crombie demanded he was also a woman hater this was another aspect of his personality whose consistency eluded dor how could a tamely married man hate women evidently irene had changed in crombies eyes from child to woman indeed there was something in the way the old soldier looked at her now that made irene tend to fade back she played little games of suggestion with a harmless person like dor but lost her nerve when confronted by a real man albeit an old one like crombie i dont define policy i only point the way yes of course and we do appreciate it dor said diplomatically uh while youre herewould you point out the direction of any special thing i should be taking care of while im king why not crombie whirled againand pointed south again ha dor exclaimed i hoped that would be the case im supposed to go find whatever it is that will help us locate king trent irenes eyes lighted sometimes you border on genius she breathed gratified at this chance to search for her parents of course i do crombie agreed though the remark had not been directed at him he marched off on his rounds guarding the castle dor promptly visited elder roland again this time having irene conjured along with him she had never before been to the north village and found it quaint vzhats that funnylooking tree in the center court she inquired ibats justin tree dor replied surprised she didnt know about it your father transformed him to that form from a man about forty years ago before he went to mundania the first time she was taken aback why didnt he transform him back once he was king justin likes being a tree dor explained he has become a sort of symbol to the north village people bring him fresh water and dirt and fertuizer when he wants them and couples embrace in his shade oh lets try that she said was she serious dor decided not to risk it were here on business rescuing your father we dont want to delay of course she agreed instantly they hurried on to rolands house where doris grandmother bianca let them in surprised at doris return grandfather dor said when roland appeared i have to make a trip south according to crombie he points out a duty i have there way down beyond lake ogrechobee so the elders cant say no to that can they roland frowned we can try your majesty he glanced at irene would this relate to the absence of magician trent king trent irene snapped roland smiled indulgently we elders are just as concerned about this matter as you are he said he spoke firmly and softly no one would know from his demeanor that he had the magic power to freeze any person in his tracks we are eager to ascertain trencs present state but we cannot allow our present kingthats you dor to risk himself foolishly im afraid a long trip particularly to the vicinity of ogrechobee is out of the question at this time but its a matter im supposed to attend to dor protested and its not exactly the lake its south of it so i dont have to go near the fiends if a king doesnt do what hes supposed to do hes not fit to be king one could wish king trent had kept that more firmly in mind roland said and irene flushed yet at times there are conflicts of duty part of the art of governing is the choosing of the best route through seeming conflicts you have done well so far dor i think youll be a good king you must not act irresponsibly now king trent said much the same dor said remembering just before he left he told me that when i was in doubt to concentrate on honesty that is certainly true how strange that he did not do the honest fling himself and consult with the elders before he departed that was bothering dor increasingly and he could see that irene was fit to explode she hated denigration of her fatheryet rolands pique seemed justified had king trent had some deeper motive than mere trade with mundania had he incredibly actually planned not to return id like just to go to bed and hide my head under the blanket dor said that is no longer a luxury you can afford i think the nightmares would seek you out they already have dor agreed ruefully the castle maids are complaining about the hoofpnts in the rugs i would like to verify your findings if i may roland said there was a break while dor arranged to have crombie conjured to the north village grandmother bianca served pinwheel cookies she had harvested from her pinwheel bush irene begged a pinwheel seed from her irene had a collection of seeds she could grow into useful plants my how youve grown bianca said observing irene irene dropped her cookiebut then had it back unbroken biancos magic talent was the replay she could make time drop back a few seconds so that some recent error could be harmlessly corrected thank you irene murmured recovering crombie arrived i would like to verify your findings if i may roland repeated to the soldier dor noted how the old man was polite to everyone somehow that made roland seem magnified in the eyes of others will you point out to me please the greatest present threat to the kingdom of xanth crombic obligingly went through his act againand pointed south again that is what i suspected roland said it seems something is developing in that region that you do indeed have to attend to dor but this is a serious matter no pleasure excursion what can i do dor asked plaintively the horror of king trents unexplained absence was closing in on him threatening to overwhelm his tenuous equilibrium you can get some good advice dor considered you mean good magician humfrey i do he can tell you which course is best and if you must make this trip he can serve in your stead as king i dont think hell agree to that dor said im sure he wont irene agreed there must be a magician on the throne of xanth ask humfrey to arrange it should he approve your excursion that was putting the good magician on the spotl i will dor looked around trying to organize himself id better get started its a long walk youre the king dor you dont have to walk there any more than you had to walk here have yourself conjured there oh yes i forgot dor felt quite foolish but first get the rest of us safely back to castle roogna irene told him nibbling on another cookie i dont want to have to cross over the gap chasm on the invisible bridge and have the gap dragon looking up my skirt she held the cookie up by the pin while she chewed around the wheel delicately dor did not arrive inside magician humfreys castle he found himself standing just outside the moat something had gone wrong no he realized he had been conjured correctlybut the good magician who didnt like intrusions had placed a barrierspell in the way to divert anyone to this place outside humfrey didnt like to talk to anyone who didnt get into the castle the hard way of course he wasnt supposed to make the king run the gauntletbut obviously the old wizard was not paying attention at the moment dor should have called him on a magic mirror he hadnt thought of it in his eagerness to get going which meant he deserved what he had gottenthe consequence of his own lack of planning of course he could probably yell loud enough to attract the attention of someone inside the castle so he could get admitted without trouble but dor had a slightly omery streak he had made a mistake he wanted to work his way out of it himself rather into it he had forced his way into this castle once four years ago he should be able to do it now that would prove he could recover his own fumblesthe way a king should he took a good look at the castle environs the moat was not clear and sparkling as it had been the last time he was here it was dull and noisome the shape of the castle wall was now curved and slanted back like a steep conical mountain it was supremely unimpressiveand therefore suspect dor squatted and dipped a finger in the water it came up feslooned with slime he sniffed it ugh yet there was a certain familiarity about it he could not quite place where had he smelled that smell before one thing was certain he was not about to wade or swim through that water without first ascertaining exactly what lurked in it mag clan humfreys castle defenses were intended to balk and discourage rather than to destroybut they were always formidable enough generally it took courage and ingenuity to navigate the several hazards there would be something in the moat a good deal more unpleasant than slime nothing showed the dingy green gook covered the whole surface unbroken by any other horror dor was not encouraged water are there any living creatures lurking in your depths he inquired none at all the water replied its voice slurred by the goop yet there was a tittery overtone it seemed to find something funny in the question any inanimate traps none now little ripples of mirth tripped across the glutinous surface whats so funny dor demanded the water made little elongated splashes like dribbles of spoiled mucus youll find out the trouble with the inanimate was that it had very shallow notions of humor and responsibility but it could usually be coaxed or cowed dor picked up a rock and hefted it menacingly tell me what you know he said to the water or ill strike you with this stone dont do that the water cried cowed ill squeal ill spill everything i know which isnt much ugh the rock said at the same time dont throw me in that feculent sludge dor remembered how he had played the magicians own defenses against each other last time there had been a warning sign trespassers will be persecutedand sure enough when he trespassed he had been presented with a button with the word trespasser on one side and persecuted on the other the livinghistory tome that had recorded the episode had suffered a typo rendering persecuted into prosecuted for the sign but not for the button spoiling the effect of these quite different words these things happened few people seemed to know the distinction and doris spelling had not been good enough to correct it but this time there was no sign he had to generate his own persecution get on with it he told the water still holding the rock its a zombie the water said a zombie sea serpent now dor understood zombies were dead so it was true there were no living creatures in the moat but zombies were mate so there were no inanimate traps either it made sudden sensefor dor remembered belatedly that the zombie master was still here when the zombie master appeared in the present xanth there had been a problem since good magician humfrey now occupied the castle the zombie master had used eight hundred years ago the one had the claim of prior tenancy the other the claim of present possession neither wanted trouble so the two magicians had agreed to share the premises until something better was offered evidently the zombie master had found nothing better naturally he helped out with the castle defenses he was not any more sociable than humfrey was as it happened dor had had experience with zombies some of his best friends had been zombies he still was not too keen on the way they smelled or on the way they dropped clods of dank glop and maggots wherever they went but they were not bad creatures their place more important they were hardly smarter than the manimate objects doris magic animated because their brains were literally rotten he was confident he could fool a zombie there should be a boat around here he said to the rock where is it over there chump the rock said now will you let me go dor saw the boat satisfied he let the rock go it dropped with a satisfied thunk to the ground and remained there in blissful repose rocks were basically lazy they hardly ever did anything on their own he went to the boat it was a dingy canoe with a battered double paddleexactly what he needed dor walked away hey arent you going to use me the canoe demanded jects werent supposed to talk unless dor willed it but they tended to get sloppy about the rules no im going to fetch my friend the zombie oh sure we see lots of that kind here they make good fertilizer when dor was out of sight of the castle he stopped and stooped to grub in the dirt he smeared dirt on his face and arms and over his royal robes naturally he should have changed to more suitable clothing for this trip but of course that was part of his overall carelessness he had not planned ahead at all next he found a sharp stone and used it to rip into the cloth of the robe ooooh ouch the robe groaned what did i ever do to you that you should slay me thus but the sharp stone only chuckled it liked ripping off clothing before long dor was a tattered figure of a man he scooped several double handfuls of dirt into a fold of his robe and walked back to the castle as he approached the moat he shuffled in the manner of a zombie and dropped small clods to the ground he got into the canoe oooooh he groaned soulfully i hope i can make it home before i go all to pieces and he used the paddle to push off into the scum of the moat he was deliberately clumsy though in truth he was not well experienced with canoes and would have been awkward anyway the water slurped and sucked as the paddle dipped into the ooze now there was a stirring as the zombie sea monster moved the slime parted and the huge mottled decaying head lifted clear of the viscous surface globules of slush dangled and dripped plopping sickly into the water the huge sloppy mouth peeled open revealing scores of loose brownish teeth set in a jaw almost stripped of flesh hi friend dor called windily can you direct me to my master as he spoke he slipped forth a moist clod of dirt so that it looked as if his lip were falling off the monster hesitated its grotesque head swung close to inspect dor its left eyeball came loose dangling by a gleaming string sooo the zombie inquired its breath redolent of spoiled limberger dor waved his arms losing some more earth one choice clod struck the monster on the nose with a dank squish he was sorry he hadnt been able to fmd anything really putrid like a maggoty rat corpse but that was the luck of the game wheeere he demanded every bit as stupid as a zombie the big advantage to playing stupid was that it didnt take much intelligence he knocked at his right ear and let fall another clod as if a piece of his brain had been dislodged at last the serpent caught on theeere it breathed spraying out several loose fragments of teeth and bone with the effort its snout seemed to be afflicted with advanced gangrene and the remaining teeth were crumbling around their canes thaaanks dor replied dropping another clod into the water he took up the paddle again and scraped on toward the castle hope i dont fall apart before i get there he had won the first round the sea serpent was in poor condition as most zombies were but could have capsized the boat and drowned dor in slime without difficulty had its brain been a better grade of pudding it might have done just that but zombies did not attack their own kind that was too messy even the completeness of doris own body conspicuously healthy under the tatters and dirt did not count too much against him fresh zombies were complete it took time for most of the flesh to fall off he docked at the inner edge of the moat where the castle wall emerged at its steep angle now dor splashed a hole in the slime and cleared a section of halfway clean water he could wash in his zombie ploy was over he didnt want to enter the castle in this condition the rents in his robe could not be repaired but at least he would look human he got out of the canoe but found it hard to stand on the sloping wall the surface was not brick or stone as he had supposed but glasssolid translucent seamless cold hard glass a mountain of glass glass now he grasped the nature of the second challenge the slope became steeper near the top until the wall was almost vertical how could he scale that dor tried he placed each foot carefully and found that he could stand and walk slowly he had to remain straight upright for the moment he leaned into the mountain as was his natural inclination his feet began to skid he could quickly get dumped into the awful moat if he let his feet slide out from under him fortunately there was no wind he could stand erect and step slowly up he noticed however a small cloud in the sky as he watched it seemed to extend rapidly oopsthat surely meant rain which would wash him out that was surely no coincidence probably the touch of his foot on the glass had summoned the storm he had to hike to the top of the mountain before the cloud arrived well the distance was not far with care and good footfriction he could probably make it then something came galloping around the mountain it had four legs a tail and a funny homed head but its chief oddity it was heading right for dor those horns lowered the creature was no taller than he and the horns were small and blunt but the body was far more massive dor had to jump to get out of its wayand lost his footing and slid down to the brink of the water before stopping his nose barely clear of the slime he stabilized hnself while the zombie sea serpent watched with a certain aloof amusement dor wiped a dangle of goo from his nose vihat was that the sidehill hoofer the glass responded something funny about that creature the legs oh sure the glass said the two left legs are shorter than the two rights thats so she can charge around the mountain in comfort its natural selection lots of the better mountains have them shorter left legsso the hoofer could stay level while running on a slope it did make a certain kind of sense how come i never heard of this creature before dor demanded probably because your education has been neglected i was tutored by a centaur dor said defensively the centaur surely told you of the sidehill hoofer the glass agreed but did you listen education is only as good as the mind of the student what are you implying dor demanded i rather thought you were too dense to grasp the implication the glass said with smug condescension youre a mountain of glass dor said irately how bright can you be thought youd never ask im the brightest thing on the horizon and a beam of sunlight slanted down avoiding the looming cloud causing the mountain to glow brilliantly dor had walked into that one with the lifetime experience he had had he still fell into the trap of arguing with the inanimate he changed the subject is the hoofer dangerous not if you have the wit to stay out of her way ive got to climb to the top of this slope extraordinary fortune the glass said brightly ets mlatpy the glass sighed i keep forgetting that animate creatures cannot match my brilliance recognizing your handicap i shall translate lots of luck oh thank you dor said sarcastically thats irony the glass said ironynot glassy spare me your feeble efforts at repartee if you do not get moving before that cloud arrives you will be washed right into the sea thats an exaggeration dor grumped starting back up the slope that is hyperbole the glass began humming a tinkly little tune dor made better progress than before he was getting the hang of it he had to put his feet down flat and softly and will himself not to skid but the sidehill hoofer came charging around the cone again spooking him with a loud moooo and dor slid down the slope again he was no more partial to this bovine than he had been to irenes sea cow the cloud was definitely closer and playful little gusts of wind emanated from it oh get lost dor told it fat chance it blew back ruming his hair with an aggravating intimacy dor went up the slope a third time by dint of incautious effort getting beyond the slight gouge in the mountain worn by the hoofers pounding hooves the glass hummed louder and finally broke into song shell be coming round the mountain when she comes sure enough the sidehill hoofer came galumphing around again spied dor and corrected course slightly to charge straight at him her uneven legs pounded evenly on the incline so that her two short horns were deadlevel as they bore on him blunt those horns might be but they were formidable enough in this situation oh no it was no accident that brought this creature around so inconveniently she was trying to prevent him from passing naturally this was the third barrier to his entry into the castle dor jumped out of the way and slid down to the brink again disgruntled the hoofer thundered by disappearing around the curve dor wiped another dribble of slime off his nose he wasnt making much progress this was annoying because he had passed his first challenge without difficulty and faced only two comparatively simple and harmless onesto avoid the hoofer and scale the slippery slope either alone was feasible together they baffled him now he had perhaps ten minutes to accomplish both before the omery raincloud wiped him out already the forward edge of the cloud had cut off the sunbeam dor didnt like leaning on his magic talent too much but decided that pride was a foolish baggage at this point he had to get inside the castle any way he could and get good magician humfreys advicefor the good of xanth glass since yoxfre so brightteer me how i can get past the hoofer and up your slope before the cloud strikes dont tell him the cloud thundered well rm not so bright any more now that im in your shadow the glass demurred this was true the sparkle was gone and the mountain was a somber dark mass like the quiet depths of an ocean but you remember the answer dor said give take the storm blew ive got to tell him the glass said dolefully though id much rather watch him fall on his as watch your language dor snapped mine posterior again and dip his nose in the gunk but hes a magician and im only silicon the glass sighed very well cogitate and masticate on what give me strength to survive the monumental idiocy of the animate the glass prayed obnoxiously the cloud had let a gleam of sunlight through making it bright again think and chew on this who can most readily mount the slope the sidehih hoofer dor said but thats no help fm the one who think and chew the glass repeated with emphasis that reminded dor of the way king trent had stressed the importance of honesty and that annoyed dor this mountain was no king what business did it have making oblique allusions as if dor were a dunce who needed special handling look glassi asked you a direct question an indirect question technically my response reflects your approach but surely you realize that i am under interdiction by another magician dor didnt know what interdiction meant but could guess humfrey had told the mountain not to blab the secret but the cloud was looming close and large and dense with water and he was impatient hey i insist that you tell m ibat is of course the answer dor paused this toobright object was making a fool of him he reviewed his words hey i insist that you tell mehow was that the answer yet it seemed it was your never get it the glass said disparagingly hey now dor started angruy ibere you go again hey now suddenly dor got it heyspelled h a y haynowl he cried it was a homonym the zombie sea serpent taking that for an order swam across the moat and reached out to take a clumsy bite of dry grass from the outer bank it brought this back to dor thank you serpent dor said accepting the armful he shook out the residual slime and dottle and several more of the monsters teeth bounced on the glass zombies had an inexhaustible supply of fragments of themselves to drop it was part of their nature he started up the slope yet again but this time he wanted to meet the hoofer he stood there with his hay facing her the creature cameround the mountainand paused as she sighted him her ears perked forward and her tongue ran over her lips ilats right you beautiful bovine dor said this hay is for you ilink and chewto chew on while you think i noticed that there isnt much forage along your beat you must use a lot of energy pounding around and work up quite an appetite surely you could use a lunch break before the rain spoils everything the hoofers eyes became larger they were beautiful and soulful her square nose quivered as she sniffed in the odor of the fresh hay her pink tongue ran around her muzzle again she was certainly hungry of course if i set it down itll just slide down the slope and into the moat dor said reasonably i guess you could fish it out but slimecoated hay doesnt taste very good does it as he spoke a stronger gust of wind from the eager storm swirled through tugging at the hay and waiting a few strands down to the goo of the moat the hoofer fidgeted with alarm tell you what ill do dor said ill just get on your back and carry the hay and feed it to you while you walk that way youll be able to eat it all without losing a wisp and no one can accuse you of being derelict in your duty youll be covering your beat all the time mmmooo the hoofer agreed salivating she might not be bright but she knew a good deal when she smelled it dor approached gave her a good mouthful of hay then scrambled onto her back from the uphill side is left foot dragged while his right foot dangled well above the surface of the glass but he was sitting level he leaned forward and extended his left hand to present another morsel of hay the hoofer took it and chewed blissfully wafldng forward when she finished masticaling thatdor realized he had learned a new word though he would never be able to spell ithe gave her more again lefthandedly she had to turn her head left to take it and her travel veered slightly that way uphill they continued in this manner for a full circuit of the mountain sure enough they were higher on the slope than they had been his constant presentation of hay on the upward side caused the hoofer to spiral upward that was where he wanted to go the storm was almost upon them it had not been fooled dor leaned forward squeezing with his knees and the hoofer unconsciously speeded up the second circuit of the mountain was much faster because of the accelerated pace and the narrower diameter at this elevation and the third was faster yet but doris luck already overextended was running out his supply of hay he saw would not last until the topand the rain would catch them anyway he made a bold try to turn liabilities into assets im running out of havand the storm is coming he told the hoofer youd better set me down before it gets slippery no sense having my weight burden you she hesitated thinking this through dor helped the process anywhere will do you dont have to take me all the way to the base of the mountain maybe there at the top where ill be out of your way its certainly closer that made good cowsense to her she trotted in a rapidly tightening spiral to the pinnacle unbothered by the nearly vertical slope where dor stepped off thanks hoofer he said you do have pretty eyes his experience with irene had impressed upon him the advantage of complimenting females they all were vain about their appearance pleased the hoofer began spiraling down at that point the storm struck the cloud crashed into the pinnacle the cloud substance tore asunder and water sluiced out of the rent rain pelted down convetting the glass surface instantly to something like slick ice wind buffeted him whistling past the needlepointed apex of the mountain that had wounded the cloud making dire screams doris feet slipped out and he had to fling his arms around the narrow spire to keep from sliding rapidly down the hoofer had trouble too she braced all four feetbut still skidded grandly downward until the lessening pitch of the slope enabled her to achieve stability then she ducked her head flipped her tail over her nose and went to sleep standing the storm could not really hurt her she had nowhere to go anyway she was secure as long as she never tried to face the other way he knew that when the rain abated the sidehill hoofer would be contentedly chewing her cud so dor had made it to the top conquering the last of the hurdles onlywhat was he to do now the mountain peaked smoothly and there was no entrance had he gone through all this to reach the wrong spot if so he had outsmarted himself the water sluicing from the cloud was cold his tattered clothing was soaked through and his fingers were turning numb soon he would lose his grip and slide down probably plunking all the way into the gook of the moat that was a fate almost worse than freezing there must be a way in from here he gasped of course there is dumbbell the spire replied youre not nearly as sharp as i am why else did you scheme your way up here to wash off your grimy body i trust im not being too pointed why else indeed he had just assumed this was the correct route because it was the most difficult one okay brilliant glassyour mind has more of a cutting edge than mine where is it now i dont have to tell you that the glass said chortling any idiot even one as dull as you could figure that out for himself im not just any idiot dor cried the discomfort of the rain and chill giving him a terrible temper you certainly arent youre a prize idiot thank you dor said mollified then he realized that he was being as gullible as the average inanimate furious dor bashed his forehead against the glassand something clicked oopshad he cracked his skull no he had only a mild bruise something else had made the noise he nudged the surface again and got another click oho he hit the glass a third timeand suddenly the top of the mountain sprang open a cap whose catch had been released it hung down one side on stout hinges and inside was the start of a spiral staircase victory at last thats using your head the glass remarked dor scrambled into the hole he entered headfirst then wrestled himself around to get his feet on the steps then he hauled the pointed cap of the mountain up and over at last closing off the blast of the rain cursest the cloud stormed as he shut it out he emerged into humfreys crowded study there were battered leatherbound tomes of spells magic mirrors papers and a general litter of indecipherable artifacts amidst it all allmost lost in the shufue stood good magician humfrey humfrey was small almost tiny and grossly wrinkled his head and feet were almost as large as those of a goblin and most of his hair had gone the way of his youth dor had no idea how old he was and was afraid to ask humfrey was an almost ageless institution he was the magician of information everything that needed to be known in xanth he knewand he would answer any question for the payment of one years service by the asker it was amazing how many people and creatures were not discouraged by that exorbitant fee it seemed information was the most precious thing there was about time you got here the little man grumped not even no ticing doris condition theres a problem in centaur isle youll have to attend to a new magician has developed this was news indeed new magicians appeared in xanth at the rate of about one per generation dor had been the last one born who is he what talent does he have he seems to be a centaur a centaur but most of them dont believe in magic theyre very intelligent humfrey agreed since centaurs did have magic talentsthose who admitted it there was no reason why there could not be a centaur magician dor realized but the complications were horrendous only a magician could govern xanth suppose one day there were no human magi cian only a centaur one would the human people accept a centaur king could a centaur king even govern his own kind dor doubted that cherie centaur would take orders from any magicworking cen taur she had very strict notions about obscenity and that was the ul timate you didnt tell me his talent i dont know his talent humfrey snapped ive been burning the midnight magic and cracking mirrors trying to ascertain itbut there seems to be nothing he does then how can he be a magician that is for you to find outviously the good magician was not at all pleased to admit his inabuity to ascertain the facts in this case we cant have an unidentified magiciancaliber talent running loose it might be dangerous dangerous something connected uhwould centaur isle be to the south southern tip of xanth where else would it be dor didnt want to admit that he had neglected that part of his geography cherie had made nonhuman history and social studies optional since dor was human therefore he hadnt studied them he had learned about the ogre migration only because smash had been curious his friend chet lived in a village not far north of the gap chasm in easy galloping range of castle roogna via one of the magic bridges of course dor knew that there were other colonies of centaurs they were scattered around xanth just as the human settlements were he just hadnt paid attention to the specific sites crombie the soldier pointed out the greatest threat to xanth there also a job i need to attend to and a way to get help to rescue king trent so it all seems to fit of course it fits everything in xanth makes sense for those with the wit to fathom it youre going to centaur isle why else did you come here i thought it was for advice oh that the elders facesaving device very well gather your juvenile friends youll be traveling incognito no conjuring or other royal affectations you cant roust out this hidden magician if he knows youre coming so the trip will take a week or so a week the elders wont let me be away more than a day ridiculous iley made no trouble about king trent going to mundania for a week did they because they didnt know dor said he didnt tell them of course he told them he consulted with me and for the sake of necessary privacy i agreed to consult with the elders and let him know if they raised any objectionsand they didnt but my grandfather roland says he was never told dor insisted the truth is he is somewhat annoyed i told him myself here verify it with the mirror he gestured to a magic mirror on the wall its surface was finely crazed evidently this was one of the ones that had suffered in the course of humfreys recent investigation of the centaur magician when did magician humfrey tell elder roland about king trents trip to mundania dor asked it carefally one had to specify things exactly for mirrors actual depth was much less than their apparent depth and they were not smart at all despite their ability to answer questions garbage in garbage out king trent had once remarked cryptically apparently meaning that a stupid question was likely to get a stupid answer the tail of a centaur appeared in the marred surface dor knew that meant no it says you didnt he said well maybe i forgot humfrey muttered im too busy to keep up with every triffing detail and the front of the centaur appeareda fetching young female no wonder there had been no protest from the elders humfrey distracted by other things had never gotten around to informing them king trent believing the magicians silence meant approval from the elders had departed as planned trent had not intentionally deceived them that gratified dor it had been difficult to think of the king as practicing deliberate deception trent had meant his words about honesty i believe the elders will veto my trip dor said especially after the elders can go humfrey a voice called warningly from the doorway dont you dare use such language on this day youve already cracked one mirror that way so that was how the mirror had suffered humfrey had uttered too caustic a word when balked on news of the new magician dor looked to the voice it came from the nothingness that was the face of the gorgon an absolutely voluptuous statuesque shapely and buxom figure of a lovely woman whose face no one could look at hunifrey had put a temporary spell on it ten or fifteen years ago to protect society from the gorgons involuntary magic while he worked out a better way to solve the problem it seemed he had never gotten around to that solution either he was known to be a bit absentminded humfreys brow wrinkled as if bothered by a pink mosquito whats special about this day she seemed to smile at least the little serpents that were her hair writhed in a more harmonious manner it will come to you in due course magician now you get into your suit the good one that you havent used for the past century or so make the moth unball it for you her facelessness turned to dor come with me your majesty perplexed dor followed her out of the room uh am i intruding or something she laughed sending jiggles through her flesh dor squinted to prevent his eyeballs from popping hardly you have to perform the ceremony doris bafflement intensified ceremony she turned and leaned toward him it embarrassed him to look into her empty head so he glanced downand found himself peering through the awesome crevice of her burgeoning cleavage dor closed his eyes blushing the ceremony of marriage the gorgon murmured didnt you get the word i guess not dor said a lot of words seem to get mislaid around here true true but you arrived on schedule anyway so its all right only the king of xanth can make it properly binding on that old curmudgeon it has taken me a good many years to land hitn and i mean to have that knot tied chokingly tight but ive neveri know nothing about dor opened his eyes again and goggled at the mountains and valley of her bosom and at the empty face and retreated hastily back into darkness too little and too much in such proximity do not be alarmed the gorgon said ile sight of me will not petrify you that was what she thought it occurred to him that it was not merely the gorgons face that turned a man to stone other parts of her could do it to other parts of him but he forced his eyes open and up from the fullness to the emptiness meeting her invisible gaze uh when does it happen not long after the nuptials she said it will be a matter of pride with me to handle it without recourse to any potency spell dor found himself blushing ferociously thei meant the ceremony she pinched his cheek gently with her thumb and forefinger i know you did dor you are so delightfully pristine irene will have quite a time abating your nayvet so his future too had been mapped out by a womanand it seemed all other women knew it no doubt there was a female con spiracy that continued from generation to generation he could only be thankful that irene had neither the experience nor the body of the gorgon quite yet they emerged into what appeared to be a bedroom your have to change out of those soaking things the gorgon said really you young people should be more careful were you playing tag with a bayonet plant let me just get these tatters off youj nol dor cried though he was shivering in the wet and ragged robe she laughed again her bosom vibrating i understand you are such a darling boy ill send in the zombie master you must be ready in hall an hour its all scheduled she turned and swept out leaving dor relieved bemused and guiltily disappointed a woman like that could play a man like a musical instrument in a moment the gaunt but halfviay handsome zombie master ar rived he shook hands formally with dor i win never forget what i owe you magician he said you paid off any debt when you made millie the ghost happy dor said gratified he had been instrumental in getting the zombie master here knowing millie loved him but dor himself had profited greatly from the experience he had in a very real sense learned how to be a man of course it seemed that he had forgotten much of that in the ensuing yearsthe gorgon had certainly set him in his placebut he was sure the memory would help him that debt can never be paid the zombie master said gravely dor was not inclined to argue he was glad he had helped this magician and millie to get together he remembered that he had promised to invite them both to visit castle roogna so that the ghosts and zombies could renew acquaintance uh dor began trying to figure out how to phrase the invita tion the zombie master produced an elegant suit of clothing tailored to doris size and set about getting him changed and arranged now we must review the ceremony he said he brought out a book millie and i will organize most of it we have been through this foolishness before you just read this service when i give the signal dor opened the book the title page advised hhu that this text contained a sample service for the unification of ageold magicians and voluptuous young maidens evidently the gorgon had crafted this one herself the service was plain enough doris enes were written in black the grooms in blue the brides in pink do you good magician humfrey take this lovely creature to be your bride to love and cherish as long as you shall live well it did make sense the chances of him outliving her were remote but this sort of contract made dor nervous dor looked up it seems simple enough i guess uh if we have a moment oh we have two or three moments but not four the zombie master assured him almost smiling dor broke into a full smile this magician had been cadaverously gaunt and sober when dor had first known him now he was better fleshed and better tempered marriage had evidently been good for him i promised the ghosts and zombies of castle roogna that your family would visit soon i know you dont like to mix with ordinary people too much but if you could see your way clear to the magician frowned i did profess a deep debt to you i suppose if you insist only if you want to go dor said quickly nese creaturesit wouldnt be the same if it wasnt voluntary i will consider i daresay my wife will have a sentiment on cue millie appeared she was as lovely as ever despite her eight hundred and thirtyodd years of age she was less voluptuous than the gorgon but still did have her talent dor became uncomfortable again he had once had a crush on millie of course we shall go millie said well be glad to wont we jonathan the zombie master could only acquiesce solemnly the decision had been made its time millie said the bride and groom are ready the bride perhaps the zombie master said wryly i suspect i will have to coerce the groom he turned to dor you go down to the main chamber the wedding guests are assembling now they will take their places when you appear uh sure dor agreed he took the book and made his way down a winding stair the castle layout differed from what it had been the last time he was here but that was only to be expected the outside defenses changed constantly so it made sense that the inner schematic followed but when he reached the main chamber dor stood amazed it was a grand and somber cathedral seemingly larger than the whole of the castle with stately columns andornate arches supporting the domed glass ceiling at one end was a dais whose floor appeared to be solid silver it was surrounded by huge stainedglass windows evidently another inner aspect of the exterior glass mountain a jeweled chan deher supported the sun which was a brilliantly golden ball bor rowed for this occasion dor had always wondered what happened to the sun when clouds blocked it off perhaps now he knew what would happen if they didnt finish the ceremony before the storm outside abated and the sun needed to be returned the guests were even more spectacular there were hundreds of them of all types some were human some humanoid and most were monsters dor spied a griffin a dragon a small sphinx several merfolk in a tub of sea water a manticora a number of elves gob ins harpies and sprites a score of nickelpedes a swarm of fruitflies and a needle cactus the far door was dwarfed by its guardian crunch the ogre smashs father as horrendous a figure of a monster as anyone cared to imagine what is this dor asked astonished ah the creatures who ever obtained answers from the good ma gician or interacted significantly with him during the past century the nearest window explained butbut why a grotesque bespectacled demon detached himself from conver sation with a nymph your majesty i am beauregard of the nether contingent we are assembled here in peace not because we neces sarily love the good magician but because not one of us would pass up the chance to see him finally get impressed into bondage himself and to the most fearsome creature known to magic come you must take your place and the demon guided dor down the center aisle toward the dais past as diversified an assortment of creatures as dor had ever encountered one he thought he recognizedgrundy the golem somehow spirited here for the unique occasion how had all these creatures gotten past the castle defenses no one had been around when dor himself had braved them oh you must be king dor someone cried dor turned to dis cover a handsome woman whose gown was bedecked with a fantastic array of gems you must be jewel he exclaimed as a diamond in her hair al most blinded him it was the size of his fist and cut in what seemed like a muion facets ihe one with the barrel of gemscrombies vje how did you ever guess she agreed flashing sapphires garnets and giant opals you favor your father dor so good of you to come in his stead dor remembered that this woman had loved his father perhaps that explained why bink wasnt here a meeting even after all these years could be awkward uh i guess so nice to meet you jewel im sorry my daughter tandy couldnt meet you jewel said it would be so nice she broke off and again dor suspected he understood why jewel had loved bink dor was binks son tandy was jewels daughter it was almost as if dor and tandy were related but how could that be said jewel pressed a stone into his hand i was going to give this to bink but i think you deserve it you will always have light dor glanced down at the gift it shone like a nufflature sun almost too bright to gaze at directly it was a midnight sunstone the rarest of all gems uh thanks he said lamely he didnt know how to deal with this sort of thing he tucked the gem into a pocket and rejoined beauregard who was urging him on as he reached the dais and mounted it the hubbub diminished the ceremony was incipient the music started the familiar theme played only at nuptials it gave dor stage fright he had never officiated at an affair like this before the opportunities for blundering seemed limitless the assembled creatures became absolutely quiet waiting expectantly for the dread denouement the good magician humfrey was finally going to get his there was a scuffle to the side the groom appeared in a dark suit that looked slightly motheaten perhaps the guardian moth had not balled it properly he was somewhat disheveled and obliquely compalled by the zombie master i survived it so can you the best man whispered audible throughout the chamber somewhere in the stygian depth of the audience a monster chuckled the expression on humfreys face suggested that he was in serious doubt about survival more members of the audience grinlied showing assorted canine teeth they liked this the music got louder dor glanced across and saw that the organist was a small tangle tree its tentacles writhing expertly over the keys no wonder there was a certain predatory intensity to the music the zombie master dourly handsome in his funerealtailed suit straightened humfreys details actually brushing him off with a little whisk broom then he put humfrey in a kind of armlock and marched him forward the music surged vengefully one demon in the front row twitched its tail and leaned toward another a creature doesnt know what happiness is he said until he gets married and then its too late half a dozen others responded from the next row back there was a smattering of applause magician humfrey quailed but the best mans grip was as firm as death itself at least he had not brought his zombies to this ceremonyl the presence of the walking dead would have been too much even for such a wedding now the music swelled to sublime urgency and the bridal procession appeared first came millie the ghost radiant in her maidofhonor gown her sex appeal making the monsters drool dor had somehow thought that an unmarried person was supposed to fill this office but of course millie had been unmarried for eight centuries so it must be all right then the bride herself stepped outand if the gorgon had seemed buxom before she was amazing now she wore a veil that shrouded the nothingness of her face so that there was no way to tell by looking that she was not simply a ravishingly voluptuous woman nevertheless few creatures looked directly at her wary of her inherent power not even the boldest dragon or tangle tree would care to stare the gorgon in the face behind her trooped two cherubs a tiny boy and girl dor thought at first they were elves but realized they were childrenthe threeyearold twins that millie and the zombie master had generated they certainly looked cute as they carried the trailing end of the brides long train dor wondered whether these angelic tots had manifested their magic talents yet sometimes a talent showed at birth as had doris own sometimes it never showed as had doris fatheisthough he knew his father did have some sort of magic that king trent himself respected most talents were in between showing up in the course of childhood some major some minor slowly the gorgon swept forward in the renewed hush of dread and expectation dor saw with a small start that she had donned dark glasses a mundane import so that even her eyes behind the gauzy veil seemed real now at last humfrey and the gorgon stood together she was taller than hebut everyone was taller than humfrey so it didnt matter ike music faded to the deceptive calm of the center of a storm the zombie master nodded to dor it was time for the king to read the service finally tying the knot dor opened the book with trembling fingers now he was glad that cherie centaur had drilled him well in reading he had the text to lean on so that his blank mind couldnt betray him all he had to do was read the words and follow the directions and everything would be all right he knew that good magician humfrey really did want to marry the gorgon it was just the ceremony that put him off as it did all men weddings were for women and their mothers dor would navigate this additional kingly chore and doubtless be better off for the experience but his knees still felt like limp noodles why did experience have to be so difficult he found the place and began to read we are gathered here to hogtie this poor idiot there was a stir in the audience the weeping matrons paused in midtear while males of every type smirked dor blinked had he read that right yes there it was printed quite clearly he might have trouble spelling but he could read well enough to this conniving wench the demons sniggered a snake stuck its head out over the gorgons veil and hissed something was definitely wrong but it says right here dor protested tapping the book with one forefinger the gride and broom shall there was a raucous creaking sound that cut through the chamber then the zombie masters whisk broom flew out of his pocket and hovered before dor astonished dor asked it what are you doing here im the broom it replied you invoked the gride and broom didnt you whats a gride you heard it awful noise so a gride was an awful noise doris vocabularly was expanding rapidly today that was supposed to be a bride and groom dor said get back where you belong aw i thought i was going to get married but the broom flew back to the pocket now milhe spoke lacunal she said one of the children jumped it was the little girl milhes daughter did you change the print millie demanded now dor caught on the childs talentchanging printed text no wonder the service was fouled up the zombie master grimaced kids will be kids he said dourly we should have used zombies to carry the train but millie wouldnt have it lets try it again zombies to attend the bride dor had to agree with millie pri vately the stench and rot of the grave did not belong in a ceremony like this lacuna put the text back the way it was milhe said severely aw the child said exactly the way the whisk broom had dor lifted the book but now there was an eye in the middle of the page it winked at him what now he asked eh the book asked an ear sprouted beside the eye hiatus millie snapped and the little boy jumped stop that right now aw but the eye and ear shrank and disappeared leaving the book clear now dor knew the nature and talent of the other twin he read the text carefully before reading it aloud it was titled a manual of simple burial he frowned at lacuna and the print re verted to the proper text a manual of sample wedding services this time he got most of the way through the service without dis ruption ignoring ears and noses that sprouted from unlikely surfaces at one point an entire face appeared on the sunball but no one else was looking at it so there was no disturbance do you good magician humfrey he concluded take this lus cious faceless female gorgon to be your he hesitated for the text now read ball and chain some interpolation was necessary your lawfully wedded wife to have and to hold to squeeze till sheuh in health and sickness for the few measly years you hang on before you croakuh until you both become rotten zombiesuh until death do you part he was losing track of the real text the good magician considered well there are positive and neg ative aspects the zombie master elbowed him stick to the format he mut tered humfrey looked rebellious but finally got it out i suppose so dor turned to the gorgon and do you you petrifying creature take this gnarled old gnomeuh the mischievous text had caught him again a monster in the audience guffawed take good magician humfrey i do she said dor checked his text close enough he decided uh the manacles oh nol gravely the zombie master brought forth the ring an eye opened on its edge the zombie master frowned at ifiatus and the eye disappeared he gave the ring to humfrey the gorgon lifted her fair hand a snakelet hissed hey i dont want to go on that finger the ring protested its dangerous would you rather be fed to the zombie sea serpent dor snapped at it the ring was silent humfrey fambled it onto the gorgons finger naturally he got the wrong finger but she corrected him gently dor returned to the manual i now pronounce you gnome and monstuh by the authority vested in me as king of thievesuh of xanth i now pronounce you magician and wife feeling weak with relief at having gotten this far through despite the treacherous text dor read the final words you may now miss the gride there was the awful banshee noise uh goose the tide there was a sloppy swish as of water reacting to an indignity uh the gorgon took hold of humfrey threw back her veil and kissed him soundly there was applause from the audience and a mournful hoot from the distance the sea monster was signaling its sorrow over the good magicians loss of innocence millie was furious when i catch you ie and lacity but the ettle imps were already beating a retreat the wedding party adjourned to the reception area where refreshments were served there was a scream millie looked and paled for a moment resembling her ghostly state jonathan you didnt well somebody had to serve the cake and punch the zombie master said defensively everyone else was busy and we couldnt ask the guests dor peered sure enough zombies in tuxedos and formal gowns were serving the delicacies gobbets of rot were mixing with the cake and yellowish drool was dripping in the punch the appetite of the guests seemed to be diminishing the assembled monsters noting that humfrey had not been turned to stone despite being petrified were now eager to kiss the bride they were in no hurry to raid the refreshments a long ene formed helue caught doris elbow that was very good your majesty i understand that my husband is to substitute for you during your jour ney to centaur isle he is but immediately the beauty and simplicity of it came clear hes a magician he would do just fine but i know he doesnt like to indulge in politics well since we are going there for a visit anyway to see the zom bies and ghosts its not really political dor realized that millie had really helped him out only she could have persuaded the zombie master to take the office of king even temporarily uh thanks i think the ghosts will like the twins she smiled ibe walls will have ears that was his talent they sure will lets go join the monsters she said taking his arm her touch still sent a rippling thrill through him perhaps not just because of her magic talent how is irene i understand she will one day do s with you what we women have always done with magicians did it ever occur to any of you scheming conspirators that i might have other plans dor asked nettled despite the effect she had on him perhaps he was reacting in order to counter his illicit liking for her she certainly didnt seem like eight hundred years old no that never occurred to any of us she said do you think you have a chance to escape i doubt it he said but first we have to deal with this mysteri ous magician of centaur isle and i hope king trent comes back soon i hope so too millie said and queen iris she was the one who helped bring me back to life she and your father im forever grateful to them and to you too dor for returning jonathan to me she always referred to the zombie master by his given name i was glad to do it dor said then a mishmash of creatures closed in on them and dor gave himself up to socializing perforce everyone had a word for the king dor wasnt good at this in fact he felt almost as awkward as good magician humfrey looked what was it really like getting married youll fmd out the book he still carried said chuckling evilly they had surveyed prospective routes and decided to travel down the coast of xanth doris father bink had once traveled into the south center region down to the great interior lake ogrechobee where the cursefiends eved and he recommended against that route drag ons chasms nickelpedes and other horrors abounded and there was a massive growth of brambles that made passing difficult as well as a region of magicdust that could be hazardous to ones mental health on the other hand the open sea was ettle better there the huge sea monsters ruled preying on everything available if dragons ruled the wilderness land serpents ruled the deep water where the magic ambience of xanth faded the mundane monsters commenced and these were worse yet dor knew them only through his inattentive ge ography studiestoothy alligators white sharks and blue whales he didnt want any part of those but the coastal shallows excluded the larger sea creatures and the solidland monsters chances were that with a strong youth like the ogre smash along they could move safely through this region with out raising too much commotion had that not been the case the elders would never have permitted this excursion regardless of the need as it was they insisted that dor take along some preventive magic from the royal arsenala magic sword a flying carpet and an escape hoop irene carried a selected bag of seeds that she could use to grow particular plants at needfruits nuts and vegetables for the food and watermelons and milkweed if they had no safe supply of liquid they used a magic boat that would sail itself swiftly and quietly down any channel that was deep enough yet was light enough to be portaged across sand bars the craft was indefatigable all they had to do was guide it and in one full day and night it would bring them to centaur isle this would certainly be faster and easier than walking chet whose geographic education had not been neglected had a clear notion of the coastal outline and would steer the boat past the treacherous shoals and deeps everything was as routine as the nervous elders could make it they started in midmorning from the beach nearest castle roogna that had been cleared of monsters the day was clear the sea calm here there was a brief bay between the mainland and a long chain of barrier islands the most secure of all waters theoretically this trip should not only be safe but also dull of course nothing in xanth could be taken for granted for an hour they traveled south along the bay channel dor grew tired of watching the passing islands but remained too keyed up to rest after all it was a centaur magician they were going to spy outsomething never before known in xanth unless one counted herman the hermit centaur who hadnt really been a magician just a strongly talented individual who related to the willowisps smash too was restive he was a creature of physical action and this free ride irked him dor would have challenged him to a game of tictactoe an amusement he had learned from the child of one of the soldier settlers but knew he would win every game ogres were not much on intellect grundy the golem entertained himself by chatting with passing fish and sea creatures it was amazing the gossip he came up with a sneaky sawfish was cutting in on the time of the damselfish of a hammerhead and the hammerhead was getting suspicious pretty soon he would pound the teeth out of the sawfish a sea squirt was shoring himself up with the flow from an undersea freshwater spring getting tipsy on the rare liquid a certain little oyster was getting out of bed at midnight and gambling with the sand dollars he was building up quite an alluvial deposit at the central bank of sand but when his folks found out he would be gamboling to a different tune irene meanwhile struck up a dialogue with the centaur youre so intelligent chet how is it that your magic is so well simple no one is blessed with the selection of his personal talent chet said philosophically he was lying m the middle of the boat so as to keep the center of gravity low and seemed comfortable enough we centaurs less than most since only recently has our magic been recognized my mother i know cherie thinks magic is obscene oh she is broadminded about its presence in lesser creatures like human beings irene asked dangerously no need to be sensitive about it we do not discriminate against your kind and your magic does to a considerable extent compensate how come we rule xanth then she demanded dor found himself getting interested this was better than fish gossip anyway there is some question whether humans are actually dominant in xanth chet said the dragons of the northern reaches might have a different opinion at any rate we centaurs permit you humans your foibles if you wish to point to one of your number and say that individual rules xanth we have no objection so long as that person doesnt interfere with important things whats so important you would not be in a position to understand the nuances of centaur society irene bridled oh yeah tell me a nuance im afraid that is privileged information dor knew chet was asking for trouble already stray wild seeds in irenes vicinity were popping open and sending out shoots and roots a sure sign of her ire but like many girls she concealed it well yet humans have the best magic certainlyif you value magic what would you centaurs say if my father started changing you into fruitflies fruit neat smash said overhearing lets eat dont be a dunce grundy said its two hours yet till lunch here ill start a breadfruit plant irene said you can watch it grow she picked a seed from her collection and set it in one of the earthfilled pots she had brought along grow she commanded and the seed sprouted the ogre watched its growth avidly waiting for it to mature and produce the first succulent loaf of bread ying trent would not do anything as irresponsible as that chet said picking up on the question we centaurs have generally gotten along well with him because he can destroy you youd better get along not so we centaurs are archers no one can get close enough to harm us unless we permit him we get along because we choose to irene adroitly changed the subject you never told me how you felt about your own magic an your brains but all you can do is shrink rocks well it does relate i render a stone into a calx a calx is a sman stone a pebble used for calculating such calculus can grow complex and it has important ramifications so i feel my magic talent contributes monster coming grundy announced a little fish told me there arent supposed to be monsters in these waters dor objected grundy consulted with the fish its a sea dragon it heard the commotion of our passage so its coming in to investigate the channels deep enough for it here wed better get out of the channel then dor said this is not the best place chet objected no place is best to get eaten dummy irene snapped we cant handle a water dragon well have to get out of its way shallow water is all we need there are groupies in these shallows chet said not a threat so long as we sail beyond their depth but not fun to encounter if we can get farther down before diverging but now they saw the head of the dragon to the south gliding above the water its neck cut a wake the monster was traveling fast it was far too big for them to fight smash however was game ogres were too stupid to know fear he stood making the craft rock crazily for mes to squeeze he said gesturing with his meathooks all you could do is gouge out handfuls of scales irene said meanwhile it would be chomping the rest of us you know an ogre has to have firm footing on land to tackle a dragon of any type without further argument chet swerved toward the mainland beach but almost immediately the sand began to writhe oh no dor exclaimed a sand dune has taken over that beach we cant go there agreed chet said that dune wasnt on my map it must have moved in the past few days he swerved back the other way that was the problem about xanth very little was permanent in the course of a day the validity of a given map could be compromised in a week it could be destroyed that was one reason so much of xanth remained unexplored it had been traveled but the details were not fixed the dune noting their departure reared up in a great sandy hump its most typical form had they been so foolish as to step on that beach it would have rolled right over them buried them and consumed them at leisure but now the water dragon was much closer they cut across its path uncomfortably close and approached the islands inner shore the dragon halted turning its body to pursue thembut in a moment its nether loops ran aground in the shallows and it halted jets of steam plumed from its nostrils it was frustrated a flipper slapped at the side of the boat its a groupies grundy cried knock it off smash reached out a gnarled mitt to grasp the flipper and haul the thing up in the air the creature was a fattish fish with large soft extremities thats a groupie irene asked vhats so bad about it the fish curled about got its flippers on the ogres arm and drew itself up its wide mouth touched smashs arm in a seeming kiss dont let it do that chet warned its trying to siphon out your soul the ogre understood that he flung the groupie far over the water where it landed with a splash but now several more were slapping at the boat trying to scramble inside irene shrieked just knock them away chet said they cant take your soul unless you let them but theyll keep trying ileyre coming in all over dor cried how can we get away from them chet smiled grimly we can move into the deep channel groupies are shallow creatures they dont stir deep waters but the dragons waiting there of course dragons eat groupies ibats why groupies dont venture there dragons also eat people irene protested that might be considered a disadvantage the centaur agreed if you have a better solution i am amenable to it irene opened her bag of seeds and peered in i have watercress that might help try it dor exclaimed sweeping three sets of flippers off the side of the boat theyre overwhenning usl that is the manner of the species chet agreed sweeping several more off they come not single spy but in battalions she picked out a tiny seed grow she commanded and dropped it in the water the others paused momentarily in their labors to watch how could such a little seed abate such a pressing menace almost immediately there was a kind of writhing and bubbling where the seed had disappeared tiny tendrils writhed outward like wriggling worms bubbles rose and popped effervescently cress the mass hissed as it expanded the groupies hesitated taken aback by this phenomenon then they pounced on it sucking in mouthfuls theyre eating it up dor said yes irene agreed smiling in moments the groupies began swelling up like balloons the cress had not stopped growing or gassing and was now inflating the fish soon the groupies rose out of the water impossibly distended and floated through the air the dragon snapped at those who drifted within its range good job i must admit chet said and irene flushed with satisfaction dor experienced a twinge of jealousy and a twinge of guilt for that feeling there was nothing between chet and irene of course they were of two different species not that that necessarily meant much in xanth new composites were constantly emerging and the chimera was evidently descended from three or four other species irene merely argued with chet to try to bolster her own image and was flattered when the centaur bolstered it for her and if there were something between them why should he dor care but he did care they could not return to the main channel for the dragon paced them alertly it knew it had them boxed chet steered cautiously south searching out the deepest subchannels of the bay avoiding anything suspicious but the island they were skirting was coming to an end soon they would be upon the ocean channel the water dragon had entered by how could they cross that while the dragon lurked chet halted the boat and stared ahead the dragon took a stance in midchannel due south and stared back it knew they had to pass here slowly deliberately it ran its long floppy tongue over its gleandng chops what now dor asked he was king he should be leader but his mind was blank i believe we shall have to wait until nightfall chet said but were supposed to make the trip in a day and nightl irene protested thatll waste half the day better waste time than iffe greermose grundy remarked listen stringbrain she retorted these two had never gotten along well together wed better wait dor said reluctantly then we can sneak by the dragon while its sleeping and be safely on our way how soundly do dragons sleep irene asked suspiciously not deeply chet said they merely snooze with their nostrils just above the water but it will be better if there is fog much better irene agreed weakly meanwhile we would do well to sleep in the daytime chet said we will need to post one of our number as a guard to be sure the boat doesnt drift he can sleep at night while the others are active what do you mean he irene demanded theres too much sexism in xanth you think a girl cant guard chet shrugged with his foresection and flicked his handsome tail about negligently i spoke generically of course there is no sexual discrimination among centaurs thats what you think grundy put in whos the boss in your familychester or cherie does she let him do anything he wants well my mother is strongwilled chet admitted ill bet the fillies run the whole show at centaur isle grundy said same as they do at castle roogna ha ha ha irene said pouting you may guard if you wish chet said you think i wont well i will give me that paddle she grabbed the emergency paddle which would now be needed to keep the boat from drifting the others settled down comfortably using pads and buoyant cushions chets equine portion was admirably suited for lying down but his human portion was more awkward he leaned against the side of the boat head against looped arms sayhow will i sleep when were nudging past that dragon irene asked my sleeping turn will come then there was a stiffed chuckle from grundys direction guess one sexist brought that on herself just dont snore too loud when were passing under its tail might scare it into she hurled a cushion at the golem then settled resolutely into her pard position watching the dragon dor tried to sleep but found himself too wound up after a while he sat upright its no use maybe ill sleep tomorrow he said irene was pleased to have his company she sat crosslegged oppo site him and dor tried not to be aware that in that position her green skirt did not fully cover her legs she had excellent ones in that lim ited respect she had already matched the gorgon dor liked legs in fact he liked anything he wasnt supposed to see she sprouted a buttercup plant while dor plucked a loaf from the breadfruit and they feasted on fresh bread and butter in silence the dragon watched and finally mischievously dor rolled some bread into a compact wad and threw it at the monster the dragon caught it neatly and gulped it down maybe it wasnt such a bad monster maybe grundy could talk to it and arrange for safe passage nosuch a predator could not be trusted if the dragon wanted to let them pass it would go away better strategy would be to keep it awake and alert ab day so that it would be tired at night do you think this new centaur magician will try to take over xanth irene asked quietly when it seemed the others were asleep dor could appreciate her concern chet who was a friend was ar rogant enough about centaurhuman relations what would be the at titude of a grown centaur with the power of a magician of course the magician would not be grown right now it must be newbirthed but in time it could become adult and then it could be an ornery creature like chets sire chester but without chesters redeeming qualities dor knew that some centaurs did not like human beings those tended to stay well clear of castle roogna but centaur isle was well clear and that was where this menace was were on our way to investigate this matter he reminded her there is help for king trent there too according to crombies pointing maybe we just need to figure out how to turn this situation positive instead of negative she shifted her position slightly unconsciously showing a little more of her legs including a tantahzing flash of inner thigh you are going to try to help my father arent you of course im going to try dor said indignantly hoping that if there was any flush on his face she would assume it was because of his reaction to her words rather than her flesh dor had in the past seen some quite lovely nymphs in quite scanty attirebut nymphs didnt really count they were all well formed and scantily attired so were not remarkable irene was a real girl and that type ranged from lovely to uglyin fact his mother chameleon covered that range m the course of each monthand irene did not normally display a great deal of her body at a time thus each glimpse beyond a certain peremeter was special but more special when the display was unintentional i know if my father doesnt come back youll stay king im not ready to stay king in twenty years maybe ill be able to handle it right now i just want king trent back hes your father i think hes my friend what about my mother dor grimaced even queen iris he said id rather face a lifelike illusion of a dragon than the real thing you know i never had any real privacy till she left irene said she was always watching me always telling on me i hardly dared even to think for myself because i was afraid shed slip one of her illusions into my mind and snitch on me i used to wish something would happen to hernot anything bad just something to get her out of my hair for a while only now that it has you didnt really want her gone dor said not like this not like this she agreed shes a bitch but she is my mother now i can do anything i wantand i dont know what i want she shifted position again this time the hem of her skirt dropped to cover more of her legs it was almost as if her reference to pnvacy from her mothers snooping around her mind had brought about pnvacy from doris surreptitious snooping around her body except to have them back again dor found he liked irene much better this way perhaps her prior sharpness of tongue back when her parents had been in xanth had been because of that constant feeling of being watched anything real might have been demeaned or ridiculed so she never expressed anything real you know ive had the opposite problem i have privacy but no one around me does because theres not much anybody does that i cant find out about all i have to do is ask their furniture or their clothing so thy avoid me and i cant blame them thats why ive found it easier to have friends like smash he wears nothing but his hair and he thinks hmture is for bonfires and he has no embarrassing secrets anyway thats right she said i have no more privacy with you than i do with my mother how come i dont feel threatened with you because im harmless dor said with a wry chuckle not by choice its just the way i am the gorgon says you have me all wrapped up anyway she smileda genuine warm smile he liked a lot she snatched she would she naturally sees all men as creatures to be dazzled and petrified good magician humfrey never had a chance but i dont know if i even want you that way i mean my mother figures ive got to marry you so i can be queenbut thats her desire not neces sarily mine i mean why would i want to grow up just like her with no real power and a lot of time on my hands why make my own daughter as miserable as she made me maybe you will have a son dor offered this was an intriguing new avenue of exploration youre right youre harmless you dont know a thing she finished her bread and tossed the crumbs on the water they floated about forming evanescent picture patterns before drifting away somehow the afternoon had passed the sun was dropping into the water beyond the barrier island there was a distant sizzle as it touched the liquid and a cloud of steam then it was extinguished the others woke and ate then chet guided the boat to the island shore anything dangerous to people here dor asked it only boredom the island replied nothing interesting ever happens here except maybe a seasonal storm or two that was what they wanted a dull locale they took turns leaving the boat in order to attend to sanitary needs irene also took time to grow a forgetme flower as the darkness closed dor reviewed the situation were going to sneak by that dragon in the night irene will harvest some for getme flowers to discourage memory of our passage that way the re actions of fish in the area will not betray us but that wont help us if the dragon sees us or hears us or smells us directly we dont have any sight or soundblanking plants we didnt anticipate this particu lar squeeze so we must go extremely carefully i wish i were string and clay again grundy said then i couldnt be killed now we do have some other resources dor said the magic sword will make any person expert the moment he takes it in hir hand it wont help much against a pouncing dragon but any lesser creature will be balked if we get in serious trouble we can climb through the escape hoop the problem with that is that it leads to the permanent storage vat of the brain coral deep under the earth and the coral doesnt like to release creatures it happens to be my friend but id rather not strain that friendship unless absolutely necessary and there is the flying carpetbut that can only take one person at a time plus grundy i think it could support smash but not chet so thats not ideal i wouldnt fit through the hoop either chet said yes so you chet are the most vulnerable one in this situation because of your mass so we need to plan for another defense dor paused for irene was looking at him strangely whats the matter youre glowing she said startled dor checked himself light was streaming from one of his pockets ohthats the midnight sunstone jewel gave me so ill always have light i had forgotten about it we dont want light at the moment she pointed out wrap it up she handed him a piece of cloth dor wrapped the gem carefully until its glow was so muted as to be inconsequential and put it back in his pocket now he continued irene has some seeds that will grow devastating plantsshe really is magician level regardless of what the elders saybut most of those plants would be as dangerous to us as to the enemy wed have to plant and run any that would block off the water so the dragon couldnt pursue chet asked oh yes irene said glowing at doris compliment about her talent the kraken weed i see what dor means the centaur said quickly i dont want to be swimming in the same ocean with a kraken or i could start a stunflower on the island here but it would be likely to stun us too she considered aha i do have some popcorn thats harmless but it makes an awful racket that might distract the dragon for a while grow me some of that chet said ill throw it behind me if i have to swim only one problem she said i cant grow that at night its a dayplant i could unwrap the sunstone dor offered thats too small i think wed need a lot of light radiating all about not gleaming from tiny facets what can you grow naturally at night chet asked gdmly well hypnogourds do well they generate their own light inside but you wouldnt want to look in the peephole because because id be instantly hypnotized chet fifthed grow me one anyway it might help as you wish she agreed dubiously she leaned over the side of the boat to drop a seed on the shore grow she murmured now if there is trouble dor said you irene get on the flying carpet you can drop a kraken seed near the dragon while the rest of us use the hoop or swim for it but well do our best to escape the notice of the dragon then we can proceed south without further trouble there was no objection they waited until the hypnogourd had fruited producing one fine specimen chet wrapped it in cloth and tucked it in the boat the craft started moving nudging silently south toward the channel while the occupants hardly dared breathe chet guided it in an eastward curve to intersect the main channel first so that he could avoid the monster that was presumably waiting due south in this silent darkness they could not see it any more than it could see them but the dragon had outsmarted them it had placed a sunfish in this channel that operated on a similar principle to the sunstone but it was thousands of times as large when they came near the fish suddenly glowed like the sun itself blindingly the rounded fin projected above the surface of the water and its light turned night to day oh no dor cried he had so carefully wrapped his sunstoneand now this was infinitely worse there was a gleeful honk from the dragon they saw its eyes glowing as it forged toward them water dragons did not have internal fire the eyes were merely reflecting the blaze of the sunfish plant the kraken dor cried no chet countered we can make it to the mainland shallows sure enough the boat glided smoothly across the channel before the dragon arrived the monster was silhouetted before the sunfish wrathing in frustration it had planned so well and just missed victory it honked curses grundy translated foiled againl what about the sand dune irene asked worriedly they are usually quiescent by night chet said but this isnt night any more she reminded him her voice taking on a pink tinge of hysteria indeed the dark mound was rippling sending a strand of itself toward the water the sand had enough mass and the water was so shallow that it was possible for the dune to fill it in the ravenous shoreline was coming toward them if we retreat from the dune well come within reach of the dragon chet said feed goon to dune smash suggested goon do you mean the dragon dor asked the ogre nodded say yes irene said talk to the dune dor tell it well lure the dragon within its range if it lets us go dor considered i dont know id hate to send any creature to such a fateand im not sure the dune can be trusted well string it out as long as you can once the dune tackles the dragon it wont have time to worry about small fry like us dor eyed the surging dune on one side the chopslurping dragon on the other and noted how the region between them was diminishing try reasoning with the dragon first he told grundy the golem emitted a series of honks grunts whistles and toothgnashings it was amazing how versatile he was with soundsbut of course this was his magic in a moment the dragon lunged forward trying to catch the entire boat in its huge jaws but falling short the water washed up in a small tsunami i asked it if it wouldnt like to let a nice group of people on the kings business like us go on in peace grundy said it replied we can see what it replied dor said very well well go the other route he faced the shore and called hey dune thus hailed the dune was touched by doris magic you calling me tidbit i want to make a deal with you ha youre going to be consumed anyway what kind of deal can you offer this whole boatload is a small morsel for the likes of you but we might arrange for you to get a real meal if you let us go in peace i dont eat really the dune said i preserve i clean and secure the bones of assorted creatures so that they can be admired millennia hence my treasures are called fossus so this monster like so many of its ilk thought itself a benefactor to xanth was there any creature or thing no matter how awful that didnt rationalize its existence and actions in similar fashion but dor wasnt here to argue with it wouldnt you rather fossilize a dragon than a sniveling little collection of scraps like us oh i dont know snivelers are common but so are dragons size is not as important for the fossil record as quality and completeness well do you have a water dragon in your record yet no most of them fall to my cousin the deepsea muck just as most birds are harvested by my other cousin the tarpit i would dearly like to have a specimen like that we offer you that water dragon there dor said ah you need to do is make a channel deep enough for the dragon to pass then well lure it inand then you can close the channel and secure your specimen for fossilization say that would work the dune agreed its a deal start your channel then well sail down it first leading the dragon make sure you let us go though sure you go the dragon stays i dont trust this irene muttered neither do i dor agreed but were in a bind chet can you apply your calculus the smallest of stones can be considered calculi chet said that is to say sarid now sand has certain properties he trailed off then brightened you have seagrass seed he asked irene lots of it but i dont see how then her eyes glowed oh i do seel yes ill be ready chet the sand began to hump itself into twin mounds opening a narrow channel of water between them chet guided the boat directly down that channel the dragon perceiving their seeming escape honked wrathfully and gnashed its teeth express hope the dragon doesnt realize how deep this channel is dor told grundy in dragon talk grundy smued grimly i know my business he emitted dragon noises immediately the dragon explored the end of the channel plunging its head into it with a glad honk it writhed on into the inviting passage soon the dragon was close on their wake its entire body was now within the separation in the dune nowclose it upl dor cried to the dune the dune did so suddenly the channel was narrowing and disappearing as sand heaped into it too late the dragon realized its peril it tried to turn to retreat but the way out was blocked it honked and thrashed but was in deep trouble in shallow water however the channel ahead of the boat was also filling in hey let us out dor cried why should i let perfectly good fossil material go the dune asked reasonably this way ive got both you and the dragon its the haul of the century but you promised dor said plaintively we made a deal promises and deals arent worth the breath it takes to utter them and i dont even breathe i knew it chet said betrayal do your stuff irene dor said irene brought out two handfuls of seeds grow she yelled seatteting them widely on either side the grass sprouted rapidly sending its deep roots into the sand grabbing holding hey the dune yelled much as dor had as it tripped over itself where the grass anchored it you reneged on our agreement dor called back now you pay the penalty for the sand in this region was no longer able to move the grass had converted it to ordinary ground enraged the dune made one final effort it humped up hoffendously in the region beyond the growing grass then rolled forward with such impetus that it spilled into the channel filling it its swamping the boat dor cried abandon ship some gratitude the boat complained i carry you loyally all over xanth risking my keel and the moment things get rough you abandon mel the boat had a case but they couldnt afford to argue it heedless of its objection they all piled out as the sand piled in they ran across the remaining section of grassanchorage while the boat disappeared into the dune the sand was unable to follow them here its mint had been reached and already the blades of grass were creeping up through the new mound nailing it down the main body of the dune had to retreat and concentrate on the thrashing dragon that bid fair to escape by coiling out of the vanished channel and wrathing back toward the sea the party stood at the edge of the bay we lost our boat irene said and the flying carpet and escape hoop and food and my bow and arrows chet said mournfully ah i salvaged was the gourd we played it too close those monsters are stronger and smarter than we thought we learn from experience dor was silent he was the nominal leader of this party the responsibility was his if he could not manage a single trip south without disaster how could he hope to handle the situation when he got to centaur isle how could he handle the job of being king if it came to that but they couldnt remain here long whether in thought or in despair already the natives of the region were becoming aware of them camivorous grass picked up where the freshly planted sea grass left off and the former was sending its hungry shoots toward them vines trembled bright droplets of sapsaliva oozing from their surfaces there was a buzzing of wings something airborne would soon show up but now at last the sunfish dimmed out and night returned the day creatures retreated in confusion and the night creatures stirred if theres one thing worse than day in the wilderness irene said shivering its night what do we do now dor wished he had an answer your plants have saved us once chet told her do you have another plant that could protect us or transport us let me see in the dark she put her hand in her bag of seeds and felt around mostly food plants and special effects a beerbarrel treehow did that get in here water locust bulrush bulrushest chet said arent those the tieds that are always in a hurry they rush everywhere she agreed suppose we wove them into a boat or raftcould we control its motion yes i suppose if you put a ring in the crafts nose but lets do it the centaur said anything will be better than waiting here for whatever is creeping up on us ill start the buhushes growing she agreed we can weave them before theyre mature but youll have to find a ring before we can fidsh dor and grundyplease question your contacts and see if you can locate a ring the centuar said bey started in dor questioning the nonhving grundy the living neither could find a ring in the vicinity the weaving of the growing bulrushes proceeded apace it seemed chet and irene were familiar with the technique and worked well together but already the rushes were thrashing about trying to free themselves to travel the mass of the matraft was burgeoning soon it would be too strong to restrain bring ring smash said were trying to dor snapped clinging to a corner of the strug gling mat be thing was hideously strong germ worm the ogre said insistently his huge hairy paw pushed something at dor the object seemed to be a loop of fur a loop a ring dor claimed where did you get it me grow on toe smash explained which itch you grew the ring on your toeand it itched dor was having trouble assimilating this let me check grundy said he made a funny sizzle talking with something then laughed you know what that is a ring worm a ringworm dor cried in dismay dropping the hideous thing if its a ring we need it chet said before this mat gets away chagrined dor felt on the ground and picked up the ringworm he passed it gingerly to the centaur here chet wove it into the nose of the craft then jerked several long hairs from his beautiful tail and twined them into a string that he passed through the ring suddenly the bulrush craft settled down the nose is sensitive chet explained ibe ring makes it hurt when jerked so even this powerful entity can be controlled some come smash warned rather than wait to discover what it was that could make an ogre nervous the others hastened to lead the nowdocile bulrush boat to the water once it was floating they boarded carefully and pushed off from the shore the craft was not watertight but the individual rushes were buoyant so the whole business floated something growled in the dark on the shorea deep low throb bing powerful and ugly sound then frustrated it moved away the ground shuddering a blast of odor passed them dank and choking no one inquired what it might be now chet gave the bulrushes some play the raft surged forward churning up a faintly phosphorescent wake wind rushed past their faces can you see where were going irene asked her voice thin no chet said but the bulrushes travel best in open water they wont run aground or crash into any monsters you trust them more than i do she said and i grew them elementary calculation of vegetable nature the centaur said may i lean against your side she asked i didnt sleep today and your coat is so soft go ahead chet said graciously he was lying down again as the woven fabric of the raft could not support his weight afoot the rushes had swelled in the water and dor had succeeded in bailing it out they were no longer sitting in sea water dor had not slept eitheir but he didnt feel like leaning against chets furry side the stars moved by dor lay on his back and determined the direction of travel of the raft by the stars apparent travel it wasnt even the bulrushes were maneuvering to find the course along which they could rush most freely they did seem to know where they were going and that sufficed for now gradually the constellations appeared patterns in the sky formations of stars that shifted from randomness to the suggestion of significance there seemed to be pictures shaping representations of creatures and objects and notions some resembled faces he thought he saw king trent peering down at him giving him a straight intelligent look where are you now dor asked wordlessly the face frowned i am being held captive in a medieval mundane caytle it said i have no magic power here you must bring me magic but i cant do thatl dor protested magic isnt something a person can carry especially not into mundanial you must use the aisle to rescue me what aisle dor asked excited the centaur aisle trent answered then a wait of ocean spray struck doris face and he woke the stellar face was gone it had been a dream yet the message remained with him center isle his spelling disability made him uncertain now of the meaning how could he use an island to seek king trent the center of what if it was centaur did that mean chet had something essential to do with it if it was an aisle an aisle between what and what if this were really a message a prophecy how could he apply it if it were merely a random dream or vision a construct of his overtired and meandering nind he should ignore it but such things were seldom random in xanth troubled dor drifted to sleep again what he had experienced could not have been a nightmare for it hadnt scared him and of course the mares could not run across the water maybe it would return and clarify itsell but the dream did not repeat and he could not evoke it by looking at the stars clouds had sifted across the night sky dor woke again as dawn came the sun had somehow gotten around to the east where the land was and dried off so that it could shine again dor wondered what perilous route it employed maybe it had a tunnel to roll along if it ever figured out a way to get down without taking a dunking in the ocean it would really have it made maybe he should suggest that to it sometime after all some mornings the sun was up several hours before drying out enough to shine with full brilliance obviously some nights were worse than others but he would not make the suggestion right now he didnt want the sun heading off to explore new routes leaving xanth dark for days at a time dor needed the fight to see his way to centaur isle jewels midnight sunstone was not enough centaur islewas that where he was supposed to find king trent no the centaurs wouldnt imprison the king and anyway trent was in mundania but maybe something at centaur isle related if only he could figure out howl dor sat up where are we now chet he inquired there was no answer the centaur had fallen asleep too irene in repose against his side smash and grandy snored at the rear of the raft everyone had slept no one was guiding the craft or watching the course the bulrushes had rushed wherever they wanted to go which could be anywhere the raft was in the middle of the ocean bare sea lay on all sides it was sheer luck that no sea monster had spied them and gobbled them down while they slept in fact there was one now but as the monster forged hungrily toward the craft dor saw that the velocity of the rushes was such that the serpent could not overtake the craft they were safe because of their speed since they were heading south they should be near centaur isle now no that did not necessarily follow dor had done better in cheries logic classes than in spelling he always looked for altematives to the obvious the craft could have been doing loops all night or traveling north and then turned south coincidentally as dawn came they could be anywhere at all where are we dor asked the nearest water longitude latitude or vise versa the water said i always confuse parallels with meridians that doesnt tell me anything dor snapped it tells me though chet said waking we are well out to sea but also well on the way to our destination we should be there toitight but suppose a monster catches us way out here in the sea irene asked also waking id rather be near land chet shrugged we can veer in to land meanwhile why dont you grow us some food and freshwater plants so we can eat and drink and a parasol plant to shield us from the sun she said and a privacy hedge for youknow she got on it soon they were drinking scented water from a pitcher plant and eating bunlike masses from puffball plants the new hedge closed off the rear of the craft where the expended pitchers were used for another purpose several parasols shaded them nicely it was all becoming quite comfortable the bulrush craft responsive to chets tug on the string tied to the ring in its nose veered toward the east where the distant land was supposed to be smash the ogre sniffed the air and peered about then he pointed me see the form of a mean ol storm be announced oh no dor spied the roiling clouds coming up over the southern horizon smashs keen ogre senses had detected it first but in moments it was all too readily apparent to them all were in trouble grundy said ill see what i can do what can you do irene asked witheringly are you going to wave your tiny ettle dumb hand and conjure us all instantly to safety grundy ignored her he spoke to the ocean in whatever language its creatures used in a moment he said i think i have it the fish are taking word to an eclectic eel a what irene demanded do you mean one of those shocldng creatures an eclectic eel dummy it chooses things from all over it does nothing original it puts it all together in bits and pieces that others have made how can something like that possibly help us better ask it why it will help us all right woodenhead why because i promised it half your seeds half my seeds she exploded you cant do that if i dont the storm will send us all to the depths hes right irene chet said were over a barrel figuratively speaking ill put the confounded golem in a barrel and glue the cork in she cried a barrel of whitehot sneezepepper he has no right to promise my property okay grundy said tell the eel no give it a shock a narrow snout poked out of the roughening water a cold gust of wind ruffled irenes hair and flattened her clothing against her body making her look extraordinarily pretty the sky darkened it says figuratively speaking your figure isnt bad grundy reported with a smirk this incongruous compliment put her off her pace it was hard to tell off someone who made a remark like that oh all right she said sulking hoff the seeds but i choose which half well toss them in stupid grundy said clinging to the side of the craft as it pitched in the swells but theyll sprout thats the idea make them all grow use your magic the eclectic eel demands payment in advance irene looked rebellious but the first drop of rain struck her on the nose and she decided to carry through this will come out of your string hide golem she muttered she tossed the seeds into the heaving water one by one invoking each in turn grow like a golems ego grow like grundys swelled head grow like the vengeance i owe the twerp strange things developed in the water pinkleaved turnips sprouted fuming in place and tan tomatoes and yellow cabbages and blue beets snap beans snapped merrily and artichokes choked then the flowers started as she came to another section of her supply white blossoms sprang up in great clusters decorating the entire ocean near the raft then they moved away in herds making faint baaaaaas whats that grundy asked phlox ninny irene said oh flocks dor thought of course the white sheep of flowers firecracker flowers popped redly tiger lilies snarled honeybells tinkled and bleeding hearts stained the water with their sad life essence irises that irenes mother had given her flowered prettily in blue and purple gladiolas stretched up happily begonias bloomed and departed even before they could be ordered to begone periwinkles opened their orbs to wink crocuses parted their white lips to utter scandalous imprecations grundy leaned over the edge of the raft to sniff some pretty multicolored little flowers that were vining upward then something happened hey he cried suddenly outraged wiping golden moisture off his head what did they do that for irene glanced across dummy she said with satisfaction what do you expect sweet peas to do you better stay away from the pansies on doris side there was an especially rapid development the red orange and white flowers bursting forth almost before the buds formed my these are in a hurry he commented theyre impatiens irene explained the display finished off with a dazzling emergence of golden balls marigolds thats half take it or leave it irene said the eel takes it grundy said still shaking pea out of his hair now the eclectic eel will lead us through the storm to shore in its fashion about time chet said everyone hang on we have a rough sail coming the eel wriggled forward the craft followed the storm struck with its moist fury what do you have against us dor asked it as the wind tore at his body nothing personal it blew back its my job to clear the seas of riffraff cant have flotsam and jetsam cluttering up the surface after all i dont know those people dor said the raft was rocking and twisting as it followed the elusive eet but they were somehow avoiding the worst of the violence a piece of planking floated by im flotsam it said rm part of the ship that wrecked here last month still floating a barrel floated by on the other side the battered trunk of a harvested jellybaffel tree im jetsam it blew from its hung i was thrown overboard to lighten the ship nice to know you both dor said politely the eel uses them for markers grundy said it uses anything it finds wheres the riffraff irene asked if the storm is here to clear it from the seas there should be some to clear im the raf the raft explained you must be the rff and it chuckled now the rain pelted down fullstrefigth all of them were soaked in an instant bail bail chet screamed thinly through the wind dor grabbed his bucketactually it was a bouquet irene had grown which his spelling had fouled up so that its nature had completely changedand scooped out water smash the ogre worked similarly on the other side using a pitcher by dint of colossal effort they managed to stay marginally ahead of the rain that poured in get low grundy cried through the weather dont let her rol over shes not rolling irene said a raft cant then the craft pitched horribly and started to turn over irene threw herself flat in the bottom of the center depression joining dor and smash the raft listed sickeningly to right then to left first throwing irene bodily into dor then hurling him into her she was marvelously soft what are you doing dor cried as his wind was allmost knocked from him despite his soft landings m yawing the raft said seems more like a roll to me chet grumbled from the rear irene fetched up against dor again hip to hip and nose to nose dear weve got to stop meeting this way she gasped attempting to smile in other circumstances dor would have appreciated the meetings more irene was padded in appropriate places so that the shocks of contact were pleasantly cushioned but at the moment he was afraid for his life and hers meanwhile she looked as if she were getting seasick the craft lurched forward and down as if sliding over a waterfall doris own gorge rose now what are you doing he heaved im pitching the raft responded were out of the waterl chet cried his head remained higher despite his prone position theres something beneath us thats why were rolling so much thats the behemoth grandy said the what dor asked the behemoth a huge wallowing creature that floats about doing nothing the eclectic eel led us up to it to help weather the storm irene unglued herself from dor and all of them crawled cautiously up and looked over the edge of the raft the storm continued but now it beat on the glistening blubbery back of the tremendous animal the crafts perch seemed insecure because of the way it rolled and slid on the slick surface but the enormous bulk of the monster provided security from the heaving ocean but i thought behemoths were freshwater creatures dor said my father encountered one below lake ogrechobee he said of course he did i was there grundy said superciliously behemoths are where you find them theyre too big to worry about what kind of water it is the eel just happened to find this creature and led us to it chet asked he also looked somewhat seasick thats the eclectic way grundy agreed to use anything handy aw you cheated the storm howled i cant sink that tub a whirling eye focused on dor thats twice you have escaped me manthing but we shall meet again disgruntled it blew itself away to the west so that had been the same storm he had encountered at good magician humfreys castle it certainly traveled about the behemoth discovering that its pleasant shower had abated exhaled a dusty cloud of gas and descended to the depths there was no point in staying on the surface when the storm didnt want to play any more the raft was left floating in a calming sea now that he was no longer in danger of drowning dor almost regretted the passing of the storm irene was a good deal more comfortable to brace against than the reeds of the raft but he mew he was foolish always to be most interested in what he couldnt have instead of being satisfied with what he did have a monster showed on the horizon get this thing movingl irene cried alarmed we arent out of the weather yetl follow the eel grundy warned but the eels headed straight for the monster chet protested that must be the way then but even grundy looked doubtful they forged toward the monster it was revealed now as extremely long and flat as if a sea serpent had been squeezed under a rolling boulder what is it dor asked amazed a ribbonfish dolt grundy said how can that help us for the storm had taken up more of the day than it had seemed to the sun was now at zenith and they remained far from shore all i know is the eel agreed to get us to land by nightfall grundy said they forged on but now the pace was slowing the bulrushes were losing their power dor realized that some of the material of the boat was dead now that was why it had been able to speak to him since his power related only to the inanimate soon the rushes would become inert stranding the craft in midsea they had no paddle that had been lost with the first boat the ribbonfish brought its preposterously flat head down as the bulrush craft sputtered close then the head dipped into the water and slid beneath them in a moment it emerged behind them and the neck came up under the boat heaving it right out of the water oh no irene screamed as they were carried high into the air she flung her arms about dor in terror again he wished this could have happened when he wasnt terrified himself but the body of the ribbonfish was slightly concave the raft remained centered not falling off as the head elevated to an appalling height the boat began to slide down along the body which was slick with moisture they watched horrified as the craft tilted forward then accelerated down the creatures neck irene screamed again and clung smotheringly to dor as their bodies turned weightless down they zoomed but the ribbonfish was undulating so that a new hump kept fomng just behind them while a new dip formed ahead of them they zoomed at frightening velocity along the creature never getting down to the water were traveling toward land dor said awed the monstees moving us therel thats how it gets its jollies grundy said scooping up things and sliding them along its length the eel just made use of this for our benefit perceiving that they were not after all in danger irene regained confidence let go of me she snapped at dor as if he had been the one doing the grabbing the ribbonfish seemed interminably long the raft slid and shd then dor realized that the monsters head had looked down under the water and come up to follow its tail the creature was running them through again the land was coming closer at last the land arrived the ribbonfish tired of the game and dumped them off with a jarring splash the rushes had just enough power left to propel them to the beach then they expired and the raft began to sink the sun was well down toward the horizon racing to cut off their day before they could travel anywhere further soon the golden orb would be quenched again from here we go by foot i think chet remarked we will not achieve centaur isle this day we can get closer though dor said ive had enough of boats for now anyway the others agreed first they paused to forage for some food wild fruitcakes were ripe and a water chestnut provided potable water irene did not have to expend any of her diminished store of seeds in fact she found a few new ones here suddenly something jumped from behind a tree and charged directly at dor he whipped out his magic sword without thinkingand the creature stopped short spun about and ran away it was all hair and legs and glower what was that dor asked shaldng thats a jumpatabody the nearest stone said whats a jumpatabody irene asked i dont have to answer you the stone retorted you cant take me for granite answer her dor told it aw okay its what you just saw thats not much help irene said you arent much yourself doll it said ive seen a better complexion on mottled serpentine bedraggled and disheveled from the ocean run irene was hardly at her best but her vanity had been pricked i can choke you with weeds mineral yeah greenie just try it weedsgrow she directed pointing to the rock immediately the weeds around it sprouted vigorously weeds the best that ever was the weeds exclaimed startled dor looked closely for his talent did not extend to living things he found that some sand caught in the plants had actually done the talking oh for schist sake the rock said shes doing it tell me what a jumpatabody is irene insisted the rock was almost hidden by vegetation all right all right doll just clear these junky plants out of my face stop growing irene told the weeds and they stopped with a frustrated rustle she tramped them down around the rock you do have pretty legs the rock said and thats not all irene straddling the rock leaped away just answer my question they just jump out and scare people and run away the rock said theyre harmless they came across from mundania not long ago when the mundanes stopped believing in them and dont have the courage to do anything bad ibank you irene said gratified by her victory over the ornery stone i think the grass needs more tramping down the rock suggested not while im wearing a skirt a they finished their repast and trekked on south very little remained of the day but they wanted to find a decent place to camp for the night dor questioned other rocks to make sure nothing dangerous remained in the vicinity this did seem to be a safe island perhaps their luck had turned and they would reach their destination without further ill event but as dusk closed they came to the southern border of the island there was a narrow channel separating it from the next island in the chain maybe wed better camp here for the night dor said this island seems safe we dont know whats on the next one also im tired irene said they settled in for the night protected by a pahsade formed of asparagus spears grown for the occasion the jumpatabocues kept charging the stockade and fleeing it harmlessly chet and smash being the most massive individuals lay at the outside edges of the small enclosure grundy needed so little room he didnt matter dor and irene were squeezed into the center but now she had room enough and time to settle herself without quite touching him ah well you know that rock was right dor said you do have nice legs and thats not all go to sleep she said not displeased in the morning a large roundish object floated in the channel dor didnt like the look of it they would have to swim past it to reach the next island is it animal or plant he asked no plant irene said she had a feel for this sort of thing since it related to her magic ill talk to it grundy said his talent applied to anything living he made a complex series of whistles and almost inaudible grunts much of his communication was opaque to others since some animals and most plants used inhuman mechanisms in a moment he announced its a sea nettle a plantlike animal this channel is its territory and it will sting to death anyone who intrudes how fast can it swim irene asked fast enough grundy said it doesnt look like much but it can certainly perform we could separate crossing in two parties that way it could only get half of us maybe perhaps you had better leave the thinking to those better equipped for it chet said we have to get it out of there or nullify it dor said ill try to lead it away using my talent meanwhile ill start my stunflower irene said thanks for the vote of confidence but dor couldnt blame her he had had success before in tricking monsters with his talent but it depended on the nature and intelligence of the monster he hadnt tried it on the water dragon knowing that effort would be wasted this sea nettle was a largely unknown quantity it certainly didnt look smart he concentrated on the water near the nettle can you do imitations he asked it the inanimate often thought it had talent of this nature and the less talent it had the more vain it was about it once years ago he had caused water to imitate his own voice leading a triton a merry chase no the water said oh well repeat after me sea nettle you are a big blob of blubber huh the water asked he would have to encounter a stupid quantity of water some water was volatile in its wit with cleverness flowing freely some just lay there in puddles blob of blubber he repeated youre anotherl the water retorted now say it to the sea nettle youre another the water said to the sea nettle the others of doris party smiled irenes plant was growing nicely no dor snapped his temper shortening blob of blubber no blob of blubber the water snapped the sea nettles spines wiggled it says thank you grundy reported this was hopeless in bad temper dor desisted the flower is almost ready irene said its a bit like the gorgon it cant stun you if you dont look at it so wed better an line up with our backs to itand dont look back therell be no returning this way once a plant like this matures i cant stop it they lined up dor heard the rustle of rapidly expanding leaves behind him this was nervous business its blossoming grundy said its beginning to feel its power oh its a bad one sure its a bad one irene agreed i picked the best seed start wading into the channel the flower wig strike before we reach the sea nettle and we want the nettles attention directed this way they waded out dor suddenly realized how constrictive his clothing would be in the water he didnt want anything hampering him as he swam by the nettle he started removing his apparel irene apparently struck by the same thought quickly pulled off her skirt and blouse does right grundy remarked he was riding chets back you do have nice legs and thats not all if your gaze should stray too far from forward irene sdd evenly it could encounter the ambience of the stunflower gruntlys gaze snapped forward so did chets smashs and doris but dor was sure there was a grim smirk on irenes face at times she was very like her mother hey the flowers bursting loosel grundy cried i can tell by what it says it has a bold selfimage what a head on that thingl indeed dor could feel a kind of heat on his bare back the power of the flower was now being exerted but the sea nettle seemed unaffected it quivered moving toward them its headpart was gilled like a toadstool all around driblets of drool formed on its surface the nettle says it will sting us all so hardoooh thats obscene grundy said let me see if i can render a properly effective translation keep moving irene said the flowers incipient now the flowers singing its song of conquest grundy reported and broke into the song im the one flower im the stunflower at the word stun there was a burst of radiation that blistered their backs dor and the others fell forward into the channel letting the water cool their burning flesh the sea nettle facing the flower stiffened its surface glazed the drool crystallized the antennae faded and turned brittle it had been stunned they swam by the nettle there was no reaction from the monster dor saw its mass extending down into the depths of the channel with huge stinging tentacles that thing certainly could have destroyed them all had it remained animate they completed their swim in good order chet and grundy in the lead then dor smash and finally irene he knew she could swim well enough she was staying back so the others would not view her nakedness she wasnt actually all that shy about it it was mainly her sense of propriety developing apace with her body and her instinct for preserving the value of what she had by keeping it reasonably scarce it was working nicely dor was now several times as curious about her body as he would have been had he seen it freely but he dared not look the stunning radiation of the stunflower still beat upon the back of his head they found the shallows and trampled out of the water keep going until shaded from the flower irene called dont look back whatever you do dor needed no warning he felt the heat of stun travel down his back buttocks and legs as he emerged from the water what a monster irene had unleashed but it had done its job when his own talent had failed it had gotten them safely across the channel and past the sea nettle they found a tangle of purplegreen bushes and maneuvered to put them between their bodies and the stunflower now dor could put his clothing back on he had kept it mostly dry by carrying it clenched in his teeth the magic sword strapped to his body you have nice legs too irene said behind him making him jump and thats not all dor found himself blushing well he had it coming to him irene was already dressed girls could change clothing very quickly when they wanted to they moved on south but it was a long time before dor lost his nervousness about looking back that stunflower chet halted whats this he asked the others looked there was a flat wooden sign set in the ground on it was neatly printed no law for the loin it was obvious that no one quite understood this message but no one wanted to speculate on its meaning at last dor asked the sign is there any threat to us nearby no the sign said they went on each musing his private musings they had come to this island naked could that relate but obviously that sign had been there long before their coming could it be a misspelling he wondered but his own spelling was so poor he hesitated to draw that conclusion now they came to a densely wooded marsh the trees were small but closely set dor and irene could squeeze between them but smash could not and it was out of the question for chet me make a lake smash said readying his huge hamfist with the trees gone this would be a more or less open body of murky water no lets see if we can find a way through dor said lung trent never eked to have wilderness areas wantonly destroyed for some reason and if we make a big commotion it could attract whatever monsters there are they skirted the thicket and soon came across another sign the loin walks where it will near it was a neat dry path through the forest elevated slightly above the swnp any danger here dor inquired not much the sign said they used the path as they penetrated the thicket there were rustlings in the trees and slurpings in the muck below whats that noise dor asked but received no answer this forest was so dense there was nothing inanimate in it the water was covered with green growth and the path itself was formed of living roots ill try grundy said he spoke in tree language and after a moment reported they are cog rats and skug worms nothing to worry about as long as you dont turn your back on them the rustlings and slurpings became louder but they are all around us irene protested how can we avoid fuming our backs we can face in all directions chet said ill go forward grundy can ride me facing backward the rest of you can look to eitheir side they did so smash on the left dor and irene on the right the noises stayed just out of sight but lets get on out of this place irene said i wonder how the loin makes out since this seems to be its path dor said as if in answer to his question they came upon another sign the loin is lord of the jungle viously the cog rats and skug worms didnt dare bother the loin i am getting more curious about this thing irene said does it hunt does it eat does it play with others of its kind what is it dor wondered too but still hesitated to state his conjectures suppose it wasnt a misspelling how then would it hunt eat and play they hurried on and finally emerged from the thicketonly to encounter another sign the loin shall lie with the lamb whats a lamb irene asked a mundane creature chet said said to be harmless soft and cuddly but stupid thats the kind the loin would like she muttered darkly still no one openly expressed conjectures about the nature of this creature they traveled on down to the southern tip of this long island the entire coastline of xanth chet explained was bordered by barrier reefs that had developed into island chains this was as good and safe a route as they could ask for since they no longer had a boat there should be very few large predators on the islands since there was insufficient hunting area for them and the sea creatures could not quite reach the interiors of the isles but no part of xanth was wholly safe all of them were ready to depart this isle of the loin as they came to the beach they encountered yet another sign a pride of loins and a roaring erupted behind them back along the path in the thicket something was comingand who could doubt what it was do we want to meet a pride of loins chet asked rhetorically but do we want to swim through that grundy asked they looked a fleet of tiger sharks had sailed in while doris party stood on the beach each had a sailfin and the head of a tiger they crowded in as close to the shore as they could reach snarling hungry welcome i think were between the dragon and the dune again grundy said i can stop the tiger sharks irene said i have a kraken seaweed seed and i still have the hypnogourd that should stop a loin chet said assuming its a case of misspelling there is a mundane monster like the front half of a tiger shark called a but there must be several loins in a pride grundy said unless its just one loin standing mighty proud me fight the fright smash said a pride might contain twenty individuals chet said you might occupy half a dozen smashbut the remaining dozen or so would have opportunity to eat up the rest of us if that is what they do but we dont know there are that many irene protested uncertainly weve got to get out of here grundy cried oh i never worried about my flesh when i was a real goleml maybe you werent as obnoxious then irene suggested besides which you didnt have any flesh then but the only way to go was along the beachand the tiger sharks paced them in the water we cant escape either menace this way irene said im planting my kraken she tossed a seed into the water grow weedl chet held forward the hypnogourd that he had retained through all their mishaps one palm covering the peephole ill show this to the first loin regardless smash joined him me reckon the secons he said his hamfists at the ready an nerd the third youre the magician grundy told dor do something dor made a wild attempt anythingis there ay way out of here thought youd never ask the sand at his feet said of course theres a way out you know a way dor asked gratified no for goodness sake irene exclaimed what an idiot youd be stupid too the sand retorted if your brains were fragmented mineral i was referring to him she said indicating dor to think they call him a magician all he can do is play ventriloquist with junk like you thats telling him the sand agreed ibats a real load of sand in his eyes why did you say there was a way out if you dont know it dor demanded because my neighbor the bone knows it dor spotted the bone and addressed it whats the way out the tunnel idiot the bone said the sound of the pride of loins was looming louder the tiger sharks were snarling as the growing kraken weed menaced them wheres the tunnel dor asked right behind you at the shore the bone said i sealed it off took three steps and fell prey to the loins i dont see it dor said of course not the high tide washes sand over it last week someone goosed the tide and it dumped a lot more sand im the only one who can locate the tunnel now dor picked up the bone it resembled the thighbone of a man locate the tunnel for me right there where the water laps scrape the sand away it angled slightly in his hand pointing dor scraped and soon uncovered a boulder this seals it he asked yes the bone said i hid my pirate treasure under the next island and tunneled here so no one would know but the loins hey smash dor called we have a boulder for you to move oh i wouldnt the bone cautioned ibafs delicately placed so the thieves cant force it the tunnel will collapse well how do we get in then you have to use a sky hook to lift the boulder out without jarring the sides we dont have a sky hookl dor exclaimed angrily of course you doift that was my talent when i was alive no one but me could safely remove that boulder i had everything figured except the loin as the bone spoke the icraken weed having driven back the tiger sharks was questing toward the shore soon it would be more of a menace to them than the tiger sharks had been any progress chet asked i do not want to rush you but i calculate we have thirty seconds before the loins whatever they are burst out of the forest chet dor exclaimed make this boulder into a pebbler but dont jar anything the centaur touched the boulder and immediately it shrank soon it was a pebble that fell into the hole beneath it the passage was open jump in dor cried irene was startled who me close enough grundy said want to stand there and show off your legs to the loins irene jumped in say this is neat she called from below her voice echoing hollowly let me just grow something to illuminate it you next dor said to chet try not to shake the tunnel its not secure chet jumped in with surprising delicacy grundy with him okay smash dor said no go the ogre said bracing to face the land menace me join the loin and he slammed one huge fist into a hammy palm with a sound like a crack of thunder smash wanted to guard the rear probably that was best otherwise the loins might pursue them into the tunnel stand next to the opening dor said when youre ready jump in and follow us dont wait too long soon the kraken will reach here that will stop the loins i think dont tangle with the kraken we need it to stand guard after you rejoin us ike ogre nodded the bellow of the loins became loud dor jumped in the hole he found himself in a mansized passage leading south under the channel the light from the entrance faded rapidly but irene had thoughtfully planted starflowers along the way and their pinpoint lights marked the progress of the tunnel dor paused to unwrap his midnight sunstone its beam helped considerably as dor walked he heard the approach of the pride of loins out side smash made a grunt of surprise then there was the sound of contact whats going on dor cried worried the ogre just threw a dandyloin to the kraken the pebble in the mouth of the tunnel said now hes facing up to their leader sir loin stake hes tough and juicy smash come on dor cried dont push your luck the ogres reply was muffled all dor heard was luck oooo what you said the pebble exclaimed wash out your mouth with soapstone in a moment smash came lumbering down the tunnel head bowed to clear the ceiling a string of kraken weed was strewn across his hairy shoulder evidently he had held off the loins until the kraken took over the vicinity horde explored adored the gourd he an nounced cracking a smile like a smoking cleft in a lightningstruck tree those who believed ogres had no sense of humor were obviously mistaken smash could laugh with the best provided the joke was suitably fundamental what did the loins look like dor asked overcome by morbid curiosity smash paused considering then uttered one of his rare nonrhym ing utterances ho ho ho ho ho he bellowedand the fragile tun nel began to crumble around them rocks dislodged from the ceiling and the walls oozed moisture dor and the ogre fled that section dor was no longer very curious about the nature of the loins he just wanted to get out of this tunnel alive they were below the ocean they could be crushed inexorably if the tunnel support collapsed a partial collapse leading to a subiji stantial leak would flood the tunnel even an ogre could not be ex pected to hold up an ocean they caught up to the others there was no crash behind them the tunnel had not collapsed yet this place makes me nervous irene said no way out but forward chet said quickly the passage seemed interminable but it did trend south it must have been quite a job for the pirate to excavate this even with his sky hook to help haul out the refuse how ironic that the loin should be his downfall after he had finished the tunnel they hurried onward and downward becoming more nervous as the depth deepened to heighten their apprehension the bottom of the tunnel became clammy then slick a thin stream of water was flowing in itand soon it was clear that this water was increasing had the ogres laugh triggered a leak after all if so they were doomed dor was afraid even to mention the possibility the tide chet said the tide is coming inand high tide covers the entrance this passage is filling with water oh good dor said relieved four pairs of eyes focused on him perplexed uh i was afraid the tunnel was collapsing dor said lamely ibe tidethats not so bad in the sense that a slow demise is better than a fast one the centaur said dor thought about that his apprehension became galloping dread how could they escape this how much longer is this tunnel dor asked youre halfway through the tunnel said but youll have trouble getting past the cavein ahead cavein irene squealed she tended to panic in a crisis oh sure the tunnel said no way around in a moment with the water ankledeep and rising they encountered ita mass of rubble that sealed the passage me bash this trash smash said helpfully urn wait dor cautioned we dont want to bring the whole ocean in on us in one swoop maybe if chet reduces the pieces to pebbles while smash supports the ceiling still wont hold chet said the dynamics are wrong we need an arch me shape escape smash offered he started to fashion an arch from stray chunks of stone but more chunks rolled down to splash in the deepening water as he took each one maybe i can stabilize it irene said she found a seed and dropped it in the water grow the plant tried but there was not enough light dor shone his sunstone on it then the plant prospered that was all it needed jewers gift was proving usefull soon there was a leafy kudzu taking form tendrils dug into the sand vines enclosed the rocks and green leaves covered the watt of the amel now smash could not readily dislodge the stones he needed to complete his arch without hurting the plant i believe we can make it without the arch chet said the plant has secured the debris he touched a stone reducing it to a pebble then touched others soon the tunnel was restored the passage clear to the end but the delay had been costly the water was now kneedeep they splashed onward fortunately they were at the nadir as they marched up the far slope the waters depth diminished but they knew this was a temporary respite before long the entire tunnel would be filled now they came to the end of ita chamber in which there stood a simple wooden table whose objects were covered by a cloth they stood around it for the moment hesitant i dont know what treasure can help us now dor said and whipped off the cloth the pirates treasure was revealed a pile of mundane gold coinsthey had to be mundane since xanth did not use comagea keg of diamonds and a tiny sealed jar too bad irene said nothing useful and this is the end of the tunnel the pirate must have filled it in as he went up to this point so there would be only the one way in ill have to plant a big tuber and hope it runs a strong tube to the surface and that there is no water above us here the tuber isnt watertight if that fails smash can try to bash a hole in the ceiling and chet can shrink the boulders as they fall we just may get out alive dor was relieved at least irene wasnt collapsing in hysterics she did have some backbone when it was needed grundy was on the table struggling with the cap of the jar if gold is precious and gems are precious maybe this is the most pre cious of all but when the cap came off the content of the jar was revealed as simple salve this is your treasure dor asked the bone oh yes its the preciousest treasure of all the bone assured him in what way well i dont know but the fellow i pirated it from fought liter amy to the death to retain it he bribed me with the gold hid the dia monds and refused to part with the salve at all he died without teu ing me what it was for i tried it on wounds and bums but it did nothing maybe if id known its nature i could have used it to de stroy the loins dor found he had little sympathy for the pirate who had died as he had lived ignominiously but the salve intrigued him increasingly and not merely because he was now standing kneedeep in water salve what is your property he asked i am a magic condiment that enables people to walk on smoke and vapor it replied proudly merely smear me on the bottoms of your feet or boots and you can tread any trail in the sky you can see of course the effect only lasts a day at a time i get scuffed off you know but repeated applications a thank you dor cut in that is very fine magic indeed but can you help us get out of this tunnel no i make mist seem solid not rock seem misty you need another salve for that if i had known your property the bone said wistfully i could have escaped the loins if only i had serves you right you infernal pirate the salve said you got exactly what you deserved i hope you loined your lesson listen greasepot the bone retorted enough dor said if neither of you have any suggestions to get us out of here keep quiet i am suspicious of this chet said the pirate took this trea sure but never lived to enjoy it ask it if there is a curse associated is there salve dor asked surprised by the notion oh sure the salve said didnt i tell you you did not dor said how much mischief had chets alertness saved them what is it whoever uses me will perform some dastardly deed before the next full moon the salve said proudly the pirate did but i never used you the bone protested i never knew your power you put me on your wounds that was a misusebut it counted those wounds could have walked on clouds then you killed your partner and took all the treasure for yourself that was a dastardly deed indeedl irene agreed you certainly deserved your fate yeah he was purloined grundy said the bone did not argue oops chet said he reached down and ripped something from his foreleg just under the rising waterline it was a tentacle from the kraken i was afraid of that irene said that weed is way beyond my control it wont stop growing if i tell it to dor drew his sword ill cut off any more tentacles he said they cant come at me too thickly here at the end of the tunnel go ahead and start your tuber irene she dipped into her seedbag ohoh that seed mustve fallen out somewhere along the way its not here they had had a violent trip on the raft the seed could have worked loose anywhere chet and smash dor said without pause go ahead and make us a way out of here if you can irene if you have another stabilization plant she checked that i have they got busy dor faced back down the dark tunnel as the water rose to thigh level spearing at the dark liquid with his sword shining the sunstone here and there the sounds of the ogres work grew loud water tell me when a tentacles coming he directed but there was so much crashing behind him as smash pulverized the rock of the ceiling that he could not hear the warnings of the water a tentacle caught his ankle and jerked him off his feet he choked on water as another tentacle caught his sword arm the kraken had him and he couldnt call for help whats going on here grundy demanded are you going swimming while the rest of us work then the golem realized that dor was in trouble hey why didnt you say something dont you know the krakens got you the kraken seaweed certainly had him the tentacles were dragging him back down the tunnel half drowning well somebodys got to do something grundy said as though bothered by an annoying detail here krakenwant a cookie he held out a gold coin which seemed to weigh almost as much as he did a tentacle snatched the coin away but in a moment discovered it to be enedible and dropped it grundy grabbed a handful of diamonds try this rock candy he suggested the tentacle wrapped around the gemsand got sliced by their sharp edges ichor welled into the water as the tentacle thrashed m pam now theres a notion grundy said he swam to where dor was still being dragged along and sliced with another diamond cutting into the tentacles they let go stung though the golem was only able to scratch them and dor finally gasped his way back to his feet waistdeep in coloring water i have to go help the others grundy said yer if you get in more trouble dor fished in the water and recovered his magic sword and the shining sunstone he was more than disheveled and disgruntled he had had to be bailed out by a creature no taller than the span of his hand some hero he was but the others had had better success a hole now opened upward and daylight glinted down come on dor grundy called were getting out of here at last dor crammed coins and diamonds into one pocket with the sunstone and the jar of salve into another smash and chet were already scrambling out the top having had to mount the new passage as they extended it the centaur was actually pretty good at this sort of climbing because he had six extremities four or five were firmly braced in crevices while one or two were searching for new holds grundy had no trouble his small weight allowed him to scramble freely only dor and irene remained below hurry up slowpoke she called i cant wait forever start up first he called im stashing the treasure oh no she retorted you just want to see up my skirt if i do thats my profit he said i dont want this hole collapsing on you for indeed gravel and rocks were falling down as chets efforts dislodged them the whole situation seemed precarious despite the effort of the plant irene had grown to help stabilize the wall there is that she agreed nervously she started to climb while dor completed his stashing the krakens tentacles given respite from the attacks of sword and diamond quested forward again the water was now chesthigh on dor providing the weed ample play theres one the water said and dor stabbed into the murky fluid he was rewarded by a jerk on his sword that indicated he had speared something that flinched away for a creature as bloodthirsty as the kraken it certainly was finicky about pinpricksl theres another the water cried enjoying this game dor stabbed again but it was hard to do much damage despite the magic skill the sword gave him since he couldnt slash effectively through water stabbing only hurt the tentacles without doing serious damage also the weed was learningto take evasive action it wasnt very smart but it did learn a certain minimum under the constant prodding of pain dor started to climb at last but to do this he had to put away his sword and that gave the tentacles a better chance at him also the gold was very solid for its size and weighed him down as he drew himself out of the water a tentacle wrapped around his right knee and dragged him down again doris grip slipped and he fell back into the water now three more tentacles wrapped themselves around his legs and waist that kraken had succeeded in infiltrating this tunnel far more thoroughly than dor had thought possible the weed must be an enormous monster now since this must be only a fraction of its activity dor clenched his teeth knowing that no one else could help him if he got dragged under this time and drew his sword again he set the edge carefully against a tentacle and sawed the magically sharp edge sliced through the tender flesh of the kraken cutting off the extremity the tentacle couldnt flinch away because it was wrapped around dor its own greed anchored it dor repeated the process with the other tentacles until he was free in a milky viscous pool of kraken blood then he sheathed the sword again and climbed hey dorwhats keeping you irene called from halfway up im on my way he answered glancing up but as he did several larger chunks of rock became dislodged perhaps by the sound of their voices and rattled down dor stood chestdeep in the water shielding his head with his arms are you all right she called just stop yelling he yelled its collapsing the passage and he shielded his head again from the falling rocks this was hellishl oh she said faintly and was quiet another tentacle had taken hold during this distraction the weed was getting bolder despite its losses dor sliced it away then once more began his climb but now ichor from the monster was on his hands making his hold treacherous he tried to rinse off his hands but the stuff was all through the water with his extra weight he could not make it dor stood there fending off tentacles while irene scrambled to the surface what am i going to do he asked frustrated ditch the coins idiot the wall said but i might need them dor protested unwilling to give up the treasure men are such fools about us a coin said from his pocket this fool will die for usand we have no value in xanth it did make dor wonder why was he burdening himself with this junk wealth that was meaningless and a magic salve that was cursed he could not answeryet neither could he relinquish the treasure just as the kraken was losing tentacles by anchoring them to his body he was in danger of losing his life by anchoring it to wealthand he was no smarter about it than was the weed then a tentacle dangled down from above dor shied away had the weed found another avenue of attack he whipped up his sword in air it was far more effective you cant nab me that way greedyweedy he said hey watch your language the tentacle protested im a rope dor was startled rope what for to pull you up dumbbell it said what do you think a rescue rope is for a rescue rope are you anchored of course im anchored it said indignantly think i dont know my business tie me about you and ill rescue you from this foul hole dor did so and soon he was on his way treasure and all aw you lucked out the coin in his pocket said what do you care wealth destroys men it is our rite of passage destroy a man we were about to destroy you and you escaped through no merit of your own wer im taking you with me so youll have another chance there is that the coin agreed brightening soon dor emerged from the hole chet and smash were hauling on the rope drawing him up while grundy called directions so that no snag occurred what were you doing down there irene demanded i thought youd never come up i had some trouble with the kraken dor said showing off a fragment of tentacle that remained hooked to his leg it was now latening afternoon any danger here dor asked the ground theres a nest of wyvems on the south beach of this island the ground replied but they hunt only by day its quite a nest though so if we camp here at the north end well be safe should be the ground agreed grudgingly if the wyvems hunt by day maybe we should trek on past them tonight irene said smash smiled we make trek me wring neck he said his brute mitts suggesting what he would do to an unfortunate wyvem the ogre seemed larger now taller and more massive than he had been and dor realized that he probably was larger ogres put on growth rapidly in their teen years but dor was too tired to do it ive got to rest he said irene was unexpectedly solicitous of course you do you stood rearguard fighting off the kraken while we escaped ill bet you wouldnt have made it out at all if chet hadnt found that vinerope dor didnt want to admit that the weight of the gold had prevented him from climbing as he should have done guess i just got tired he said the fool insisted on bringing us gold coins along the coin blabbed loudly from his pocket irene frowned you brought the coins we dont need them and theyre awful heavy dor sat down heavily on the beach the coins jangling i know what about the diamonds them too he said patting the other pocket though he wasnt sure which pocket he had put them in i do like diamonds she said i regard them as friends she helped him get his jacket off then his wet shirt he had avoided the kingly robes for this trip but his gardenvariety clothing seemed hardly better now dor your arms are all scraped thats the work of the kraken grundy said matteroffactly it hooked his limbs and dragged hhu under i had to carve it with diamonds to make it let go you didnt tell me it was that bad she exclaimed to dor krakens are dangerous up close you were busy making the escape dor said now the abrasions on his arms and legs were stinging get the rest of this clothing oil she said working at it herself grundy go find some healing elixir we forgot to bring any but a number of plants manufacture it grundy went into the forest any of you plants have healing juice he called dor was now too tired to resist irene tugged at his trousers then she paused oh myi forgot about that she said what dor asked not sure how embarrassed he should be im certainly glad you brought that along she said hey chet look at this ihe centaur came over and looked the salve he said yes that could be quite useful dor relaxed for a moment he had thoughtbut of course she had been talking about the salve soon irene had him stripped your skins abraded all over she scolded its a wonder you didnt faint down there guess ill do it now dor said and did dor woke fairly well refreshed evidently grundy had located a suitable balm for the scraped skin was largely healed his head was pillowed on something soft after a moment he realized it was irenes lap irene was asleep with her back against an ash tree and a fine coating of ashes now powdered her hair she was lovely in that unconscious pose he seemed to be wearing new clothing too they must have located a flannel plant or maybe irene had grown one from seed as he considered that he heard a faint bleat in the distance and was sure newly shorn flannel plants did protest for a while he decided not to dwell on how she might have measured or fitted him for the clothing she had made viously she was not entirely nave about such things in fact irene was shaping up as a pretty competent girl dor sat up immediately irene woke well someone had to keep you from thrashing about in the sand until you healed she said embaffassed he had liked her better without the explanation thank you im better now chet and smash had gathered red and blue berries from colorberry bushes and tapped a winekeg tree for liquid they got pleasantly high on breakfast while they discussed the exigencies of the day i dont think we had better try to walk by that wyverns nest chet said but our most feasible alternative carries a penalty the curse grundy said beware the air smash agreed dor scratched his head what are you talking about the salve chet explained to walk on clouds i dont want to perform some dastardly deed irene said but i dont want to get chewed up by wyvems either now a shape loomed on the ocean horizon whats that dor asked the sea a big sea serpent the water answered she comes by here every morning to clean off the beaches now dor noticed how clean this beach was the sand gleamed as whitely as bone i think our decision has just been made for us chet said lets risk the curse and walk the vapors but the clouds are way out of reach irene protested light a fire grundy said we can walk up the smoke that ought to work chet agreed hurriedly they gathered dry wood from the interior of the island while irene grew a flamevine soon the vine was blazing and they set the wood about it forming a bonfire several fine bons puffed into the sky looking like burning bones then smoke billowed up roiling its way slantwise to the west it seemed thick enough but was it high enough the sea monster was looming close attracted by the fire lets move it grundy cried wheres the salve dor produced the salve and the golem smeared it on his little feet then he made a running leap for the smokeand flipped over and rolled on the ground lift me up to the top of it he cried unhurt i need to get it firmly under me i think smash lifted him up yes the ogre was definitely taller than he had been at the start of their trip now the golem found his footing heyits hot he cried dancing he ran up the columnbut the smoke was moving making his footing uncertain and in a moment he stumbled felland plummeted through the smoke toward the ground smash caught him before he struck the golem disappeared entirely inside the ogres brute hand small fall smash commented how about putting it on his hands too irene asked dor did so dabbing it on the golem with the tip of his little finger they put grundy up again this time when the golem stumbled he was able to catch himself by grabbing handfuls of smoke come on up he cried the vapors fine the sea monster was almost upon them the others put salve on their hands and feet and scrambled onto the smoke chet with four feet balanced on the shifting surface fairly handily but smash irene and dor had trouble finary they scrambled on hands and feet getting from the hot lower smoke to the cooler higher smoke this was less dense but the footing remained adequate the surface was spongy to doris sensation like a soft balloon that was constantly changing its shape the smoke seemed solid to their soles and palms but it remained gaseous in nature with its own whorls and eddies they could not stand still on it dor had to keep shifting his weight to maintain balance it was a challengeand became fun now the sea monster arrived she sniffed the beach then followed her nose up to the smoke and the creatures on it the wind was extending the smoke on an almost level course at this elevation not quite beyond reach of the monster the creature spied irene up there did a double take then snapped at the girlwho screamed and jumped off the smoke for an instant dor saw her there in midair as if she were frozen her shriek descending with her he knew he could not reach her or help her the fool girl then a loop of rope snagged her and drew her back to the smoke chet had saved his rope the one used to draw dor up from the hole and now had used it to rescue irene from her folly doris heart dropped back into place the sea monster deprived of her morsel emitted an angry honk and lunged again but this time irene had the wit to scramble away and the huge snout bit into the smoke and passed through it harmlessly the teeth made an audible clash as they closed on nothing however the passage of the monsters head through the smoke disturbed the column and dor and smash were caught on the side nearer the fire they could not rejoin the others until the column mended itself now the monster concentrated on the two of them since they were closest to the ground they could not move off the smoke so she had a good shot at them her huge ugly snout oriented on dor and lunged forward dor had had enough of monsters he danced aside and whipped out his magic sword the weapon moved dazzlingly in his hand slicing through the soft tissue of the monsters left nostril the creature honked with pain and rage oooo thats not ladylikel grundy called from upsmoke depends on the lady irene remarked now the sea monster opened her ponderous and motlied jaws and advanced agape dor had to retreat for the mouth was too big for him to handle it could take him in with one chomp the monsters of the ocean grew larger than those of the lakes but stepping back he stumbled over a fresh roil of smoke and sat down hardon nothing solid his seat passed right through and he had to snatch madly with both hands to save himself he was caught as if in a tub supported only by his feet and hands the monster hissed in glee and moved in to take him in bottomfirst but smash stepped into her mouth hamfists bashing into the giant teeth with loud clashing sounds knocking chips from them startled the monster paused mouth still open the ogre stomped on her tongue and jumped back to the smoke by the time dor had regained his feet the monster had retreated and smash was bellowing some rhyming imprecation at her but the monster was not one of the shy little creatures of the inland lakes that gobbled careless swimmers she was a denizen of the larger puddle she had been balked not defeated she was really angry now the monster honked i have not yet begun to bite grundy translated she cast about for some better way to get at the smokehome morselsand spied the fire on the beach the monster was not stupid for her kind the tiny wheels rotated almost visibly in her huge ugly head as she contemplated the blaze then she dropped her head down gathered herself and with her flippers swept a huge wash of water onto the beach the fire hissed and sent up a violent protest of steam then ignominiously capitulated and died the smoke stopped billowing up dor and his friends were left standing on dissipating smoke soon they would be left with no visible means of support the remaining cloud of smoke coalesced somewhat as it shrank dor and smash rejoined the other three now all were balancing on a diffusing mass soon they would fall into the ocean where the sea monster slavered eagerly well do something irene screamed at dor doris performance under pressure had been spotty now his brain percolated more efficiently we must make more smoke he said irene do you have any more flammable plants in your bag just some torchflowers she replied i lost so many good seeds to the eclectic eell but where can i grow them they need solid ground smear magic salve on the roots dor told her let a torch grow in this smoke her mouth opened in a cute of surprise that just might work she took out a seed smeared it in the salve dor held out and ordered it to grow it worked the torch developed and matured guttering into flame and smoke the wind carried the smoke west in a thin dark brown stream irene looked at it with dismay i expected it to spread out more it will take a balancing act to walk on that in addition to which chet said the smoke in which the torch is rooted is rapidly dwindling when it falls into the ocean well have to root it in its own smoke dor said then it will never fall cant she protested the smoke wont curl down and anyway its always moving the thing would go into a tailspin it also smacks of paradox chet said this is a problematical concept when magic is involved nevertheless better do something grundy warned that sea monsters waiting openmouthed beneath this cloud have you another torchseed dor asked yes one more irene said but i dont see grow it in smoke from this one then well play leapfrog are you sure that makes sense no she proceeded soon the second torch was blazing rooted in the smoke of the first and its own trail of smoke ran above and parallel to the first but we still cant balance on those thin lines chet said yes we can put one foot on each dubiously chet tried it it worked he was able to brace against the two columns careful not to fall between them and walk slowly forward irene followed more awkwardly for the twin columns were at slightly different elevations and varied in separation there was a honking chuckle from below irene colored that monster is looking up my skirt she exclaimed furious dont worry grundy said its a female monster you can be sure your legs are the first it will chomp if it gets the chance dor snapped he had little patience with her vanity at this moment smash went out on the columns next balancing easily the ogre was not nearly as clumsy as he looked go on grundy dor said ill move the first torch how can you move it the golem demanded you cant balance on one column ill manage somehow dor said though this was a complication he hadnt worked out once the first torch was moved there would be no smoke from it for him to walk on youre so busy trying to be a hero youre going to wind up monster food grundy said where is xanth if you go the way of king trent i dont know dor admitted maybe the zombie master wui discover he likes politics after all that dourpuss ha but those torches have to be moved ill move them grundy said im small enough to walk on one column you go ahead dor hesitated but saw no better alternative very well but be careful dor straddled the two columns this felt more precarious than it had looked but was far better than dropping to the water and monster below when he had progressed a fair distance he braced himself and looked back grundy was laboring at the first torch but the thing was about as big as the golem and was firmly rooted in the remaining cloud of smoke from the erstwhile beach fire the tiny man could not get it loose the sea monster perceiving the problem was bracing herself for one good snap at the whole situation grundy get out of there dor cried leave the torch too late the monsters head launched forward as her flippers thrust the body out of the water grundy cried out with terror and leaped straight up as the snout intersected the cloud the monsters teeth closed on the torchand the golem landed on the massive snout the saucereyes peered crosseyed at grundy who was no bigger than a mote that might irritate one of those orbs while smoke from the torch drifted from the great nostrils the effect was anomalous since no sea monster had natural fire fire was the perquisite of dragons then the sea monsters body sank back into the ocean grundy scrambled up along the wispy trail of smoke from the nostrils and managed to recover his perch on the original smoke cloud but the torch was gone run up the other column dor shouted save yourself for a moment grundy stood looking down at the monster i blew it he said i ruined it all well figure out something dor cried realizing that everything could fall apart right here if every person did not keep scrambling get over here now numbly the golem obeyed walking along the widening but thinning column dor saw that their problems were still mounting for the smoke that supported the second torch was now dissipating soon the second column too would be lost chet dor called smear salve on your rope and hook it over one smoke column tie yourself to the ends and grab the others you have the salve the centaur reminded him catch it dor cried he hefted the small jar in his right hand made a mental prayer to the guiding spirit of xanth and hurled the jar toward the centaur the tiny missile arched through the air had his aim been good at first its course seemed too high then it seemed to drop too rapidly then it became clear the missile was off to the side he had indeed missed the jar was passing well beyond chets reach dor too had blown his chance then chets rope flung out and the loop closed neatly about the jar the centaur expert in the manner of his kind had lassoed it doris relief was so great he almost sat downwhich would have been suicidal but this ropes not long enough chet said analyzing the job he had to do with it have irene grow it longer dor called i can only grow live plants she protested those vineropes live a long time dor replied they can root after months of separation from their parentplants even when they look dead try it but as he spoke he remembered that the rope had spoken to him when it came for him down the hole that meant that it was indeed dead dubiously irene tried it grow she called they all waited tensely then the rope grew one end of it had been dormant it must have been the other end that had been dead once more doris relief was overwhelming they were skirting about as close to the brink of disaster as they could without falling in once the rope started it grew beautifully not only did it lengthen it branched becoming a fullfledged ropevine soon chet had enough to weave into a large basket he smeared magic salve all over it and suspended it from the smoke column chet himself got into it and irene joined him then smash it was a big basket and strong it had to be to support both centaur and ogre the two massive creatures clapped each others hands together in victory they liked each other now the second torch lost footing and started to fall dor charged back along the two columns dived down reached out and grabbed it but his balance on one column was precarious he windmilled his arms but could not quite regain equilibrium then another loop of rope flung out dor was caught under the arms just as he slipped off the column chet hauled him in as he feil so that he described an are toward the water the sea monster pursued him eagerly doris feet barely brushed the waves then he swung up on the far side of the are sword grundy cried perched on smoke far above dazedly dor transferred the torch to his left hand and drew his sword now he swung back toward the grinning head of the monster chet heaved lifting dor up a body length as a result instead of swinging into the opening mouth he smacked into the upper lip just below the flaring nostrils dor shoved his feet forward mashing that hp against the upper teeth then he stabbed forward with the sword spearing the tender left nostril hows that feel garlicsnoot he asked the snoot blasted out an angry gale of breath that was indeed redolent of garlic and worse creatures with the most objectionable qualities were often the ones with the most sensitive feelings about them dor was blown back out over the ocean stm rising as chet hauled him up but now the smoke supporting the rope and basket was dissipating soon they would all falland the monster was well aware of this fact all the pinpricks and taps on teeth and snout she had suffered would be avenged she hung back for the moment avoiding doris sword awaiting the inevitable with hungry eagerness the smoke grundy cried dor realized that the torch he held was pouring its smoke up slantingly the breeze had diminished allowing a steeper angle yesl use this smoke to support the ropel he ordered chet catching on rocked the ropebasket and set it swinging as the smoke angled up the basket swung across to intersect it but that caused dor to swing also moving his torch and its smoke grow a beanpole he told irene gotcha irene said soon another seed was sprouting a bean in the form of a pole smash wedged this into the basket and bent it down so that dor could reach the far tip dor grabbed it and hung on now the pole held him at an angle below the basket chet and smash managed to rotate the whole contraption so that dor was upwind from them the smoke poured up and across passing just under the basket buoying it up each wrinkle in the smoke snagging on the woven vines the rising smoke simply carried the basket up with it the sea monster caught on that the situation had changed it charged forward snapping at dorbut dor was now just out of its reach slowly and uncertainly the whole party slid upward buoyed by the smoke from the torch the arrangement seemed too fantastic and tenuous to operate even with magic but somehow it did the sea monster seeing her hardwon meal escape vented one terrible honk of outrage that caused the smoke to waver this shook their entire apparatus the sound reverberated about the welkin startling pink green and blue birds from their island perches and sending sea urchins fleeing in childish tears i cant even translate that grundy said awed the honk had one other effect it attracted the attention of the nest of wyvems the empty nest flew up a huge mass of sticks and vines and feathers and scales and bones whats this noise it demanded oh no doris talent had to be responsible for this he had been under such pressure his magic was manifesting erratically the sea monster did it he cried truthfully enough that animated worm the nest demanded ill teach it to disturb my repose ill squash it and it flew fiercely toward the monster the sea monster justifiably astonished ducked her head and dive a u under the water xanth was the place of many incredible things but this was beyond incredibility the nest pursuing the monster landed with a great splash became waterlogged and sanl im all washed upl it wailed despairingly as it disappeared dor and the others stared they had never imagined an event like this but where are the wyvems chet asked probably out hunting grundy answered wed better be well away from here when they return and fmd their nest gone they had by this devious route made their escape from the sea monster as time passed they left the monster far below dor began to relax againand his torch guttered out these plants did not burn forever and this one had expended all its smoke smoke alert dor cried waving the defunct torch they were now so high in the air that a fall would be disastrous even without an angry monster below so close to the clouds chet lamented pointing to a looming cloudbank they had almost made it grow the rope some more grundy said make it reach up to those clouds irene complied a new vine grew up anchored in the basket it penetrated the lowest cloud but it has no salve chet said it cant hold on there give me the salve grundy said ill chmb up there he did so nimbly he mounted the ropevine in moments he disappeared into the cloud a blob of salve stuck to his back the supportive smoke column dissipated the basket sagged and dor swung about below it horrified but it descended only a little the ropevine had been successfully anchored in the cloud and they were safe there was no way the rest of them could climb that rope though they had to wait suspended until a vagary of the weather caused a new layer of clouds to forin beneath them hiding the ocean the new clouds were traveling south in contrast to the westwardmoving higher ones when the positioning was right they stepped out and trod the billowy white masses jumping over the occasional gaps until they were safely ensconced in a large cloudbank in due course this cleared away from the higher clouds letting the sky open the winds at different levels of the sky were traveling in different directions carrying their burdens with them this wind was bearing south since the basket was firmly anchored to the higher cloudbank they had to unload it quickly so they would not lose their remaining possessions they watched it depart wth mixed emotions it had served them well lbey sprouted a grapefnjit tree and ate the grapes as they ripened t was sunny and warm here atop the clouds since this wind was car rying them south there was no need for the travelers to walk their difficult journey had become an easy one only one thing bothers me chet murmured when we reach centaur islehow do we get down maybe well think of something by then dor said he was tired again mentally as well as physically he was unable to concentrate on a problem of the future right now however critical that problem might be they smeared salve on their bodies so they could lie down and rest the cloud surface was resilient and cool and the travelers were tired soon they were sleeping dor dreamed pleasantly of exploring in a friendly forest the ac tion was inconsequential but the feeling was wonderful he had half expected more nightmares but realized they could not reach him up here in the sky not unless they got hold of some magic salve for their hooves then in his dream he looked into a deep dark pool of water and in its reflection saw the face of lgng trent remember the isle the king told him it is the only way you can reach me we need your help dor dor woke abruptly to find irene staring into his face for a mo ment you almost looked like she said perplexed your father he finished dont worry its only his message i guess i must use the isle to find him how do you spell that dor scratched his head i dont know i thoughtbut im not sure island does aisle make sense a i s l e she spelled not much i guess im not any better at visions than i am at adventure he said with resignation her expression changed becoming softer dor i just wanted to tell youyou were great with the smoke and everything me he asked unbelieving i barely scrambled through you and chet and grundy did all the you guided us she said every time there was a crisis and we froze or fouled up you called out an order and that got us movmg again you were a leader dor you had what it took when we really had to have it i guess you dont know it yourself but you are a leader dor your make a decent king some day i dont want to be kingl he protested she leaned down and kissed him on the ups i just had to tell you lbats all dor lay there after she moved away his emotions mixed the kiss had been excruciatingly sweet but the words sweeter yet he tried to review the recent action to fathom where he might have been heroic but it was all a nightmare jumble despite the absence of the night mares he had simply done what had to be done on the spur of the moment sometimes on the very jagged edge of the moment and had been lucky he didnt like depending on luck it was not to be trusted even now some horrendous unluck could be pursuing them he almost thought he heard it through the cloudbank a kind of leathery swish ing in the air then a minor kind of hell broke loose the head of a dragon poked through the cloud uttering a raucous scream suddenly the entire party was awake and on its feet the wy verns chet cried the ones whose nest we swamped they have found us there was no question of avoiding trouble the wyvems attacked the moment they appeared in this first contact it was every person for himself doris magic sword flashed in his hand stabbing expertly at the vulnerable spots of the wyvern nearest him the wyvem was a small dragon with a barbed tail and only two legs but it was agile and vi cious the sword went unerringly for the beasts heart but glanced off the scales of its breast the dragon was past in a moment it was flying while dor was stationary and contact was fleeting there were a number of the wyvems and they were expert flyers smash was standing his own as one ogre was more than a match for a dragon of this size but chet had to gallop and dodge madly to avoid trouble he whirled his lasso trying to snare the wyvem but so far without success irene was in the most trouble dor charged across to her grow a plant he cried ill protect you a wyvem oriented on them and zoomed in its narrow lance of fire shooting out ahead cloud evaporated in the path of the flame leav ing a trench they had to scramble aside some protectionl irene snarled her complexion was turning green she was afraid but doris magic sword slashed with the uncanny accuracy inher ent in it and lopped off the tip of a dragons wing the myem squawked in pain and rage and wobbled partly out of control and finally disappeared into the cloud there were sputtering sounds and a trail of smoke fusing with the cloud vapor where the dragon went down it was a strange business with doris party standing on the puffy white surface the dragons passing through it as if it were vapor which of course it was the dragons had the advantage of maneu verability and concealment while the people had the leverage of a firm anchorage but dor knew the wyvems could undercut the peo ples footing by burning out the clouds beneath them all the dragons needed to do was think of it fortunately wyverns were not very smart their brains were small since any expendable weight was sac rificed in the interest of better flight and what brains they had were kept too hot by the fire to function well wyvems were designed for fighting not thinking irene was growing a plant evidently she had saved some salve for it it was a tangler as fearsome a growth as the kraken seaweed but one that operated on solid landor cloud in moments it was big enough to be a threat to all in its vicinity try to get the tree be tween you and the dragon irene advised stepping back from the vegetable monster dor did so when the next wyvem came at him he scooted around behind the tangler the dragon hardly expecting to encoun ter such a plant in the clouds did a double take and banked off but the tangler shot out a tentacle and hooked a wing it drew the wyvem in wrapping more tentacles about it like a spider with a fly the dragon screamed biting and clawing at the plant but the tangler was too strong for it the other wyvems heeded the call they zoomed in toward the tangler chet lassoed one as it passed him the dragon turned ferociously on him biting into his shoulder then went on to the plant three wyvems swooped at the tangler jet ting their fires at it there was a loud hissing foulsmelling steam ex panded outward but a tentacle caught a second dragon and drew it in no one tangled with a tangler without risk wed better get out of here irene said whoever wins this bat tle wt be after us next dor agreed he called to grundy and smash and they went to join chet the centaur was in trouble bright red blood streamed down his left side and his arm hung uselessly leave me he said i am now a liability were all liabilities dor said irene grow some more healing plants i dont have any she said we have to get down to ground and fmd one then i can make it grow we cant get down chet said not until night when perhaps fog will form in the lower reaches and we can walk down that youll bleed to death by night dor protested he took off his shirt the new one irene had made for him ill try to bandage your wound thenwell see here ill do it irene said you men arent any good at this sort of thing dor you question the cloud about a fast way down dor agreed while she worked on the centaur he interrogated the cloud they stood on where are we in relation to the land of xanth we have drifted south of the land the cloud reported south of the land what about centaur isle south of that too the cloud said smugly weve got to get back there sorry im going on south you should have disembarked an hour ago you must talk to the wind if it changed dor knew it was useless to talk to the wind he had tried that as a child the wind always went where it wanted and did what it pleased without much regard for the preferences of others how can we get down to earth in a hurry jump off me im tired of your weight anyway youll make a big splash when you get there i mean safely it was pointless to get mad at the inanimate but dor was doing it what do you need for safely a tilting ramp of clouds going to solid land no none of that here closest we have is a storm working up to the east its turbulence reaches down to the water dor looked east and saw a looming thunderhead it looked familiar he was about to have his third brush with that particular storm that will have to do youll be sorree the cloud sang those theads are mean ones and that one has a grudge against you im a cumulus humius myself the most humble of fleecy clouds but that one enough dor said shortly he was already nervous enough about their situation the storm had evidently exercised and worked up new vaporous muscle for this occasion this would be badbut what choice did they have they had to get chet down to landand to centaur islequickly ihe party hurried across the cloud surface toward the storm the thunderhead loomed larger and ugher as they approached its huge damp vortex eyes glared at them and its nose dangled downward in the forin of a whirling cone new muscle indeed but the slanting sunlight caught the fringe turning it bright silver on the near side a silver lining irene exclaimed id like to have some of that maybe you can catch some on the way down dor said gruffly she had criticized him for saving the gold after all now she wanted silver a wyvem detached itself from the battle with the tangler and winged toward them look out behind enemy at six oclock grundy cried dor turned wearily drawing his sword but this dragon was no longer looking for trouble it was flying weakly seeming dazed before it reached them it sank down under the cloud surface and disappeared the tangler must have squeezed it grundy said the tangler looks none too healthy itself irene pointed out she was probably the only person hi xanth who would have sympathy for such a growth dor looked back sure enough the tentacles were wilting that was quite a fight she concluded but if the tangler is on its last roots dor asked why did the wyvem fly away from it its not like any dragon to quit a fight unfinished they had no answer then ahead of them the wyvem pumped itself above the cloud again struggling to clear the thunderstorm ahead but it failed it could not attain sufficient elevation it blundered on into the storm the storm grabbed the dragon tossed it about and caught it in the whirling cone the wyvem rotated around and around scales flying out and got sucked into the impenetrable center of the cloud i hate to see a storm feeding grundy muttered that things worse than the tangler irene breathed it gobbled that dragon just like that we must try to avoid that cone dor said theres a lot of vapor outside it if we can climb down that near the silver lffng my hooves are sinking in the cloud chet said alarmed now they found that the same was happening to all their feet the formerly bouncy surface had become mucky whats happening irene demanded her tone rising warningly toward hysteria vkats happening dor asked the cloud your salve is losing its effect dolt the thunderhead gusted sounding bluffed the salve did have a time emit of a day or so quickly they applied more that helpedbut still the cloud surface was tacky i dont like this grundy said maybe our old salve was wearing off but the new application isnt much better i wonder if theres any connection with the wilting tangler and the fleeing wyvern thats it chet exclaimed wincing as his own animation shot pain through his shoulder were drifting out of the ambience of magic thats why magic things are in trouble that has to be it dor agreed dismayed the clouds are south of xanthand beyond xanth the magic fades were on the verge of mundania for a moment they were silent shocked the worst had befallen them well fall through the cloud irene cried wer fall into the sea the horrible mundane sea lets run north grundy urged back into magic well only come to the edge of the cloud and fall off irene wailed dor do something how he hated to be put on the spot like that but he already knew his course the storm he said weve got to go through it getting down before were out of magic but that storm hates us that storm will have problems of its own as the magic fades dor said they ran toward the thunderhead who glared at them and tried to organize for a devastating strike but it was indeed losing cohesion as the magic diminished and could not concentrate properly on them as they stepped onto its swirling satellite vapors their feet sank right through as if the surface were slush the magic was certainly fading and very little time remained before they lost all support and plummeted yet as they encountered the silver lining dor realized there was an unanticipated benefit here this slow sinking caused by the loss of effect of the salve was allowing them to descend in moderate fashion and just might bring them safely to ground they didnt have to depend on the ambience of the storm they caught hold of each others hands so that no one would be lost as the thickening winds buffeted them smash put one arm around chets barrel holding him firm despite the centaurs useless arm they sank into the swirling fog feeling it about them like stew dor was afraid he would be smothered but found he could breathe well enough there was no salve on his mouth cloud was mere vapor to his head all that silver lining irene said and i cant have any of it the swirl of wind grew stronger they were thrown about by the buffets and drawn into the central vortexbut it now had only a fraction of its former strength and could not fling them about as it had the wyvern they spiraled down through it as the magic continued to dissipate dor hung on to the others hoping the magic would hold out long enough to enable them to land softly but if they splashed into deep water after an interminably brief descent they did indeed splash into deep water the rain pelted down on them and monstrous waves surged around them dor had to let go of the hands he held in order to swim and let the others swim he held his breath stroked for the surface of the current wave and when his head broke into the troubled air he cried help spread the word did any magic remain yesa trifle help the wave echoed faintly help the next wave repeated help help help the other waves chorused a raft appeared someones drowning a voice cried where are you here dor gasped five of us then a cruel wash of water smacked into his face and he was choking after that all his waning energies were taken trying to stay afloat in the turbulence and he was not quite succeeding then strong hands caught him and hauled him onto a broad wooden raft the others dor gasped four others weve got them king dor his rescuer said waterlogged but safe chetmy friend the centaurhes woundedneeds healing elwrj the rescuer smiled he has it of course do you suppose we would neglect our own doris vision cleared enough to take in the tuff nature of his rescuer it was an adult centaur wewe made it welcome to the waters of the coast of centaur isle your majesty but dor spluttered you arent supposed to know who i am the good magician humfrey ascertained that you were in trouble and would require assistance when you touched water the zombie master asked us to establish a watch for you in this locale you are a most important person in your own land king dor it is fortunate we honored their request we do not ordinarily put to sea during a funnelstorm oh dor was abashed uh did they tell you what my mission was only that you were traveling the land of xanth and making a survey of the magic therein is there something else we should know uh no thanks dor said at least that much had been salvaged the centaurs would not have taken kindly to the notion of a magician among thema centaur magician dor did not like deceit but felt this much was necessary irene appeared soaked through bedraggled and unkempt but still quite pretty somehow she always seemed prettiest to him when she was messed up perhaps it was because then the artifice was gone i guess you did it again dor she said taking his hand you got us down alive but you didnt get your silver lining he reminded her she laughed some other time after the way that storm treated us i dont want any of its substance anyway then the centaurs led them into the dry cabin of the raft irene continued to hold his hand and that pleased dor it was dark by the time the centaurs raft reached port chet was taken to a vet for treatment as the wyvems bite seemed to be resisting the healing elixir dor and his companions were given a good meal of blues and oranges and greens and conducted to a handsome stable for the night it commanded a fine view of a succulent pasture was adequately ventilated and was well stocked with a water trough hay and a block of salt they stared at the accommodations for a moment then smash stepped inside say hay he exclaimed and plunked himself down into it with a crash that shook the building good idea grundy said and did likewise only the shaking of the building was somewhat less after another moment dor and irene settled down too the hay was comfortable and sweetly scented conducive to relaxation and thoughts of pleasant outdoors irene held doris hand and they slept well in the morning a stately elder centaur male entered the stable he seemed oddly diffident i am gerome the elder of the isle king dor i am here to apologize for the error you were not supposed to be bedded here dor got hastily to his feet brushing hay off his crumpled clothing while irene straightened out her skirt and brushed brown hay out of her green hair elder were so glad to be rescued from the ocean and fed and housed that these accommodations seem wonderful well be happy to complete our business and go home this was never intended as an official occasion the stable was just fine the centaur relaxed you are gracious your majesty we mamtain assorted types of housing for assorted types of guests i fear a ghtch got to the program we try to fence them out but they keep sneaking in they infest castle roogna also dor said we catch them in humane glitch traps and deport them to the far forests but they breed faster than we can catch them come the centaur said we have attire and food for you he paused one other thing some of our number attended the good magicians wedding they report you performed splendidly in trying circumstances magician humfrey had intended to give you an item it seems the distractions of the occasion caused it to slip his mind the centaur almost smiled he does tend to be forgetful dor said remembering the lapse about notifying the human elders about king trents excursion to mundania accordingly the gorgon asked one of our representatives to convey the item to you here gerome held out a small object dor accepted it thank you elder uh what is it i believe it is a magic compass note that the indicator points directly to youthe one magician on the isle dor studied the compass it was a disk within which a needle of light showed this isnt pointing to me gerome looked why so it isnt but im sure it was until a moment ago that is how i was certain it had reached its proper destination perhaps i misunderstood its application it may have pointed to you only to guide us to you certainly it assisted our search for you yesterday afternoon that must be it dor agreed the good magician might have anticipated the problem with the storm and sent down the one thing that would bring help to him unerringly humfrey was funny that way doing things anachronistically dor tucked the compass in a pocket with the diamonds and sunstone and changed the subject chethow is he doing this morning gerome frowned i regret to report that he is not fully recovered apparently he was bitten near the fringe of magic he was dor agreed and a mundane infection got in this is resistive to magic healing perhaps on the other hand it was merely the delay in applying the elixir we cannot be certain odd things do happen at the fringe of magic he is in no danger of demise but i fear it will be some time before his arm is again at full strength maybe we can help him back at castle roogna dor said uncomfortable he is our friend without him we could not have made it down here i feel responsible he must not indulge in any further violence until he recovers completely gerome said gravely it is not at all wise to take a magicresistive illness lightly comehe awaits you at breakfast on the way there gerome insisted they pause at the centaur clothier dor was outfitted with bright new trousers shirt and jacket all intricately woven and comfortable irene got a dress set that set her off quite fetchingly though it was not her normal shade of green even smash and grundy got handsome jackets the ogre had never worn clothing before but his jacket was so nice he accepted it with pride this material irene said theres something magic about it gerome smiled as you know we centaurs frown on personal magic talents but we do work with magic the apparel is woven by our artisans from iron curtain thread and is strongly resistant to penetration by foreign objects we use it for vests during combat to minimize injuries but this must be very precious stuff dor said your welfare is important to us your majesty had you and chet been wearing this clothing the wyverns teeth would not have penetrated his shoulder dor appreciated the rationale it would be a big embarrassment to the centaurs if anything happened to the temporary king of xanth or his friends during their stay here thank you very much they entered a larger room whose tall ceiling was supported by ornate white columns huge windows let in the slanting morning sunlight lending a pleasant warmth and brilliance on an enormous banquet table in the center were goblets of striped sardonyx and white alabaster doubly pretty in the sun the plates were of green jadeite a kings ransom irene whispered i think they trotted out the royal crockery for you dor i wish they hadnt he whispered back suppose something gets broken keep an eye on smash she said that made dor more nervous than ever how would the ogre handle the delicate tableware they were given high chairs for the table was too tall for them several more centaurs joined them male and female introduced as the other elders of the isle they stood at the table centaurs had no way to use chairs and the table was crafted to their height the food was excellent dor had been halfway fearful that it would be whole oats and cracked corn with silage on the side but the ghtch of the stablehousing was not repeated there was a course of yellow corraneal mush from cornmeal bushes and fine chocolate milk from cocoanuts for sweetening there was an unusual delicacy caged honey said to be manufactured by a rare species of bees n ported from mundania dor had encountered sneezebees and the spelling bee but it was odd indeed to think of honeybees smash to doris surprise and relief turned out to be a connoisseur of delicate stone his kind he informed them happily in rhyme had developed their power by smashing and shaping different kinds of minerals they could not turn out goblets as nice as these but did produce pretty fair marble and granite blocks for walls and buildings indeed gerome agreed some fine cornerstones here were traded from ogres those corners stand up to anything smash tossed down another couple mugs of milk pleased few other creatures recognized the artistic propensities of ogres chet was there looking somewhat wan and eating very little which showed that his injury was paining him somewhat there was nothing dor could do except politely ignore it as his friend obvi ously wanted no attention drawn to his weakness chet would not be traveling with them again for some time after the meal they were treated to a guided tour of the isle dor was conscious of king trents reference to isle or aisle in the vision if it were the only way dor could reach him he must be alert for the mechanism somewhere here perhaps was the key he needed the outside streets were broad paved with packed dirt suitable for hooves and were banked on the curves for greatest galloping com fort at intervals were low wooden props that the centaurs could use to knock the dottle from their feet the buildings were mixed some were stables while others were more like human residences i see you are perplexed by our premises gerome said our ar chitecture derives from our origin in due course you shall see our historical museum where this will be made clear during their walk dor surreptitiously looked at the magic com pass good magician humfrey had sent him he had believed he had figured out its application compassdo you point to the nearest and strongest magician who is not actually using you he asked sure the compass replied any fool knows that so it was now pointing to the centaur magician once dor got free of these formalities he would follow that needle to the object of his quest they stopped at the extensive metalworking section of town here were blacksmiths and silversmiths and coppersmiths fashioning the strange shoes that important centaurs used and the unusual instruments they employed for eating and the beautiful pots they cooked with they had no trouble harvesting plenty of silver linings irene commented enviously ahyou appreciate a silver lining gerome inquired he showed the way to another craftshop where hundreds of silver linings were being fashioned as the fringes of jackets and such this is for you and the centaur gave her a fresh fur with a fine silver lining sewn in which gleamed with the splendor of sunlight after storm ooooh irene breathed melting into it its soft as cloud dor had to admit privately that the decorative apparel did enhance her appearance one centaur was working with a new mundane import a strong light metal called aluminum king trents encouragement of trade with mundania has benefited us gerome remarked we have no natural alwninum in xanth but the supply is erratic because we never seem to be able to trade with the same aspect of mundania twice in succession if that problem could be ameliorated it would be a great new day for commerce hes working on it irene said but she had to stop there they had agreed not to spread the word about king trents situation they saw the weaving section where great looms integrated the threads garnered from assorted sources the centaurs were expert spinners and weavers and their products varied from silkenly fine cloth to heavy ruglike mats dor was amazed it had never occurred to him that the products of blanket trees could be duplicated artificially how wonderful it would be to be able to make anything one needed instead of having to wait for a plant to grow itl another section was devoted to weapons centaurs were superlative bowmen and spearmen and here the fine bows and spears were fashioned along with swords clubs and ropes a subsection was devoted to armor which included woven metal clodftg as well as helmets greaves and gauntlets smash tried on a huge gauntlet and flexed it into a massive fist me see he inquired hopefully by all means gerome said ihere is a boulder of quartz we mean to grind into sand practice on it smash marched to the boulder lifted his fist high and smashed it down upon the boulder there was a crack of sound like thunder and a cloud of dust and sand erupted from the point of contact enveloping him when it settled they saw the ogre standing kneedeep in a mound of sand a blissful smile cracking his ugly face love glove he grunted reluctantly removing it wisps of smoke rose from its fingertips then it is yours together with its mate gerome said you have saved us much labor reducing that boulder so efficiently smash was thrilled with the gift but dor was silent he knew ogres were strong but smash was not yet grown the metal gauntlet must have enhanced his power by protecting his hand as an adult smash would be a truly formidable creature with almost too much power that could get him exiled from the vicinity of castle roogna but more than that dor was disquieted by something more subtle the centaurs were evidently giving choice gifts to each member of doris partyfine protective clothing plus whatever else offered such as irenes silver lining and smashs gauntlets this might be a fine gesture of friendshipbut dor distrusted such largesse what was the purpose in it king trent had warned him once to beware strangers bearing gifts did the centaurs suspect dofs mission and were they trying to affect the manner he pursued it why he had no ready answer they viewed the centaur communal kitchen where foodstuffs from a wide area were cleaned and prepared viously the centaurs ate very well in fact in most respects they seemed to be more advanced and to have more creature comforts than the human folk of the castle roogna area dor found this unsettling he had somehow expected to find centaur isle inhabited by a few primitives galloping around and fighting each other with clubs now that he was here centaur isle seemed more like the center of culture whue castle roogna appeared to be the hinterland the power of magic was surely weaker here near the fringe which helped explain why most centaurs seemed to lack talents whiie those farther toward the center of xanth were showing them how was it then that these deficient centaurs were doing so well it was almost as if the lack of magic was an advantage causing them to develop other skills that in the end brought more success than the magic would have this was nonsense of course but as he viewed the things of the isle he almost believed it suppose just suppose that there way a correlation between success and the lack of magic did it then follow that mundania the land completely devoid of magic was likely to become a better place to hve than xanth that brought a puff of laughter he had followed his thought to its logical extremity and found it ludicrous therefore the thought was false it was ridiculous on the face of it to think of drear mundania as a better place than xanth the others were looking askance at him because of his pointless laughter uh just a chain of thought that snapped in a funny place dor explained then fearing that wasnt enough to alleviate their curiosity he changed the subject uh if i may inquiresince you centaurs seem to be so well organized herecertainly better than we humans arehow is it that you accept human government you dont seem to need us and if it ever came to war you could destroy us dor irene protested what a thing to say you are too modest your majesty gerome said smiling tbere are several compelling reasons first we are not interested in empire we prefer to leave decisions of state to others while we forward our arts crafts skills and satisfaction since you humans seem to like the tedious process of government we gladly leave it to you much as we leave the shaping of granite stones to the ogres and the collection of diamonds to the dragons it is far simpler to acquire what we need through trade well i suppose so dor agreed dubiously second you humans have one phenomenal asset that we generally lack gerome continued evidently embarked on a favorite subject you can do magic we utilize magic but generally cannot perform it ourselves nor would we wish to we prefer to borrow it as a tool can you imagine one of us prevailing over king trent in an altercation he would convert us all to inchworms if he could get close enough dor said he remembered that this matter had been discussed before chet had pointed out how the centaurs skill with the bow and arrow nullified trents magic was there an answer to that dor would much prefer to believe that magic was the supreme force in xanth who can govern from a distance gerome inquired rhetorically armies in the field are one thing governing people is another king trents magic enables him to govern as does your own even your lesser talents are far beyond our capacities was the centaur now gifting him with flattery but centaurs can do magic dor protested our friend chet please gerome said you humans perform natural functions too but we do not speak pubhcly of such things in deference to your particular sensitivities it is a fact that we centaurs were not aware of any personal magic talents through most of our history and even now suspect manifestations are an aberration so we have never con sidered personal magic as being available for our use and would pre fer that no further mention of this be made uh sure dor agreed awkwardly it seemed the other centaurs were just as sensitive and unreasonable about this as doris tutor cherie was humans were indeed finicky about certain natural func tions as the centaur elder had remin ded him while centaurs were not while humans were not finicky about the notion of personal magic the way the centaurs were probably one attitude made as much nonsense as the other but how would the citizens of centaur isle react to the news that a full magician of their species was among them eventually dor would have to tell them this mission could be awkward indeed third we honor an understanding dating from the dawn of our species gerome continued leaving the distasteful subject of magic behind like a clod of manure we shall not indulge in politics and will never compete with our human brethren for power so even if we desired empire and had the ability to acquire it we would not do so we would never renege on that binding commitment and the centaur looked so serious that dor dared not pursue the matter fur their at last they came to the historical museum this was an impres sive edifice of red brick several stories high with small windows and a forbidding external aspect but it was quite interesting inside being crowded with all manner of artifacts there were samples of all the centaurs products going back decade by decade to before the first wave of human conquest dor could see how the earlier items were cruder the craftsmen were still improving their skills everything was identified by neat plaques providing dates places and details of manufacture the centaurs had a keen sense of historyl during the tour dor had continued to sneak glances at the magic compass he was gratified to see that it pointed toward the museum maybe the magician was here and this is our keeper of records gerome said introducing a middleaged bespectacled centaur he knows where all the bodies are hidden amolde the archivist precisely amolde agreed dourly peering over his glasses the demon beauregard was the only other creature dor had seen wearing such devices so nice to encounter you and your party king dor now if you will excuse me i have a new shipment of artifacts to catalogue he retreated to his cubby where objects and papers were piled high amolde is dedicated to his profession gerome explained hes uite intelligent even by our standards but not sociable i doubt there is very much about xanth natural history he doesnt know recently he has been picking up items from the fringe of magic he made one trip to an island to the south that may have taken him entirely out of magic though he denies this prior to the time king trent dropped the shield that enclosed xanth such expeditions were impossible dor remembered the shield for his tutor had drilled him on it cherie centaur was particularly strong on social history the waves of human conquerors had become so bad that one king of xanth had finally put a stop to further invasion by setting up a magic shield that killed any living thing that passed through it but that had also kept the inhabitants of xanth in the mundanes it seemed came to believe that xanth did not exist at all and that magic was impossible since none of it leaked out any more there had it seemed been many recorded cases of magic that mundanes had witnessed or experienced all these were now written off as superstition perhaps that was the mundanes way of reconciling themselves to the loss of something as wonderful as enchantment to pretend it did not exist and never bad existed but xanth had suffered too in time it had become apparent that mankind in xanth needed those periodic infusions of new blood however violently they came for without the waves there was a steady attrition of pure human beings first people developed magic talents later generations became magic themselves either mating with animals to form various composite species like harpies or fauns or merfolk or simply evolving into gnomes or giants or nymphs so king trent had lowered the shield and brought in a number of settlers from mundania with the understanding that these new people would be awn on as warriors to repel any future violent invasion that might come so far there had been nonebut the waves had been a pattern of centuries not of decades so that meant little immigration was an uncertain business as it was far easier to go from xanth to mundania than the other way around at least for individual people but the human situation in xanth did seem to be improving now dor could appreciate how an intelligent inquisitive centaur would be eager to begin cataloguing the wonders of mundania which long had been a great mystery it was still hard to accept the notion that here was a region where magic was inoperative and where people survived they moved on down the narrow hall dor checked the compass againand found that it pointed directly toward amolde the archivist could he be the centaur magician the threat to the welfare of xanth the important business dor had to attend to that didnt seem to make much sense for one thing amolde showed no sign of magic ability for another he was hardly the type to threaten the existing order he was dedicated to recording it for yet another he was a settled middleaged person of a species that lived longer than man magic talents might not be discovered early but the evidence was that they existed from birth on why should this talent become an issue now perhaps a century into amoldes life so it must be a mistake doris target had to be a young centaur perhaps a newborn one yet as dor moved about the building only half listening to the presentation the compass pointed unerringly toward amoldes cubby maybe amolde was married dor thought with exasperated inspiration maybe he had a baby centaur hidden there among the papers the compass could be pointing to the foal not to amolde yes that made sense if you dont get that glazed look off your face the elder will notice irene murmured jolting doris attention after that he concentrated and managed to assimilate more of the material after all there was nothing he could do about the magician at the moment at length they completed the tour is there anything else you would like to see king dor gerome inquired no thank you elder dor replied i think ive seen enough shall we arrange to transport your party back to your capital we can contact your conjurer this was awkward dor had to complete his investigation of the centaur magician so he was not ready to leave this isle but it was obvious that his mission and discovery would not be well received here he could not simply tell the centaur elders the situation and beg their assistance to them that would be obscenity and their warm hospitahty would abruptly chill a persons concept of obscenity was not subject to reasonable discussion for of course the concepts of obscenity and reason were contradictory in fact that might be the root of the centaurs accommodation and generosity maybe they suspected his mission so were keeping him reined at all times in the guise of hospitality how could he decune to go home promptly after they had seemingly catered to his needs so conscientiously they wanted him off the isle and he had little chance to balk their wish uh could i talk with chet before i decide anything dor asked of course he is your friend again gerome was the soul of accommodation that made dor more nervous ironically he was almost sure now that he was being managed and my other friends dor added we need to decide things together it was arranged in the afternoon the five got together in a lovely little garden site of guaranteed privacy you all know our mission dor said it is to locate a centaur magician and identffy his talentand perhaps bring him back to castle roogna but the centaurs dont much like magic in themselves to them its obscene they react to it somewhat the way we do towell like people looking up irenes skirt dont start on that she said coloring slightly i think the whole world has been looking up my skirt recentlyl your fault for having good legs grundy said she kicked at him but the golem scooted away dor noted that she hadnt tried very hard to tag grundy she was not really as displeased as she indicated i happen to be in a position to understand both views chet said iris left arm was now in a sling and he wore a packing of antipain potions his outlook seemed improved but not his immediate physical condition i admit that both centaur and human foibles are foolish centaurs do have magic talents and should be proud to display them and irene does have excellent limbs for her kind and should be proud to display them and thafs not all all rightf irene snapped her color deepening point made we cant go blabbing our mission to everyone on centaur isle they just wouldnt understand yes dor said glad to have this confirmation of his own analysis of the situation so now i need some group input you see i believe i have located the centaur magician it has to be the offspring of arnolde the archivist amolde chet asked i know of him hes been at his job for fifty years my mother speaks of him hes a bachelor he has no offspring hes more interested in figures of the nwnerical persuasion than in figures of fillies no offspring then it must be amolde himself dor said the magic compass points directly to him i dont know how it is possible since im sure no such magician was known in xanth before but i dont believe good magician humfrey would give me a bad signal on this whats his talent irene asked i dont know i didnt have a chance to find out i could ask around grundy offered if there are any plants or animals around his stall they should know i can ask around myself dor said there are bound to be inanimate objects around his stall thats not the problem the elders are ready to ship us home now and i have no suitable pretext to stay even one night might be enough but what do i ten them without lying or alienating them king trent told me that when in doubt honesty is the best policy but in this case im in doubt even about honesty again i perceive both sides chet said honesty is bestexcept perhaps in this case my kind can become exceedingly omery when faced with an incompatible concept while i would not wish to imply any criticism of my sire the others knew what he meant chester centaurs way to handle something he didnt like was to pick it up in a chokehold and shake the stuffing from it the centaurs of centaur isle were more civilized but just as ornery underneath tell them your business is unfinished and you need another day irene suggested thats the literal truth that simplistic as it sounds is an excellent answer chet said then go out at night and spy out amoldes talent have grundy scout the route first so you dont arouse suspicion that way you can complete the mission without giving offense and go home tomorrow but suppose we need to take him with us a full magician should come to castle roogna no problem at all chet said i can tell you right now he wont come and no magician can be compelled iberes hardly a thing that could dislodge the archivist from his accustomed rounds knowing his talent should be enough irene said our own council of elders can decide what to do about it once they have the information dor was relieved yes of course tonight then the rest of you can sleep fat chance irene said and smash grunted agreement were in this mess together youre certain to foul it up by yourself i appreciate your vote of confidence as always dor said wryly but he also appreciated their support he was afraid he would indeed foul it up by himself but hadnt wanted to ask them to participate in what might be a nasty business that night they put their plot into execution grundy went out first his tiny dark body concealed by the darkness there was no trouble and soon all of them left their comfortable humanstyle beds chet excepted as he was separately housed and could not readily leave his stall unobservedand moved into the moonlit evening they had no difficulty seeing because the moon was nearing fuu and gave plenty of light they found the museum without trouble dor had assumed it would be closed for the night but to his dismay it was lighted who is in there he asked the ground amolde the archivist the ground replied you have to be pretty stupid not to know hes been working late all week cataloguing those new mundane artifacts though what he finds so interesting about such junk whats his magic talent his what the ground asked bewildered you know of no magic associated with him dor asked surprised normally people were very free about what they did around only inanimate things and it was hard to avoid the inanimate that was what made doris own talent so insidious the complete privacy people thought they had became complete disclosure in his presence he tried not to pry into what did not rightly concern him but most people including his own parents normally stayed clear of him without making any issue of it the people who had traveled with him were different for their separate reasons when he thought about it he appreciated it immensely even irene who professed to value her privacy was not truly uncomfortable in doris presence she really didnt have to make any great play for him gratitude would haul him into her orbit any time she wished he knew she was accustomed to lack of privacy because of the way her mother was but still found it easier to get along with her than with other girls others got unduly upset when their clothing started telling dor their secrets dor glanced at the large round moon again it was amazing how that orb stimulated his thoughts along such lines meanwhile the ground had answered none at all centaurs dont do magic dor sighed i guess well have to go in and brace him directly they went in amolde had artifacts spread out all over a main table and was attaching tags to them and making notes there were fragments of stone and crockery and rusted metal i wish the archaeologists would get these classified sooner he grumbled this table is not available by day so i have to tag them at night then he did a startled double take what are you doing here the guest tour is over dor considered making a bald statement of purpose and decided against it he needed to get to know the centaur a little better before broaching so delicate a subject i have an important matter to discuss with you a uh private matter so i didnt bring it up during the tour amolde shrugged i have no inkling what the king of xanth would want with me just keep your hands off the artifacts and i will listen to what you have to impart mundane items are difficult to come by im sure they are dor agreed we came here by air riding the clouds and almost went beyond the limit of magic we were lucky we didnt fag mundania is no place for the creatures of xanth oh the centaur said without much interest did you see the southern island no we werent that far south we came down in sight of centaur isle there should have been plenty of magic my raft was powered by a propulsion spell and it never failed i was needlessly concerned evidently that island was mundane historically but is now magic the centaurs hands were busy affixing each tag neatly and making careful entries in a ledger he evidently liked his work tedious as it seemed and was conscientious i think we were north of it but we certainly had trouble dor said but there was a storm that could have disrupted the magic quite possible amolde agreed storms do seem to affect it the centaur seemed sociable enough now that they were not taking him away from his beloved work but dor still did not feel easy uh the elder gerome mentioned asome kind of pact the centaurs made with my kind back at the beginning do you have artffacts from that time indeed i do amolde said growing animated bones affowheads the hilt of an iron swordthe record is fragmentary but documents the legend the full truth may never be known sadly but we do have a fair notion uh if youre interestedim a magician i make things talk if youd like to question one of those old artifacts now amolde grew excited i had not thought of that magic is all right for you of course youre only human i pride myself on being reasonably realistic yes i would like to question an artifact are you familiar with the legend of centaur origin no not really dor said growing interested himself it would help me if i did know it then i could ask the artifact more specific questions back cbp thats circa before present one thousand eight hundred years the archivist intoned reverently the first man and first horseyou are aware of the nature of that animal front of a sea horse merged with the rear of a centaur yes like a nightmare only in the day dor said exactly these two the first of each kind we know of reached xanth from imundania xanth was already magic then its magic seems to have existed for many thousands of years the plants were already well evolvedyou do luiow what i mean by evolution how nickelpedes developed from centipedes urn yes the way individual species change with the times ah yes the king always has a centaur tutor so you would have been exposed to such material back then the dragons dominated the landone might term it the age of reptilesand there were no human hybrids and no dwarves trolls goblins or elves this man saw that the land was good he was able and clever enough to stay clear of the more predatory plants and to balk the dragons he was a warrior with a bow sword spear club and the ability to use them and a valiant spirit but though he found xanth delightful he was lonely he had it seemed fled his home tribewe like to think he was an honorable man who had run afoul of an evil kingsuch things do happen in mundania we understandand could not safely return there indeed in time a detachment of other warriors came after him intent on his murder there is an opacity about the manner mundanes may enter xanth normally people from the same mundane subsociety may enter xanth only if they are grouped together not separately but it seems these ones were after all able to followi dont pretend to understand this but perhaps it is a mere distortion of the legendat any rate they were less able than he and fell prey to the natural hazards of xanth all but two of them diedand these two severely wounded survived only because this first good manwe call him alpha for what reason the record does not divulgerescued them from peril and put healing balm on their wounds after that they declined to attack him any more they owed lifedebts to him and swore friendship instead there was a kind of honor in those days and we have maintained it since now they were three men with three fine mares they had salvaged none of them could leave xanth for news of their betrayal had somehow spread and enemies lurked just beyond the realm of magic or perhaps the mundane culture had somehow become alien one variant of the legend has reference to their attempt to return and discovery of babelthat they could no longer speak the language or comprehend the culture of the mundanians one of them had been a mercenary a paid soldier who it seemed spoke a different mundanian dialect but he spoke the same language as the others when they met in xanth we know this is a property of the magic of xanth all cultures and languages become one including the written language there is no language barrier between creatures of the same species for whatever reasoni might wish that the legend was absolutely firm and clear but must deal with a story line that fragments into mutually incompatible aspects each of which has elements that are necessary to the continuation of the wholea most intriguing riddlethe three men and their mounts were safe as long as they remained within the realm of magic they had come to understand and use so wellbut they longed for the companionship of women of their kind they wished to colonize the land but could only live on then exploring deep in new territory they came upon a spring on a lovely offshore island and all three drank deeply and watered their horses they did not know it was a spring of love that would compel instant love with the first creature of the opposite sex spied after drinking and so it happened that each man in that critical moment saw first his good mareand each mare saw her master and so it was that the species of the centaur began this is another of the perplexing distinctions between xanth and mundania in the latter kingdom representatives of different species are unable to interbreed to produce offspring while in xanth it is a matter of course though normally individuals are most attracted to their own species the offspring of these unions perceiving that their parents differed from themselves and that the masters were human beings who were possessed of the greater part of the intellect while the mares possessed the greater part of the strength learned to respect each species for its special properties the men taught their offspring all the skills they knew so well both mental and physical and commanded in return the right to govern this land of xanth in time the mares died after foaling many times and eventually the men died too leaving only the continuing species of centaur on the island but the tradition rereamed and when centuries later other men came and women too the centaurs accorded them the dominance of the kingdom so it continues to the present day thats beautfful irene said now i know why you centaurs have always supported us even when our kind was unworthy and why you served as our mentors you have been more consistent than we have been we have the advantage of cultural continuity yet it is a legend amolde reminded her we believe it but we have no detailed proof bring me an artifact dor said moved by the story he had no desire to mate with a creature of another species but could not deny that love matches of many types existed in xanth the harpies the merfolk the manticora the werewolves and vampirebatsall had obvious human and animal lineage and there were also many combinations of different animals like the chimera and griffin it would be unthinkable to deny the validity of these mixed species xanth would not be the same at all without them ill get you the proof but now the centaur hesitated i thought i wanted the proofbut now i am afraid it would be other than the legend there might be ugly elements in lieu of the beautiful ones perhaps our ancestors were not nice creatures i sheer away for the first time i discover a limit to my eagerness for knowledge perhaps it is best that the leg end remain unchallenged perhaps it is dor agreed now at last he felt the time had come to express his real concern since centaurs derive from men and men have magic talents oh i suppose some centaurs do have some magic amolde said in the manner of an openminded person skirting a closeminded issue but it has no bearing on our society we leave the magic like the governing to you humans but some centaurs doeven magician level oh you mean herman the hermit centaur amolde said the one who could summon the willowisps he was wronged i think he used his power to save xanth from the ravage of wiggles and gave his life in that effort eighteen years ago but of course though some magic has perforce been accepted recently in our society if another centaur magician appeared he too would be outcast we centaurs have a deep cultural aversion to obscenity dor found his task increasingly unpleasant he knew cherie centaur considered magic in her species to be obscene though her mate chester chets father had a magical talent cherie had adjusted to that situation with extraordinary difficulty there is one though a centaur magician amoldes brow wrinkled over his spectacles are you certain almost certain we have had a number of portents at castle roogna and elsewhere i pity that centaur viho is it now dor was unable to answer amolde looked at him the import dawning surely you do not mean to implyyou believe it is i at doris miserable nod the cen taur laughed uncertainly ibats impossible what magic do you think i have i dont know dor said then how can you make such a preposterous allegation the centaurs tail was swishing nervously dor produced the compass have you seen one of these amolde took the compass yes this is a magic compass it is pointing at you since you are a magician but when i hold it it points to you i cannot believe that amolde protested here take it back and stand by that mirror so i can see its face dor did as bid and amolde saw the needle pointing to himself his face turned a shade of gray but it cannot be i cannot be a magician it would mean the end of my career i have no magic it doesnt make sense to me dor agreed but good magician humfreys alarms point to a magician on centaur isle thats what brought me here yes our elders feared you had some such mischief in mind arnolde agreed staring at the compass then abruptly he moved no he cried and galloped from the room what now irene asked we follow dor said weve got to find out what his talent isand convince him we cant leave the job half done somehow im losing my taste for this job she muttered dor felt the same going after an anonymous magician was one thing tormenting a dedicated archivist was another but they were caught in the situation they followed the centaur though hardly in his prime easily outdistanced them but dor had no trouble picking up the trail for all he had to do was ask the surrounding terrain the path led south to the ocean he took his raft with the magic motor irene said well have to take another he must be going to that mundane island they preempted another raft after dor had questioned several to locate one with a suitable propulsionspell dor hoped this would not be construed as theft he had every intention of returning the raft but had to catch up with amolde and talk to him before the centaur did something more foolish than merely fleeing the storm had long since passed and the sea was glassy calm m the bright moonlight ihe centaurs raft was not in sight but the water reported its passage hes going for the formerly mundane island grundy said good thing it is magic now since were magical creatures did you suffer when the magic faded near the storm irene asked no i felt the samescared grundy admitted how about you smash this freak feel weak the ogre said in the knees irene said we all did shes knees please mes smash agreed irenes face ran a peculiar gamut from anger to embarrassment she decided the ogre was not trying to tease her he really wasnt that smart thank you smash your own knees are like the holes on twisted ironwood trunks the ogre went into a small bellow of delight that churned up waves behind them and shoved the raft forward at a faster pace she had found the right compliment the spell propelled them swiftly and soon the island came into sight then progress slowed somethings the matter dor said were hanging up on something but there was nothing the raft was free in the water unbothered by waves or sea creatures it continued to slow until it was hardly moving at all we would get one with a defective gospell irene complained whats the matter with you dor asked it iugnh the raft whispered hoarsely then was silent the magic irene cried were beyond the magic just as we were during the storm lets check this out dor said worried at least they were not in danger of falling from a cloud this time irene grow a plant she took a bottleneck seed grow she ordered the seed began to sprout hesitated then fell limp is there anything you can talk to grundy dor asked the golem spied some kelp in the water he made strange sounds at it there was no response smash try a feat of strength dor said the ogre picked up one of his feet uh no dor said quickly i mean do something strong stand on one finger or squeeze juice from a log smash put one paw on the end of one of the rafts logsupports he squeezed nothing happened me unprepared me awhd scared he said dor brought out his midnight sunstone now it possessed only the faintest internal glimmerand in a moment that too faded out so that answers two questions dor said trying to sound confident though in fact he was deeply alarmed first we are passing out of the region of magic the propulsionspell is defunct i cant talk to the inanimate and irene cant grow plants magically second its only our magic that fades not our bodies grundy cant translate the talk of other creatures and smash has lost his superhuman strengthbut both are alive and healthy irenes plants wont grow but she he paused looking at her what happened to your hair hair she took a strand and pulled it before her face eeek its faded aw just the greens gone grundy said looks better this way irene stunned did not even try to kick at him she like dor had never realized that her hair tint was magical in nature so mundania doesnt hurt us dor continued quickly it just inconveniences us well simply have to paddle the rest of the way to the island they checked the rafts supplies the centaurs were a practical species the raft was equipped with several paddles and a pole dor and irene took the former and smash the latter and grundy steadied the tiller it was hard work but they resumed progress toward the island how did amolde ever get so far ahead alone irene gasped he would have had an awful time paddling and steering finally they reached the beach there was amoldes raft drawn up just out of the water he moved it along all right grundy remarked he must be stronger than he looks tus is a fairly small island dor said he cant be far away well corner him smash you stand guard by the rafts and bellow if he comes back here the rest of us will try to run him down they spread out and crossed the island it had a distinctly mundanian aspect there was green grass growing that did not grab at their feet and leafy trees that merely stood in place and rustled only in the wind the sand was fine without being sugar and the only vines they saw made no attempt to writhe toward them how could the centaur have mistaken this for a spot within the realm of magic they discovered amolde at his refugea neat excavation exposing mundane artifacts the scholars place of personal identification apparently he was more than a mere compiler or recorder of information he did some field work too amolde saw them he had a magic lantern that illuminated the area as the moon sank into the sea no i realize i cannot flee the situation he said sadly the truth is the truth whatever it is and i am dedicated to the truth but i cannot believe what you say never in my life have i evinced the slightest degree of magic talent and i certainly have none now perhaps some of the magic of the artifacts with which i associate has rubbed off on me giving the illusion of how can you use a magic lantern here in mundania irene asked this is not mundania amolde said i told you that before the limits of magic appear to have extended reaching out far enough to include this island recently but our magic ceased dor said we had to paddle here impossible my raft spelled forward without intermission and there is no storm to disrupt the magic ambience try your talent now king dor ill warrant you will discover it operative as always speak ground dor said wondering what would happen okay chump the ground answered whats on your slow mind dor exchanged glances with irene and grundy astonishedand saw that irenes hair in the light of the lantern was green again its back he said the magics back yet i dont see how irene threw down a seed grow she ordered a plant sprouted rising rapidly into a lively raspberry bush bffrppp the plant sounded making obscene sounds at them all is this really a magic island grundy asked the nearest tree translating into its language the tree made a rustling response it says it isnow he reported dor brought out the sunstone again it was shining brightly how could the magic return so quickly irene asked my fatheir always said the limit of magic was pretty constant in fact he wasnt sure it varied at all ibe magic never left this island amolde said you must have passed through a flux an aberration perhaps after all a lingering consequence of yesterdays storm maybe so dor agreed magic is funny stuff ours certainly failedfor a while the centaur had a bright idea maybe the magic compass was affected by a smffar flux alad thrown out of kiter so it pointed to the wrong person doubt nagged dor i guess thats possible somethings certainly wrong if thats so i must apologize for causing you such grief it did seem strange to me that you should so suddenly manifest as a magiclan when such power remains with a person from birth to death yes indeed amolde agreed enthusiastically an error in the instrumentthat is certainly the most facile explanation of course i could not manifest as a magician after ninety years of pristine nonmagic so they had guessed correctly about one thing the centaur was close to a century old i guess we might as well go back now dor said we had to borrow a raft to follow you and its owner will be upset if it stays out too long feel no concern amolde said growing almost affable in his relief the rafts are communal property available to anyone at need however there would be concern if one were lost or damaged they walked back across the island the magic lantern brightening the vicinity steadily as they neared the two rafts they saw smash he was holding a rock in both hands squeezing as hard as he could a grimace of concentration and disgust making his face even uglier than usual suddenly the rock began to compress at length my strength the ogre exclaimed as the stone crumbled into sand you could never have done it you big boob if the magic hadnt come back the sand grumbled the magic returnedjust now dor asked something percolating in the back of his mind sure the sand said you should have seen this musclebrained brute straining i thought i had him beat then the magic came back just as you did mores the pity the magiccame with us dor asked are you dimwitted or merely stupid nitbrain the sand asked with a gravelly edge i just said that when was the magic here before dor asked only a ettle while ago hoiserear here can tell you he was here when it happened you mean this is normally a mundane island sure its always been mundane except when oll hooffegs around i think were on to sometlftg grundy said amolde looked stricken butbut how canthis is preposterousl we owe it to you and ourselves to verify this one way or an other dor said if the power of magic travels with you oh horriblel the centaur moaned it must not bel lets take another walk around the island dor said grundy you go with amolde and talk to the plants and creatures you encounter ask them how long magic has been here the rest of us win spread out and wait for amolde to approach if our magic fades out during his absence and returns when he comes near grudgingly the centaur cooperated he set out on a trot around the island pretty spry for his age the golem perching on his back no sooner were they on their way than doris magic ceased feg sunstone no longer shone and he could no longer talk to the inanimate it was evident that irene and smash were similarly discommoded in a few minutes the circuit was complete they compared notes the magic was with us all along grundy reported but all the plants and shellfish said it had come only when we were there when he go me not rhyme smash said angrily not even worth a dime that was extreme distress for the ogre dor had not realized that his rhyming was magicrelated maybe frustration had flustered himor maybe magic had shaped the lives of the creatures of xanth far more than had been supposed irenes hair smashs rhymes my potted petunia would not grow at all irene said but when the centaur came near it grew and got roaring drunk and my talent operated only when amolde was near dor said so my talent seems to be dependent on his presence here as with the rest of you since i am a tuff magician what does that make iwly a magicians magician irene said a catalyst for magic but i never performed any magic in my lifel amolde protested still somewhat in shock never you dont perfomi it you promote it dor said you represent an island of magic an extension of xanth into mundania wherever you go magic is there this is certainly a magiciaifs talent how could that be true when there was no indication of it in all my prior life i cannot have changedlll but now dor had an answer you left xanth only recently you said you came to this mundane island for research good magician humfreys magic indicators never oriented on you before because you are completely camouflaged in xanth proper you are like a section of mist in the middle of a cloud but when you left xanth your power manifested triggering the alarms once the indicators had oriented on you they continued to point you out maybe your presence makes magic slightly more effective since centaur isle is near the fringe of magic its like a bug on a distant leaf once you know exactly where it is you can see it but you cant locate it when it sits still and you dont even know it exists amoldes shoulders slumped and his coat seemed to lose luster he was an appaloosa centaur with white spots on his brown bank a natural blanket that made him quite handsome now the spots were fading out i fear you are correct my associates always considered this to be a mundane island i thought them mistaken but oh what havoc this wreaks on my career the profession of a lifetime ruined i can never return to the museum do the other centaurs have to know grundy asked i may be contamnated by obscene magic axnolde said gravely but it is beneath me to prevaricate dor considered the attitude of the various centaurs he had known he realized amolde was right the archivist could not conceal the truth and the other centaurs would not tolerate a centaur magician in their society they had exiled herman the hermit in the past generation then termed him a hero after he was dead some rewardl doris quest had gained him nothing and had destroyed the livelihood and pride of a decent centaur he felt responsible he had never wanted to hurt anyone this way the moon had been descending into the ocean now just before it got soaked it seemed to have swelled great and round and greenish its cheese was tantaffiffigly close dor gazed at it pondering its maplike surface could a column of smoke lead all the way up to the moon and could they use the salve some day tothen he suffered an awful realization the curse he cried the centaur glanced dourly at him you have certainly cursed me king dor the magic salve we used to tread the cloudsit had a curse atteched whoever used it would do some dastardly deed before the next full moon this is our deed we have forced you out of your satisfied existence and made you into something you abhor the curse made us do it such curses are a readily avoidable nuisance the centaur remarked ah that is required is an elementary cursecounterspeff there are dozens in our archives we dont even file them carefully ironic that this ignorance on your part should have such a serious consequence for me do something dor irene said what is there to be done amolde asked disconsolately am rendered at one fell stroke into an exile but dor cudgeling his brain under pressure had a sudden explosion of genius you take magic with you anywhere you go he said right into mundania this relates in all the three ways we were warned it is certainly a matter i must attend to for the existence of any new magician in xanth is the kings business it also could pose a threat to xanth for if you go out into mundania on your own taking that magic with you bad people could capture you and somehow use your magic for evil but most important somewhere in mundania is someone we fear is trapped or in trouble who perhaps needs this magic to escape now if i were to take you into mundania proper we could rescue my father irene exclaimed jumping up and down and clapping her hands in the manner of her kind she bounced phenomenally so that even the centaur paused to look as if regretting his species and his age oh dor i could kiss you and without waiting for his reaction she grabbed him and kissed him with joyful savagery on the mouth in that moment of hyperanimation she became very special radiant and compelling in the best sort of way but by the time he realized it she was already away and talking to the centaur amolde if you have to be exiled anyway you might as well come with us we dont care about your magicnot negatively i meanwe all of us have talents and think of the artifacts you can collect deep in mundania you can start your own museum and if you help rescue my father king trent the centaur was visibly wavering viously he did not like the notion of exile but could not return to his job on centaur isle and the centaurs around castle roogna are used to magic irene continued apace chester centaur plays a magic sffver flute and his uncle was herman the hermit he would be glad for your company and i believe i have little alternative amolde said heavily you will help us oh thank youl irene cried and she flung her arms about the centaurs forepart and kissed him too amolde was visibly startled but not entirely displeased his white spots wavered dor suffered a wash of jealousy thinking of the legend of the origin of the centaurs kisses between different species were not necessarily innocent as that legend showed but it seemed irene had convinced the centaur magician to help and that was certainly worthwhile then dor remembered another complication we cant just leave for mundania the council of elders would never permit it how can they prevent it irene asked glancing meaningfully at him but we must at least tell them chet can tell them he has to go home anyway dor tried to dissemble i dont know then irene focused her stare on him fullforce daring him to attempt to balk her she was extremely pretty in her challenge and dor knew their course was set she intended to rescue her father no mat ter what they sailed the two rafts back to centaur isle that night in the process they discovered that amoldes ambience of magic extended farthest toward the front perhaps fifteen paces and half that distance to the rear it was least potent to the sides going hardly beyond the centaurs reach it was in fact less an isle of magic than an aisle always preceding the centaurs march thus the second raft was able to precede amoldes raft comfortably or to follow it closely but not to travel beside it they had verified that the hard way having the magic propulsion fail until amolde turned to face them once they reentered the main magic of xanth amoldes power was submerged it seemed to make no difference how close he was or which way he faced there was no enhancement of enchantment near him but of course they had no way to measure the intensity of magic in his vicinity accurately grundy sneaked in to wake chet and explain the situation while amolde researched in his old tomes for the best and swiftest route to mundania he reported that there was the tunnel the sun used to return from the ocean east to its position of rising drying out and recharging along the way this tunnel would be suitable by day when the sun wasnit using it they could trot right along it but that would take us west irene protested my father left xanth to the north dor had to agree the standard route to mundania is across the northwest isthmus we must go there and hope to pick up traces of his passage we cant use the suns tunnel but its a long way to the isthmus and i dont think we want to make another trip like the one down the coast we might never get there are there any other good notions well tomorrow is destined to have intermittent showers arnolde said ibere should be a rainbow there is a spell in the archives for traveling the rainbow it is very fast for rainbows do not endure long there is some risk speed is what we need dor said remembering his dreamvisions where there had been a sensation of urgency i think ki trent is in trouble and needs to be rescued soon maybe not in the next day but i dont think we can afford to wait a month there is also the problem of mounting the rainbow amolde said now that he had accepted the distasteful notion of his own magic his mind was relating to the situation very readily perhaps it was because he was trained in the handling of information and knew how to organize it part of the rainbows magic as you know is that it appears equally distant from all observers with its two ends touching the ground equally far from them north and south we must ascend to its top then slide down quickly before it fades the salve grundy said we can mount smoke to a cloud and run across the cloud to the top of the rainbow if we start early be fore the rainbow forms you just dont understand the centaur said it will seem just as far from us when we board the cloud catching a rainbow is one of the hardest things to do i can see why dor muttered how can we catch one if it al ways retreats excise the eyes smash suggested covering his own gross orbs with his gauntleted mitts of course the monster is right amolde said not looking at smash whom he seemed to find objectionable that is the obvious solution it was hardly obvious to dor how can covering our eyes get us to the rainbow it can hardly appear distant if you dont look at it amolde said yes but i get it grundy said ve spot it then close our eyes and go to where we saw it and it cant get away because we arent lookag at it simple but somebody has to look at it or it isnt there irene protested sis it chet can look at it grundy said hes not going on it any way dor distrusted this but the others seemed satisfied lets get some sleep tonight and see what happens tomorrow he said hoping it all made sense they slept late but that was all right because the intermittent rain wasnt due until midmorning amolde dutifully acquainted the centaur elders with his situation as expected they encouraged him to depart the isle forever at his very earliest convenience without directly referring to the reason for his loss of status in their community a magician was not wanted here they could not be comfortable with him they would let it be known that amolde was retiring for reasons of health so as to preserve his reputation and they would arrange to break in a new achivist no one would know his shame to facilitate his prompt departure they provided him with a useful assortment of spells and counterspeus for his journey and wished him well the hypocrites irene exclaimed for fifty years amolde serves them well and now suddenly just becausei i said you would not comprehend the nuances of centaur society chet reminded her though he did not look comfortable himself irene shut up rebelliously dor liked her better for her feeling however it was time to leave centaur isle and not just because they had a new mission ihe intermittent clouds formed and made ready to shower dor set up a smudge pot and got a column of smudge angling up to intersect the cloud level they applied the salve to their feet and hands invoked the cursecounterspehs amolde distributed and marched up the column amolde adjusted to this odd climb remarkably well for his age he had evidently kept himself in traveling shape by making archaeological field trips for a moment they paused to turn back to face chet who was standing on the beach watching for the rainbow dor found himself choking up and could only wave i hope to see you again cousin amolde called chet was not related to him what he referred to was the unity of their magic talents and meet your sire and chet smiled appreciating the thought when they reached the cloud layer they donned blindfolds clouds dor said tell us where the best path to the top of the rainbow is dont let any of us step too near the edge of you what rainbow the nearest cloud asked ihe one that is about to fozm that my friend chet centaur will see from the ground oh that rainbow it isnt here yet it hasnt finished its business on the eastern coast of xanth well guide us to where its going to be why dont you open your eyes and see it for yourself the canny cloud asked the inanimate was often perverse and the many folds and convolutions of clouds made them smarter than average just guide us dor said aw but the cloud had to do it there was a popping sound behind them down on the ground ibats the popcorn i gave chet irene said i told him to set it off when he saw the rainbow now that rainbow is fixed in place as long as he looks at it and we dont we must be almost upon it are we dor asked the cloud yeah the cloud conceded grudgingly its right ahead though it has no head thats cumulus humor rainbow dor called sing out if you hear me back came the rainbows song tralalafolderol it sounded beautiful and multicolored they hurried over to it once they felt its smooth surface projecting above the cloud and climbed upon it they removed their blindfolds the rainbow could no longer work its deceptive magic ihe rainbow was fully as lovely as it sounded bands of red and yellow blue and green extended lengthwise and sandwiched between them where ground observers couldnt see them were the secret riches of the welkin bands of polkadot plaid and checkerboard some internal bands were translucent and some blazed with colors seldom imagined by man like fortissimo charm phon and torque it would have been easy to become lost in their wonders and irene seemed inclined to do just that but the rainbow would not remam here long it seemed rainbows had tight schedules and this one was due for a showing somewhere in mundania in half an hour some magic it seemed did extend to mundania dor wondered briefly whether the mundanes would have the same trouble actually catching up to a rainbow or whether there it would stay my in place regardless how the viewers moved amolde brought out his rainbowtravel span which was sealed in a paper packet he tore it openand abruptly they began to slide ihe speed was phenomenal they zoomed past the clouds then down into the faintly rainy region below plunging horrendously toward the sea to the north below them was the land of xanth a long peninsula girt by thin islands along the coastlines across the center of it was the jagged chasm of the gap that separated the northern half of xanth from the southern it appeared on no maps because no one remembered it but this was no map it was reality as viewed from the rainbow there were a number of lakes such as ogrechobee in the south but no sign of the human settlements dor knew were there man had simply not made much of an impression on xanth physically fun begunl smash cried joyfully eeekmy skirt rene squealed a the mischievous gusts whipped it up displaying her legs to the whole world dor wondered why she insisted on wearing a skirt despite such constant inconveniences pants of some kind would have solved the problems dedsavely then it occurred to him that she might not want that particular problem solved she was well aware that her legs were the finest features of a generally excellent body and perhaps was not averse to letting the world know it also if she constantly protested any inadvertent exposures that occurred how could anyone blame her for showing herself off she had a pretty good system going dor and grundy and amolde less sanguine about violence than the ogre and less modest than irene hung on to the sliding are of the rainbow and stared ahead and down with increasing misgiving how were they to stop once the end came the descent was drawing close at an alarming velocity the northern shoreline of xanth loomed rapidly larger the curlicues of beaches magnifying the ocean in this region seemed oddly reddish dor hoped that wasnt from the blood of prior travelers of the rainbow of course it wasnt how could he think such a thought then the travelspell reversed and they sed rapidly slower until as they reached the water at the end of the rainbow they were moving at no more than a running pace they plunged into the crimson water and swam for the shore to the north the color was not blood it was translucently thin up close dor was relieved now that he could no longer see it from the air dor remembered other details of xanth the length of it was northsouth with the narrowest portion near where his grandfather elder rolands village was in the middle north on the western side at the top xanth extended west linking to mundania by the isthmus they were headed forand somehow mundania beyond that isthmus seemed huge much larger than xanth dor decided that must be a misimpression surely mundania was about the same size as xanth or somewhat smaller how could a region of so little importance be larger especially without magic now they came to the shallows and waded through the dark red water to the beach that crimson bothered him as the color intensified near the tideline how could the normally blue water change color here in the mundane quadrant what magic could affect it here where no magic existed maybe some color leaked from the rainbow irene said following his thought well maybe of course there was the centaur aisle of magic now so that wherever they were was no longer strictly mundane yet the red water extended well beyond the area of temporary enchantment it seemed to be a regular feature of the region they gathered on the beach dripping pink water grundy and smash didnt mind but dor felt uncomfortable and irenes blouse and skirt were plastered to her body im not walking around this way and im not taking off my clothes she expostulated she felt in her seedbag which she had refilled at centaur isle and brought out a purple seed it seemed the bag was waterproof for the seed was dry grow she ordered it as she dropped it on the sand the thing sprouted into a hehotrope clusters of small purple flowers burst open aromatically warm dry air waited outward this plant did not really travel toward the sun it emulated the suns heat dehydrating things in the vicinity soon their clothing was dry again even smash and grundy appreciated this since both now wore the special jackets given them by the centaurs smash also shook out his gauntlets and dried them and irene spread her silverlined fur out nearby do we know where we go from here irene asked once she had her skirt and blouse properly fluffed out did king trent pass this way dor inquired of the landscape when the beachsand asked vithin the past month i dont think so they moved a short distance north and dor tried again again the response was negative as the day wore into afternoon and on into evening they completed their traverse of the isthmuswithout positive result ihe land had not seen the king maybe the queen stiff had an illusion of invisibility enchantment grundy suggested so nothing could see them her illusion wouldnt work here in mundania dummy irene retorted she was still miffed at the golem because of the way grundy had caused her to lose half her seeds to the eclectic eel she carried a little grudge a long time i am not properly conversant with king trents excursion arnolde said perhaps he departed xanth by another route but i know he came this way irene said you didnt even know he was leaving xanth grundy reminded her you thought he was inside xanth on vacation she shrugged that off as irrelevant but this is the only route out of xanth her voice was starting its hysterical tremor unless he went by sea dor said yes he could have done that she agreed quickly but he would have come ashore somewhere my mother gets seasick when shes in a boat too long all we have to do is walk along the beach and ask the stones and plants and watch for mundane monsters grundy said still needling her so they cant look up your i am inclined to doubt that countermagical species will present very much of a problem amolde said in his scholarly manner what he know he hoofed schmoe smash demanded evidently more than you you moronic oaf the centaur snapped back i have been studying mundania somewhat recently gamering information from immigrants and by most reports most mundane plants and animals are comparatively shy of course there is a certain margin for error as in all phenomena what dray he say smash asked perplexed by the centaurs vocabulary dray amolde repeated freshly affronted a dray is a low cart not a creature you ignorant monster i shag thank you to address me by my proper appellation whats the poop from the goop smeish asked dor stifled a laugh fuming it into a choking cough in this hour of frustration tempers were fraying and they could not afford to have things get too negative grundy opened his big mouth but dor managed to cover it in time the golem could only aggravate the situation with his natural penchant for insults it was irene who retained enough poise to alleviate the crisis you just dont understand a person of education smash he says the mundane monsters wont dare bother us while youre on guard oh so the ogre said mollified ignorant troglodyte the centaur muttered that set it off again me know he get the place of chet smash said angrily forming his gauntlets into horrendous fists so that was the root of the ogres ire he felt amolde had usurped the position of his younger centaur friend no thats not so dor started seeking some way to alleviate his resentment if their party started fracturing now before they were fairly clear of xanth what would happen once they got deep into mundania and he called you a cavernan smash grundy put in helpfully compliments no good me head like wood the ogre growled evidently meaning that he refused to be swayed by soft talk indubitably amolde agreed dor decided to leave it at that a more perfect understanding between ogre and centaur would only exacerbate things they walked along the beach sure enough nothing attacked them the trees were strange ovalleafed things with brownish inert bark and no tentacles small birds flitted among the branches and gray animals scurried along the ground amolde had brought along a tome of natural history and he consuited it eagerly as each thing turned up an oak tree he exclaimed probably the root stock of the silver oak the blackjack oak the turkey oak and the acorn trees but theres no silver blackjacks or acorns grundy protested or turkeys irene added certainly there are in rudimentary forms the centaur said serve a certain silvery aspect to some leaves and the typical shape of others primitively suggestive of other eventual divergencies and i suspect there are also acoms in season the deficiency of magic prevents proper mauffestation but to the trained perceptionj maybe so the golem agreed shrugging iw was evidently more than he cared to know about oak trees dor continued to query the objects along the beach and the water of the sea but with negative results all denied seeing king trent or queen iris this is ridiculousl irene expostulated i know he came this wayll amolde stroked his chin thoughtfully there does appear to be a significant discontinuity something doesnt fit grundy agreed as the sun set they made camp high on the beach rather than post watches they decided to trust in magic dor told the sand in their vicinity to make an exclamation if anything dangerous or ob noxious intruded and the sand promised to do so irene grew a blan ket bush for their beds and set a chokecherry hedge around them for additional protection they ate beefsteak tomatoes that they butch ered and roasted on flamevines and drank the product of wine andrain lilies young lady your talent contributes enormously to our comfort amolde complimented her and irene flushed modestly aw hes just saying that cause shes pretty grundy grumbled that only made irene flush with greater pleasure dor was not pleased but could not isolate the cause of his reaction the hangups of others were easier for him to perceive than his own especially when her skirt hikes up over her knees the golem continued irene quickly tugged down her hem her flush becoming less attractive actually there are few enough rewards to a mission like this amolde said had i my choice i would instantly abolish my own magic and return to my sinecure at the museum my shame extir pated and there was the centaues fundamental disturbance dor real ized he resented their dastardly deed that had ripped him from his contented existence and made him an exile from his kind dor could hardly blame him amoldes agreement to travel with them to mun dania to help rescue king trent did not mean he was satisfied with his lot he was merely making the best of what was for him an awful situation me help he go with big heaveho smash offered but we need his magic irene said verbally interposing herself to prevent further trouble just as we need your strength smash and she laid her hand on the ogres ponderous arm pacifying him dor found himself resenting this too though he understood her motive the peace had to be kept they settled down for the nightand the sand gave alarm the monsters it warned of turned out to be sand fleasbugs so small they could hardly even be seen amolde dug a verminrepulsor spen out of his collection and that took care of the matter they settled down again and this time slept once more the nightmares were unable to reach them since the magic horses were bound to the magic realm of xanth and could not cross the mundane territory intervening dor almost felt sympathy for the mares they had been balked from doing their duty to trouble peoples sleep for several nights now and must be very frustrated they resumed their march in the morning but as the new day wore on the gloom of failure became more pervasive something certainly appears to be amiss amolde observed from what we understand king trent had to have passed this vicinityyet the objects here deny it perhaps it is not entirely premature to entertain conjectures smash wrinkled his hairy brow trying to figure out whether this was another rarefied insult say whats on your mind horsetail grundy said with his customary diplomacy we have ascertained that the queen could not have employed her power to deceive the local objects amolde said didactically not without magic dor agreed the two of them were strictly mundanetype people here as far as we know could they have failed to come in from the sea no irene cried emotionally i have queried the sea dor said it says nothing like that is in it irene relaxed could they have employed a completely different route perhaps crossed to the eastern coast of xanth and sailed north from there to intercept another region of mundania they didnt irene said firmly they had it all planned to come out here someone had found a good trade deal and they were following his map i saw it and the route passed here but if you dont know dor protested i didnt know they were going to travel the route then she said but i did see the map when their scout brought it in with the line on it now i know what it meant thats all i saw but i am absolutely certain this was the way they headed dor was disinclined to argue the point further this did seem to be the only practical route he had told the others all he knew about king trenfs destination and this route certainly did not conflict with that information could they have been intercepted before leaving xanth arnolde continued evidently with an intellectual conclusion in mind waylaid perhaps my father would have turned any waylayer into a toad she said defiantly anyway inside xanth my mothers illusion would have made them impossible to identify then it seems we have emmated the likely amolde said we are thus obliged to contemplate the unlikely what do you mean irene asked as i intimated it is an unlikely supposition that i entertain quite possibly erroneous spit it out brownfur grundy said my dear vociferous construct a civilized centaur does not expectorate and my color is appaloosa not mere brown irene was catching on to her power over the centaur and over males in general please amolde she pleaded sweetly its so important to me to know anything that might help find my lost father of course dear child amolde agreed quickly adopting an avuncular pose it is simply this perhaps king trent did not pass this region when we suppose he did it had to be wiffid this past month she said not necessarily that is the extraordinary aspect of this supposition he may have passed here a cenma ago now dor irene and grundy peered at the centaur intently to see whether he was joking smash less interested in intellectual conjectares idly formed sandstone by squeezing handfuls of sand until the mineral fused his new gauntlets evidently enabled him to apply his power in ways that were beyond hir nataral fliffits before since even ogres flesh was marginally softer than stone a modest sandstone castle was developing you happen to sleep with your head underwater last night the golem inquired solicitously i have as i have clarified previously engaged in a modicum of research into the phenomena of mundania amolde said i confess i know only the merest fraction of what may be available and must be constantly alert for error but certain conclusions are becoming more credible through history certain anomalies have manifested in the relationship between continuums there is of course the matter of linguisticsit appears that there exist multiple languages in mundania yet all become intelligible in xanth i wonder if you properly appreciate the significance of irene was growing impatient she tapped her small foot on the ground how could he have passed a century ago when he wasnt even born then it is this matter of discontinuity as i was saying time seems to differ there may be no constant ratio there is evidence that the several waves of human colonization of xanth originated from widely divergent subcultures within mundania and in fact some may be anachronistic that is to say the last wave of people may have orig nated from a period in mundania preceding that of the prior wave now wait dor exclaimed i visited xanth of eight hundred years ago and i guess that was a kind of time travel but that was a special case since theres no magic in mundania how could people get reversed like that are their times mixed up no i believe their framework is consistent in their world yet if the temporal sequence were reversed with respect to ours i just want to know where my father is irene snapped he may be in mundanias pastor its future the centaur said we simply do not know what law governs transfer across the bartier of magic but it seems to be governed from xanths side that is we may be able to determine into what age of mundania we travel whereas the access of mundania to xanth is random and perhaps in some cases impossible it is a most intriguing interface it is as if xanth were a boat sailing along a river the passengers may disembark anywhere they choose merely by picking their port or a specific time on the triptych so to speak but the natives along the shores can take only that craft that happens to pass within their range this is an inadequate analogy i realize that does not properly account for certain ibe king can be anywhen in mundania irene demanded skeptically marvelously succinct summation amolde admitted but he told me medieval dor protested that does narrow it the centaur agreed but it covers an extraordinary range and if he was speaking figuratively then how can we ever fmd him irene demanded that becomes problematical i hasten to remind you that thi is merely a theory undocumented perhaps fallacious i would not have introduced it for consideration except except nothing else fits irene said suppose its right what do we do now well i believe it would expedite things if we located research faeflities in mundania some institution where detailed records exist archives and youre an archivist dor exclaimed precisely this should enable me to determine at what period in mundanias history we have intruded since as king dor says king trent referred to a medieval period that would provide a frame of reference if were in the wrong mundane century irene said how do we get to him we should be required to return to xanth and undertake a new mission to that century as i mentioned it seems feasible to determine the temporal locale from xanth and once in that aspect of mundania we would be fixed in it until returning to xanth however this procedure is fraught with uncertainties and potential complications i should think so dor said if we figured it wrong we might get there before he did oh i doubt that would happen other than on the macroscopic scale of course the what dor asked i believe the times are consistent in particular circumstances that is to say within a given age we could enter mundania only with an elapsed period consonant with that of xanth therefore we might miss by a century but not by a day grundy said that is the essence golem ihe particular channels appear to be fixed so lets go find the centuryl irene said brightening then all wen need is the place with appropriate research the specific geography should also be evident then lets go find your archives she said unfodwately we have no knowledge of this period amolde reminded her we are hardly likely to locate a suitable facility randomly i can help there dor said it should be where there are a lot of people right correct yang dor uh better not call me king here im not really and people might find it strange then dor addressed the sand which way to where most people live how should i know the sand asked you know which direction most of them come from and where they return oh that they mostly go north north it is dor ageed they marched north and in due course encountered a mundane path that debouched into a road that became a paved highway no such highway existed in xanth and dor had to question this one closely to ascertain its nature it seemed it served to facilitate the travel of metal and rubber vehicles that propelled themselves with some sort of magic or whatever it was that mundanes used to accomplish such wonders these wagons were called cars and they moved very rapidly i saw something like that belowground grundy said ihe demons rode in them soon the party saw a car the thing zoomed along like a racing dragon belching faint smoke from its posterior they stared after it amazed fire it send from wrong end smash said are you sure theres no magic in mundania grundy asked even the demons didnt have firebreathers i am not at all certain amolde admitted perhaps they merely have a different name and application for their magic i doubt it would operate for us perhaps this is the reason we believe there is no magic in mundaniait is not applicable to our needs i dont want any part of that car irene said any dragon shooting out smoke from its rear is either crazy or has one awful case of indigestionl how could it fight lets find our archives and get out of here the others agreed this aspect of mundania was certainly inverted they avoided the highway making their way along assorted paths that paralleled it dor continued to query the ground and by nightfall they were approaching a city it was a strange sort of settlement with roads that crisscrossed to form large squares and buildings all lined up with their fronts right on the edges of the roads so that there was hardly room for any forest there jammed in close togather some were so tall it was a wonder they didift fall over when the wind blew doris party camped at the edge of the city under a large umbrella tree irene grew to shelter them the trees canopy dipped almost to the ground concealing them and this seemed just as well they were not sure how the mundanes would react to the sight of an ogre golem or centaur we have gone as far as we can as a group dor said ibere are many people here and few trees we cant avoid being seen any more i think irene and i had better go in and find a museum a library amolde corrected him i would love to delve eternally in a mundane museum but the information is probably most readily accessible in a hbrary a library dor agreed he knew what that was because king trent had many books in his libraryoffice in castle roogna however that is academic no pun intended the centaur continued you cannot go there without me i know ill step out of magic dor said but i wont need to do anything special nothing magical once i find the library for you you have no certainty you can even speak their language arnolde said curtly in the magic ambience you can beyond it this is problematical im not sure we speak the same language in our own group sometimes irene said with a smile words like ambience and problematical i can speak their language grundy said thats my talent i was made to translate a magical talent amolde said oooops grundy said chagrined wont work outside the aisle but you cant just walk in to the city dor said im sure they arent used to centaurs would have to walk in to use the ebrary amolde pointed out fortunately i anticipated such an impediment so obtained a few helpful spells from our repository we centaurs do not norinally practice inherent magic but we do utilize particular enchantments on an ad hoc basis i have found them invaluable when on field trips to the wilder regions of xanth he checked through his bag of spells much the way irene checked through her seeds i have with me assorted spells for invisibility inaudibility untouchability and so forth the golem and i can traverse the city unperceived what about the ogre dor asked he cant exactly merge with the local population either amolde frowned him too i suppose he agreed distastefully however there is one attendant habitity inherent in this process i wont be able to detect you either dor finished precisely some one of our number must exist openly for these spells make the handling of books awkward our hands would pass right through the pages my ambience of magic should be unnpaired of course and we could remain with youbut you would have to do all the research unassisted hell never make it irene said shes right dor said im just not much of a scholar id mess it up y allow me to cogitate amolde said he closed his eyes and stroked his chin reflectively for a worried moment dor thought the centaur was going to be sick then realized that he had the wrong word in mind cogitate actually referred to thinking perhaps i have an alternative amolde said you could obtain the assistance of a mundane scholar a qualified researcher perhaps an archivist you could pay him one of the gold coins you have hoarded or perhaps a diamond i believe either would have value in any frame of mundania uh i guess so dor said doubtfully i tell you even with help hell foul it up irene said she seemed to have forgotten her earlier compliments on doris performance that was one of the little things about herselective memory youre the one who should do the research amolde i can only as it were look over his shoulder the centaur said it would certainly help if i could direct the manner he selects references and turns the pages as i am a gifted reader with a fine memory he would not have to comprehend the material but unless i were to abort the imperceptibility spells which i doubt very much would be wise since i have no duplicates theres a way maybe grundy said i could step outside the magic aisle then he could see me and hear me and i could tell him to turn the page or whatever and any mundanes in the area would pop their eyeballs looeng at the living doll irene said if anyone does it im the one so they can pop their eyes looking up your skirt the golem retorted miffed that may indeed be the solution amolde said now wait a minuter irene cried he means the messenger service dor told her gently of course the centaur said since we have ascertained that the aisle is narrow it would be feasible to stand quite close while dor rereams well within the forward extension dor considered and it did seem to be the best course he had somehow thought he could just go into mundania follow king trents trail by querying the terrain and teach the king without much trouble this temporal discontinuity as the centaur put it was hard to understand and harder to deal with and the vicarious research the centaur proposed seemed fraught with hangups but what other way was there well try it he agreed in the morning they settled down for the night their second in mundania smash and grundy slept instantly dor and irene had more trouble and arnolde seemed uncomfortably wide awake we are approaching direct contact with mundane civilization the centaur said in a certain sense this represents the cubnination of an impossible dream for me almost justifying the personal damnation my magic talent represents yet i have had so many confusing intimations i hardly know what to expect this city could be too primitive to have a proper hbrary the denizens could for all we know practice cannibalism there are so many imponderabilities i dont care what they practice irene said just so long as i find my father perhaps we should query the surroundings in the morning arnolde said thoughtfully to ascertain whether suitable facilities exist here before we venture any farther certainly we do not wish to chance discovery by the mundanes unless we have excellent reason and we should ask where the best mundane archivist is irene agreed dor drew a word in the dirt with one finger onesn he contemplated it morosely this is relevant the centaur inquired glancing at the word its what king trent told me dor said if ever i was in doubt to proceed with honesty honesty amolde asked his brow g at the dirt i think about that a lot when im in doubt dor said i dont like deceiving people even mundanes irene smiled tiredly amolde its the way dor spens the word he is the worlds champion poor speller n e s t i honesty onesti the centaur repeated removing his spectacles to rub his eyes i believe i perceive it now a fitfing signature for a king king trents a great king dor agreed i know his advice will pun us through somehow amolde seemed almost to smile as if finding doris attitude peculiar i will sleep on that the centaur said and he did lying down on the dirtscratched word in the morning after some problems with food and natural functions in this semipublic locale they set it up the centaur dug out his collection of spells each one sealed in a glassy ettle globe and dor stepped outside the aisle of magic while the spells were invoked first the party became inaudible then invisible it looked as if the spot were empty dor gave them time to get through the unfeeling spell then walked back onto the lot he heard saw and felt nothing but i can smell you he remarked amolde has a slight equine odor and smash smells like a monster and irene is wearing perfume better clean yourselves up before we get into a building soon the smells faded and after a moment irene appeared a short distance away can you see me now i see you and hear you dor said oh good i didnt know how far out the magic went im still the same to me she stepped toward him and vanished youve gone again dor said hastening to the spot where she had been can you perceive me hey youre overlapping mel she protested appearing right up against him so that he almost stumbled well i cant perceive you he said i mean now i can but i couldnt before can you see the others when youre outside the aisle she looked theyre gone we can see and hear you all the time but now soyoull know when i can see you by when you cant see them she leaned forward and her face disappeared reminding him of the gorgon then she drew back i could see them then im really in the enchantment arent i youre enchanting he agreed she smiled and leaned forward to kiss himbut her face disappeared and he felt nothing now i have to go find a library and a good archivist he said disgruntled as she reappeared if youre with me stay away from me she laughed im with you just dont try to catch me outside the aisle and of course that was what he should have done if he really wanted to kiss her and he did want tobut he didnt want to admit it she walked well to the side of him staying clear of the enchantment no sense you getting lost they walked on into the city there were many cars in the streets all zooming rapidly to the intersections where they screeched to stops waited a minute with irate growls and constant ejections of smoke from their posteriors then zoomed in packs to the next intersections they seemed to have only two speeds zoom and stop there were people inside the cars exactly the way grundy had described with the demon vehicles but they never got out it was as if the people had been swallowed whole and were now being digested because the cars were as large as centaurs and moved at a constant gallop when not stopped dor was wary of them and tried to avoid them but it was impossible he had to cross the road sometime he remembered how the nefarious gap dragon of xanth lurked for those foolish enough to cross the bottom of the gap these cars seemed all too similar maybe there were some that had not yet consumed people and were traveling hungry waiting to catch someone like dor he saw one car stopped by the side of the street with its mouth wide open like that of a dragon he avoided it nervously ihe strangest thing about it was that its guts seemed to be all in that huge mouthsteaming tubes and tendons and a diskshaped tongue oddest of all it had no teeth maybe that was why it took so long to digest the people he ewne to a corner how do i get across he asked you wait for a light to stop the traffic the street informed him with a contemptuous air of dust and car fumes then you rundont walk across before they clip you if youre lucky where have you been all your life in another realm dor said he saw one of the lights the street described it hung above the intersection and wore several little visors pointing each way ah sorts of colors flashed malevolently from it in all sorts of directions dor couldnt understand how it made the car stop maybe the lights had some kind of stunspell or whatever it was called here he played it safe by asking the fight to tell him when it was proper to cross now the light said flashing green from one face and red from another dor started across a car honked like a sea monster and squealed like a seamonster victim almost running over doris leading foot not that way idiotl the eght exclaimed flashing an angry red the other way with the green not the red havent you ever crossed a street before never dor admitted irene had disappeared she must have reentered the magic aisle to consult with the others maybe she found it safer within the spell zone apparently the cars were unable to threaten her there wait till i tell you then cross the way i tell you the light said blinking erratically i dont want any blood in my intersection dor waited humbly now the light said walk straight ahead keeping an even pace fast you dont have all day only fifteen seconds but theres a car charging me dor protested it will stop the light assured him i shall change to red at the last possible moment and force it to scorch rubber i get a deep pleasure from that sort of thing nervously dor stepped out onto the street again the car zoomed terffftgly close then squealed to a stop a handspans distance from doris shaking body shook you up that time you damned pedestrian the car gloated through its cloud of scorched rubber if it hadnt been for that blinking light id a had you you creeps shouldnt be allowed on the road but how can i cross the street if im not allowed on the road dor asked thats your problem the car huffed see i can time them perfectly the light said with satisfaction i get hundreds of them each day no one gets through my intersection without paying his tax in gas and rubber go blow a bulbl the car growled at the eght go soak your homl the light flashed back some day we cars will have a revolution and establish a new axle the car said darkly well smash all you restrictive lights and have a genuine freeenterprise system you really crack me up the light said disdainfully without me youd have no discipline at all dor walked on another car zoomed up and dor lost his nerve and leaped out of the way missed him the car complained i havent scored in a weekl get out of my intersection the light screamed you never stopped you never burned rubber youre supposed to waste gas for the full pause before you go tluough how do you expect me to maintain a decent level of pollution here if you dont cooperate oh go jam your circuits the car roared moving on through police police the eght flashed that criminal car just ran the light rogue car rogue car but now the other cars perceiving that one was getting away with open defiance hastened to do likewise the intersection filled with snarling vehicles that crashed merrily into each other there was the crackle of beginning fire then the magic aisle moved out of the lights range and it was silent dor was relieved he didnt want to attract attention irene reappeared you almost did it that time dor why dont you quit fooling with lights and get on to the library im trying tol dor snapped where is the ebrary he asked the sidewalk you dont need a library you clumsy oaf the walk said you need a bodyguard just answer my question the perversity of the inanimate seemed worse than ever here in mundania perhaps it was because the objects here had never been tamed by magic three blocks south two east the walk said grudgingly whats a block is this twerp real the walk asked rhetorically answerl dor snapped and in due course he obtained the necessary definition a block was one of the big squares formed by the crisscrossing roads is there an archivist there a what a researcher someone who knows a lot oh sure the best in the state he walks here all the time strange old coot that sidewalk sure understands you irene remarked smugly dor was silent irene was safe from any remarks the sidewalk might make about her legs because she was outside the magic aisle dor knew amolde was keeping up with him because his magic was operating if irene stepped within that region of magic she would vanish so she had the advantage and could snipe with impunity for now a small group of mundanes walked toward them three men and two women their attire was strange the men wore knots of something about their necks almost choking them and their shoes shone like mirrors the women seemed to be walking on stilts irene contissued blithely along passing them dor hung back curious about mundane reactions to a citizen of xanth the two females seemed to pay no attention but all three males paused to look back at irene look at that creature one murmured what world is she from whatever world it is i want to go there another said must be a foreign student i havent seen legs like that in three years her clothing is three centuries out of fashion if it ever was in fashion one of the women remarked her nose elevated evidently she had after all paid attention it was amazing what women could notice while seeming not to her own legs were unremarkable though it occurred to dor that the stiltshoes might be responsible for deforming them men have no taste the other woman said they prefer harem girls yeah the third man said with a slow smile id like to have her number over my dead body the second woman said the mimdanes went on their strange conversation fading from doris hearing dor proceeded thoughtfully if irene were that different from mundanes what about himself no one had reacted to him yet he was dressed as differently from the males as irene was from the females he pondered that as he and irene continued along the streets maybe the mundanes had been so distracted by irenes legs that they had skipped over dor that was understandable ihe library was a palatial echfice with an exceedingly strange entrance ihe door went round and round without ever quite opening dor stood near it uncertain how to proceed mundane people passed him not noticing him at all despite his evident difference that was part of the magic he realized suddenly his contemplations finally fitting an aspect of the mundane mystery together he seemed to share their culture should he step outside the magic aisle he would stand out as a complete foreigner as irene had fortunately she was a pretty girl so she could get away with it he would not have that advantage at the moment irene was not in view perhaps she had been more aware of the mundane reaction and preferred to avoid repetition but as the mundanes cleared the vicinity she reappeared amolde believes that is a revolving door she said there are a few obscure references to them in the texts on mundania probably all you have to do isj she saw another mundane approaching and hastily stepped into invisibility ihe mundane walked to the door put forth a hand and pushed on a panel of the door a chamber swung inward and the man followed the compartment around so simple once dor saw it in action he walked boldly up to the door and pushed through it worked like a charmthat is almost like a natural phenomenon of xanthpassing him into the building he was now in a large room in which there were many couches and tables and the walls were lined with levels of books this was a library all right now all he needed to do was locate the excellent researcher who was supposed to be here maybe in the history section dor walked across the room toward a wall of books he could check those and see if any related it shouldnt be too hard to he paused aware that people were staring at him what was the matter an older woman approached him her face formed into stern lines xf ibwf b esfttdpef ifsf she said severely her gaze traveling disapprovingly from his unkempt hair to his dustscuffed sandaled feet it seemed she disapproved of his attire after a moment of confusion dor realized he had stepped beyond the magic aisle and was now being seen without the cushion of enchantment amolde had been correct dor could not accomplish anything by himself what had happened to the centaur dor looked back toward the doorand saw irene beckoning him frantically he hurried back to her the mundane woman following xf pqfsbuf a respectable library here the mundane was saying we expect a suitable demeanory dor turned to face her yes the woman stopped nonplused ohi see you are properly dressed i must have mistaken you for someone else she retreated embarrassed doris clothing had not changed only the womqns perception of it had thanks to the magic amolde cant get through the spinning door irene said so that was why dor had left the aisle he had walked well beyond the door of course those small chambers could not accommodate the mass of the centaur maybe theres another door dor suggested we could walk around the building irene vanished then reappeared yes amolde says the spell fuzzes the boundaries of things somewhat so his hands pass through mundane objects but his whole body mass is just too much to push through a solid mundane wall he might make it through a window though dor went back out the rotating door then walked around the building in the back was a double door that opened wide enough to admit a car dor walked through this and past some men who were stacking crates of books hey kid you lost one called it had not taken him long to progress from king to kid i am looking for the archives dor said nervously oh sure the stacks third door on your left thank you dor went to the door and opened it wide taking his time to pass through so that the others could get clear he smelled the centaur and ogre faintly so knew they were with him now they were in a region of long narrow passages between shelves loaded with boxes dor had no idea how to proceed and wasnt certain the centaur could fit within these passages but in a moment irene appeared and informed him that amolde was right at til home here but it would be better to consult with a competent archivist he says she concluded there is one here he said i asked then another thought came but suppose he sics the mundane authorities on us he may not understand our need amolde says academics arent like that if there is a good one here his scientific curiosityi think thats what they call magic herewill keep him interested check in that little office that looks like an archivists cubby reluctantly dor looked he was in luck of what kind he was not sure there was a middleaged bespectacled man poring over a pile of papers excuse me sirwould you like to do some research dor asked the man looked up blinking of what nature uh its a long story im trying to find a king and i dont know where or when he is the man removed his spectacles and rubbed his tired eyes that would seem to be something of a challenge what is the name of the king and of his kingdom king trent of xanth the man stood up and squeezed out of his cubby he was fairly small and stooped with fading hair and he moved slowly he reminded dor of amolde in obscure ways he located a large old tome took it down dusted it off set it on a small table and turned the brittle pages that designation does not seem to be listed irene appeared he would not be a king in mundania the scholar squinted at her with mild surprise my dear i cannot comprehend a word you are saying uh shes from another land dor said quickly since irene had to stand outside the magic aisle in order to be seen and heard the magic translation effect was not operative for her since dor had been raised in the same culture he had no trouble understanding her it was an interesting distinction he dor could understand both the others and both seemed to be speaking the same language but the two could not understand each other magic kept coming up with new wrinkles that perplexed him the scholar pondered ohshe is associated with a motion picture company this is research for a historical recreation not exactly dor said shes king trents daughter oh it is a contemporary kingdoml i must get a more recent text no it is a medieval one dor said uh that iswell king trent is in another time we think the scholar paused thoughtfully the kingdom you are recreating of course i believe i imderstand he looked again at irene females certainly have adequate limbs in that realm whats he saying irene demanded that you have nice legs dor told her with a certain mild malice she ignored that what about my father not listed in this book i think well have to try another tack the scholars eyes shifted from irenes legs to doris face this is very odd you address her in english and she seems to understand but she replies in an ahen tongue its corn licated to explain dor said p id better check with amolde irene said and vanished the mundane scholar removed his spectacles and cleaned them carefully with a bit of tissue paper he returned them to his face just in time to see irene reappear yes thats defiffitel better he mur y mured amolde says well have to use some salient identifying trait to locate my father or mother irene said there may be a historical reference exactly what language is that the scholar asked again fixing on irenes legs he might be old and academic but he evidently had not forgotten what was what in female appearance xanthian i guess dor said she says we should look for some historical reference to her parents because of special traits they have and what would these traits be well king trent transforms people and queen iris is mistress of illusion idiot irene snapped dont tell him about the magic i dont quite understand the scholar said what manner of transformation what mode of illusion well it doesnt work in mundania dor said awkwardly surely you realize that the laws of physics are identical the world over the scholar said anything that works in the young ladys country will work elsewhere not magic dor said and realized he was just confusing things more how dumb can you get irene demanded im checking with amolde she vanished again this tne the scholar blinked more emphatically strange girll shes flmny that way dor agreed weakly ihe scholar walked to the spot irene had vacated tabhf jmmvtjpo he inquired oh nol he was outside the magic aisle now so the magic no longer made his language align with doris dor could not do anything about this the centaur would have to move lerene reappeared right next to the scholar evidently she hadnt been paying attention for she should have been able to see him while within the magic ambience ohyoure here she exclaimed bnbajohl the scholar said j wtu jorvjsf then the centaur moved irene vanished and the scholar became comprehensible exactly how you perform that trick he paused oops youre gone again irene reappeared farther down the hall amolde says well have to tell him she announced about the magic and everything thanks to your bungling really this is amazing the scholar said well lll have to teer you something you may find hard to believe dor said at this stage im iffclined to believe in magic itselfl yes xanth is a land of magic in which people disappear and reappear at will i think i would prefer to believe that than to conclude i am losing my sight wer some do disappear thats not irenes talent though thats not the young ladys ability then why is she doing it shes actually stepping in and out of a magic aisle a magic aisle generated by a centaur the scholar smiled wanly i fear you have the advantage of me you can imagine nonsense faster than i can assimilate it dor saw that the scholar did not believe him r show you my own magic if you like he said he pointed to the open tome on the table book speak to the man why should i bother the book demanded ventriloquisml the scholar exclaimed i must confess you are very good at it what did you call me the book demanded would you do that againwith your mouth closed the scholar asked dor dor closed his mouth the book remained silent i rather thought so the scholar said thought what foureyes the book asked startled the scholar looked down at it then back at dor but your mouth was closed im sure its magic dor said i can make any inanimate object talk lets accept for the moment that this is true you are telling me that this king you are searching for can also work magic right only he cant do it in mundania so i guess it doesnt count because he has no magic centaur with him yes i would like to see this centaur hes protected by an invisibility spell so the mundanes wont bother us this centaur is a scholar yes an archivist like yourseil then he is the one to whom i should talk but the spell abate the spell bring your centaur scholar forth otherwise i cannot help you i dont think hed want to do that it would be hard to get safely out of here without that enchantment and we have no duplicate invisibility spell the scholar walked back to his cubby mind you i believe in magic no more than in the revelations of a hallucination but i am willing to help you if you meet me hallway desist your parlor tricks show me your scholar and i will work with him to fathom the information you desire i dont care how fanciful his outward form may be provided he has a genuine mind the fact that you find it necessary to dazzle me with ventriloquism a lovely costumed girl who vanishes and a mythological narrative suggests that there is very rttle substance to your claim and you are wasting my time i ask you to produce your scholar or depart my presence uh amolde dor said i know itll be awful hard to get out of here without the spells but maybe we could wait till night we really need the information and abruptly the centaur appeared facing the scholars cubby the ogre and golem stood behind him i agree amolde said ihe scholar turned about he bm ed these are rare costumes i adndt amolde strode forward his barrel barely clearing the shelves on either side extending his hand i certainly do not blame you for being impatient with the uninitiate he said you have excellent fa cihties here and i know your time is valuable the scholar shook the hand seeming more reassured by amoldes spectacles and demeaner than confused by his form what is your specially alien archaeologybut of course there is a great deal of routine work and overlapping of chores there certainly isl the scholar agreed the nuisances i have to endure here the two fell into a technical dialogue that soon left dor behind they became more animated as they sized up each others minds and information there was now no doubt they were similar types irene bored grew a cocoa plant in the hall and shared the hot cups of liquid with dor smash and grundy they knew it was n portant that amolde establish a good rapport so that they could gain the scholars cooperation and make progress on their request time passed the two scholars delved into ancient tomes debated excruciatingly fine points questioned dor closely about the hints king trent had given him in both person and vision and finally wound down to an animated close the mundane scholar accepted a mug of cocoa relaxing at last i believe we have it he said will i see you again centaur surely so sir i am able to travel in mundania am fascinated by your comprehensive history and am presently as it were between positions your compatriots found your magic as intolerable in you as mine would find a similar propensity in me i shall not be able to tell anf one what i have learned this day lest i too lose my position and possibly even be institutionalized imagine conversing with a centaur ogre and tiny golem how i should love to do a research paper on your fantastic land of xanth but it would hardly be believable you could write a book and call it a story grundy suggested and amolde could write one about mundania both scholars looked pleased neither had thought of such a sim ple expedient but do you know where my father is irene demanded yes i believe we do amolde said ying trent left a message for us we believe how could he leave a message she demanded he left it with dor that and the other hints we had such as the fact that he was going to a medieval region in the mountains near a black body of water there are my friend informs me many places in mundania that fit the description so we assume it is literal either the water itself is black or it is called black as it happens there is in mundania a large body of water called the black sea many great rivers empty into it great mountain ranges surround it but that is not sufficient to identify this as the specific locale we seek it merely makes it one possibility among many amolde smiled we spent a good deal of time on geography as it happens there was historically a confluence of a b and k people in that vicinity in medieval timesat least that is so when their names are rendered into xanth dialect the avars the bulgars and the khazars so it does seem to fit everything you have told us seems to fit but that isnt enough dor cried how can you be sure you have the place the time honesty amolde said o n e s t i he pointed to a spot on an open book this we believe is the unique special hint king trent gave you to enable you and only you to locate him in an emergency dor looked it was an atlas with a map of some strange mundane land on the map was a place labeled onesti there is only one such place in the world amolde said it has to be king trents message to you no one else would grasp the significance of that unique nomenclature dor recaped the intensity with which king trent had spoken of honesty as if there had been a separate meaning there he rememhered how well aware the king had been of does kind of spenwg it seemed no one else spelled it the obvious way onesti but if thats been therethat name there in your maps and things for centuriesthat means king trent never came backl we cant rescue him because then the name would go not necessarily amolde said the placename does not depend on his presence we should be able to rescue him without disturbing it at any rate we are never certain of the paradoxes of time we shall simply have to go to that location and that time circa ad and try to find him but suppose its wrong irene asked worriedly suppose he isnt there then we shall return here and do more research amolde said i intend to visit here again anyway and my friend ichabod would like to visit xanth there will be no trouble about that i assure you yes you will be welcome here the mundane scholar agreed you have a fine and arcane mind for the first time amolde continued i look upon my exile from centaur isle and my assumption of an obscene talent with a certain equanimity i have not it seems been excluded from my calling my horizons have been inordinately expanded and mine ichabod agreed i must confess my contemporaneous existence was becoming tiresome though i did not recognize this until this day now the scholar sounded just like amolde perhaps some obscure wrinkle of fate had operated to bring these two together did luck or fate really operate in mundania perhaps they did when the magic aisle was present the prospect of researching in a completely new and mystical terrain is immensely appealing it renovates my outlook he paused ah would there by any chance be individuals of the female persuasion remotely resembling his glance ticked guiltily to irenes legs nymphs galore grundy said a dime a dozen oh you employ contemporaneous currency the scholar asked surprised currency dor asked blankly a dime is a coin of small denomination here dor smiled no a dime is a tiny object that causes things passing over it to come to a sudden stop when it has functioned this way twelve times its enchantment wears out hence our saying how marvelous i wonder whether one of my own dimes would perform similarly there thats the idea grundy said toss it in front of a troupe of gamboling nymphs and grab the first one it stops nymphs dont have much brains but they sure have legs he moved farther away from irene who showed signs of kicking oh i can hardly wait to commence research in xanth the scholar exclaimed as it happens i have a dime ready he brought out a tiny silver coin his gaze once again touching on irenes limbs i wonder irene frowned sometimes i wonder just how badly i really want to rescue my folks ill be lucky if my legs dont get blistered from all the attention but as usual she did not seem completely displeased lets be on our way i dont care what you do once my father is back in xanth amolde and ichabod shook hands two very similar creatures on impulse dor brought out one of the gold coins he had so carefully saved from the pirates treasure please accept this sir as a token of our appreciation for your help he pressed it on the scholar ihe man hefted the coin thats solid goldl he exclaimed i believe it is a genuine spanish doubloonl i cannot accept it the centaur interceded please do accept it ichabod dor is temporary king of xanth to decline would be construed as an offense to the crown but the value lets trade coins dor said discovering a way through your dime for my doubloon then it is an even exchange an even exchange the scholar exclaimed in no way can this be considered dimes are very precious in xanth amolde said gold has little special value please acquiesce maybe a nymph would stop on a doubloon too grundy suggested she certainly would ichabod agreed but not because of any magic women here are much attracted to wealth please irene put in smiling beguilingly dor knew she only wanted to get moving on the search for her father but her intercession was effective in that case i will exchange with you with pleasure king dor the scholar agreed giving dor his dime i only meant to protest that your coin was far too valuable for whatever service i might have pro vided when in fact it was a pleasure providing it anyway nothings too valuable to get my father back irene said she leaned forward and kissed ichabod on the cheek the man froze as if he had glimpsed the gorgon an astonished smile on his face it was obvious he had not been kissed by many pretty girls in his secluded lifetime it was now early evening ichabod delved into assorted cubbies and produced shrouds to conceal the bodies of the centaur and ogre then amolde and smash walked out of the library in tandem look ing like two big workmen in togas moving a covered crate between them it turned out to be almost as good concealment as the in visibility spell no one paid attention to them they were on their way back to xanth they did not go all the way back home they trekked only to the northwest tip of xanth where the isthmus connected it to mundania once they were back in magic territory irene set about replenishing her stock of seeds smash knocked down a jellybarrel tree consumed the jelly and fashioned the swollen trunk into a passable boat arnolde watched the terrain making periodic forays into mundania hi just far enough to see whether it had changed dor accompanied m questioning the sand by the description of people the sand had recently seen they were able to guess at the general place and time in mundania for the change was continuous once a person from xanth entered mundania his framework was fixed until he returned but anyone who followed him might enter a different aspect of mundania this was like missing one boat and boarding the next amolde explained the person on the first boat could return but the person on land could not catch a particular boat that had already departed thus king trent had gone they believed to a place caned europe in a time called medieval doris party had gone to a place called america in a time called modern the shifting of places and times seemed random probably there was a pattern to the changes that they were unable to comprehend they simply had to locate the combination they wanted and pass through that window before it changed amolde concluded from their observations that any given window lasted from five minutes to an hour and that it was possible to hold a window open longer by having a person stand at the border it seemed the window couldnt quite close while it was in use perhaps it was like the revolving door in the mundanian ibrary whose turning could be temporarily stopped by a person in ituntil some other person needed to use it on the third day it became tedious irenes seed collection was complete and she was restive smash had finished his boat and stocked it with supplies grundy had made himself a nest in the bow from which he eavesdropped on the gossip of passing marine life arnolde and dor walked down the beach what have you seen lately dor inquired routinely of the sameyetdifferent patch of sand a man in a spacesuit the sand repeed he had little antennae sprouting from his head like an ant and he could talk to his friends without making a sound that didnt sound like anyone dor was looking for some evil magician must have enchanted the man perhaps trying to create a new compositespecies they turned about and returned to xanth this surely was not their window the sea changed color frequently it had been reddish the lint time they came here and reddish when they returned for they had been locked into that particular aspect of mundania but thereafter it had shifted to blue yellow green and white now it was orange changing to purple when it was solid purple they walked west again what have you seen lately dor asked once more a cavegirl swimming the sand said she was sort of fat but oooh didnt she have they walked east again depressed i wish there were a more direct way to do this amolde said i have been striving to analyze the pattern but it has eluded me perhaps because of insufficient data i know its not much of a life we have brought you into dor said i wish there had been some other way on the contrary it is a fascinating lie and a challenging puzzle the centaur demurred it is akin to the riddles of archaeology where one must have patience and fortune in equal measure we merely must gather more data whether it takes a day or a year a year dor cried horrified surely it will be shorter amolde said reassuringly it was obvious that he had a far greater store of patience than dor did as they reentered xanth the sea turned black blackl dor exclaimed could that be it is possible amolde agreed reffng his own excitement with the caution of experience we had better alert the remainder of our company grundy get smash and irene to the boat dor called we just might be close more likely another false alarm the golem grumbled but he scampered off to fetch the other two when they reached their usual spot of questioning dor noticed that there was a large old broadleaved tree that hadnt been there before this was certainly a different locale but that in itself did not mean much the landscape did shift with the mundane aspects sometimes dramatically it was not just time but geography that changed some aspects were flat and barren while others were raggedly mountainous the only thing all had in common was the beach line with the sea to the south and the terrain to the north amolde was constantly intrigued by the assorted significances of this but dor did not pay much attention what have you seen lately he asked the sand nothing much since the king and his moll walked by the sand said oh dor turned to trek back to the magic section the centaur paused did it say then it sank in excitement raced along doris nerves king trent and queen iris i suppose they were sort of old i believe we have our window at last amolde said go back and alert the others i shall hold the window open dor ran back east his heart pounding harder than warranted by the exertion did he dare believe weve found itl he cried move out nowl they dived into the boat smash poled it violently forward then the ogres effort diminished dor looked and saw that smash was striving hard but accomplishing little ohwere out of the magic of xanth and not yet in the magic aisle he said come onweve all got to help dor and irene leaned over the boat on either side and paddled desperately with their hands and slowly the boat moved onward they crawled up parallel to the centaur all aboardl dor cried exhilarated amolde trotted out through the shallow water and climbed aboard with difficulty rocking the boat some sea water slopped in the craft was sturdy as anything crafted by an ogre was bound to be but stul reeked of eme jelly especially where it had been wet down ihe centaur stood in the center facing forward irene sat in the front her fair green hair traihng back in the breeze it had faded momentarily when they were between magics just now perhaps that had helped give dor the hint of the problem it remained the easiest way to tell the state of the world around them dor settled near the rear of the boat and smash poled vigorously from the stern now that they were within the magic aisle the ogres strength was full and the boat was lively the black waves coursed rapidly past i wish i had known this was all we had to do to locate king trent dor said we could have saved ourselves the trip into modem mundania by no means amolde protested swishing his tail we might have discovered this window true but each window opens onto an entire mundane world we should soon have lost the trail and ourselves and been unable to rescue anyone as it is we know we are looking for onesti and we know where it is this will greatly facilitate our operation the centaur paused besides which i am most gratified to have met ichabod so their initial excursion did make sense after ab what sort of people do you see here dor asked the water tough people with baggy clothes and swords and bows the water said theyre not much on the water though not the way the greeks were those are probably the bulgers amolde said they should have passed this way in the past few decades according to ichabod who are the bulgers irene asked now that they were actually on the trail of her lost father she was much more interested in details this is complex to explain ichabod gave me some detail on it but i may not have the whole story if theyre people my father metand if we have to meet them tooi want to know all about them her face assumed her determined look ihe boat was moving well for the ogres strength was formidable the shoreline stretched ahead curving in and out with inlets and bays we do have a journey of several days ahead of us the centaur said time will doubtless weigh somewhat ponderously on our hands he took a didactic breath and started in on his historical narrative while the ogre scowled uninterested and grandy settled down in his nest to sleep but dor and irene paid close attention in essence it was this about three centuries before this period there had been a huge mundane empire in this region calledas dor understood itroaxn perhaps because it spread so far but after a long time this empire had grown corrupt and weak then from the great inland mass to the east had thrust a formerly quiescent tribe the huns perhaps short for hungries because of their appetite for power pushing other tribes before them these tribes had overrun the roaming empire destroying a large part of it but when the hungry chief attaboy died of indigestion they were defeated and driven partway back east to the shore of this black sea the very color of their mood they fought among themselves for a time as people in a black mood do then reunited and called themselves the bulgers but the buls were driven out of their new country by another savage tribe of turksno relation to the turkey oakscalled the khazars some buls fled north and some fled westand this was the region the western ones had settled here at the western edge of the black sea they couldnt go any farther because another savage tribe was there the avars the avars had a huge empire in eastern europe but now it was declining especially under the onslaught of the khazars at the moment circa mundane ad the number referred to some mundane religion to which none of these parties belongedthere was an uneasy balance in this region between the three powers the avars bulgars and khazars with the khazars dominant somehow this was too complex for dor to follow all these strange tribes and happenings and numbersthe intricacies of mundania were far more complicated than the simple magic events of xanth easier to face down griffins and dragons than avars and yhazars at least the dragons were sensible creatures but what has this to do with my father irene demanded which tribe did he go to trade with none of the above the centaur said this is merely background it would be too dangerous for us to deal with such savages but we believe there is a small kingdom maybe a gothic rerimant or some older indigenous people who have retained nominal independance in the carpathian mountains with a separate language and culture they happen to be at the boundary between the avars bulgars and khazars protected to a degree because no one empire can make a move there without antagonizing the other two and also protected by the rougimess of the terrain hence the a b k complex king trent referenceda valuable clue for us separate region is the kingdom of onestl it is ensconced in the mountains difficult to invade and has very little that others would want to take which may help account for its independence but it surely is eager for peaceful and profitable trade and ichabods mundane reference suggests that it did have a trade route that has been lost to history which enabled the kingdom to prosper for a century when their normal channels appeared to be blocked that could be the trade route to xanth that king trent sought to establish yes that does make sense irene agreed but suppose one of those other tribes caught my father and thats why he never returned we shall trace him down the centaur said reassuringly we have an enormous asset king trent lackedmagic all we need to do is go to onesti and query the people plants animals and objects there win surely be news of him irene was silent dor shared her concern now that they were on the verge of finding king trenthow could they be certain they would find him alive if he were dead what then are we going to have to fight all those ais bs and ivs grundy asked apparently he had not been entirely asleep i doubt it amolde replied actual states of war are rarer than they seem in historical perspective the great majority of the time life goes on as usual the fishermen fish the blacksmiths hammer iron the farmers farm the women bear chudren otherwise there would be constant deprivation however i have stocked a friendshipspefl for emergency use he patted his bag of spells they went on the ogre poling indefatigably gradually the shoroline curved southward and they followed it when dusk came they pulled ashore briefly to make a fire and prepare supper then they returned to the boat for the night so as not to brave the mundane threats of the darkness there were few fish and no monsters in the black sea grundy reported it was safe as long as a storm did not come up now amolde expended one of his precious spens he opened a wind capsule orienting it carefully the wind blew southwest catching the small squat sat they raised for the purpose now the ogre could rest while the boat coursed on toward their destination they took turns steering it grundy asking the fish and water plants for directions dor asking the water and irene growing a compass plant that pointed toward the great river they wanted that reminded dor of the magic compass he brought it out and looked hoping it would point to king trent but it pointed straight at amolde and when amolde held it it pointed to dor it was useless in this situation sleep was not comfortable on the water but it was possible dor lay down and stared at the stars wide awake then the stars abruptly shifted position and he realized he had slept now he was wide awake they shifted again then he was wide awake againwhen grundy woke him to take his turn at the helm he had it seemed been dreaming he was wide awake that was a frustrating mode he would almost have preferred the nightmares in the morning they were at the monstrous river deltaa series of bars channels and islands through which the slow current coursed now smash had to unship the two great oars he had made face back and row against the current still the boat moved alertly enough irene grew pastry plants and fed their pastryflower fruits to the ogre so he would not suffer the attrition of hunger smash gulped them down entire without pausing in his efforts dor was almost jealous of the creatures sheer zest for food and effort no he realized upon reflection he was jealous of the attention irene was paying smash for all that he dor did not want to be considered the property of any girl especially not this one he still became resentful when irenes attention went elsewhere this was unreasonable he knew smash needed lots of food in order to continue the enormous effort he was making this was the big thing the ogre was contributing to their missionhis abundant strength yet still it gnawed at dor he wished he had enormous muscles and endless endurance and that irene was popping whole pies and tarts into his mouth once dor remembered he had been bigor at least had borrowed the body of a powerful barbarianmaybe an avar or a bulgar or a khazarand had discovered that strength did not solve all problems or bring a person automatic happiness but at the moment his selfish feelings didnt go along with the sensible thinking of his mind sometimes i wish i were an ogre grundy muttered suddenly dor felt better all day they heaved up the river leaving the largest channel for a smaller one and leaving that for another and still smaller one there were some fishermen but they didnt look like as bs or ws and they took a look at the size and power of the ogre and left the boat alone arnolds had been correct the ordinary mundane times were pretty duff without rampaging armies everywhere in this respect mundania was similar to xanth well upstream they drew upon the shore and camped for the night dor told the ground to yell an alarm if anything approachedanything substantially larger than antsand they settled down under another umbrella tree irene grew it was just as well for during the night it rained on the third day they forged up a fastflowing tributary stream ascending the great carpath range some places they had to portage smash merely picked up the entire boat upright balanced it on his corrugated head steadied it with his gauntleted hamhands and trudged up through the rapids if you dont have your tuff strength yet dor commented you must be close to it ungh smash agreed for once not having the leisure to rhyme ogres were the strongest creatures of xanth size for sizebut some monsters were much larger and others more intelligent so ogres did not rule the jungle smash and his parents were the only ogres dor had met if he didnt count his adventure into xantifs past where he had known egor the zombie ogre they were not common creatures today perhaps that was just as well if ogres were as common as dragons who would stand against them at last on the afternoon of the third day they came to the kingdom of onesti or at least its main fortress castle onesti dor marveled that king trent and queen iris traveling alone without magic could have been able to get here in similar time maybe they underestimated the arduousness of the journey web it would soon be known dor tried to question the stones and water of the river but the water wasnt the same from moment to moment and so could not remember and the stones claimed that no one had portaged up here in the past month viously the king had taken another route probably an easier one perhaps the king of onesti had sent an escort and they had ridden mundane horses up a horse trail yes that was probably it they drew up just in sight of the imposing castle huge stones formed great walls leading up to the front entrance there was no moat this was a mountain fastness do we knock on the door or what irene asked nervously your father told me honesty is the best policy dor said masking his own uncertainty iassume that wasnt just a riddle to suggest where he went we can approach openly we can tell them were from xanth and are looking for king trent maybe they have no connection to whatever happenedif anything happened but lets not go out of our way to tell them about our magic just in case just in case she agreed tightly they marched up to the front entrance that seemed to be the only accessible part of the edifice anyway the wall passed through a forest on the south to merge cleverly with the clifflike sides of the mountain to the west and north they were at the east face where the approach was merely steep no wonder no one has conquered this little kingdom irene murmured i agree arnolde said no siege machinery could get close and a catapult would have to operate from the valley below perhaps it could be taken but it hardly seems worth the likely cost dor knocked they waited he knocked again still no response then smash tapped the door with one finger making it shudder now a window creaked open in the middle of the door a face showed behind bars who are you the guard demanded i am dor of xanth i have come to see king trent of xanth who i believe is here who king trent imbecile one of the bars snapped the guards head jerked back startled what you got a potato in your ear the bar demanded stop it dor mumbled at the bars the last thing he wanted was the premature exposure of his talent then quickly louder we wish to see king trent wait the guard said the window slammed closed but smash tired from his two days labors was irritable no wait ingrate he growled and before dor knew what was happening the ogre smashed one sledgehammer fist into the door the heavy wood splintered he punched right through then caught the far side of the door with his thick gauntleted fingers and hauled violently back the entire door ripped free of its bolts and hinges he put his other hand on the little barred window and hefted the door up and over his head while the other people ducked hastily now see what youve done you moronic brute amolde said but somehow the centaur did not seem completely displeased he too was tired and irritable from the journey and the welcome at castle onesti had not been polite the guard stood inside staring as the ogre hurled the great door down the mountainside take us to your leader dor said calmly as if this were routine all he could do after all was make the best of the situation and poise counted for a lot we dont want my friend to get impatient the guard turned about somewhat dazedly and led the way to the interior of the castle other guards came charging up attracted by the commotion swords drawn smash glared at them and they hastily faded back swords sheathed soon they came to the main banquet hall where the king of onesti held sway the king sat at the bead of an immense wooden table piled with puddings he stood angrily as dor approached his huge belly bulging out over the table h edlzme sn jmny sgd ldzmhmf timesghr hmsqtrhnm he demanded his fat face reddening impressively then arnoldes magic aisle caught up and the king became intelligible before i have you all thrown in the dungeonl hello dor said i am dor temporary king of xanth while king trent is away of course the zombie master was temporarytemporary king now while dor himself was away but that was too complicated to explain at the moment he came here on a trading mission i believe less than a month ago and has not returned so i have come to look for him whats the story the king scowled suddenly dor knew this approach had been an wrong that king trent had not come here that the people of onesti knew nothing about him this was au a mistake i am king oary of onesti the iung said from out of his glower and i never saw this king trench of yours get out of my kingdom despair struck dorbut behind him amolde murmured ibat person is prevaricating i believe on top of that hes lying irene muttered glib fib smash said he set one hamhand down on the banquet table gently the bowls of pudding jumped and quivered nervously king oary considered the ogre his ruddy face paled his righteous anger dissolved into something like guffty cunning however i may have news of him he said with less bellicosity join my feast and i will query my minions dor didnt like this king oary did not impress him favorably and he did not feel like eating with the man but the puddings looked good and he did want oarys cooperation he nodded reluctant assent ihe servants hurried up with more chairs for dor irene and smash grundy too small for a chair perched instead on the edge of the table arnolde merely stood more puddings were brought in together with flagons of beverage and they all pitched in the pudding was thick with fruit embedded and surprisingly tasty dor soon found himself thirsty for the pudding was highly spiced so he drankand found the beverage a cross between sweet beer and sharp wine from indifferent beerbaffel and winekeg trees he hadnt realized that such trees grew in mundania certainly they did not grow as well but the stuff was heady and good once he got used to it the others were eating as happily they had all developed quite an appetite in the course of their trek up the mountain river and had not paused to grow a meal of their own before approaching the castle smash especially tossed down puddings and flagons of drink with an abandon that set the castle servants gaping but the drink was stronger than what they were accustomed to dor soon found his awareness spinning pleasantly grundy began a little dance on the table a routine he had picked up from a mundane immigrant to xanth he called it the drunken sailors hornpipe and it did indeed look drunken king oary liked it applauding with his fat hands arnolde and irene ate more diffidently but the centaurs mass required plenty of sustenance and he was making good progress irene it seemed loved puddings so she could not hold back long zrne vgn lhfgs wt ad ezhq czlrdk king oary asked irene pleasantly oopsthey were seated along the table with the king at the end the king was beyond the aisle of magic but amolde grasped the problem quickly and angled his body so that he now faced the king that would extend the magic far enough irene too caught on were you addressing me your majesty she asked demurely dor had to admit she was very good at puffing on maidenly ways of course what other fair damsels are in this hall she colored slightly looking about as if to spy other girls she was getting more practiced at this sort of dissemblance thank you so much your majesty what is your lineage oh im king trenfs daughter the king nodded sagely im sure you are prettier than your mother did that mean something dor continued eating listening hoping irene could get some useful information from the obese monarch there was something odd here but dor did not know how to act until he had more definite information have you any news of my parents irene inquired having the wit and art to smile fetchingly at the king yet again dor had to suppress his unreasoning jealousy im so worried about them and she pouted cutely dor hadnt seen her use that expression before it must be a new one my henchmen are spying out information now the king reassured her soon we should have what news there is amolde glanced at dor a fleeting frown on his face he still did not trust oary tell me about onesd irene said brightly it seems like such a nice little kingdom oh it is it is the king agreed his eyes focusing on what showed of her legs two fine castles and several villages and some very pretty mountains for centuries we have fought off the savages two thousand years ago this was the heartland of the battleaxe people the cimmerians then the scyths came on their horses driving the footbound cimmerians south horses had not been seen in this country before they seemed like monsters from some fantasy land the king paused to chew up another pudding monsters from a fantasy landcould that refer to xanth dor wondered maybe some nightmares found a way out and turned mundane and that was the origin of day horses it was an intriguing speculation but here at the mountains the king resumed wiping pudding crust from his whiskers the old empire held many hundreds of years later the sarmatians drove out the scyths but did not penetrate this fastness he belched contentedly then came the gothsbut sfiff we held the border then from the south came the horrible civfflm romans and from the east the huns ah the huns irene agreed as if she knew someffng about them but still onesti survived here in the mountains unconquered though beset by barbarians the king concluded of course we had to pay tribute sometimes a necessary evff yet our trade is inhibited if we interact too freely with the barbarians there wig surely be mischief yet we must have trade if we are to survive my father came to trade irene said perhaps he got sidetracked by the dread ihazars or their magyar minions king oary suggested i have had some dealings with those they are savage canning brutes always alert for spoils i happen to speak their language so i know dor decided he would have to do some searching on his own questioning the objects in this vicinity but not right now while the king was watching he was sure the king was hiding something have you been king of onesti for a long time irene inquired innocently not long oary admitted my nephew omen was to be king but he was underage so i became regent when my brother died then omen went out huntingand did not return we fear he strayed too far and was ambushed by the khazars or magyars so i am king until we can declare omen officially dead there is no hope of his survival of course but the old council moves very slowly on such matters so king oary was in fact regent during the true kings absencemuch as dor was in xanth but this king was eager to retain the throne had there been foul play by other than the khazars dor found his head on the table contesting for space with a pudding he must have gotten quite sleepy whats going on he mumbled youve been dragged you fool thats what the table whispered in his ear theres more in that rotgut than booze ill tell youl dor reacted with shock but somehow his head chd not nse drugged why cause the imposter king doesnt like you thats why the table said he always drugs his enemies thats how he got rid of king omen and then that fake magician king magician kingl it was funny whispering with his head on the table but fairly private dois nose was almost under the pudding was that king trent thats what he called himself but he couldnt do magic he drank the drink alltrusting the way they all are the fools and went to sleep just like you yoifre all such suckers smash grtmdy dor cried as loudly as he could his head still glued to the table weve been betrayed drugged break out of here but now many guards charged into the hall remove this carrion king oary commanded throw them in the dungeon dont damage the girl shes too pretty to waste put the freak horse in the stable smash who had gulped huge quantities of the drugged drink nevertheless had strength to rouse himself and fight dor heard the noise but was facing the wrong way guards charged and screamed and retreated give it to them ogre grundy cried dancing on the table tear them up but then the violence abated hey dont slow down now grundy called whats the matter with you dor knew what had happened smash had wandered outside the magic aisle and lost his supernatural strength now the nagons of drugged drink took their toll as they would on any normal creature me sleep a peep smash said the last of his magic expended in the rhyme dor knew this fight was lost get out of here grundy he said with a special effort before you sleep too dont let them catch you ihe unconsciousness overcame dor dor woke with a headache he was lying on soursmelling hay in a dark cell as he moved something skittered away he suspected it was a rat he understood they abounded in mundania maybe that was a blessing the magic creatures of the night could be horrible in xanth there was the sound of muted sobbing dor held his breath a moment to make certain it wasnt himself he sat up peering through the gloom to find some vestige of light there was a ettle which grew brighter as his eyes acclimatized it seemed to be a candle in the distance but there was a wall in the way the light filtered through the cracks he oriented on the sobbing it was from an adjacent chamber separated from his own by massive stone pilings and huge wood timbers this must be the lower region of the castle these cells hollowed out from around the foundations there were gaps between the supports big enough for him to pass his arm through but not his body irene he asked oh dorl she answered immediately tearfully i thought i was alone what has become of us we were drugged and thrown in the dungeon he said king oary must have done the same to your parents before he couldnt quite remember where he had gotten that notion or how he himself had been drugged his memory was foggy on recent details but why my father came only to trade i dont know but i think king oary is a usurper maybe he murdered the rightful king and your folks found out oary knew he couldnt fool us long so he practiced his treachery on us too what do we do now she demanded hysterically oh dor rye never felt so horribler i think its the drug he said i feel bad too that should wear off if we have our magic we may be able to get free do you have your bag of seeds she checked no only my clothing do you have your gold and gems dor checked no they must have searched us and taken everything they thought was valuable or dangerous i dont have my sword either but then his questing fingers found something small i do have the jar of salve not that its much good here and my midnight sunstone it fell into the jacket lining let me s he brought it out no i guess not this has no light where are the others ill check he said floor where are my companions there was no answer that means we have no magic amolde must be in the stable he seemed to remember someffng about that foggily what about smash and grundy me here the ogre said from the opposite cell head hurt strength gone now dor had no further doubt the magic was gone the ogre wasnt rhyming and no doubt irenes hair had lost its color magic had strange little bypaths and side effects where loss was somehow more poignant than that of the major aspects but those major ones were vital without his magic strength smash could probably not break free of the dungeon grundy dor called inquiringly there was no answer grundy it seemed had escaped capture that was about the extent of their good fortune me got gauntlets smash said include one more item of fortune if the ogre should get his strength back those gauntlets would be a big help probably the castle guards had not realized the gauntlets were not part of the ogre since smash had used them for eating the ogreish lack of manners had paid off in this respect doris head was slowly clearing he tried the door to his cell it was of solid mundane wood worn but far too tough to break too tough too for smash in his present condition the ogre tried and couldnt budge his own door unless the centaur came wiffid range none of them had any sigafficant lever for freedom the doors seemed to be barred by some unreachable mechanism outside inside the slimy stone floor was interrupted only by a disposal sumpa small but deep hole that reeked of old excrement ohviously no one would be released for sanitary purposes either smash banged a fist against a wall owl he exclaimed now me miss centaurl he does have his uses dor agreed you know smash arnolde didnt really usurp chets place chet couldnt come with us anyway because of his injury and amolde didnt want to we pretty q much forced him into it by reveahng his magic talent ungh the ogre agreed me want out of here no like be weak i think well have to wait for whatever king oary plans for us dor said grimly if he planned to kill us he wouldnt have bothered to lock us in here dor im scared really scared irene said ive never been a prisoner before dor peered out through the cracks in his door had the flickering candle shadow moved the guard must be coming in to eavesdrop naturally king oary would want to know their secretsand irene just might let out their big one before she realized he had to warn herwithout the guard catching on they just might turn this to their advantage he went to the wall that separated them it win be a good idea to plan our course of action he said if they question us tell them what they want to know therds no point in concealing anything since were innocent he managed to reach his arm through the crevice in the wall nearest her but we dont want them to force us into any false statements les hand touched someffng soft it was irene she made a sfled eeek then grasped his hand let me review our situation dor said i am yang during icing trents absence he squeezed her hand once you are king trents daughter he squeezed again once amolde the centaur is also a prince among his people this time he squeezed twice what are you talking about she demanded amoldes not she broke off as he squeezed several times hard then she began to catch on she was a bright enough girl not with us now she concluded and squeezed his hand once if the centaur does not return to his people on schedule they will probably come after him with an army dor said squeezing twice a big army she agreed returning the two squeezes with many fine archers and spear throwers thirsty for blood and a big catapult to loft huge stones against the castle she was getting into it now they had their signals set one squeeze for truth two for falsehood that way they could talk privately even if someone were eavesdropping im glad were alone he said squeezing twice so we can talk freely alone she agreed with the double squeeze yes now she knew why he was doing this she was a smart girl and he liked that nymphlike proportions did not have to indicate nymphlike stupidity we have no chance to break out of here ourselves dor said squeezing twice we have no resources they dont already know about two we dont have magical powers or anything she agreed with an emphatic double squeeze but maybe it would be better to let them think we have magic dor said not squeezing that might make them treat us better there is that she agreed if the guards thought we could zap them through the walls they might let us out maybe we should figure out something to fool them with he said this time squeezing once something to distract them while the centaur army is massing like growing plants very fast if they thought you could grow a tree and burst out the ceiling and maybe make this castle collapse they would take me out of this cell and keep me away from seeds she said then maybe i could escape and set out some markers so the centaurs can find us more quickly yes but you cant just tell the mundanes about growing things it has to seem that they forced it out of you and youll need some good excuse in case they challenge you to grow something you could say the time of the month is wrong or or that i have to do it in a stable she said that would get me out of the heavily guarded area by the time they realize its a fake and that i cant grow anything i may have escaped yes but had they set this up correctly would it trick the guards into taking irene to the stable where amolde might be or would they not bother this business of deception was more difficult than he had thought then she signaled alarm what about smash theyr want to know how he tore off the front gate when he cant do a thing now dor thought fast we have to hide from them the fact that the ogre is strong only when hes angry the guard at the gate insulted smash so naturally he tore off the gate but king oary gave him a good meal so he wasnt really angry despite getting drugged maybe we can trick a guard into saying something mean to smash or depriving him of food or water when smash gets hungry he gets mean and he has a big appetite if they try starving him watch outl hell blow his top and tear this cellar apart yes she agreed thats really our best hope ultreatment we dont even need to trick anybody all we have to do is wait by midday tomorrow smash will be storming well all escape over the dead bodies of the guards who get in the way we may not need the centaurs at all something caught doris eye he squeezed irenes hand to call her attention to it the guard was quietly moving no doubt a hot report was going upstairs youre an idiot irene murmured squeezing his hand twice you get these fool notions to fool our captors and theyll never work i dont know why i even talk to you because its better than tafling to the rats he said without squeezing rats she cried horrified where i thought i saw one when i woke maybe i was wrong no this is the kind of place they like she squeezed his hand not with any signal oh dorweve got to get out of here they may take you out pretty soon to verify that you cant grow plants she squeezed his hand seamingly they already know actually the purpose of the fake dialogue had been to convince their captors that dor and irene had no magic then if they somehow got the chance to use magic the guards would be caught completely by surprise in addition they had probably guaranteed good treatment for smashif their ruse had been effective soon a wan crack of dawn flltered in through the ceiling near what they took to be the east wall but the angle was wrong and dor finally concluded that they were incarcerated against the west wan above the cliff vnth the eght enteting only by emde reffeedon it would have been much bdghter on the other side no chance to tunnel out even if they had the strength what use to step off the che guards brought smash a huge basket of bread and a barrel of water foodl the ogre exclaimed happily and crunched up entire loaves in single mouthfuls as was his wont then perceiving that neither dor nor irene had been served he hurled several loaves through to them dor squeezed one through the crevice to irene the water was harder to manage no cups had been provided but dois thirst abruptly intensified perhaps in reaction to the wine of the day before he finally borrowed and flued one of the ogres gauntlets and jammed that through to irene tastes like sour sweat she complained but she drank it then shoved the gauntlet back dor drank the rest of it agreeing with her analysis of the taste and returned the gauntlet to smash with due thanks sweatflavored water was much better than thirst give me your hand again irene said thinking she had more strategy to discuss dor passed his right arm through the crack gnawing on a loaf held in his left ibat was a mean thing you did getting me food she murmured squeezing twice well you know i dont like you dor told her returning the double squeeze he wasnt sure this mattered to their eavesdropper but the reversals were easy enough to do i never liked you she returned in kind in fact i think i hate you what was she saying the double squeeze suggested reversal the opposite of what she said reverse hate what would i want with an ugly girl like you anyway he demanded there was a long pause dor stared through the crack seeing a strand of her hair and as he had expected it had lost its green tint then he reahud he had forgotten to squeeze belatedly he did so twice ugly huh she squirmed about bringing something soft into contact with his palm is that ugly im not sure what it is dor said he squeezed experimentally eeeki she yiped and swatted his hand ugly as sin he said trying to picture female anatomy so as to ascertain what he had pinched it certainly had been interestingl ill bite your hand she threatened in their old game there are teeth there he inquired surprised for an instant she choked whether on mirth or anger he could not quite tell with my mouth ill bite she clarified but only her lips touched his fingers you wouldnt dare she kissed his hand twice more ouch dor cried now she bit him lightly twice he wasnt sure what mood this signified it was a new variant of an old game perhaps no more but it caused dor to think about his relationship with irene he had known her since childhood she had always been jealous of his status as magician and had always taunted him and sicked her plants on himyet always too had been the underlying knowledge that they were destined for each other he had resisted that as violently as shebut as they grew older the sexual element had begun to manifest at first in supposedly innocent games and accidental exposures then more deviously but seriously when he had been twelve and she eleven they had kissed for the first time with feeling and the experience had shaken them both since then their quarreling had been tempered by the knowledge that each could give a new kind of joy to the other potentially when conditions were right irenes recent development of body had intensified that awareness and their spats had had a voyeuristic element such as when they had torn the clothes off each other in the moat now when they could not be sure of their fate and in the absence of anything else to do this relationship had become much more important for the moment almost literally all he had was irene why should they quarrel in what might be their last hours yes i definitely hate you irene said nipping delicately at the tip of one of his fingers twice as if testing it for digestibility i hate you too dor said trying to squeeze but only succeeding in poking his finger into her mouth his whole being seemed to concentrate on that hand and whatever it touched and the caress of her lips was excruciatingly exciting i wish i could never see you again she said hugging his hand to her bosom this was getting pretty seriousl yet he found that he felt the same he never wanted to leave her they werent even squeezing now playing the game of reversal with increasing intensity and comprehension was this merely a reaction to the fear of extinction he could not be surebut was unable to resist the current of emotion i wish i ceuld hurt you he said having trouble formulating a properly negative concept id hurt you backl she hugged his hand more tightly id like to grab you and again the problem and what she demanded and once more he found his hand encountering strange anatomy or something les inability to identify it was driving him crazyl was it limb or torso above or below the waistand which did he want it to be and squeeze you to pieces he said giving a good squeeze that moatscene had been nothing compared with this this time she did not make any sound of protest i wouldnt marry you if you were the last man alive she whispered she had upped the ante again she was taling of marriage dor was stunned unable to respond she caressed his hand intimately would you she prompted dor had not thought much about marriage despite his involvement in good magician humfreys wedding he somehow thought of marriage as the perquisite of old people like his parents and king trent and humfrey he dor was only sixteen yet in xanth the age of consent coincided with the age of desire if a person thought he was old enough to marry and wished to do so and had a willing bride he could make the alliance thus a marriage could be contracted at age twelve or at age one hun ed magidw humfrey had hardly seemed ready even at that exuemel did he want to marry when he thought of the next few hours perhaps his last he wanted to for he had known he would have to marry before his efe was out it was a requirement of kingship like being a magician but when he thought of a iffetime in xanth he wasint sure there was a lot of time and so much could happen in a lifetimer as humfrey had said there were positive and negative upects i dont know he said you dont knowl she flared oh i hate youl and she bit his hand once and her sharp teeth cut the flesh painfully oh yes this was getting seriousl dor tried to jerk his hand away but she clung to it you oaft you ingrate she exclaimed you manl and her face pressed against his hand moistly moistly yes she was crying perhaps there was art to it nevertheless this unnerved dor if she felt that strongly could he afford to feel less did he feel less then a tidal swell of emotion flooded him what did it matter how much time there was or how old he was or where they were he did love her i would not he said and tweaked her slick nose twice she continued crying into his hand but now there was a gentler feeling to it she was no longer angry with him these were tears of joy it seemed they were engaged hey dor a whisper came it was from his own cell grundy dor whispered back he tried to signal irene but she seemed to have fallen asleep against his hand sorry i was so long the golem said it took time to sleep off that knockout juice and more time to find a good secret route here without rlmning afoul of the rats i talked to themrat language seems to be much the same all over so i didnt need the magicbut theyre mean i finally made myself a sword out of this big ol hatpin and after i struck a few they decided to cooperate he brandished the weapon a bent iron sliver it did look deadly poked at a rats eye it would be devastating irene and i are engaged dor said the golem squinted at him to determine whether this was a joke and concluded it was not you are of all things why did you propose to her now i didnt dor confessed she proposed to me i think but you cant even touch her i can touch her dor said remembering not where it counts yes where it countsi think the golem shrugged this off as fantasy well it wont make any difference if we dont get out of here i tried to talk to the animals and plants around here but most of them i cant understand without magic i dont think they know anything about king trent and queen iris anyway but im sure old king oarys up to something how can i spring you get amolde into range dor said ibats not easy dor theyve got him in a stable with a barlock setup like this too heavy for me to force and out of his reach crude but effective if i could spring him i could spring you but weve got to get together dor whispered we need magic and thats the only way they arent going to let him out grundy said theyve got this fool notion that an army of warrior centaurs is marching here and they dont want anyone to know theres a centaur in the castle irene woke are you talking to me dear she asked dear grundy chortled hoo has she lassoed youl quietl dor whispered fiercely the guard is listening but he wondered whether that was really his concern is that the golem irene asked want to hold hands with me dear grlmdy called go unravel your string she snapped back anything but that grundy said smiling mischievously i want to stick around and watch the nuptials how are you going to make it through the wall let me get at that bigmouthed imp irene said ill jam him down the sump headfirst how did you get the poor sucker to accept the knot the golem persisted did you scream at him show him some forbidden flesh and cry big green tears the sump is too good for him she gritted if you both dont be quiet the eavesdropping guard will learn everything dor warned ravaged by worry and embarrassment grundy looked at him outside the magic ambience they cant understand a word we say how can they eavesdrop dor was stunned i never thought of thatl had his entire ruse been for nothing how come they fed smash then irene demanded forgetting her fury with the golem as she came to grips with this new question how come they heard about the centaur army seems to me you saidor did i dream that i said it and its true grundy said you mean you started that story i overheard it when i was visiting amolde then i could understand the mundane speech we started it dor agreed and we gave them the notion that smash only has super strength when hes angry and he gets angry when hes hungry they brought him food very soon so they must have understood but how i think were about to find out grundy said fading into the shadow someones coming irene finally let go of doris hand and he drew it back through the wall his arm was cramped from the hours in the awkward position but dor hardly regretted the experience it was all right being engaged to irene he knew her well enough to know she would make a pretty good wife she would quarrel a lot but he was used to that because that was the way his mother chameleon was when she was in her smart phase actually a smart woman who quarreled was not smart at all but no one could tell her that irene like her obnoxious mother had a sense of the proprieties of the office queen lris mischief was never directed openly at the king if dor ever became king in fact as well as in name irene would never seek to undermine his power that was perhaps a more important quality than her physical appearance but he had to admit that she had acquired a most interesting body those touches she had used to tantalize him that grundy had so acutely notedthey had been marvelously effective viously she had been attempting to seduce him into acquiescenceand she had succeeded as the gorgon had intimated irene had him pretty well contained what the gorgon had not hinted was the fact that such captivity was quite comfortable to the captive like a warm jacket on a cold day good magician humfrey was undoubtedly a happy man right now despite his protestations in fact a mans objections to marriage were rather like irenes objections to people looking at her legsmore show than substance doris attention was jerked back to the immediate situation by the arrival of the mundanes there were three guards one carrying a crude iron bar they stopped before irenes cell and used the bar to pry up the wedged plank that barred it without that tool evidently the door could not be opened one of the guards went in and grabbed irene she did not resist she knew as well as dor did that this was the expected questioningshe would try to answer in such a way that they would take her to the stable where amolde was confined if only to prove she was lying then she could pry up the bar on the centaurs stall or start some devastating plant growing except that she had no seeds grundy he whispered find irenes seeds shell need them ill try the golem scrambled through a crevice and was gone now king oary entered the dungeon rn wfqd sgd jhmfr cztfgsdq he said vgzs hr wtq herb i dont understand you irene said his higimess king oary asks what is your magic one of the guards said his speech was heavily accented but he was intelhgible you know xanth speech she asked surprised how can that be you have no need to know the gaard said just answer the question wench so one of the mundanes here spoke the language of xanth doris mind started clicidng over this explained the eavesdroppingbut how could the man have teamed it however poorly he had to have been in contact with people from xanth go soak your snoot in the sump irene retorted dor winced she might be playing her role too boldlyl the king will use force the man warned better answer slut irene looked daunted as perhaps she was but those insulting references to her supposed status made her angry you answer first toady she said compromising ihe guard decided negotiation was the best course i met a spy from your country tart i am quick with languages he taught me then he went back to xanth to report to my father king trent irene exclaimed you promised him a trade agreement didnt you rogue if he would come himself to negotiate it it is your turn to answer hussy the man said oh all right wretch my magic is growing plants i can make anything grow from seed to tree in moments dor peering out could not see the mans face clearly but was sure there was a knowing expression on it ihe eavesdropper thought he knew better but didnt want to betray his own secret snooping so had to translate for the king rgd fzud sgd khd he said h vzms sgd sqtsgl oary snapped ies majesty suspects you are deceiving us the guard said what is your real magic what does ol fatso care im not doing any magic now you had magic when you came trollop the ogre used unnatural strength to destroy our front gate and you all spoke our language now the ogre is weak and you speak your own language what happened to the magic the language dor cursed himself for overlooking that detail of course that had given away their secret king trent would have used an interpreterprobably this same manand the ability of doris party to converse directly would have alerted cunning king oary immediately he had known they had operative magic and now wanted to discover the mechanism of it well if you bring me some seeds thug maybe i can find out irene said im sure i can grow plants if i just find the right place bless her she was still trying to get to the stable where she really could perform but the mundanes thought they knew better if the king says you lie you lie strumpet the guard said again i ask what is your real magic can you speak in tongues and cause others to do the saine of course not villain she said otherwise we wouldnt need you to translate to his lowness king puddingbelly here would we plants are all i can enchant rgd vhkk mns sdkk the guard said to the king vd rgzkk lzjd ghl sdkk the king responded snqstqd gdq hm eqnms timeghl the other two guards grabbed irenes arms and hauled her a few steps down the hall until they were directly in

wrestled irenes jacket and silverlined fur off her body while she struggled and cursed them roundly then the translator put his hand on her neckline and brutally ripped downward the blouse tore down the front exposing her fine bosom irene shocked at this sudden physical violence heaved with her arms but the two men held her securely vdkk knnj zs sgzs the king exclaimed admiringly h sgntfgs innkx gdq kdfr vdqd fnne dor could not understand a word of the language but he grasped the essence readily enough king translator and both guards were all ga king at irenes revealed body so was dor he had thought irene did not match the gorgon in general architecture but irene had iffed out somewhat since he had last looked he had had the chance to see during the quarrel in the moat but there had been other distractions then during the journey south to centaur isle rene had kept herself fairly private and perhaps her excellent legs had led his attention away from her other attributes now he saw that she was no longer reaching for bodily maturity she had achieved it at the same time he was furious with the king and his henchmen for exposing irene in this involuntary manner he determined not to tell them anything gd khjdr gdq knt snke id the king said h bzm rdd vgx sgqdzsdm gdq zme gdkk szkj the king was plotting something dastardly dor hardly dared imagine what he might do to irene he couldnt stand to have her hurt the translator stood in front of irene and formed a fist he drew back his arm aiming at her belly stop dor cried ill tell shut up irene snapped at him one of her knees jerked up catching the translator in the groin ihe man doubled over and the surprised guards allowed irene to tear herself free leaving shreds of cloth in their hands barebreasted as any nymph she ran a few steps stooped to pick up the dooropening bar and whirled to apply it to doris door run dor cried dont waste time on me but it was already too late both guards had drawn their flat swords and were closing on irene she turned raising the bar defensively determined to fight no dor screamed his voice breaking ibeyll kill you but now there was a new distraction smash snoozing before had become aware of the situation he rattled his door angrily kiul he bellowed both guards and the king blanched they believed the ogres fantastic strength stemmed from his anger if they hurt irene while smash watched the translator was beginning to recover from his injury it probably had been a glancing blow gdqc gdq hmsn gdq bdkk he gasped to the other two guards then to irene girlgo quickly to your cell and they wont hurt you irene realizing that she could not hope to escape the two swordsmen and knowing that the bluff of smaslfs strength should not be called edged toward her cell the two guards followed cautiously smash watched still angry but with the sense not to protest as long as the guards were holding off then irene stepped into her cell the guards slammed the door shut and barred it and the crisis was over you should have run out of the dungeonl dor said with angry relief i couldnt leave you she replied where would i find another like you dor wasnt certain quite how to take that was it a compliment or a deprecation king oary himself seemed shaken sgzs fhqkr mns tnnkx adztshetk rgd gzr ehfgshmf rohqhs he said cwns gtqs gdq h itrs ehme z trd enq gdq he turned about and marched out of the dungeon followed by his henchmen the translator though still uncomfortable had to remain where he thought he was just out of sight to eavesdrop some more the dungeon settled back into its normal gloom they were plotting something worse dor knew but at least irene had escaped unhurt and the secret of their magic had been pr served at least in part the mundanes knew the prisoners had magic but still had not fathomed its mechanism it was a temporary respite but much better than nothing i think wed better get out of here soon irene said as the mundanes departed give me your hand what was she contemplating this time dor passed his hand through the crevice she took it in her own and kissed it that was nice enough though he found himself obscurely disappointed she had lost her jacket and blouse she took his wrist in her hand and had him spread his fingers then she put something into his hand dor almost exclaimed with surprise for it was hard and cold and heavy it was the iron bar of coursel in their confusion the guards had foreoften that irene retained the bar she had picked up now dor had this useful tool or weapon maybe he could lever open his door from the inside but a guard was in the hall probably the translator though there could have been a change dor didnt dare try the door now he would have to wait in fact he could not risk prying at any other part of the cell for the noise would alert the guard and call attention to his possession of the bar so for now they had to waitand there were things he wanted to tell irene you were awfully brave he said you faced up to those thugs i was scared almost speechless she confessed that was surely an overstatement she had traded jibes with the translator quite neatly but i knew theyd hurt you if hurt me it was you they well i worry about you dor you wouldnt be able to manage without me she was teasing himmaybe i like your new outfit he said but maybe youd better take my jacket maybe so she agreed its cool here dor removed his centaur jacket and squeezed it through the creyice she donned it and was quite fetching in it though it tended to fall open in front or perhaps that was why he found it so fetching at least the jacket would protect her from the cold and from the attack of instruments like swords or spears because it was designed to resist penetration and it wouldnt hurt to have her body concealed from the lecherous eyes of the king and his henchmen doris jealousy of such things remained in force grundy reappeared i got a seed he said the bags in the kings chamber along with the magic sword i knew it was safe to sneak in there because the king was down here but i couldnt carry the whole bag couldnt find the magic compass at all they must have thrown that away so i picked out what looked like a good seed give it here irene said eagerly yesthis is a tangler if i could start it and drop it in the hall but you cant dor said not without he caught himself for the eavesdropper was surely eavesdropping i have an idea dor said suppose we brought a part of youknow who herewould it have a little magic enough to start one seed irene considered a piece of hoof maybe i dont know its worth a try im on my way grundy said i always thought girls were supposed to be timid and sweet and to scream helplessly at the mere sight of trouble dor said but youthose guards you saw too much of millie the ghost real girls arent like that except when they want to be you certainly arent but i never thought youd risk your life like that are you disappointed dor considered no youre a lot more girlmore woman than i thought i guess i do need you if i didnt love you before i do now and not because of your looks though when it comes to that really she asked sounding like an excited chud well i could be overreacting because of our imprisornent i liked it better unqualified she said oh sure uh i think youre beautiful butj then wed better check again after we get out of this to see if we feel the same no sense being hasty dor was shaken you have doubts well i might meet a handsomer many uh yes dor said unhappily she laughed im teasing you girls are smarter about appearances than boys are we go for quality rather than packaging i have no doubt at all i love you dor i never intended to marry anyone else but i refuse to take advantage of you when youre unsettled maybe when you get older youll change your mind youre younger than i am girls mature faster hadnt you noticed now dor laughed just today i noticed she kissed his hand again well its all yours when when dor considered the ramification of that and felt warm all over she had a body truebut what pleased him most was the lovalty implied she would be with him she would support him whatever happened dor realized he needed that support he really would foul up on his own irene was strong when not jarred by an acute crisis she had nerve he lacked her personality complemented his shoring up his weakness she was the one who had gotten them going on this rescue mission her determination to rescue her father had never relented with her at his side he could indeed be king his reflections were interrupted by the return of the golem i got three hairs from his tail he whispered hes very vain about his tail like all his breed its his best feature maybe theyll be enough did some magic adhere to portions of the centaur that were removed from his body dor brought out his midnight sunstone gem and held it close to the hairs almost he thought he saw a gleam of light deep within the crystal but maybe that was a reflection from the wan illumination of the cell take them in to irene dor said hardly allowing himself to hope grandy did so irene set the seed down on the tail hairs and leaned close grow she breathed they were disappointed the seed seemed to try to swell expectantly but could not grow there was not enough magic maybe if i took it back to amolde grundy said irene was silent and dor reaumd she was sffldg her tears she had really hoped her magic would work yes try that dor told the golem maybe the seed has been started maybe it just needs more magic now grundy took the seed and the tail hairs and departed again dor reached through the crevice to pat irene on the shoulder it was worth the try he said she clutched his hand i need you dor when i collapse you just keep on going there was that complementary aspect again she would soon recover her determination and nerve but in the interim she needed to be steadied they remained that way for what seemed like a long time and despite the despair they both felt dor would not have traded it somehow this privation enhanced their personal liaison making their love bum more fiercely and reach deeper what would happen after this day he could not know but he was certain he had been changed by this experience of emotion his age of innocence in a fundamental and positive sense had passed then a commotion began in the distance the sound electrified them was it possible grundy burst in on them it worked he cried that seed started growing the moment i got it in the magic aisle it heaved right out of its shell it must have been primed by your command in that bit of magic with the tall hairs i had to throw it down outside the stall it worked irene cried jubilantly i always knew it wouldll i told amolde where we are just in case grundy continued excitedly ibat tangler will rip apart his stalll but can he get through all the locked doors irene asked turning worried her moods were swinging back and forth now he cant do magic himself and theres no one with him to im way ahead of you doll the golem said i scouted all around he cant get through those doors but he can get out the gate that smash ripped off cause they havent fixed that yet and theres a small channel outside the castle wall and these cells are against the wall unless the outside wall is over his aisledepth and if it is she prompted as if uncertain whether to go into a scream of jubilation or of despair im sure the wall isnt grundy said its not more than six of your paces thick and his aisle reaches twice that far forward but well soon find out because hell soon be on his way the clamor continued i hope amolde doesnt get hurt dor said king oary took our supply of healing elixir too probably dumped it down a sump grundy said dake all the sick maggots healthy sti by the outer wall irene told him when you can talk to it dor well know the centaues here ill go check on his progress grundy said and scurried away again that tangler should be almost fullgrown now irene said i hope amolde has the sense to stay away from its tentacles then she reconsidered but not so far away the lack of magic kills the tree hes got to keep it in the aisle untu it does its job once he leaves it will die speak to me wall dor said touching the stone there was no response whats up smash inquired from the next cell grundy took a sprouted tangler seed to amolde dor explahied we hope the centaurs on his way here at length me strength the ogre said comprehending heyyou rhymed dor cried he must be here me see smash said he punched his fist through the wall near dor youve got it dor said go rip open your doorl then you can free irene and mel ihe ogre tramped to the front of his cell and gleefully smashed at his front door ooo that hurt he grunted shaking his gauntleted fist the door had not given way i es strength is gone againl irene said somethings wrongl dor cudgeled his brain what could account for this partial recovery where is the centaur now he asked his back wall fearing it would not answer right outside irenes cell it replied cenging to a narrow track above a chasm terrified dor visualized the centaurs position then he cant face directly into the castle he can only turn a little the wall agreed any more and hen fall off soldiers are getting ready to put arrows in his tail too so his magic aisle slants in obliquely dor concluded it covers this wall but not the front of our cells anybody can see that idiot the wall agreed smugly dor used his sunstone to verify the edge of the aisle the gem flashed and darkened as it passed outside the magic the line was only a few handspans inside doris wall projecting farther into smashs cell hey smash dor cried the magics only at this end bash out the outer wall to let amolde in right site smash agreed he aimed his huge horny gauntleted hamfist dont hit me the wall cried i support the whole castle but it was too late the fist powered through the brick and stone oooo that smarts the wall turned out to be double two sections of stone with a filling of rubble between smash ripped out the loose core then pulverized the outer barrier gaining enthusiasm as he went iu moments bright daylight shone through the cloud of dust the ogre ripped out more chunks widening the aperture beyond was the back of the mountain falling awesomely away into a heavily wooded valley good to see you brute amoldes voice came clear an entrance for me before these savages attack smash leaned out he grabbed a stone duck cluck he warned and hurled his missile there was a thud and scream as someone was knocked off the ledge what did you do irene cried appalled then amoldes front end appeared in the gap in the wall centaur and ogre embraced joyously i think he knocked off an enemy dor said irene sounded weak with relief oh i guess theyre friends now we need both magic and power dor agreed each is helpless without the other they have come to understand that we have all come to understand a lot of things she agreed smiling obscurely now amolde faced the front door putting it within the aisle and smash marched up and lucked it off its moorings then he took hold of the front wall and tore it out of the floor debris crashed down from the ceiling dont bring the whole castle down on usl dor warned while irene choked on the voluminous dust me wrestle this castle the ogre said unworried he hoisted one paw to the ceiling and the collapse abated there was a stray guard in the hall the man watched the progress of the ogre a few moments in silence then fainted grundy reappeared troops coming he reported wed better move they moved doors and gates were locked but smash smashed them clear like so much tissue when they encountered a wall he burst right through it they emerged into an inner court where flowers grew grow growl growl lrene ordered and the plants exploded upward and outward where is our safest retreat dor asked the next wan the other side of me dolt it replied smash opened another hole and they trooped out into a section of forest soon they had hidden themselves well away from the castle they were together again and free and it felt wonderful they paused catching their breaths assessing their situation eyerybody all right dor asked around no serious injuries there seemed to be none so have you reconsidered irene inquired you know how i abhor you he looked at her she was still wearing his jacket over her bare upper torso her hair was tangled and dirt smudged her face she seemed pretematurally lovely yes he said and the answer comes out the same i still hate you he took her in his arms and kissed her and she was all eager and yielding in the manner of her kindwhen her kind chose to be if that be hate amolde remarked i would be interested in witnessing their love the idiots are engaged to each other grundy explained to the others it seems they saw the eght in the darkness or something or someffng the centaur agreed dubiously now we have arrived dor said taking charge after reluctantly disengaging from irene but we have not accomplished our mission i believe this is the place king trent and queen iris came to i think the table told me they were here just before i passed out from king oarys drug but i might have dreamed that the memory is very foggy have we any solid proof apart from the henchman who speaks the language of xanth grundy asked ibats circumstantial irene said it only proves he had contact with the xanth scout not that king trent actually came here we have to be sure my evidence is rather tenuous amolde offered it seems that the stable hands had difficulty thinking of me as a person of intellect and spoke more freely in my vicinity than they might otherwise have done i declined to speak to them in what i confess might be construed as a fit of pique chic pique smash chuckled and so they did not realize that the magic in your vicinity caused their language to be intelligible to you or that you had the wit to comprehend it dor put in pleased we could not communicate with them without an interpreter so it was natural for them to assume you couldnt either that combined with their tending to think of you as an animal precisely my pique may have been fortuitous so i found myself overhearing certain things that were perhaps not entirely my affair he smiled in one case literally it seems one of the cooks has a continuing liaison with a scullery maid he broke off grimacing right beside my stall it was instructive they are lusty folk at any rate there was at one point a reference to a certain alien king who it seems had claimed to be able to perform magic king trentl dor exclaimed my memory was right then not a dream the table did say king trent was here i think we always knew it irene agreed gjowering in memory of the betrayal associated with that table ibe translator knew about the magic of xanth dor continued but of course no one could do magic here in mundania until we discovered you amolde king trent would have said he could do magic in xanth and the qualification got dropped in translation certainly the centaur agreed it seems that king oary somehow anticipated magic that he thought might greatly enhance his power and was very angry when that magic did not materialize so he arrested the alien king treacherously and locked him away hoping to coerce him into performing or into revealing the secret of his power where irene demanded where is my father i regret i did not overhear more than i have told you the alien king was not named i do not believe the people of the stables knew his identity or believe in his power or know where he may be confined they merely gossip the apparent magic of smashs initial display of strength and the manner we communicated with king oary caused a considerable ripple of interest around the castle and indeed in the entire kingdom of onesti which accounts for the gossip about similar cases but already this interest is waning since both strength and communication appeared to have been illusion it is very easy to attribute phenomena to illusion or false memory when practical explanations are lacking and mundanes do this often he sanded grimly i daresay a new round of speculation has comanenced considering the events of the past hour your tangle plant irene was gratifyingly impressive it sure was grundy agreed enthusiastically it was grabbing people right and left and it ripped the stall apart but when amolde left the tangler sank down dead magic plants cant function without magic dummy irene said fortunately amolde agreed on occasion it reached for me then i angled away from it depriving it of magic and it desisted after a time it ceased to bother me even a tangler isnt totally stupid irene laughed at least we have more to go on dor said we can be pretty sure king oary imprisoned king trent and queen his and that they remain alive oarys experience with us must have enhanced his conviction that anyone from xanth is hiding magic from him since we really did have magic then stopped showing it when he imprisoned us he probably intended to force us to teer him the secret of magic so he could do it too or at least compel the rest of us to perform for l king oary strikes me as a pretty cunning old rascal irene said wrongheaded but cunning indeed amolde agreed from my observation he runs this kingdom reasonably well but unscrupulously perhaps that is what is required to maintain the precarious independence from the larger empires on three sides we still need to locate king trent dor said amolde did you hear anything else that might remotely connect i am not sure dor there was a reference to king omen oarys predecessor who disappeared it seems the common folk liked him and were sorry to lose him he was king dor asked i understood he was underage so oary was regent and omen never actually became king i gather in contrast that he was indeed king for about a year before he disappeared the centaur said they called him good omen and believe the kingdom of onesti would have prospered under his guidance surely it would have dor agreed he realized that king oary might have preferred to minime king omens stature in order to make his own position more secure if the kingdom of onesti was weer run it could have been mostly king omens doing a trade agreement with xanth could help both kingdoms maybe ying omen was arranging that then got deposed before king trent arrived ying oarys greed has cost him that chance the peasants suspect that ying omen was illicitly removed the centaur continued some even choose to believe that he still lives that king oary imprisoned him by subterfuge and usurped power this may of course be mere wish fumment and just may be the truth irene put in if king oary deceived and imprisoned us and did the same with my parents why not also with good ying omen it certainly fits his pattern we are indulging in a great deal of supposition amolde said seamingly we could encounter disappointment yet if i may extend the rationaleit occurs to me that if king trent and king omen both survive they may be confined together we have already seen that the dungeons of castle onesti are not extensive if there is another castle and we find one confined there we find the other irene finished and if we rescued them both good omen would be king of onesti again and all would be well id sure like to depose hoary king oaryl that was the extrapolation of my conjectures amolde agreed yet i reiterate it is highly speculative its worth a try dor said now lets plan our strategy probably only king oary knows where king trent andor king omen are incarcerated and he wont tell i could question the stones of the castle but probably the kings arent here at all and the stones wouldnt know anything about other places if the local servants dont know anything about it it probably isnt known so the question is how can we get him to tell he ought to have a guilty conscience irene said maybe we could play on that distrust this dor said i encountered some bad people and creatures in another adventure and i dont think their consciences troubled them because they simply didnt believe they were doing anything wrong goblins and harpies of course they dont have consciences irene snapped but oary is a person human beings can be worst of all especially mundanes dor said many of them have ravaged xanth over the centuries and king oary may contemplate something similar i just dont have much confidence in any appeal to his conscience i perceive your point amolde said but i think appeal is not the appropriate term a guilty conscience more typically manifests in the perception of nocturnal specters not many speciers running around this far from xanth grandy pointed out we could scare him into giving it away irene exclaimed tonight dor decided we must rest and feed ourselves firstand hide from king oarys troops they had no trouble avoiding the troops it took oarys forces some time to organize after the devastation smash had caused during the breakout and only now after the long discussion was any real activity manifesting at the castle irene made vines grow bristling with thorns in their natural state these had been a nuisance but now they were a menace when the magic moved away the vines died for they had been extended far beyond their natural limitsbut the tangle of thorns remained as a formidable barrier that coupled with the mundanes knowledge that the ogre lurked in the forest kept the guards close to the castle even after they emerged they were not eager for contact with the creature who had bashed all those holes in the massive walls at night rested doris party made its play grandy had scouted the castle so they knew which tower contained the royal suite king oary was married but slept alone his wife couldnt stand him he ate well and conlmed much alcoholic beverage this facilitated his sleep they had fashioned a platform that smash carried to the base of the outer wall nearest the royal tower which happened to be on the forest side amolde mounted this bringing his magic aisle within range of the king irene had scouted for useful mundane seeds and had assembled a small collection now she planted several climbing vines and in the ambience of magic they assumed somewhat magical properties they mounted wall and platform vigorously sending their little anchortendrils into any solid substance they found quickly binding the platform firmly in place amolde had to keep moving his legs to avoid tendrils that swiped at his feet until the growing stage passed that level the plants ascended to the embrasure that marked the kings residence then halted the magic aisle extended more inward than upward grundy used the sturdy vines to mount to that embrasure he scrambled over found himself a shrouded corner and called quietly down i can see inside some but i dont dare get close enough to cover the whole room talk to the plant irene said in her dontbedumb tone she no longer used that on dor mute recognition of their changed situation but obviously she retained the expertise say yes the golem agreed theres a vine that reaches inside he paused talking to the plant it says oarys not alone hes got a doxy in his bed he would irene grumped men like that will do anything it occurred to dor that this could be the reason the translator had persisted in addressing irene as slut and strumpet this was the type of woman king oary nominally associated with but dor decided not to mention this to irene she already had reason enough to hate oary dor climbed the vines finding a lodging against the watt just beneath the embrasure describe the room he murmured to grundy ive got to know exactly whats in it and where the golem consulted with the plant there is this big feather bed to the right two of your paces in from this wall a wooden bench straight in from the embrasure six paces with her dress strewn on it a wooden table to its left one paceand theres your sword on it and amoldes bag of spells ha dor exclaimed quietly i need that sword too bad its not the variety that wields itself i could call it right to me the golem continued describing the room until dor was satisfied he had the details properly fixed in his mind he was able to picture it noweverything just so i hope my mind doesnt go blank he called down dont you dare irene snapped save your fouling up for some other time do i have to come up there and prompt you that might help dor confessed you see i cant make things say specific things they only answer questions or talk in response to my words usually and the inanimate is not too bright and sometimes perverse so i may indeed foul it up for pitys sake irene took hold of the vines and began climbing and dont look up my skirt she said to amolde i wouldnt think of it the centaur said equably i prefer to view equine limbs and never did see the merit in pink panties theyre not pink she said theyre not i must be colorblind let me see forget it she joined dor gave him a quick kiss wrapped her skirt closely about her legs and settled in for the duration dor had worried about the strength of the vines with all this weight on them but realized she would have a better notion than he how much they could hold well start she whispered but if i talk loud enough for the things to hear me so will king oary she sighed you are a dumbbell at times dear you dont have to talk aloud to objects just direct your attention to them thats the way your magic works as for king oaryif that snippet with him knows her trade he woift be paying any attention to whats outside the castle she was right dor concentrated but stul couldnt quite get it together he was used to spealdng aloud to objects are they really not pink he asked irrelevantly mat youryouknows she laughed my panties you mean you never looked dor embarrassed admitted that he had not youre entitled now you know but i wasnt back when i had a chance to see she released her grip on the vine with one hand and reached over to tweak his cheek in much the manner the gorgon had youre something sort of rare and special dor well you get this job done right and ill show you will you get on with it grundy demanded from above but she says not till after this jobs done dor said i was referring to the job the golem snapped ill tell you what color her i will wring your rag body into a tight little knot irene threatened and the golem was silent prompted by this dor concentrated on the magic sword on the kings table groan he ordered it mentally ediently the sword groaned naturally it hammed it up groooaanl it singsonged in an awful key the doxy just sat up straight grundy reported gleefully as the vine rustled the news to him oh she shouldnt have done that shes stark bare nude nakedl skip the pornography you little voyeurl irene snapped its the king we want to rouse she nudged dor you know the script we worked out let me free let me free dor concentrated again sword i have a game for you if you play your part well you can scare the pants off bad king oary hey great the sword exclaimed only theyre already off him boy is he fat no dont talk to me talk to the king groan again and say let me free let me freel the idea is youre the ghost of good king omen coming back to haunt him can you handle that or are you too stupid ill show youl the sword exclaimed it groaned again with hideous feeling it was definitely a ham theres someone here the doxy screamed there cant be the king muttered ibe guards prevent anyone from getting through they know i dont want to be disturbed when im conducting affairs of state affairs of state irene hissed furiously affair anyway dor said trying to calm her let me free let me free the sword groaned enthusiastically then whos that the doxy demanded hiding under the feathers i am the ghooost of goood king ooomen the sword answered dor no longer needed to prompt it the doxy emitted a halfstiffed squeak and disappeared entirely into the feathers according to gruntlys gleeful playbyplay report the king clutched a feather quilt about him causing part of the doxy to reappear to her dismay you cant be oary retorted shakily trying to see where the voice came from the lone candle illuminating the room cast many wavering shadows the plant reported making such detection difficult coming back from the graaave to haaunt you the sword continued really getting into it impossible but the king looked nervous grundy reported hes a tough one irene murmured he should be terrified and hes only worried were only scaring the doxy who doesnt matter girls can be such foolish creatures then she reconsidered when they want to be dor nodded worried himself if this ruse didnt work yooou killed me the sword said i did not oary shouted ionly locked you up untu i figured out what to do with you i never killed you the doxys face reappeared replacing the rounder portion of her that had showed before you locked up good omen she asked surprised i had to or i never would have gotten the throne the king said absently i thought he would foul up as king but he didnt so there was no way to remove him legitimately as he talked he hoisted his porcine torso from the bed wrapped the quilt about it and stalked the voice he heard but i didnt kill him i am too cautious for that it is too hard to undo a kimng if anything goes wrong so this cant be his ghost then whose ghost is it the doxy demanded no ghost at all the king said theres no one there he picked up the sword just this sword i took from the xanth prince i thought it was magic but it isnt i tried it out and theres nothing remarkable about it except a fine edge thafs not true the sword cried unhand me varlet unnerved at last the king hurled it out the embrasure the thing talks he cried well thats one way to recover my weapon dor murmured try for my bag of seeds irene suggested i can do a lot with genuine magic plants grundy had located the seeds carelessly thrown in a corner no doubt oary had been disappointed when he discovered the bag did not contain treasure though he should have been satisfied with the gold and diamonds dor had carried greed knew no restraint you cant get rid of me that way the seedbag said as dor mentally prompted it my ghost will haunt you forever i tell you i didnt kill you oary said looking for the new voice that sounded seedy youre just making that up well i might as well be dead the seedbag said locked up here aloneits awful what do you mean alone oary demanded the xanth king is in the next cell and the sharptongued xanth queen in the third they wanted to know what had happened to you and wouldnt deal with me so now they know irenes free hand clutched doris shoulder confirmation she whispered thrilled dor was equally gratified the talking objects had hardly terrorized oary but they had evoked his confession nevertheless dor continued to concentrate but youre way out in nowhere he thought to the bag but were way out in nowhere the bag dutifully repeated dor was getting better at this as he went he had never before used his talent in quite this way it was a new aspect nowhere the king pounced on the bag and shook it youre in the ocna dungeon the second biggest castle of the kingdoml plenty of company there id be proud to be in that dungeon myself i out you ungrateful bag and he hurled it out the embrasure what flie doxy demanded she had evidently heard only the last few words out you ungrateful bag the table repeated helpfully mats what he said well i neverl the doxy said flushing wrathfully dont tell me you neverill the feather quilt she had retained said i was right here when you the doxy slapped the quilt silencing it then wrapped it about her and stalked out helpil the quilt cried im being iddnapped by a monster then it was beyond the magic aisle and said no more guardsl the king bellowed search the prensesl report anything remarkable there was a scream from the hall and the sound of someone being slapped he said premises not mistressest the doxys voice cried there was a guttural laugh but we do have someffng remarkable to report hes seen it before she retorted her footfalls moved on away guards charged into the room quickly they ascertained that no one except the king was in the tower then they spied the tip of the vine that had grown into the embrasure they investigated itwhile dor and irene scrambled down the wall grundy leaped from above them dropping to the centaurs back take off he cried amolde in turn launched himself from the platform landing with heavy impact on the dark ground and galloping off the platform was shoved violently by the back thrust of his hooves so that the vines holding it in place were wrenched from the wall suddenly irene was failing her support gone while dor dangled tenuously from his vine his grip slipping but smash the ogre was there below he snatched irene out of the air and whirled her around absorbing the shock of her fall her skirt flew out and upand now at last dor saw her panties they were green then smash deposited her gently on the ground while dor slid down as quickly as he could weak with relief im glad you were there dor gasped me glad centaur was still near smash said he out of range now which meant that the ogres magic strength was gone again irene had fallen in those few seconds that the rear extension of the aisle remained now smashs nonrhyming showed that the mundane environment had closed in someones out there king oary cried from the embrasure after him but the guards had no good light for the purpose and seemed loath to pursue a magic enemy in the moonlight you sword smash said pressing it into doris hand you seeds he said to irene giving her the bag he had rescued thanks oodles smash she said now lets get away from here but as they moved out a small gate opened in the castle wan and troops poured forth bearing torches oary must have caught on that it was our magic dor said as they scrambled away soon they caught up to the centaur who had stopped as soon as he realized what was happening dor felt no different as they reentered the magic aisle but smashs panting alleviated his strength had returned quickly dor summarized their situation were together we have our magic things except for amoldes spells and we know king trent queen iris and king omen are alive in castle ocna oarys troops are on our trail we had better hurry on to rescue the three before the troops catch us but we dont know the way every plant and rock must know the way to ocna grundy said we can ask as we go along the guards were spreading out and combing through the forest whatever virtues king oary lacked he evidently compelled obedience when he really wanted it doris party had to retreat before them but there were two problems this section of forest was small so that they could not remain concealed long and they were being herded the wrong way for it turned out that ocna was half a days walk northwest of onesti while this forest was southeast they were actually moving toward the village settlement where the peasants who served the castle dwelt that village would in the course of centuries expand into the town of onesti whose designation on the map had given them the hint where to find king trent they didnt want to interfere with that weve got to get on a path irene said wen never make it to ocna tonight traveling crosscountry but the soldiers will be patrolling the paths maybe theres a magic seed for this grundy suggested udaybe irene agreed another tangler would doexcept i dont have one i do have a cherry seed the kind that grows cherry bombs that would do it no amolde said whats the matter horsetail the golem demanded nastily youd rather get your rump riddled with arrows than throw a few cherries at the enemy setting aside the ethical and aesthetic considerationswhich process i find objectionablethere remain practical ones the centaur said first we dont want a pitched battle we do want to elude these people if possible leaving them here in a fruitless search while we proceed unchallenged to ocna if we fight them we shall be tied down indefinitely until their superior numbers overwhelm us there is that dor agreed centaurs did have fine minds second we must keep moving if we are to reach ocna before dawn a halfdays march for seasoned travelers by day familiar with the route will be twice that for us at night a cherry tree cant travel it must be rooted in soil and since it is magic wed have to stay with it irene finished itd die the moment we left anything magic will be no good away from the magic aisle however the centaur said after a moment it might be possible to grow a plant that would distract them even if it were dead especially if it were dead cherry bombs wont work grundy said they dont exist in mundania they wouldnt explode outside the aisle oh i dont know irene said defensively once they are mature and ready to detonate it seems to me they should be able to explode anywhere id be willing to try them certainly possibly so the centaur said however i was thinking of resurrection fem whose impact would extend beyond the demise of the plant itself i do have some irene said but i dont see how it can stop soldiers primitives tend to be superstitious the centaur explained especially i understand mundanes who profess not to believe in ghosts thats ridiculous dor protested only a fool would not believe in ghosts some of my best friends are im not certain all mundanes are fools amolde said in his cautious way but these particular ones may be so if they encountered resurrection fem it could be quite something for people who didnt know about it irene agreed and surely these mundanes dont amolde said i admit it is a bit of a dastardly deed but our situation is desperate dastardly deed dor said are you sure that counterspell we used with the salve worked the centaur smiled certainly im sure we do not have to do such a deed but we certainly can if we choose to irene dug out the seed i can grow it but youll have to coordinate it the wrong suggestion can ruin it these primitives are bound to have suffered lost relatives the centaur said ibey will have repressed urgings all we shall have to do is establish pseudoidentities i never talked with resurrection fem grundy complained whats so special about it vihats this business about lost relatives lets find a place on a road amolde said we want to intercept the mundanes but have easy travel to ocna they will pursue us when they penetrate the deception right irene agreed ill need time to get the fem established so it can include all of us include us all in what the golem demanded resurrection fem has the peculiar property of the centaur began near herel smash called pointing oges had excellent night vision sure enough they had found a path a mt worn by the tread of peasants feet and horses hooves do you go to ocna dor asked the path no i merely show the way it answered which way is it that way the section of path to their west said but yoxfu have trouble traveling there tonight itimy because there is something wrong with me i feel numb everm where but here maybe theres been a bad storm that washed me out could the path be aware of itself beyond the region of magic irene asked dor im not sure i dont think sobut then it does know it goes to ocna so maybe it does have some awareness im not used to dealing with things that straddle magic and nonmagic i dont know all the rules i believe it is reasonably safe to assume the path is animate only within the aisle amolde said in any event this is probably as good a place for our purpose as any the soldiers are surely using this path and will circle around here it is better to meet them in a manner of our choosing than to risk an accidental encounter let us begin our preparations right irene said now the fem will grow in the dark but needs eght to activate its magic the soldiers will have torches so it should be all right i have the sunstone dor reminded her that can trigger the fem if necessary or we could clear out some trees to let the moonlight in good enough she agreed she planted several seeds grow but what does it do grundy asked plaintively well it relates to the psychology of the ignorant spectator arnolde explained anyone who comprehends its properties soon penetrates the illusion that is why i feel it will be more effective against mundanes than against citizens of xanth thus we should be able to deceive them and nullify the pursuit without violence a distinct advantage ah we have to do is respond appropriately to their overtures keeping our own expectations out of it what expectations the golem demanded frustrated dor took a hand you see resurrection fem makes figures seem like refrainl smash whispered thunderingly mundanel ogres hearing was also excellent they waited by the growing fem in a moment three onesti soldiers came into view their torches flashing between the trees casting monstrous shadows they were peering to either side alert for their quarry then the three spied the five the soldiers halted staring just within the magic aisle grandfather one exclaimed aghast stanng at smash the ogre knew what to do he roared and made a threatening ges ture with one hamfist the soldier dropped his torch and lied in terror one of the remaining soldiers was looking at irene you livel he gasped the fever spared you after all irene shook her head sadly no friend i died but i see you the man cried in an agony of doubtful hope hear you now we can marry i am dead love she said with mournful fimmess i return only to warn you not to support the usurper but you never cared for politics the soldier said bewildered you did not even like my profession i still dont irene said but at least you worked for good king omen death has given me pause for thought now you work for his betrayer i will never respect you even from the grave if you work for the bad king who seeks to send good king omen to his grave ill renounce king oary the soldier cried eagerly i dont like him anyway i thought good omen dead he lives irene said he is in the dungeon at castle ocna ill tell everyone only return to me i cannot return love she said i am resurrected only for this moment only to tell you why i cannot rest in peace i am dead king omen lives go help the living she moved back to hide behind the centaur disappearing from the soldiers view beautiful amolde whispered i feel unclean she muttered the third man focused on grundy my baby sonreturned from the khazars he exclaimed i knew they could not hold you long the golem had finally caught on to the nature of resurrection fem it resurrected the memories of important figures in the viewers lives only my spirit escaped he said i had to warn you the khazars are coming they will besiege onesti slay the men rape the women and carry the children away into bondage as they did me warn the kingl fetch all troops into the castle barricade the access roadsl dont let more families be ravaged dont let my sacrifice be in vainl fight to the last dor nudged the golem with his foot dont overdo it he murmured mundanes are ignorant they arent necessarily stupid lets move out irene whispered this should hold them for a while they moved out cautiously the two soldiers remained by the fem absorbed by their thoughts before rounding a curve in me path dor glanced backand saw a giant pretty spider of the kind that ranged about rather than forming a web the decorations on its body resembled a greenish face and it had eight eyes of different sizes jumperl he exclaimedthen stifled himself jumper had died of old age years ago he had been doris closest friend when the two had seemed to be the same size within the historical tapestry of castle roogna but their worlds were different the spiders descendants remained by the tapestry and dor could talk to them if he arranged for translation but it wasnt the same they seemed like interlopers taking the place of his marvelous friend now he saw jumper himself but of course it was only a resurrection not the real friend as dor reminded himself of that the image reduced to the standing soldier how dor wished it could have been genuine this new separation albeit from a phantom was painfully poignant so the fern resurrects precious memories grundy said as they got clear the person looking sees what is deepestetched in his perience he really should know better oh what do you know about it irene said irritably its an awful thing to do to a person even a mundane you looked back too dor asked i saw my father i krow he isnt dead but i saw him she sounded choked mthat a torment it would have been if that were all i would ever see of him well soon fmd him dor said encouragingly this too he found he liked about herher human feeling and loyalty to her fatheir who had always been a large figure in doris own life she flashed him a grateful smile in the moonlight dor understood her mood his vision of his longgone friend had wrenched his emotion how much worse had it been for the mundanes who lacked knowledge of the mechanism it was indeed a dastardly thing they had done perhaps the violence of ogre and sword would have been gentler soon however they heard the commotion of pursuit the resurrection fem had perished or at least had become inactive after the magic aisle left it there would be no more visions there the stories of the three affected soldiers would spread alarm but there would also be many who still followed their orders to capture doris party they stepped from the path hiding in the brushand the troops rushed on past a snatch of their dialogue rung out khazars coming it seemed the golems information had been taken to heartl i think theyve forgotten us irene said as they stepped back on the path the resurrections gave them other things to think about now they arent even looking for us so maybe we can travel to ocna safely it was a good move we made strategically dor said a dirty one perhaps and i wouldnt want to do it again but effective first we must pass castle onesti amolde reminded them they got past onesti by following the directions the path gave there was a detour around that castle for peasants had fields to attend to wood to fetch and hunting to do well beyond the castle and the immediate environs were forbidding this path angled down below the clifflike western face of the peak the castle stood on wending its way curvaceously through pastures and forest and slope several parties of soldiers passed them but were easily avoided it seemed these people took the khazars seriously beyond the castle the way grew more difficult this was truly mountainous country and there was a high pass between the two redoubts dor and the ethers were not yet fully rested from their arduous climb to onesti of a day or so ago now the stiffness of muscles was aggravated but the path assured them there was no better route perhaps that was its conceitbut they had no ready altemative so they hauled themselves up and up untu near midnight they came to the highest pass it was a narrow gap between jags it was guarded by a select detachment of soldiers they could not conveniently circle around it and knew the soldiers would not let them through unchallenged what now irene asked too tired even to be properly irritable maybe i can distract them dor said if i succeed the rest of you hurry through the pass they worked their way as close to the pass as they could without being discovered amolde oriented himself so that the magic aisle was where they needed it then dor concentrated causing the objects to break into speech ready khazars an outcroppin of rock cried readyl came a chorused response from several loose rocks sneak up close before firing your arrows the outcropping directed we want to get them all on the first volley save some for our boulder the upper face of the cleft called we have a perfect drop here the onesti soldiers at first uneasy abruptly vacated the cleft glancing nervously up at the crags it seemed impossible for anyone to have a boulder up there but the voice had certainly been convinging they charged the rocks swords drawn move out dor cried amolde and grandy charged for the pass smash and irene hesitated go on dor snapped get through before the magic ends but what about you irene asked dor concentrated retreat men the outcropping cried theyre on to us there was the sound of scrambling from the rocks im not going without you irene said ive got to keep them distracted until the rest of you safely clear the pass dor cried exasperated you cant keep on after then the voices stopped the magic aisle had passed after amolde gets out of range she finished lamely the soldiers baffled by the disappearance of the enemy were turning about in a moment they would spy the two the moonlight rereamed too bright for effective concealment in the open i grew a pineapple while we waited irene said i hate to use it on people even mundanes but theyll kill us if how can a magic pineapple operate outside the aisle he demanded knowing this argument was foolish but afraid if they moved that the soldiers would spy them she looked chagrined for once youre right if cherry bombs are uncertain so is this smash was standing in the cleft run he cried but the soldiers were closing in dor knew they couldnt make it through in time he drew his sword without its magic it felt heavy and clumsy but it was the best weapon he had he would be overwhelmed of course but he would die fighting it wasnt the end he would have chosen had he a reasonable choice but it was better than nothing run to smash he said ill block them off you come too she insisted i love you now she tells me he muttered watching the soldiers close in irene threw the pineapple at them maybe ifn scare them she said it cant they dont know what the pineapple exploded sending yellow juice everywhere it detonatedl dor exclaimed amazed come onl amolde called appearing behind the ogre suddenly it made sense the centaur had turned about and come back when they hadnt followed that had returned the magic to the vicinity just in time they ran to the cleft the mundanes were pawing at their eyes blinded by pineapple juice there was no trouble you were so busy trying to be heroes you forgot common sense amolde reproved them all you needed to do was follow me while the mundanes backs were turned they would never have known of our passage i never was strong on common sense dor admitted thats for sure irene agreed ibat juice wont hold them forever well have to move far and fast they did just that their fatigue dissipated by the excitement now the path led downhill facilitating progress somewhat but it was treacherous in the darkness at this speed for the mountain crags and trees shadowed it and it curved and dropped without fair warning soon the soldiers were in pursuit but dor used his talent making the path call out warnings of hazards so that they could proceed more rapidly than other strangers might his midnight sunstone helped too casting just enough light to make pitfalls almost visible but he knew they couldnt remain on the path long because the soldiers were more familiar with it and had their torches and would surely catch up they would have to pun off and hideand that might not be enough this time there was too little room for concealment and the soldiers would be too wary then disaster loomed ihe bridge is outl the path warned what bridge dor panted the wooden bridge across the cut dummyl what happened to it the onesti soldiers destroyed it when they heard the khazars were coming so doris party had brought this mischief on itselfl can we cross the cut some other way see for yourself here it is they halted hastily there shrouded by darkness and fog was a gap in the mountaina fissure four times the fum reach of a man ex tending from the clifflike face of the peak above down to the deep valley below shrouded in nocturnal fog here the moonlight blazed down as if eager to show the full extent of the hazard a young vigorous centaur could hurdle that amolde said it is out of the question for me if we had the rope irene said but of course chet had that wherever he was now ascent of the peak seemed virtually impossible and there was no telling what lay beneath the fog the bridge had been the only practi cal crossingand only fragments of that remained this had become a formidable natural barriersurely one reason the khazars had been unable to conquer this tiny kingdom any bridge the enemy built could readily be hacked out or fired but now the torches of the garrison of the upper pass were ap proaching that was the other pincer of this trap a few men could guard that pass preventing retreat the slope was steep here offering little haven above or below the path if the soldiers didnt get them nature would the salve irene said see the fogweve got to use the salve but the curseweve lost the counterspell dor protested well have to do some dastardly deed those soldiers will do some dastardly deed to us if we dont get away from here fast she pointed out dor looked at her standing in the moonlight wearing his jacket her fineformed legs braced against the mountain he thought of the soldiers doing a dastardly deed to her as they had started to do in the dungeon well use the salve he decided iley scrambled down the steep slope to reach the level of the mist they had to cling to trees and saplings lest they slide into the cleft involuntarily dor felt in his pocket for the jarand found the dime he had ob tained from ichabod in modern mundania he had forgotten that it must have slipped into another crevice if his pocket and been over looked it was of course of no use now he fumbled farther and found the jar quickly they applied the salve to their feet the supply was getting low this was just about the last time they would be able to use it then they stepped cautiously out onto the fog stay close to amolde dor warned and in line anyone who goes outside the magic aisle will fall through now the soldiers reached the cut they were furious when they discovered no victims there but almost immediately they spied the fugitives cnvm adknvl one cried sgdxqd rim sgd bknto then he did a double take for a moment the soldiers stared sgdx cant do that one protested as the rear of the magic aisle swung around to intersect him but their leader found the answer theyre sorcerersl spies sent by the khazars shoot them downl numbly responsiveto orders the soldiers nocked arrows to their bowstrings run dor cried but stay with amolde this time ill bring up the rear just to be sure the centaur said lead the way the rest of you it made sense the main part of the magic aisle was ahead of the centaur and this way amolde could angle his body to keep them all within it dor and irene and smash charged forward as the first volley of arrows came at them grundy rode the centaur it was the best way to keep him out from underfoot they crossed the fogfilled cut coming to the dense forest at the far side aaahh amolde screamed dor paused to look back an arrow had struck the centaur in the ramp amolde was crippled trying to move forward on three legs smash was leading the way he reached out to grab the branch of a tree that projected through the fog he ripped that branch out of its trunk and hurled it uphill and across the cut toward the soldiers his aim was good the soldiers screamed and flung themselves rat as the heavy branch landed on them and one almost fell into the chasm then smash charged back across the cloud he ducked down grabbed the centaur by one foreleg and one hindleg and hefted him to shoulder height oh i say amolde exclaimed amazed despite his pain but within the ambience of magic there was no strength to match that of the ogre smash carried amolde to the slope and set him down carefully where the ground rose out of the fog this place was sheltered from the view of the soldiers there would be no more shooting but the arrow the centaur said bravely we must get it out smash grabbed the protruding shaft and yanked amolde screamed againbut suddenly the arrow was out it had not been deeply embedded or the head would have broken off yes that was the appropriate way to do it the centaur saidand fainted irene was already sprouting a seed they had lost their healing elixir with amoldes bag of spells but some plants had curative properties she grew a balm plant and used its substance on the wound this wont cure it all the way she said but it win deaden the pain and start the hearing process he should be able to walk smash paced nervously yetchet he said mundane the pain dor caught on to the ogres concern we dont know that a mundane wound will always become infected the way chets did that was probably chets bad luck also he was bitten by a wyvem so there might have been poison while amolde was struck by an arrow this is a different situationi think still the coincidence of a second centaur getting wounded bothered dor could it be part of the salves curse the centaurs had had to use twice as much salve since they had four feet and perhaps that made them more susceptible to the curse amolde soon woke and agreed that the agony of the wound was much abated that was a relief for at least two reasons ne ertheless dor decided to camp there for the remainder of the night their chance of approaching castle ocna secretly was gone anyway and the recovery of their friend was more important after all the centaurs aisle of magic was essential to their welfare in mundania in midday weary but hopeful they reached castle ocna this was less imposing than castle onesti but still formidable the outer wall was far too high for them to scale me bash to trash smash offered confidently no dor said that would alert the whole castle and bring a hundred arrows down on us he glanced at amolde who seemed to be doing all right no infection was in evidence but they wanted no more arrows well wait until night and operate quietly theyll be expecting our attack but wont know exactly what form it will take if we can bring the magic aisle to cover king trent hell be able to take it from there but we dont know where in the castle he is irene protested anxiously thats my job grandy said ill sneak in and scout about and let you know by nightfall then well wrap this up without trouble it seemed like a good idea the others settled themselves for a meal and a rest while the golem insinuated his way into the castle amolde perhaps more greatly weakened by his injury than he showed slept smash always conked out when he had nothing physical to do dor and rene were awake and alone again it occurred to dor that bringing the magic aisle to bear on ying trent might not necessarily solve the problem king trent could change the jailor to a slugbut the cell would stul be locked queen iris might make a griffin seem to appearbut that would not unlock the cells more thinking needed to be done they lay on the slope in the concealment of one of the huge ancestral oaks and the world was deceptively peaceful do you really think it will work irene asked worriedly the closer i get the more i fear something dreadful win happen dor decided he couldnt afford to agree with her we have fought our way here he said it cant go for nothing we have had no omens of success she paused or have we omenking omencan he have anything to do with it anything is possible with magic and we have brought magic to this kingdom she shook her head i swing back and forth full of hope and doubt you just keep going on never suffering the pangs of uncertainty and you do generally get there well make a good match no uncertainty he was made of uncertainty but again he didnt want to undermine what ettle confidence irene was grasping for we have to succeed otherwise i would be king you wouldnt want that she rolled over fetching up next to him shedding leaves and grass she grabbed him by the ears and kissed him id settle for that dor he looked at her startled she was disheveled and lovely she had always been the aggressor in their relationship first in quarreling more recently in romance did he really want it that way he grabbed her and pulled her back down to him kissing her sayagely at first she was rigid with surprise then she melted she returned his kiss and his embrace becoming something very special and exciting it would have been easy to go on from there but a note of caution sounded in doris mind in the course of assorted adventures he had come to appreciate the value of timing and this was not the proper time for what offered first we rescue your father he murmured in her ear that brought her up short yes of course so nice of you to remind me dor suspected he had misplayed it but as usual all he could do was bull on now we can sleep so as to be ready for tonight whatever you say she agreed but she did not release him dear dor considered and realized he was comfortable as he was a strand of irenes greentinted hair fell across his face smelling pleasantly of girl her breathing was soft against him he felt that he could not ask for a better mode of relaxation but she was waiting for something finally he decided what it was dear he said she nodded and closed her eyes yes he was learningl he lay stul and soon he slept now arent we cozy grundy remarked dor and irene woke with a joint start we were just sleeping together she said and you admit it the golem exclaimed well we are engaged you know we can do what we like together dor realized that she was teasing the golem so he stayed out of it what did it matter what other people thought what passed between himself and the girl he loved was their own business ill have to tell your father grundy said nettled suddenly dor had pause to reconsider this was the daughter of the king ill tell him myself you wad of string and clay irene snapped did you find him maybe i shouldnt tell a bad girl like you maybe i should grow a large flytrap plant and feed you to it irene replied that fazed the golem i found them all in three cells the way the three of you were one in each cell queen iris king trent and king omen irene sat up abruptly disengaging from dor are they all right grundy frowned ibe men are they have been through privation before the queen is not pleased with her situation she wouldnt be irene agreed but are they all right physically they havent been starved or anything well they were a bit closemouthed about that the golem said but the queen seems to have lost weight she was getting fat anm way so thats all right but i guess she hasnt been fed much and i saw a crust of bread she left it was moldy the flies are pretty thick in there too must be a lot of maggots around irene got angry they have no right to treat royalty like that something else i picked up grundy said the guard who feeds themit seems he eats what he wants first and gives them the leavings sometimes he spits on it or rubs dirt in it just to aggravate them they have to cat the stuff anyway or stuve once he even urinated in their g water right where they could see him to be sure they knew what they were drinidng he doesnt speak he just shows his contempt by his actions i have heard of this technique amolde said it is the process of degradation if you can destroy a persons pride you can do with him what you will pride is the backbone of the spirit probably king oary is trying to get king omen to sip a document of abdication just in case there is ever any challenge to king oarys legitimacy why is he keeping the others alive then dor asked appalled by both the method and the rationale mundanes played politics in an ugly fashion well we have seen how he operates if he lets the three spend time together and become friends then he can use the others as leverage against king omen remember how you told me he was going to torture irene to make you talk hes going to torture my parents irene demanded aghast i dislike formulating this notion but it is a prospect irene was silent smoldering dor decided regretfully to tackle the problem of freeing the prisoners i hoped king trent could use his power to break out but im not sure how transformation of people can unlock doors if we can figure out a way elementary amolde said the king can transform the queen to a mouse she runs out through a crevice then he transforms her back and she opens the cells from the outside if there are guards he can transform her to a deadly monster to dispatch them so simple why hadnt he dor thought of that irene shifted gears in the manner of her sex becoming instantly practical who is in the cell closest to the wall the queen the golem frowned you know i think shes the only one the magic aisle can reach the watts pretty thick in that region so my father probably cant transform anyone irene said trouble dor considered trying to come up with an alternate suggestion the queen does have powerful magic it should be possible for her to free them by means of illusion she can make them see the cells as empty or containing dead prisoners so that the guards open the gates then she can generate a monster to scare them away there are problems amolde said the aisle as you know is narrow the illusion will not operate outside it since two cells are beyond the queens illusion will have very limited play dor concluded we had better warn her about that she should be able to manage if she has time to prepare im on my way grundy said i dont know how this expedition would function without me there isnt one of us we can do without dor said weve already seen that when we get separated were all in trouble as the night closed they moved to the castle trying to reach the spot nearest the queens cell as described by the golem again there was no moat just a glacis so that they had to mount a kind of stone hill leading up to the wall dor could appreciate how thick that wall might be set on a base this massive castle ocna was alert fearing the invasion of the khazars torches flickered in the turrets and along the walls but doris party was not using the established paths and remained unobserved people who lived in castles tended to be insulated from events outside and to forget the potential importance of the exterior environment it occurred to dor that this also applied to the whole land of xanth few of its inhabitants knew anything about mundania or cared to learn trade between the realms hitherto a matter of erratic chance should be established if only to facilitate a more cosmopolitan awareness king oary was evidently not much interested in trade to the detriment of his kingdom he regarded the xanth visitors as a threat to his throne as indeed they weresince he was a usurper now we cant plan exactly how this will work dor said in a final review i hope the queen will be able to make an illusion that will cause the guards to release her and then she can free the others shed love to vamp a guard irene said shell make herself look like the winsomest wench in all mundania then when he comes close shell turn into a dragon and scare him to death serve lift right dor chuckled i think i know how that works she whirled on him in mock fary you havent begun to see how it works but she couldnt hold her frown she kissed him instead the lady appears to have given fair wanting amolde remarked you wont see the dragon until you are securely married he knows that irene said smugly but men never learn each one thinks hes different amolde set himself against the watt changing his orientation by small degrees so that the aisle swung through the castle grundy will have to report whether we intercept the queen he said i cannot perceive the use of the aisle if anything goes wrong irene said smash wm have to go into action and ill grow some plant to mess them up they waited the centaur completed a sweep through the castle without event he swept back still accomplishing nothing i begin to fear we are after all beyond range he said smash put one cauliflower ear to the watt gy down for crown of course dor agreed they are in the dungeon below ground level aim down with difficulty amolde bent his forelegs leaving his hindlegs extended tilting his body down he commenced another sweep this was quite awkward for him because of the position and his injury smash joined him efting him up and setting him down at a new angle making the sweep easier but if they are too far inside for the aisle to reach irene murmured tensely grundy will let us know dor said trying to prevent her from becoming hysterically nervous he knew this was the most trying time for herthis period when they would either make contact or fail we may catch queen iris then sweep on past and it will take a wldle for the golem to relay the news that could be it she agreed moving into the circle of his arm he turned to kiss her and found her lips eager to meet his own once she had declared her love she made absolutely no secret of it dor realized that even if their mission failed even if they perished here in mundania it was privately worth it for him in this sense he had discovered love and it was a universe whose reaches pitfalls and potential rewards were more vast than all of mundania he held the kiss for a long time is this how you behave when unchaperoned a womans voice demanded sharply dor and irene broke with a start there beside them stood the queen mother irene cried half in relief half in chagrin shamefully embracing in public queen iris continued frowning she had always been the guardian of other peoples morals this must come to the attention of the queen vanished amolde timing as well as he could to face her image had thereby shifted the magic aisle away from iris cell so that the queens magic was interrupted she could no longer project her illusionimage beg pardon the centaur said he shifted back queen iris reappeared before she could speak again irene did so thats nothing mother this afternoon dor and i slept together you disreputable girl iris exclaimed aghast dor bit his tongue he had never really liked queen his and could hardly have thought of a better way to prick her bubble the centaur tried to reassure her your majesty we all slept it you too iris demanded her gaze surveying them with an amazing chill and the ogre were a very close group irene said i love them all this was going too far you misunderstand dor said we only irene tromped his toe cutting him off she wanted to continue baiting her mother but queen iris no fool had caught on they only saw up your skirt of course how many times have i cautioned you about that you have absolutely no sense of we bring the king smash inquired ibe king iris exclaimed by all means you must march in and free us all but the noise dor protested if we alert the soldiers you forget my power queen iris informed him i can give your party the illusion of absence no one will hear you or see you no matter what you do such a simple solution the queens illusion would be more than enough to free them all break in the wall smash dor caged we can rescue king trent ourselves with a grunt of glee the ogre advanced on the wall then he disappeared so did the centaur dor found himself embracing nothing he could neither see nor feel irene and heard nothing eitherbut there was resistance where he knew her to be experimentally he shoved something shoved him back it was like the force of inertia when he swung around a corner at a run a force with no seeming origin irene was there all right this spell differed from the one the centaur had used it made the people within it undetectable to each other as well as to outsiders he hoped that didnt lead to trouble a gap appeared in the wall chunks of stone fell out silently the ogre was at work dor kept his arm around the nothingness beside him and it moved with him curious about the extent of the illusion he moved his hand portions of the nothingness were more resilient than others then he found himself stumbling a less resilient portion had given him another shove then something helped steady him the nothingness was evidently sorry he wrapped his arms about it and drew it in close for a kiss but it didnt feel right he concluded he was kissing the back of her head he grabbed a hank of nothingness and gave it a friendly tug then irene appeared laughing oh am i going to get even for thatl then she realized she could perceive him in the moonlight she wrapped the jacket about her torsoit had fallen open during their invisible encounterand drew him forward were getting left b she vanished and silenced they had reentered the aisle dor kept hold of her nothinghand and followed the other nothings into the hole in the wall for a moment they all became visible amolde was ahead negotiating a pile of rubble smash had broken through to the lower level but the path he made was hardly smooth ihe centaur realizing thai the aisle had shifted away from the queen hastily corrected his orientation they all vanished again castle personnel appeared gaping at the rubble unable to fathom its cause one stepped into the passageand vanished that created another stir as yet the mundanes did not seem to associate this oddity with an invasion the ogres tunnel progressed apace soon enough it broke into the queens cell then into king trents and finally king omens at that point the parties became visible again there was ambient light courtesy of the queens illusion dor was uncertain at what point illusion became reality since light was light however it was generated but he had learned not to worry unduly about such distinctions irene lurched forward and flung herself into king trents arms oh daddyl she cried with tears of joy now dor experienced what he knew to be his most unreasonable surge of jealousy yet after all why should she not love her father he glanced aboutand saw queen iris watching her husband and daughter with what appeared to be identical emotion she too was jealousand unable to express it for the first time in his iffe dor felt coluplete sympathy with the queen this was one shame he shared with her the ying set irene down and looked about suddenly it was incumbent on dor to make introductions and explanations he hurried up uh weve come to rescue you king trent this is amolde the centaurhes the one who made the magic aislethats his talentand this is smash the ogre and irenej king trent looked regal even in rags i believe i know that last he said gravely uh yes dor agreed flustered knowing he was really fouling it up i uh do you know what he did father irene asked king trent indicating dor i did not dor exclaimed teasing the queen was one thing teasing the king was another anyway dor and i are irenes voice broke off as she spied the third prisoner he was a stunningly handsome young man who radiated charisma though he too was dressed in rags king omen king trent said with his customary gravity my daughter irene for the first time dor saw irene girlishly flustered king omen strode forward picked up her limp hand and brought it to his eps ravishing he murmured irene tittered dor felt a new surge of jealousy viously the girl so ardent toward dor a moment ago was now smitten by the handsome mundane king she was after all fifteen years old constancy was not her nature yet it hurt to be so suddenly forgotten dor turned his eyes awayand met the gaze of the queen again there was a flash of understanding now we have business to accomplish king trent said my friend king omen must be restored to his throne to make that secure we must separate the loyal citizens of onesti from the disloyal dor forced his mind to focus on this problem how can anyone in this castle be loyal they kept their king prisoner in the dungeon by no means king omen said resonantly few were aware of my presence we were brought in manacled and hooded and the only one who sees us is a mute eunuch who is absolutely loyal to oary the usurper no doubt the castle personnel were told we were khazar prisoners of war so only the mute knew your identity dor asked remembering gmndys description of the mans aedvities but the golem sometimes exaggerated for effect at least he brought you food foodl the queen cried that slopi irene grow us a pie treel we havent had a decent meal since this happened irene wrenched her eyes off king omen long enough to dig out and sprout a seed quickly the plant grew leafing out in the illusion of daylight and developing big circular buds that burst into assorted fiuit pies king omen was amazed its magiel he exclaimed what an abilityl irene flushed pleased its my talent everyone in xanth does magic but i understood no magic would work here in the real world how is it possible now evidently doris introduction of amolde had not been sufficient for one who was completely unused to magic thats the centaurs talent he explained hes a full magician he brings magic with him in an aisle in that aisle everyones talent works thats why we were able to come here king omen faced king trent as they bit into their pies i apologize sir for my nagging doubt about your abilities i have never believed in magic despite the considerable lore of our superstitious peasants now i have seen the proof your lovely wife and lovely daughter have marvelous talents irene flushed again inordinately thrilled king omen is really a fine young man queen iris remarked to no one m general dor felt cold the queens favor was not lightly gained she had extremely strict and selfish notions of propriety and these were focused largely on her daughter queen iris had evidently concluded that king omen was a suitable match for irene of course the final opinion was king trents if he decided on king omen dor was lost but king trent had always supported dor before suddenly a huge fat man burst upon them ies eyes rounded with amazement as he spied the visitors in the dungeon and the pie tree then he drew his sword he charged upon king omen irene screamed as the man passed near her father then the mundane turned into a purple toad his sword clattering to the floor king trent had transformed him who was that dor asked his startlement subsiding raggedly the mute eunuch gaard king omen said picldng up the fallen sword we bear him no love he considered the toad speculatively it was covered with green warts yes your magic is impressivel wir he remain that way until i transform him again king trent said or until he leaves the region of magic then i believe he will slowly revert to his normal state but that process may take months and be uncomfortable and awkward if someone does not take him for a monster and kill him before it is complete a fitting punishment king omen said izt him begin it he urged the toad on out of the magic aisle by pricking it with the point of the sword now lets consider prospects king trent said we have achieved a significant breakthrough here regaining our magic but very soon the usurpers picked private troops comprised largely of avar mercenaries will lay siege to us here and we have no magic that wt stop a flight of arrows we are certain that the general populace will rally gladly to king omen once they realize he is alive but most of the people are outside the cas its and we are in danger of being wiped out before that realization prevails we must plan our strategy carefully i must advise you that the magic associated with me is in a fairly narrow aisle amolde said it extends perhaps fifteen paces forward and half that distance back but only two to either side therefore the queens illusion will be fli ted to that ambience and any person outside it will be immune but a lot can be done within the aisle dor said when irene and i lagged outside the aisle we reappearedbut the rest of you remained invisible to us we werent immune to the illusion just outside it so the queen can keep us all from the perception of the mundanes ibats a considerable asset true the centaur agreed but now that they know about our magic we cannot prevent them from wg their arrows into this region in a saturation pattern that is bound to wipe us out i have already had experience with this tactic he rubbed his rank ruefully the healing had continued nicely but he still walked slightly stiffly we must take cover of course king trent agreed ibere is now plenty of rubble to shield us from arrows but we cannot afford to remain confined here the problem will be the elimination of the enemy forces maybe we can lure them in here and ambush them king omen suggested we now have two swords and i am impressed with the ogres strength no good grundy said he had reappeared during their feast on the pies and now took a small pie for himself the avar commander is a tough experienced son of a blizzard who knows you have magic he is heating a cauldron of oil soon hell pour it down the dungeon steps anyone hiding here with or without magic win be fried in oil impossible to fill this chamber with oil queen iris said it would all leak out but it will cover the whole floor first grundy said youll all get hotfeet dor looked down at his sandals nervously he did not like the notion of splashing through a puddle of boiling oil trent considered and an ambush waits outside the dungeon sure thing grundy agreed you dont think they let you sit here and gorge on pies just because they like you do you turnus all into birds father irene suggested well fly out before they know it two problems daughter king trent said you will have trouble when you fly outside the magic aisle im not sure how you will function but probably poorly as you wont be able to change back yet the magic will be gone also i cannot transform myself ohi forgot she was chagrined since the rescue of her father had been her whole purpose we have to get you safely out of here sir dor said the land of xanth needs you i have every present intention of returning king trent said with a smile i am now merely pondering mechanisms i can deal with the avars readily enough provided i can get close enough to them with my magic power intact that means i shag have to remain with magician amolde and with me queen iris said to keep you invisible and the ogre to open doors and me irene said loyally you i want safely out of the way her father said there was a bubbling noise the oill grundy cried weve got to move smash went into action he started bashing out a new channel they became invisible but dor had a mental picture of where each person was icing trent amolde and the queen were near the ogre ready to follow in his new tunnel and avoid the spilling on but irene and the golem were on the far side of the chamber ihe oil was already flowing between them and the ogre they would be trappedand as the centaur moved away they would become visible and vulnerable even if they avoided oil dor ran across to pick up a fragment of rubble he tossed it into the flowing oil he grabbed more chunks and tossed them forming a dam but it wasnt enough he wasnt sure irene could make it through then the pieces started flying into place at double the rate he was throwing them someone else was helping dor could not tell who or communicate directly he simply continued tossing stones damming off the hot oil soon it formed a reluctant pool dor filled in the crevices of the dam with sand and the way was clear ihe ofl ploy had been abated and irene could cross to safety now a troop of guards charged down the steps swords drawn they wore heavy boots evidently to protect them from the oil they thought would be distracting their quarry it should have been a neat double trap they didnt know the quarry had departed still the avars could use their bows to fire arrows up the new tunnel doing much harm dor leaped across to guard the tunnel entrance trusting that the others had by now safely passed through it an invisible guardian could hold them off long enough perhaps then he saw his own arms the magic aisle had left him vulnerablel the soldiers spied him in the torchlight they whirled to attack him another sword flashed beside him king omenl he was the other person who had helped dam the hot oill no words were exchanged they both knew what had to be done they had to guard this entrance from intrusion by the enemy until king trent could handle his task the ogres new passage was too narrow to allow them to fight effectively while standing inside and the dungeon chamber was too broad soldiers could stand against the far wall out of sword range and fire their arrows down the length of the tunnel so dor and omen moved out into the chamber standing back to back near the wilting pie tree and dominated the entire chamber with their two swords dor hoped king omen knew how to use his weapon the avars no cowards came at them enthusiastically they were of a wild turk nomad tribe according to amoldes secondhand information dissatisfied with their more settled recent ways and these mercenaries were the wildest of the bunch their swords were long singleedged and curved made for vigorous slashing in contrast with doris straight doubleedged sword here in the somewhat confined region of the dungeon the advantage lay with the defenders omen cut great arcs with his curved blade keeping the ruffians at bay and dor stabbed and cut severing an avars hand before the soldiers teamed respect doris sword was not magic now he had to do it all himself but he had been taught the rudiments of swordplay and these now served him well several bats shot out of the tunnel and flew over the heads of the avars who mostly ignored them one bat as if resentful of this timeglect hovered in the face of the avar leader who sliced at it with his sword the bat gave up and angled out of the chamber but swordplay was tiring business and dor was not in shape for it his arm soon felt leaden omen too was m a poor way because of his long imprisonment the avars aware of this pressed in harder they knew they would soon have the victory one charged dor blade swinging down irresistibly dor tried to step aside and counter but slipped on blood or oil and lost his footing the blade sliced into his left hip dor fell helplessly headlong omen he cried flee into the tunnel i can no longer guard your back xnt zqd gtqs omen exclaimed whirling the avars seeing their chance charged omens blade flashed in another circle for the moment daunting them while dor fought off the pain of his wound and floundered for his lost sword his questing fingers only encountered something mushy a spoiled chocolate pie from the dead pie tree two avars stepped in one countering king omen while the other ducked low to slice at omens legs dor hefted the pie and smashed it into the avars face it was a perfect shot the man dropped to his knees pawing at his mudfilled eyes while the stink of rotten pie flfled the chamber king omen granted this reprieve dispatched the remaining avar but already another was charging and dor had no other pie within reach omen hurled his sword at the bold enemy skewering him then bent to take hold of dor and haul him back to the tunnel this is crazyl dor cried despite the peril of their situation he noticed that omen too had been wounded a slash on his left shoulder was dripping bright blood and it was mixing with the gore from doris own wound save yourself l then the avars were closing for the final assault knowing they faced two unarmed and injured men taking time to aim their cuts even if omen got them to the tunnel he would be doomed he had been a fool to try to save dorbut dor found himself rather fung the man suddenly a dragon shot out of the tunnel wings unfurling as it entered the dungeon chamber it snorted fire and hovered in the air raising gleaming talons seeking prey the avars fell back amazed and terrified one made a desperate slash at the monsterand the sword passed right through the dragons wing without resistance or damage illusion of course the magic had returned and now the queen was fighting in her spectacular fashion but the moment the avars realized that the dragon had no substance it worked the opposite way the avar discovering that he could not even touch the dragon screamed and fled the chamber he was far more afraid of a spiritual menace than of a physical one king omen too stared at the dragon where did that come from he demanded i dont believe in dragons dor smiled its an illusion he explained they were able to converse again because of the ambience of magic queen iris is quite an artist in her fashion she can generate completely credible images with smell and sound and sometimes touch no one in all the history of xanth has ever been able to do it better the dragon spun to face them why thank you dor it said dissolving into a wash of color that drifted after the departing avarg now irene appeared as the avars scrambled to escape the dragon oh youre hurt she cried dor wasnt sure whether she was addressing him or omen king omen saved my life he said you were the only one with sense enough to dam off the oil to save the girl omen replied could i do less than help thanks dor said finding himself liking this bold young king more than ever rival he might be but he was a good man they shook hands dor didnt know whether this was a mun dane custom but king trent had evidently explained xanth ways now our blood has mingled we are blood brothers omen said gravely irene and iris were tearing up lengths of cloth from somewhere fashioning bandages irene got to omen first leaving dor for her mother i suspect i underestimated you dor the queen mur mured as she worked efficiently on his wound cleaning and bandag ing it after applying some of the plant healing extract but then i also underestimated your father my father dor asked bewildered that was a long time ago before i met trent she said none of your business now but he did have mettle in the crunch and so do you dor appreciated her compliment but regretted that her modifica tion of attitude had come too late irene had focused on king omen he tried to stop himself from glancing across to where irene was working on the mundane king but could not help himself the queen caught the glance you love her she said you did not before but you do now thats nice was she taunting him but you endorse king omen dor said his emotion warring within himself no omen is a fine young man but not right for irene nor she for him i support your suit dor i always did but you said she smiled sadly never in her life did my daughter do what i wished her to sometimes subtlety is necessary dor stared at her he tried to speak but the thoughts stumbled over themselves before reaching his tongue instead he leaned for ward and kissed her on the cheek lets get you on your feet the queen said helping him up dot found that he could stand though he felt dizzy the wound was not as critical as it had seemed and already was magically healing king trent appeared you did good work men thanks to your diversion i was able to get close to the majority of the avar soldiers i turned them into bats so that was the origin of the bats dor had seen one bat had tried to warn the remaining avars without success but the avars are not the only enemies king omen said we need to weed out the other collaborators lest assassins remain among us magic will help there ying trent said iris and dor will see to it we will dor asked surprised of course the queen said can you walk i dont know dor said his feelings about irenes mother had just been severely shaken up and it would take some time for them to settle into a new pattern he stepped forward experimentally and she gripped his arm and steadied him he half wished it were irene lending him support the avars however had discovered that the dragon did not fol low beyond the dungeon they were not yet aware that their backup contingent had been eliminated now they charged back into the chamber theyre catching on to the illusion grundy said wed better get out of here true enough the avars were stopping just outside the magic aisle and nooking arrows to strings they had found the way to fight magic smash went back into action he ripped a boulder out of the foun dation and hurled it at the avars his strength existed only within the aisle but the boulder once harled was just as effective beyond it as the arrows were within it the troops dived out of the way the party moved back up the tunnel dor limping dragons flew ahead and behind a ferocious honor guard in due course they reached the main hall of castle ocna a num her of the castle personnel were there huddled nervously at one end the avars had spread out and used other routes and now were ranged all around the hall the castle staff were afraid of the avars and did not yet know yang omen lived thus the castle remained in ying oarys power despite king omens release the ogre and i will guard king omen king trent said irene grow a cherry tree you and the golem win be in charge of defensive artillery magician centaur if you please stand in the center of the hall and turn rapidly in place several times as soon as i give the sig nal iris and dor your powers reach farther than mine you will rout out the lurldng avars you see i know how my husbands mind works queen iris murmured hes a genius at tactics but the avars are beyond the magic aislel dor protested and they know about your illusions theyre pretty smart in their fashion we cant fool them much longer we dont need to iris said all you have to do is have any stones in the magic aisle call out the position of any lurking avars the rest of us will take it from there ready irene trent inquired irenes tree had grown rapidly and now had a number of bright red cherries ripening ready father she said grimly dor was glad king trent was a good tactician for he dor had only the haziest notion what was developing when amolde turned it might bring some avars within the magic aisle but most would remain outside how could those others be nuumed before they used their bows now it gets nervy king trent said be ready ogre king omen its your show king omen mounted a dais in the center of the hall he was pale from loss of blood and carried his left arm awkwardly but still radiated an aura of kingliness irene picked several of the ripe cherries giving some to grundy who stood beside a pile of them smash lifted a solid wooden post to his shoulder amolde in response to trents signal began fuming himself about in place dor concentrated willing the stones in the hall to cry out if any avars were hiding near them queen iris fashioned an illusion of extraordinary grandeur the dais became a solid gold pedestal and king omen was clothed in splendid royal robes with a halo of light about his body hearken to me minions of castle ocna and loyal citizens of the kingdom of onesti the king declaimed and his voice resonated throughout the chamber i am king omen your rightful monarch betrayed and imprisoned by the usurper oary now my friends from the magic land of xanth have freed me and i call upon you to renounce oary and resume your rightful homage to me mknn jkol the avar leader cried in his own language ujqqy jko fqyp an arrow flew toward king omen smash batted it out of the air with his stake ow the arrow complained doris talent was operating too effectively i was only doing my duty as amolde turned the magic aisle rotated reaching to the farthest extent of the hall heres an avarl a stone cried as the magic engaged it he shot that affowl shut up you invisible tattletaler the avar snapped sffi g at what he assumed was there now a winged dragon launched toward the avar belching forth fire you too you fake monsterl the man cried he drew his sword and slashed at the dragon irene threw a cherry it struck the floor at the avars feet and exploded the man was knocked back against the watt stunned and soaked with red cherry juice amolde had hesitated facing the action now he resumed his turning another stone cried out theres one behind me the dragon flying in the moving aisle sent out another column of flame rich and red this time irene timed her throw to coincide and the cherry bomb detonated as the dragons apparent flame struck that made the dragon seem real dor realized all of youshoot your ettqyu the avar leader called as the magic aisle passed by him vjg oqpuvgtu etg lwuy knnwukqpu but his men hesitated for two of their number had been stunned by something that was more than illusion the cherry bombs did indeed detonate outside the ambience of magic maybe there were after all such things in mundania amolde continued to turn and the stones continued to betray the avars the lofted cherries commanded respect among the avars that king omen did not the ogres bat prevented their arrows from scormg and the queens illusions kept them confused for the flying dragon became a giant armered man with a flashing sword and the man became a pouncing sphinx and the sphinx became a swarm of green wasps thunder sounded about the dais the illusion of sound punctuating king omens speech soon all the remaining avars had been cowed or nullified now the enemy troops are gone king omen said his size increased subtly by illusion loyal citizens of the kingdom of onesti need have no fear come before me renew your allegiance stars and streamers floated down around him hesitantly the castle personnel came forward theyre afraid of the images grundy said the queen nodded abmptly the monsters vanished and the hall became a region of pastel lighting and gentle musicat least within the rotating aisle heartened the people stepped up more boldly is it reay you your majesty good omen an old retainer asked we thought you dead and when the monsters came holdl a student voice called from the archway nearest the castles main entrance all turned there stood kirig oary just within the aisle dor realized the man must have ridden to castle ocna by another route avoiding the path with the bridge out oary had figured out where dois party was heading had known it meant trouble and hastened to deal with the situation before it got out of control oary had cunning and courage there is the usurperl king omen cried take him captiver but oary was backed by another contingent of avar mercenan es brought with him from the other castle the ordinary servitors could not readily approach him he stood just at the fringe of the magic aisle so that his words were translated he had ascertained its flidt he could step out of it at any moment fools oary cried his voice resounding throughout the hall you are being deluded by illusion muong to me and destroy these alien intruders alien intruders king omen cried outraged the stars exploded around him and gloriously indignant music swelled in the backgroimd you who drugged me and threw me into the dungeon and usurped my throneyou dare call me this the people of the castle hesitated looking from one iing to another uncertain where their loyalty should lie each king was imposing oary had taken time to garb himself in full regaha his royal cloak crown and sword rendering his fat body elegant king omen was enhanced by queen iris magic to similar splendor it was obviously hard for the ordinary people to choose between them on the basis of appearance i call you nothing oary roared with the sincerity of conviction that only a total scoundrel could generate you do not even exist you died at the hands of khazar assassins you the stars around omen became blinding and now they hissed sputtered and roared with the sound of the firmament being torn asunder the noise drowned out oarys words nay let the villain speak king omen said it was ever our way to let each person present his case hell destroy you queen iris samed i dont trust hbn dont give him a chance it is omens choice king trent said gently with that the illusion stopped not in the slightest way did queen iris ever oppose her will to king trentsat least in pubhe there was only the mundane court silent and drab with its huddled ser ants facing the knot of avars you are no more than an illusion oary continued boldly grasping his opportunity we have seen how the aliens can fashion monsters and voices from nothing who doubts they can fashion the likeness of our revered former king queen iris looked pained master stroke she breathed i knew we shouldnt have let that cockatrice talk indeed the castle personnel were swayed they stared at king omen as if trying to fathom the illusion the very facility of queen iris illusions now worked against king omen who could ten reality from image if king omen somehow returned from the dead king oary continued i would be the first to welcome him home but woe betide us all if we proffer loyalty to a false image king omen stood stunned by the very audacity of oarys ploy in their contest of words the usurper had plainly scored a critical point destroy the impersonator oary cried seizing the moment the people started toward king omen now king omen found his voice how can you destroy an illusion he demanded if i am but a construct of air i will laugh at your efforts the people paused confused again but once more oary rushed into the gap of course theres a man there he merely looks like king omen hes an imposter sent here to incite you to rebellion against your real king then the ogre can rule in my stead the people shuddered they did not want to be ruled by an ogre imposter king omen exclaimed dor lend me your swordl for in the confusion dor had recovered his sword while king omen had lost his that will settle nothing king trent said ike better swordsman is not necessarily the rightful king oh yes he is omen cried only the royalty of onesti are trained to fine expertise with the sword no peasant imposter could match oary but i am a better swordsman than the usurper so can prove myself no imposter not so oary protested well i know that is an enchanted sword your henchman has given you no one can beat that for it makes any duffer skilled the man had learned a lot in a hurry it had never occurred to dor that king oary would be so agile in debate evidently his head was not filled with pudding omen glanced at the sword startled dor did not evince any particular skill with it he said with unconscious disparagement of doris technique it is nevertheless true king trent said dor was outside the magic aisle when he used it thats right dor agreed reluctantly in the aisle with that sword anyone could beat anyone also the queens illusion could make king trent look like you king omenand he is probably a better swordsman than you are dor wondered just after he said it whether he had made that comparison because he smarted from omens disparagement of his own skill yet king trent was the finest swordsman in xanth so his point was vahd you fools queen iris expostulated victory in your grasp and you squander it away on technicalities its a matter of honesty dor said o n e s t l king omen laughed able to grasp the spelling pun within the centaurs range yes i understand well i will fight oary outside the magic aisle where your wound will weaken you and you will have the disadvantage of using a straight sword when you are trained to a curved one queen his said if those arent enough the imposters avars will put an arrow in your back dont be even more of a fool than you need to be oarys trying to maneuver you into a position where his treachery can prevail i tell you i know the type dor was silent the queen knew the type because she was the type that made her a good adviser in a situation like this but how can i prove my identity king omen asked somewhat plaintively let the castle personnel come to you and touch you and talk with you king trent suggested surely many of them know you well they will be able to tell whether you are an imposter oary tried to protest but the suggestion made too much sense to the castle personnel king trents ability to maneuver had foiled oarys stratagems nonavar guards appeared reaching for their weapons and they were more numerous than the avars it seemed that news of this confrontation had spread and the true onesti loyalists were converging seeing himself losing position oary grudgingly agreed i will join the line myselfl he declared after all i should be the first to welcome king omen back should he actually return since it is in his stead i hold the throne of onesti queen iris scowled but king trent gestured her to silence it was as if this were a game of moves and countermoves with limiting rules oary was now going along with king trents move and had to be accommodated until he made an open break dor noted the process at such time as he himself had to be king for keeps this might guide him come king king trent said takhig omen by the arm let us all set aside our weapons and form a receiving line gently he took the magic sword and passed it over to queen iris who set it carefully on the floor oary had to divest himself of his own weapon honoring this new move his avars grumbled but stayed back smash the ogre moved nearer them retaining his post this encouraged them to keep the peace the line tonned the palace personnel coming eagerly forward to verify the person of king omen the first was an old man slow to move but given the lead because of the respect of the others hello borywog king omen said grasping the mans frail arm remember what a torment i was when a child and you my tutor worse than my father was you thought youd never teach me to spell remember when i wrote the name of our kingdom as honesty my lord my lord the old man cried fal g to his knees never did i tell that abomination to a soul it has to be you your majestyl the others proceeded through the ene king omen knew them all the case was becoming conclusive king trent stood behind him smiling benignly suddenly one of the men in the line drew a dagger and lunged at omen but before the treacherous strike scored the man became a large brown rat who scurried away terrified a palace cat bounded eagerly after it i promised to stand bodyguard king trent said mildly i have had a certain experience in such matters then oary was at the head of the ene why it is omenlll he exclaimed in seeming amazement avars sheathe your weapons our proper ying has returned from the dead what a miracler ng omen expecting another ad of treachery stood openmouthed again king trent stepped in so nice to have your confirmation king oary we always knew you had the best interests of the kingdom of onesti at heart it is best to resolve these things with the appearance of amicability if possible dor why dont you conduct king oary to a more private place and work out the details now dor was amazed he stood unspealdng grundy appeared tapping dor on the leg take him into an anteroom the golem whispered ill get the others dor composed himsell of course he said with superficial equilibrium king oazy shall we adjourn to an anteroom for a private discussion by all means oary said the soul of amicability he seemed to understand the rules of this game better than dor did they walked sedately to the anteroom while king omen continued to greet old friends and the avars fidgeted in their isolated mass without oary to command them the avars were ineffective they didnt even speak the local language doris thoughts were spinning why had oary welcomed omen after trying to deny him and have him assassinated why did he pretend not to know where omen had been and why did king trent himself a victim of oarys treachery and cruelty go along with this why finally had king trent turned the matter over to dor who was incompetent to understand the situation let alone deal with it irene smash and amolde joined them in the anteroom oary seemed unperturbed shall we speak plainly the mundane inquired sure irene retorted drawing her jacket close about her think you stinkl do you folk comprehend the situation oary asked blithely no dor said i dont know why king trent didnt turn you into a worm and step on you king trent is an experienced monarch oary said he deals with realities rather than emotions he goes for the most profitable combination rather than simple vengeance here is reality i have one troop of avars here who could certainly create trouble i h ave more at the other castle it would take a minor civil war to dislodge those mercenaries whose captains are loyal to meand that would weaken the kingdom of onesid at a time when the khazar menace is grovdng it would be much better to avoid that nuisance and keep the kingdom strong therefore king omen must seek accommodation with mefor the good of onesti why not just irene started but broke off you are unable to say it oary said that is the symptom of your weakness which you will have to eliminate if you hope to make as effective a queen as your mother why not just kill me and be done with it because your kind lacks the gumption to do what is necessary yeah grundy demanded why didnt you kill king omen then oary sighed i should have i suppose i really should have but i liked the young fool no ones perfect but you tried to have him killed just now dor said a desperate measure oary said i cant say im really sorry it failed the move came too late t should have been done at the outset so that omen never had opportijnity to give proof of his identity then the game would have been mine but that is the measure of my own inadequacy i didnt want to retain my crown enough doris emotions were mixing he knew oary to be an unscrupulous rascal but the mans candor and cleverness and admission of civilized weakness made it hard to dislike him totally and now we have to deal with you dor said but i dont see how we can trust you of course you cant trust me oary agreed had i the option i would have you right back in the dungeon and your horseman would be touring the avar empire as a circus freak now see here amolde said if we cant kill him and cant trust him what can we do with him dor asked the others throw him in the same cell he threw king omen irene said have a sadistic mute eunuch feed him smash destroyed those cells grundy reminded her anyway they arent safe one of his secret henchmen might let him out but weve got to come up with a solution for king omen dor said i dont know why this was put in my hands but because you will one day be king of xanth oary said you must learn to make the hard decisions right or wrong had i had more experience before attaining power i would have acted to avoid my present predicament had omen had it he would never have lost his throne you have to learn by doing your king trent is one compatent individual it was my misfortune to mis udge hirm since i thought his talk about magic indicated a deranged mind usually only ignorant peasants really believe in sorcery by the time you are king you will know how to handle the office this made brutal sense i wish i could trust you dor said youd make an excellent practical tutor in the realities of governing this is your practical tutoring oary said there are two customary solutions historically amolde said one is mutilationthe criminal is blinded or deprived of his extremities so he can do no further harm no dor said and irene agreed we are not barbarians you are not professional either oary said still you balk at expedient methods ile other is banishment the centaur continued people of your species without magical talents used to be banished from xanth just as people of my species with such talents are banished it is a fairly effective device but he could gather an army and come back dor protested king trent did way back when he was banished but he did not conquer xanth the situation had changed and he was invited back perhaps in twenty years the situation will be changed in onesti and oary will be needed again at any rate there are precautions a selective restricted banishment should prevent betrayal while keeping him out of local mischief it would be advisable not to call it banishment of course that would suggest there was something untoward about the transfer of power instead of an amicable return of a temporarily lost king he could be assigned as envoy or ambassador to some strategic territory ike khazars grundy cried hey i dont want to go there oary protested those are rough people it would take all my wit just to survive precisely the centaur said oary would be something of a circus freak in that society tolerated but hardly taken seriously it would be his difficult job to maintain liaison and improve relations with that empire and of course to advise onesti when any invasion was contemplated if he did a good enough job for a long enough period he might at length be pardoned and allowed to retire in onesti if not but the khazars are bound to invade onesti sooner or later oary said how could i prevent i seem to remember that at this period the nordic magyars were nominally part of the khazar empire amolde said they remained however a discrete culture oary might be sent to the magyar court where he would probably foment rebeleon against the khazars dor said just to keep the action away from onesti it would take constant cunning and vigilance what a dastardly deed irene exclaimed gleefully surprised they all exchanged glances a dastardly deed dor repeated we were cursed to do it irene said before the moon got fulland its very nearly fun now lets go tell the others how ambassador oary is going to the magyars purely in the interest of serving the kingdom i love so well to promote the interests of my good friend and restored eege king omen oary said philosophically it could have been worse i thought youd flay me and turn me loose to beg naked in the village or feed you to the ogre grundy said but were softheaded and youre too clever to waste they trooped out oary has graciously consented to be your ambassador to the magyar court of the rhazar empire dor told king omen who had finally completed the receiving line he wants only what is best for the kingdom of onesti excellent king omen said he had evidently been briefed in the interim and who will be xanths ambassador to onesti amolde centaur king trent said promptly we reaeze that his enforced absence from his home in centaur isle is a personal sacrifice for him but it is evident we need a certain amount of magic here and he is uniquely qualified he can escort specially talented xanth citizens such as my daughter when trade missions occur amolde nodded and dor saw how king trent was facilitating things for the centaur too amolde had no future at centaur isle anyway this put a different and far more positive face on it naturally amolde would not spend all his time here he would have time to visit his friend lehabod in the other aspect of mundania too in fact he would be able to do all the research he craved there was indeed an art to governance and king trent was demonstrating it ah your daughter king omen said you told me about her during our long days of confinement but i took it for the fond imagmmgs of a parent now i think it would be proper to seal the alliance of our two kingdoms by a symbolic personal merger doris heart sank king omen certainly wasnt reticent he moved boldly to obtain what he wantedas a king should dor doubted that he himself would ever be that type of person the irony was that he could not oppose king omen in this he liked the man and owed him his life and irene liked him too and was probably thrilled at the notion the alliance did seem to make sense politically and personally if there were benefits to being in line for the kingship there were also liabilities dor had to give way to what was best but he hated this king trent turned to irene how do you feel about it you do understand the significance oh i understand irene agreed flushing becomingly it makes a lot of sense and im flattered but there are two or three little points im young time takes care of that king omen said it was evident that her youth did not repel him any more than the youthfulness of the doxy had repelled king oary in fact women age so quickly here in onesti that it is best to catch them as young as possible while they remain attractive irene paused as if tracking down an implication in xanth women remained attractive a long time with the aid of minor magic c and i would have trouble adjusting to a life with no magi she continued after a moment a queen does not need magic king omen said persuasively she has power she has authority over the entire kitchen staff irene paused again that much she murmured it was evident that men dominated the society of onesti while in xanth the sexes were fairly even except for the rule about who could be king dor thought of living the rest of his life in mundania unable to utilize his own magic or participate in the magic of others the notion appalled him he doubted lrene could stand it long either and im in love with another man irene finished but the girls love has nothing to do with it yang omen protested this is a matter of state les eyes traveled along the length of her legs king trent considered we conduct such matters differently in xanth but of course compromise is essential in international relations if you really desire my daughter fatherl irene said seamingly now dont embarrass your father queen iris said irene reacted with a rebellious frown that she quickly concealed it was the old syndrome if her mother pushed something irene did the opposite doris secret ally had struck again bless the queenl king trents gaze passed across them all finishing with the queen who made the slightest nod however he continued i understand that in some societies there is a certain premium on the shall we say pristine state virginity irene said clearly but we never dor started just before she stomped on his toe king omen had caught the motion ah i did not realize it was you she loved blood brotherl you came all the way here at great personal risk to help restore my throne i cannot yet a liaison would certainly be appropriate king trent mused father irene repeated sharply queen iris smiled somewhat smugly in her daughters direction it was strange dor reflected how the very mannerisms that had annoyed him in the past now pleased him irene would never go with king omen now yet there is that matter of pristinity king omen said a queen must be above do you by chance have a sister king omen king trent inquired dor recognized the tone trent already knew the answer to his question dor might what irene screeched no no sister omen said evidently disgruntled unfortunate perhaps then a symbolic gesture king trent said if prince dor here is taking something of value to king omen or perhaps has already compromised the valuey yes irene said shamel queen iris said glaring at dor with only the tiniest quirk of humor twitching at one lip but dor said unwilling to confess falsely then some token of recompense might be in order king trent concluded we might call it a gift to preserve appearance ihe midnight sunstonel dor exclaimed after an it was just about midnight now without waiting for king trent to take the matter further dor drew it from his pocket king omen as a sincere token of amity between the kingdom of xanth and the kingdom of onesti and of my appreciation for the manner you saved my iffe allow me to present you with this rarest of gems note that it shines in the presence of magicbut turns dull in the absence of magic thus you will always know when magic is near he gave the gem to king omen who stepped out of the magic aisle then back in fascinated by the manner the gem faded and flashed again oh yes king omen agreed i shall have this set in my crown the most precious of all my treasures but now irene was angry i will not be bought for a gem she exclaimed but dor said helplessly stepping toward her right when he thought things had fallen into place they were falling out again stay away from me you slaver she flared retreating i think i am well off king omen murmured smiling dor did not want to chase her it was undignified and hardly suited to the occasion also he could not move rapidly his fresh wound inhibited him yet he was in a sense on stage he could not let her walk out on him now then he remembered the dime he had a use for it after all he clutched it out of his pocket and threw it at her moving feet irene came to an abrupt stop windmilling her arms and almost falling what she demanded then dor caught up to her and took her in his arms the dime she expostulated you made me stop on a dimel ilats cheating dor kissed herand found an amazingly warm response but even amidst the kiss he realized that amolde was facing in another direction irene had been outside the magic aisle when she stalled on the dime but he began his knees feeling weak she bit lightly on his ear did the gorgon let go of magician humfrey she asked dor laughed somewhat nervously never another dastardly deed performed in the light of the midnight sunstone grundy said and dor had to hold irene delightfully tight to prevent her from kicking the golem about the author piers anthony is the name of a hopelessly mundane character who has difficulty taking abouttheauthor notes seriously he was born in england moved to spain had his sixth birthday aboard the ship that brought hira and the former king edward vri of england to the new world and took three years to get through first grade because he couldnt learn to read naturally he grew up to be a writer whose interest was in islands peninsulas kings and illiteracy his early problems in math still manifest in his tendency to crowd five or six novels into a trilogy he now lives in the backwoods of florida with his browneyed wife blueeyed daughters and browneyed horses and dogs the old railroad tracks that cut through the hill in sight of their house bear a suspicious resemblance to the gap chasm the drooping live oaks with their spanish moss are reminiscent of tangle trees and if the local sugar sand isnt very sweet at least it is excellent for miring vehicles the land of xanth is real for those who understand it those who dont believe in it are relegated to mundania it serves them right piers anthony lost count of his novels when they approached the number of his years of age his first was written in and was never published his second chthon was published in now he turns them out at the rate of about three a year the first xanth revelation a spell for chameleon won the august derleth fantasy award for best novel of but the real success of xanth is indicated by the fact that it has generated more fan mail than any other series by this author from people ranging in age from nine to xanth is spreading a tangle tree was recently spotted in colorado and night mares have ranged even farther out
