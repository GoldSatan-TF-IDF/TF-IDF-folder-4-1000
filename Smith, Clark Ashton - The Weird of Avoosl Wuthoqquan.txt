the weird of avoosl wuthoqquan clark ashton smith i give give o magnanimous and liberal lord of the poor cried the beggar avoosl wuthoqquan the richest and most avaricious moneylender in all commoriom and by that token in the whole of hyperborea was startled from his train of reverie by the sharp eerie cicadalike voice he eyed the supplicant with acidulous disfavor his meditations as he walked homeward that evening had been splendidly replete with the shining of costly metals with coins and ingots and goldwork and argentry and the flaming or sparkling of manytinted gems in rills rivers and cascades all flowing toward the coffers of avoosl wuthoqquan now the vision had flown and this untimely and obstreporous voice was imploring for alms i have nothing for you his tones were like the grating of a shut clasp only two pazoors o generous one and i will prophesy avoosl wuthoqquan gave the beggar a second glance he had never seen so disreputable a specimen of the mendicant class in all his wayfarings through commoriom the man was preposterously old and his mummybrown skin wherever visible was webbed with wrinkles that were like the heavy weaving of some giant junglespider his rags were no less than fabulous and the beard that hung down and mingled with them was hoary as the moss of a primeval juniper i do not require your prophecies one pazoor then no the eyes of the beggar became evil and malignant in their hollow sockets like the heads of two poisonous little pitvipers in their holes then o avoosl wuthoqquan he hissed i will prophesy gratis harken to your weird the godless and exceeding love which you bear to all material things and your lust therefor shall lead you on a strange quest and bring you to a doom whereof the stars and the sun will alike be ignorant the hidden opulence of earth shall allure you and ensnare you and earth itself shall devour you at the last begone said avoosl wuthoqquan the weird is more than a trifle cryptic in its earlier clauses and the final clause is somewhat platitudinous i do not need a beggar to tell me the common fate of mortality ii it was many moons later in that year which became known to preglacial historians as the year of the black tiger avoosl wuthoqquan sat in a lower chamber of his house which was also his place of business the room was obliquely shafted by the brief aerial gold of the reddening sunset which fell through a crystal window lighting a serpentine line of irised sparks in the jewelstudded lamp that hung from copper chains and touching to fiery life the tortuous threads of silver and similor in the dark arrases avoosl wuthoqquan seated in an umber shadow beyond the aisle of light peered with an austere and ironic mien at his client whose swarthy face and somber mantle were gilded by the passing glory the man was a stranger possibly a travelling merchant from outland realms the usurer thought or else an outlander of more dubious occupation his narrow slanting berylgreen eye his bluish unkempt beard and the uncouth cut of his sad raiment were sufficient proof of his alienage in commoriom three hundred djals is a large sum said the moneylender thoughtfully moreover i do not know you what security have you to offer the visitor produced from the bosom of his garment a small bag of tigerskin tied at the mouth with sinew and opening the bag with a deft movement poured on the table before avoosl wuthoqquan two uncut emeralds of immense size and flawless purity they flamed at the heart with a cold and icegreen fire as they caught the slanting sunset and a greedy spark was kindled in the eyes of the usurer but he spoke coolly and indifferently it may be that i can loan you one hundred and fifty djals emeralds are hard to dispose of and if you should not return to claim the gems and pay me the money i might have reason to repent my generosity but i will take the hazard the loan i ask is a mere tithe of their value protested the stranger give me two hundred and fifty djals there are other moneylenders in commoriom i am told two hundred djals is the most i can offer it is true that the gems are not without value but you may have stolen them how am i to know it is not my habit to ask indiscreet questions take them said the stranger hastily he accepted the silver coins which avoosl wuthoqquan counted out and offered no further protest the usurer watched him with a sardonic smile as he departed and drew his own inferences he felt sure that the jewels had been stolen but was in no wise perturbed or disquieted by this fact no matter who they had belonged to or what their history they would form a welcome and valuable addition to the coffers of avoosl wuthoqquan even the smaller of the two emeralds would have been absurdly cheap at three hundred djals but the usurer felt no apprehension that the stranger would return to claim them at any time no the man was plainly a thief and had been glad to rid himself of the evidence of his guilt as to the rightful ownership of the gems that was hardly a matter to arouse the concern or the curiosity of the moneylender they were his own property now by virtue of the sum in silver which had tacitly been regarded by himself and the stranger as a price rather than a mere loan the sunset faded swiftly from the room and a brown twilight began to dull the metal broideries of the curtains and the colored eyes of the gems avoosl wuthoqquan lit the fretted lamp and then opening a small brazen strongbox he poured from it a flashing rill of jewels on the table beside the emeralds there were pale and iceclear topazes from mhu thulan and gorgeous crystals of tourmaline from tscho vulpanomi there were chill and furtive sapphires of the north and arctic carnelians like frozen blood and diamonds that were hearted with white stars red unblinking rubies glared from the coruscating pile chatoyants shone like the eyes of tigers garnets and alibraundines gave their somber flames to the lamplight amid the restless hues of opals also there were other emeralds but none so large and flawless as the two that he had acquired that evening avoosl wuthoqquan sorted out the gems in gleaming rows and circles as he had done so many times before and he set apart all the emeralds with his new acquisitions at one end like captains leading a file he was well pleased with his bargain well satisfied with his overflowing caskets he regarded the jewels with an avaricious love a miserly complacence and one might have thought that his eyes were little beads of jasper set in his leathery face as in the smoky parchment cover of some olden book of doubtful magic money and precious gems these things alone he thought were immutable and nonvolatile in a world of neverceasing change and fugacity his reflections at this point were interrupted by a singular occurrence suddenly and without warning for he had not touched or disturbed them in any manner the two large emeralds started to roll away from their companions on the smooth level table of black oggawood and before the startled moneylender could put out his hand to stop them they had vanished over the opposite edge and had fallen with a muffled rattling on the carpeted floor such behavior was highly eccentric and peculiar not to say unaccountable but the usurer leapt to his feet with no other thought save to retrieve the jewels he rounded the table in time to see that they had continued their mysterious rolling and were slipping through the outer door which the stranger in departing had left slightly ajar this door gave on a courtyard and the courtyard in turn opened on the streets of commoriom avoosl wuthoqquan was deeply alarmed but was more concerned by the prospect of losing the emeralds than by the eeriness and mystery of their departure he gave chase with an agility of which few would have believed him capable and throwing open the door he saw the fugitive emeralds gliding with an uncanny smoothness and swiftness across the rough irregular flags of the courtyard the twilight was deepening to a nocturnal blue but the jewels seemed to wink derisively with a strange phosphoric luster as he followed them clearly visible in the gloom they passed through the unbarred gate that gave on a principal avenue and disappeared it began to occur to avoosl wuthoqquan that the jewels were bewitched but not even in the face of an unknown sorcery was he willing to relinquish anything for which he had paid the munificent sum of two hundred djals he gained the open street with a running leap and paused only to make sure of the direction in which his emeralds had gone the dim avenue was almost entirely deserted for the worthy citizens of commoriom at that hour were preoccupied with the consumption of their evening meal the jewels gaining momentum and skimming the ground lightly in their flight were speeding away on the left toward the less reputable suburbs and the wild luxuriant jungle beyond avoosl wuthoqquan saw that he must redouble his pursuit if he were to overtake them panting and wheezing valiantly with the unfamiliar exertion he renewed the chase but in spite of all his efforts the jewels ran always at the same distance before him with a maddening ease and eerie volitation tinkling musically at whiles on the pavement the frantic and bewildered usurer was soon out of breath and being compelled to slacken his speed he feared to lose sight of the eloping gems but strangely thereafterward they ran with a slowness that corresponded to his own maintaining ever the same interval the moneylender grew desperate the flight of the emeralds was leading him into an outlying quarter of commoriom where thieves and murderers and beggars dwelt here he met a few passers all of dubious character who stared in stupefaction at the fleeing stones but made no effort to stop them then the foul tenements among which he ran became smaller with wider spaces between and soon there were only sparse huts where furtive lights gleamed out in the fullgrown darkness beneath the lowering frondage of high palms still plainly visible and shining with a mocking phosphorescence the jewels fled before him on the dark road it seemed to him however that he was gaining upon them a little his flabby limbs and pursy body were faint with fatigue and he was grievously winded but he went on in renewed hope gasping with eager avarice a full moon large and ambertinted rose beyond the jungle and began to light his way commoriom was far behind him now and there were no more huts on the lonely forest road nor any other wayfarers he shivered a little either with fear or the chill night air but he did not relax his pursuit he was closing in on the emeralds very gradually but surely and he felt that he would recapture them soon so engrossed was he in the weird chase with his eyes on the everrolling gems that he failed to perceive he was no longer following an open highway somehow somewhere he had taken a narrow path that wound among monstrous trees whose foliage turned the moonlight to a mesh of quicksilver with heavy fantastic raddlings of ebony crouching in grotesque menace like giant retiarii they seemed to close in upon him from all sides but the moneylender was oblivious of their shadowy threats and heeded not the sinister strangeness and solitude of the jungle path nor the dank odors that lingered beneath the trees like unseen pools nearer and nearer he came to the fleeting gems till they ran and flickered tantalizingly a little beyond his reach and seemed to look back at him like two greenish glowing eyes filled with allurement and mockery then as he was about to fling himself forward in a last and supreme effort to secure them they vanished abruptly from view as if they had been swallowed by the forest shadows that lay like sable pythons athwart the moonlit way baffled and disconcerted avoosl wuthoqquan paused and peered in bewilderment at the place where they had disappeared he saw that the path ended in a cavernmouth yawning blackly and silently before him and leading to unknown subterranean depths it was a doubtful and suspiciouslooking cavern fanged with sharp stones and bearded with queer grasses and avoosl wuthoqquan in his cooler moments would have hesitated a long while before entering it but just then he was capable of no other impulse than the fervor of the chase and the prompting of avarice the cavern that had swallowed his emeralds in a fashion so nefarious was a steep incline running swiftly down into darkness it was low and narrow and slippery with noisome oozings but the moneylender was heartened as he went on by a glimpse of the glowing jewels which seemed to float beneath him in the black air as if to illuminate his way the incline led to a level winding passage in which avoosl wuthoqquan began to overtake his elusive property once more and hope flared high in his panting bosom the emeralds were almost within reach then with sleightful suddenness they slipped from his ken beyond an abrupt angle of the passage and following he paused in wonder as if halted by an irresistible hand he was half blinded for some moments by the pale mysterious bluish light that poured from the roof and walls of the huge cavern into which he had emerged and he was more than dazzled by the multitinted splendor that flamed and glowed and glistened and sparkled at his very feet he stood on a narrow ledge of stone and the whole chamber before and beneath him almost to the level of this ledge was filled with jewels even as a granary is filled with grain it was as if all the rubies opals beryls diamonds amethysts emeralds chrysolites and sapphires of the world had been gathered together and poured into an immense pit he thought that he saw his own emeralds lying tranquilly and decorously in a nearer mound of the undulant mass but there were so many others of like size and flawlessness that he could not be sure of them for a while he could hardly believe the ineffable vision then with a single cry of ecstasy he leapt forward from the ledge sinking almost to his knees in the shifting and tinkling and billowing gems in great double handfuls he lifted the flaming and scintillating stones and let them sift between his fingers slowly and voluptuously to fall with a light clash on the monstrous heap blinking joyously he watched the royal lights and colors run in spreading or narrowing ripples he saw them burn like steadfast coals and secret stars or leap out in blazing eyes that seemed to catch fire from each other in his most audacious dreams the usurer had never even suspected the existence of such riches he babbled aloud in a rhapsody of delight as he played with the numberless gems and he failed to perceive that he was sinking deeper with every movement into the unfathomable pit the jewels had risen above his knees were engulfing his pudgy thighs before his avaricious rapture was touched by any thought of peril then startled by the realization that he was sinking into his newfound wealth as into some treacherous quicksand he sought to extricate himself and return to the safety of the ledge he floundered helplessly for the moving gems gave way beneath him and he made no progress but went deeper still till the bright unstable heap had risen to his waist avoosl wuthoqquan began to feel a frantic terror amid the intolerable irony of his plight he cried out and as if in answer there came a loud unctuous evil chuckle from the cavern behind him twisting his fat neck with painful effort so that he could peer over his shoulder he saw a most peculiar entity that was crouching on a sort of shelf above the pit of jewels the entity was wholly and outrageously unhuman and neither did it resemble any species of animal or any known god or demon of hyperborea its aspect was not such as to lessen the alarm and panic of the moneylender for it was very large and pale and squat with a toadlike face and a swollen squidgy body and numerous cuttlefish limbs or appendages it lay flat on the shelf with its chinless head and long slitlike mouth overhanging the pit and its cold lidless eyes peering obliquely at avoosl wuthoqquan the usurer was not reassured when it began to speak in a thick and loathsome voice like the molten tallow of corpses dripping from a wizards kettle ho what have we here it said by the black altar of tsathoggua tis a fat moneylender wallowing in my jewels like a lost pig in a quagmire help me cried avoosl wuthoqquan see you not that i am sinking the entity gave its oleaginous chuckle yes i see your predicament of course what are you doing here i came in search of my emeralds two fine and flawless stones for which i have just paid the sum of two hundred djals your emeralds said the entity i fear that i must contradict you the jewels are mine they were stolen not long ago from this cavern in which i have been wont to gather and guard my subterranean wealth for many ages the thief was frightened away when he saw me and i suffered him to go he had taken only the two emeralds and i knew that they would return to me as my jewels always return whenever i choose to call them the thief was lean and bony and i did well to let him go for now in place there is a plump and wellfed usurer avoosl wuthoqquan in his mounting terror was barely able to comprehend the words or to grasp their implications he had sunk slowly but steadily into the yielding pile and green yellow red and violet gems were blinking gorgeously about his bosom and sifting with a light tinkle beneath his armpits help help he wailed i shall be engulfed grinning sardonically and showing the cloven tip of a fat white tongue the singular entity slid from the shelf with boneless ease and spreading its flat body on the pool of gems into which it hardly sank it slithered forward to a position from which it could reach the frantic usurer with its octopuslike members it dragged him free with a single motion of incredible celerity then without pause or preamble or further comment in a leisurely and methodical manner it began to devour him
