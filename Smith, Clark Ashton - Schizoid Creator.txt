schizoid creator clark ashton smith in the private laboratory which his practice as a psychiatrist had enabled him to build equip and maintain dr carlos moreno had completed certain preparations that were hardly in accord with the teachings of modern science for these preparations he had drawn instruction from old grimoires bequeathed by ancestors who had incurred the fatherly wrath of the spanish inquisition according to a rather scurrilous family legend other ancestors had been numbered among the inquisitors at the end of the long room he had cleared the cluttered floor of its equipment leaving only an immense globe of crystal glass that suggested an aquarium about the globe he had traced with a consecrated knife the sorcerers arthame a circle inscribed with pentagrams and the various hebrew names of the deity also at a distance of several feet a smaller circle similarly inscribed wearing a seamless and sleeveless robe of black he stood now within the smaller protective circle upon his breast and forehead was bound the double triangle wrought perfectly from several metals a silver lamp engraved with the same sign afforded the sole light shining on a stand beside him aloes camphor and stroax burned in censers set about him on the floor in his right hand he held the arthame in his left a hazel staff with a core of magnetized iron like dr faustus moreno designed an evocation of the devil but not however for the same purpose that had inspired faustus pondering long and gravely on the painful mysteries of the cosmos the discrepancy of good and evil moreno had at last conceived an explanation that was startlingly simple there could he reasoned be only one creator god who was or had been primarily benignant yet all the evidence pointed to the coexistence of an evil creative principle a satan god then must be a split or dual personality a sort of jekyll and hyde manifesting sometimes as the devil this duality moreno argued must be a form of what is commonly called schizophrenia he had a profound belief in the efficacy of shock treatment for such disorders if god in his aspect as the devil could be suitably confined and subjected to treatment a cure might result the confused problems of the universe would then resolve themselves under a sane and no longer semidiabolic deity the glass globe specially constructed at great expense contained at one side electrical apparatus of morenos own devising the machine far more complex than the portable apparatus used in electric shock treatment could release a voltage powerful enough to electrocute simultaneously all the inmates of a state prison moreno considered that no lesser force could effect the shock necessary for the cure of a supernatural personage he had memorized an ancient spell for the calling up of the devil and his confinement within a bottle the globe would do admirably for the aforesaid bottle the spell was a bastard mixture of greek hebrew and latin its exact meaning seemed doubtful it was filled with such terms as eloha tetragrammaton kis elijon elohim saday and zevaoth the names of god the word bifrons recurred several times this was no doubt one of the devils numerous names but there could be only one devil moreno disregarded as childish those old demonologies that peopled hell with a multitude of evil spirits having each his own name rank and office all then was in readiness in a firm sonorous voice which might have been that of a priest chanting the mass he began to recite the incantation when the summons came bifrons was busily engaged in amorous dalliance with the sheimp foti like janus he was twofaced and he possessed multiple members since foti herself was somewhat peculiarly formed their lovemaking was quite complicated bifrons began to withdraw his members from about the sheimp some damned sorcerer has gotten hold of that ancient spell containing my name its the first time in two hundred years but ill have to go hurry back enjoined foti pouting with her four lips two of which were located in her abdomen if you dont you may find me otherwise occupiedthe air sizzled behind bifrons in his exit from the infernal regions dr moreno felt surprised and even appalled when he saw the being that his incantation had called up in the globe he had scarcely known what to expect and had paid little attention to old pictures and descriptions of the devil seeing in them only the dementia of mediaeval superstition but the teratology of this creature seemed incredible the two faces of bifrons bloated alternately against the globes interior and his arms legs body and numerous other parts squirmed and flattened themselves convulsively in a furious effort to escape but through the thickness of the glass or the power of the surrounding circle bifrons was bottled up as helplessly as any djinn imprisoned by solomon he resigned himself presently and began to relax floating awhile in midair and finally seating himself on morenos electrical machine as if feeling more at home he looped some of his parts around the various pairs of forceps ending in electrodes that projected from a huge and intricate device what the devil do you want he bellowed the glass muffled his voice which was still sufficiently audible his tones bespoke anger and resentment i want the devil said moreno and i presume that you are he the devil queried bifrons its true that im a devil but im not the old man himself there are many thousands of us as you should know if youve read the demonologists im no infernal price but merely a subordinate though with special powers of my own again what do you want money women a senatorship the presidency of your cockeyed republic name it and ill grant the wish im in a hellish hurry to get out of here you cant fool me i know that you are the devil the only one in the universe and i dont want any of your gifts all i want is to cure you bifrons was startled cure me of what say what kind of a sorcerer are you anyway im not a sorcerer but a psychiatrist my name is dr moreno my hope and intention is to cure you of being the devil this madhouse doctor must be crazy himself thought bifrons he cogitated the trend of his cogitations was betrayed only by a sardonic onesided twist of his lefthand mouth all right im the devil he agreed finally but lets get this over with what do you mean to do with me subject you to shock treatment announced the doctor a very special highvoltage treatment it should be the best thing for schizophrenia like yours schizowhat roared bifrons do you think im a lunatic let me explain i am using the term schizophrenia in its literal sense meaning split personality not as commonly applied to several types of psychic disintegration or regression i think that you are really a sick deity your illness consists in being satan part of the time a genuine case of dual and alternating egos the satanic self dominates at present otherwise i shouldnt have been able to call you up but well soon remedy all that the demon thought it well to conceal his consternation he must get back to hell as soon as possible and make a report satan he felt would be interested in dr moreno get on with your treatment he enjoined what is it anyway electricity bifrons assumed an expression of doublefaced dismay thats a highly dangerous and destructive force do you wish to annihilate me the result should be different in your case said the doctor in his most soothing professional voice are you ready bifrons gave a bicephalic nod moreno stepped cautiously from the circle and went over to a panel of switches and levers set in the laboratory wall watching the demon closely he began to manipulate one of the levers the numerous forceps of the machine on which bifrons had so conveniently seated himself closed themselves on various parts of his anatomy applying their electrodes to his skin a pair hitherto concealed sprang forth and seized his temples tightly moreno grasped a switch firmly and turned on the full voltage then still cautious he returned to the protective circle a shower of sparks and short blue bolts issued from the machine within the globe in spite of the many forceps that had tightened upon him bifrons writhed and tossed like a harpooned octopus smoke seemed to pour from his head body and members muffling the apparatus that held him captive soon a darkbrown cloud seething and swelling had filled the globes interior concealing everything from view the cloud was something that bifrons could emit at will like the fluid of a cuttlefish as a matter of fact since his nature was itself electrical he had absorbed the terrific voltage with merely a mild discomfort the dark cloud was a necessary screen for the tactics that he now intended to use perhaps moreno thought the treatment had been sufficiently prolonged he could repeat it if necessary emerging once more from his magic shelter he turned off the switch and reversed the lever that had served to manipulate the forceps once again he went back to the circle after an interval of silence there issued from the clouded globe a voice which had no resemblance to that of bifrons it was both thunderous and mellow to morenos inexperienced ear it sounded like the voice that spoke to moses on the mountain i am cured it announced you have restored me to my divinity o wise and beneficent doctor pronounce the formula of release and let me go hell is henceforth abolished together with all evil sin and disease the devil is dead god alone exists and god is good moreno was enraptured believing that he had realized so quickly his fondest professional hope scarcely knowing what he did he uttered the formula that served to release an imprisoned spirit afterwards he asked now will you reveal yourself to me i would behold you in all your glory it cannot be the voice thundered my glory would blast your eyes forever therefore the cloud with which i have surrounded myself a moment later the globe burst asunder in flying fragments like some gigantic bottle of new champagne the released cloud billowing vastly and voluminously seemed to overspread the whole laboratory in an instant bifrons raging behind it but still invisible proceeded to wreck all of morenos equipment like a dozen baboons gone berserk trayladen tables were overturned and smashed into splinters shelves were pulled down with a crashing of countless vials and carboys coiled tubings were twisted and bent and ripped apart heavily insulated wires snapped like twine the old volumes of magic piled in a corner sprang into flame and burned to ashes in a few seconds a violent wind coming as if from nowhere took up the ashes and scattered them throughout the room moreno protected by the circle alone escaped the demons wrath he crouched at the circles center cowering and gibbering while the cloud passed away through windows from which every pane had been broken several of his colleagues coming to consult him that evening found him still crouching on the wreckagelittered floor he did not seem to recognize them and had obviously become deranged his mouthings appeared to indicate a sort of theological mania the colleagues held an impromptu consultation of their own as a result moreno was removed gently but forcibly to the same type of institution as that to which he had committed so many of his patients his friends and fellowpsychiatrists deplored the interruption perhaps the ending of an illustrious career the wrecking of the laboratory remained a mystery had there been an explosion caused by one of morenos experiments had the doctor himself destroyed his equipment in a state of violent mania or should the occurrence be classified as an act of god fuming at the interruption of his tryst with foti bifrons nevertheless thought it incumbent upon himself to report at once to satan when he returned to the nether realms he found that master of that picturesque region occupied in caressing a halfflayed girl the flaying had been done to render the caresses more intimate and more exquisitely agonizing satan listened gravely to the demons account of dr moreno his tapering artistic fingers with longpointed nails of polished jet ceased their occupation and a furrow appeared like a black triangle between his luminous marble brows this is all very interesting and rather unfortunate he said however you have acted with admirable aplomb and presence of mind the situation should be well under control as long as moreno remains in the madhouse where you and his colleagues have landed him he paused and his fingers resumed in an absentminded fashion their gentle raking of his victims lumbar regions of course as you understand moreno was quite mad from the start but lunatics with a speculative bent can sometimes stumble overly close to certain guarded cosmic secrets and there are spells which even i must answer and obey not to mention the unspeakable name the shemhamphorash which coerces and compels jehovah after he recovers from his present state of shock moreno might be adjudged sane and released to continue his researches and experiments such an eventuation must be forestalled permanently my good bifrons you must return immediately to earth and watch over him i have full trust in your abilities and i confer upon you plenipotentiary powers all i ask is that you keep this doctor well bedeviled and legally insane until the hour of his death when bifrons departed satan summoned his chief lieutenants before him in the halls of pandemonium i am going away for a while he told them there are certain obligations of a pressing nature that call me and i must not neglect them too long in my absence i consign the management of hell to your competent hands bowing reversely gorson goap zimimar and amaimon lords of the four quarters went out one after one leaving their prince alone when they had gone he descended from his globed throne and passed through many corridors and by upwardwinding stairs to the small postern door of hell the door swung open without touch of any visible hand a long white robe seemed to weave itself swiftly from the air about satans form his infernal attributes withered and dropped away and the long white beard of the elohim sprouted and flowed down over his bosom as he stepped across the sill into heaven
