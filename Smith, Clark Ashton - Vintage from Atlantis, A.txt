a vintage from atlantis clark ashton smith i thank you friend but i am no drinker of wine not even if it be the rarest canary or the oldest amontillado wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and more than others i have reason to know the truth that was writ by solomon the jewish king give ear if ye will and i shall tell you a story such as would halt the halfdrained cup on the lips of the hardiest bibber we were sevenandthirty buccaneers who raked the spanish main under barnaby dwale he that was called red barnaby for the spilling of blood that attended him everywhere our ship the black falcon could outfly and outstrike all other craft that flew the jolly roger full often captain dwale was wont to seek a remote isle on the eastward verge of the west indies and lighten the vessel of its weight of ingots and doubloons the isle was far from the common course of maritime traffic and was not known to maps or other mariners so it suited our purpose well it was a place of palms and sand and cuffs with a small harbor sheltered by the curving outstretched arms of rugged reefs on which the dark ocean climbed and gnashed its fangs of white foam without troubling the tranquil waters beyond i know not how many times we had visited the isle but the soil beneath many a cocotree was heavy with our hidden trove there we had stored the loot of bullionladen ships the massy plate and jewels of cathedral towns even as to all mortal things an ending came at last to our visits we had gathered a goodly cargo but might have stayed longer on the open main where the spaniards passed if a tempest had not impended we were near the secret isle as it chanced when the skies began to blacken and wallowing heavily in the rising seas we fled to our placid harbor reaching it by nightfall before dawn the hurricane had blown by and the sun came up in cloudless amber and blue we proceeded with the landing and burying of our chests of coin and gems and ingots which was a task of some length and afterward we refilled our watercasks at a cool sweet spring that ran from beneath the palmy hill not far inland it was now midafternoon captain dwale was planning to weigh anchor shortly and follow the westering sun toward the caribbees there were nine of us loading the last barrels into the boats with red barnaby looking on and cursing us for being slower than mudturtles and we were bending kneedeep in the tepid lazy water when suddenly the captain ceased to swear and we saw that he was no longer watching us he had turned his back and was stooping over a strange object that must have drifted in with the tide after the storm a huge and barnacleladen thing that lay on the sand half in and half out of the shoaling water somehow none of us had perceived it heretofore red barnaby was not silent long come here ye chancreeaten coistrels he called to us we obeyed willingly enough and gathered around the beached object which our captain was examining with much perplexity we too were greatly bewondered when we saw the thing more closely and none of us could name it offhand or with certainty the object had the form of a great jar with a tapering neck and a deep round abdomens body it was wholly encrusted with shells and corals that had gathered upon it as if through many ages in the ocean deeps and was festooned with weeds and seaflowers such as we had never before beheld so that we could not determine the substance of which it was made at the order of captain dwale we rolled it out of the water and beyond reach of the tide into the shade of nearby palms though it required the efforts of four men to move the unwieldy thing which was strangely ponderous we found that it would stand easily on end with its top reaching almost to the shoulders of a tall man while we were handling the great jar we heard a swishing noise from within as if it were filled with some sort of liquor our captain as it chanced was a learned man by the communion cup of satan he swore if this thing is not an antique winejar then i am a bedlamite such vesselsthough mayhap they were not so hugewere employed by the romans to store the goodly vintages of falernus and cecuba indeed there is today a spanish winethat of valdepenas which is kept in earthen jars but this if i mistake not is neither from spain nor olden rome it is ancient enough by its look to have come from that longsunken isle the atlantis whereof plato speaks truly there should be a rare vintage within a wine that was mellowed in the youth of the world before the founding of rome and athens and which perchance has gathered fire and strength with the centuries ho my rascal seabullies we sail not from this harbor till the jar is broached and if the liquor within be sound and potable we shall make holiday this evening on the sands belike tis a funeral urn full of plaguey cinders and ashes said the mate roger aglone who had a gloomy turn of thought red barnaby had drawn his cutlas and was busily prying away the crust of barnacles and quaint fantastic coralgrowths from the top of the jar layer on layer of them he removed and swore mightily at this increment of forgotten years at last a great stopper of earthenware sealed with a clear wax that bad grown harder than amber was revealed by his prying the stopper was graven with queer letters of an unknown language plainly to be seen but the wax refused the cutlas point so losing all patience the captain seized a mighty fragment of stone which a lesser man could scarce have lifted and broke therewith the neck of the jar now even in those days i stephen magbane the one puritan amid that christless crew was no bibber of wine or spirituous liquors but a staunch rechabite on all occasions therefore i held back feeling little concern other than that of reprobation while the others pressed about the jar and sniffed greedily at the contents but almost immediately with its opening my nostrils were assailed by an odor of heathen spices heavy and strange and the very inhalation thereof caused me to feel a sort of giddiness so that i thought it well to retreat still further but the others were eager as midges around a fermentingvat in autumn sblood tis a royal vintage roared the captain after he had dipped a forefinger in the jar and sucked the purple drops that dripped from it avast ye slumgullions stow the watercasks on board and summon all hands ashore leaving only a watch there to ward the vessel well have a gala night before we sack any more spaniards we obeyed his order and there was much rejoicing amid the crew of the black falcon at the news of our find and the postponement of the voyage three men grumbling sorely at their absence from the revels were left on board though in that tranquil harbor such vigilance was virtually needless we others returned to the shore bringing a supply of pannikins in which to serve the wine and provisions for a feast then we gathered pieces of drift with which to build a great fire and caught several huge tortoises along the sands and unearthed their hidden eggs so that we might have an abundance and variety of victuals in these preparations i took part with no special ardor knowing my habit of abstention and being of a somewhat malicious and tormenting humor captain dwale had expressly commanded my presence at the feast however i anticipated nothing more than a little ribaldry at my expense as was customary at such times and being partial to fresh tortoisemeat i was not wholly unresigned to my lot as a witness of the babylonian inebrieties of the others at nightfall the feasting and drinking began and the fire of driftwood with eery witchcolors of blue and green and white amid the flame leapt high in the dusk while the sunset died to a handful of red embers far on purpling seas it was a strange wine that the crew and captain swilled from their pannikins i saw that the stuff was thick and dark as if it had been mingled with blood and the air was filled with the reek of those pagan spices hot and rich and unholy that might have poured from a broken tomb of antique emperors and stranger still was the intoxication of that wine for those who drank it became still and thoughtful and sullen and there was no singing of lewd songs no playing of apish antics red barnaby had been drinking longer than the others having begun to sample the vintage while the crew were making ready for their revel to our wonderment he ceased to swear at us after the first cupful and no longer ordered us about or paid us any heed but sat peering into the sunset with eyes that held the dazzlement of unknown dreams and one by one as they began to drink the others were likewise affected so that i marvelled much at the unwonted power of the wine i had never before beheld an intoxication of such nature for they spoke not nor ate and moved only to refill their cups from the mighty jar the night had grown dark as indigo beyond the flickering fire and there was no moon and the firelight blinded the stars but one by one after an interval the drinkers rose from their places and stood staring into the darkness toward the sea unquietly they stood and strained forward peering intently as men who behold some marvelous thing and queerly they muttered to one another with unintelligible words i knew not why they stared and muttered thus unless it were because of some madness that had come upon them from the wine for naught was visible in the dark and i heard nothing save the low murmur of wavelets lapping on the sand louder grew the muttering and some raised their bands and pointed seaward babbling wildly as if in delirium noting their demeanor and doubtful as to what further turn their madness might take i bethought me to withdraw along the shore but when i began to move away those who were nearest me appeared to waken from their dream and restrained me with rough hands then with drunken gibbering words of which i could make no sense they held me helpless while one of their number forced me to drink from a pannikin filled with the purple wine i fought against them doubly unwilling to quaff that nameless vintage and much of it was spilled the stuff was sweet as liquid honey to the taste but burned like hellfire in my throat i turned giddy and a sort of dark confusion possessed my senses by degrees and i seemed to hear and see and feel as in the mounting fever of calenture the air about me seemed to brighten with a redness of ghostly blood that was everywhere a light that came not from the fire nor from the nocturnal heavens i beheld the faces and forms of the drinkers standing without shadow as if mantled with a rosy phosphorescence and beyond them where they stared in troubled and restless wonder the darkness was illumed with the strange light mad and unholy was the vision that i saw for the harbor waves no longer lapped on the sand and the sea had wholly vanished the black falcon was gone and where the reefs had been great marble walls ascended flushed as if with the ruby of lost sunsets above them were haughty domes of heathen temples and spires of pagan palaces and beneath were mighty streets and causeys where people passed in a neverending throng i thought that i gazed upon some immemorial city such as had flourished in earths prime and i saw the trees of its terraced gardens fairer than the palms of eden listening i heard the sound of dulcimers that were sweet as the moaning of women and the cry of horns that told forgotten glorious things and the wild sweet singing of people who passed to some hidden sacred festival within the walls i saw that the light poured upward from the city and was born of its streets and buildings it blinded the heavens above and the horizon beyond was lost in a shining mist one building there was a high fane above the rest from which the light streamed in a muddier flood and from its open portals music came sorcerous and beguiling as the far voices of bygone years and the revellers passed gayly into its portals but none came forth the weird music seemed to call me and entice me and i longed to tread the streets of the alien city and a deep desire was upon me to mingle with its people and pass into the glowing fane verily i knew why the drinkers had stared at the darkness and had muttered among themselves in wonder i knew that they also longed to descend into the city and i saw that a great causey built of marble and gleaming with the red luster ran downward from their very feet over meadows of unknown blossoms to the foremost buildings then as i watched and listened the singing grew sweeter the music stranger and the rosy luster brightened then with no backward glance no word or gesture of injunction to his men captain dwale went slowly forward treading the marble causey like a dreamer who walks in his dream and after him one by one roger aglone and the crew followed in the same manner going toward the city haply i too should have followed drawn by the witching music for truly it seemed that i had trod the ways of that city in former time and had known the things whereof the music told and the voices sang well did i remember why the people passed eternally into the fane and why they came not forth and there it seemed i should meet familiar and beloved faces and take part in mysteries recalled from the foundered years all this which the wine had remembered through its sleep in the ocean depths was mine to behold and conceive for a moment and well it was that i had drunk less of that evil and pagan vintage than the others and was less besotted than they with its luring vision for even as captain dwale and his crew went toward the city it appeared to me that the rosy glow began to fade a little the walls took on a wavering thinness and the domes grew insubstantial the rose departed the light was pale as a phosphor of the tomb and the people went to and fro like phantoms with a thin crying of ghostly horns and a ghostly singing dimly above the sunken causey the harbor waves returned and red barnaby and his men walked down beneath them slowly the waters darkened above the fading spires and walls and the midnight blackened upon the sea and the city was lost like the vanished bubbles of wine a terror came upon me knowing the fate of those others i fled swiftly stumbling in darkness toward the palmy hill that crowned the isle no vestige remained of the rosy fight and the sky was filled with returning stars and looking oceanward as i climbed the bill i saw a lantern that burned on the black falcon in the harbor and discerned the embers of our fire that smoldered on the sands then praying with a fearful fervor i waited for dawn
