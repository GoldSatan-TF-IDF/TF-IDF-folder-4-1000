the death of ilalotha clark ashton smith black lord of bale and fear master of all confusion by thee thy prophet saith new power is given to wizards after death and witches in corruption draw forbidden breath and weave such wild enchantment and illusion as none but lamiae may use and through thy grace the charneled corpses lose their horror and nefandous loves are lighted in noisome vaults long nighted and vampires make their sacrifice to thee disgorging blood as if great urns had poured their bright vermilion hoard about the washed and weltering sarcophagi ludars litany to thasaidon according to the custom in old tasuun the obsequies of ilalotha ladyinwaiting to the selfwidowed queen xantlicha had formed an occasion of much merrymaking and prolonged festivity for three days on a bier of diversecolored silks from the orient under a rosehued canopy that might well have domed some nuptial couch she had lain clad with gala garments amid the great feastinghall of the royal palace in miraab about her from morning dusk to sunset from cool even to torridly glaring dawn the feverish tide of the funeral orgies had surged and eddied without slackening nobles court officials guardsmen scullions astrologers eunuchs and all the high ladies waitingwomen and female slaves of xantlicha had taken part in that prodigal debauchery which was believed to honour most fitly the deceased mad songs and obscene ditties were sung and dancers whirled in vertiginous frenzy to the lascivious pleading of untirable lutes wines and liquors were poured torrentially from monstrous amphorae the tables fumed with spicy meats piled in huge hummocks and forever replenished the drinkers offered libation to ilalotha till the fabrics of her bier were stained to darker hues by the spilt vintages on all sides around her in attitudes of disorder or prone abandonment lay those who had yielded to amorous license of the fullness of their potations with halfshut eyes and lips slightly parted in the rosy shadow cast by the catafalque she wore no aspect of death but seemed a sleeping empress who ruled impartially over the living and the dead this appearance together with a strange heightening of her natural beauty was remarked by many and some said that she seemed to await a lovers kiss rather than the kisses of the worm on the third evening when the manytongued brazen lamps were lit and the rites drew to their end there returned to court the lord thulos acknowledged lover of queen xantlicha who had gone a week previous to visit his domain on the western border and had heard nothing of ilalothas death still unaware he came into the hall at that hour when the saturnalia began to flag and the fallen revelers to outnumber those who still moved and drank and made riot he viewed the disordered hall with little surprise for such scenes were familiar to him from childhood then approaching the bier he recognized its occupant with a certain startlement among the numerous ladies of miraab who had drawn his libertine affections ilalotha had held sway longer than most and it was said she had grieved more passionately over his defection than any other she had been superseded a month before by xantlicha who had shown favor to thulos in no ambiguous manner and thulos perhaps had abandoned her not without regret for the role of lover to the queen though advantageous and not wholly disagreeable was somewhat precarious xantlicha it was universally believed had rid herself of the late king archain by means of a tombdiscovered vial of poison that owed its peculiar subtlety and virulence to the art of ancient sorcerers following this act of disposal she had taken many lovers and those who failed to please her came invariably to ends no less violent than that of archain she was exigent exorbitant demanding a strict fidelity somewhat irksome to thulos who pleading urgent affairs on his remote estate had been glad enough of a week away from court now as he stood beside the dead woman thulos forgot the queen and bethought him of certain summer nights that had been honeyed by the fragrance of jasmine and the jasminewhite beauty of ilalotha even less than the others could he believe her dead for her present aspect differed in no wise from that which she had often assumed during their old intercourse to please his whim she had feigned the inertness and complaisance of slumber or death and at such times he had loved her with an ardor undismayed by the pantherine vehemence with which at other whiles she was wont to reciprocate or invite his caresses moment by moment as if through the working of some powerful necromancy there grew upon him a curious hallucination and it seemed that he was again the lover of those lost nights and had entered that bower in the palace gardens where ilalotha waited him on a couch strewn with overblown petals lying with bosom quiet as her face and hands no longer was he aware of the crowded hall the highflaring lights the wineflushed faces had become a moonbright parterre of drowsily nodding blossoms and the voices of the courtiers were no more than a faint suspiration of wind amid cypress and jasmine the warm aphrodisiac perfumes of the june night welled about him and again as of old it seemed that they arose from the person of ilalotha no less than from the flowers prompted by intense desire he stooped over and felt her cool arm stir involuntarily beneath his kiss then with the bewilderment of a sleepwalker awakened rudely he heard a voice that hissed in his ear with soft venom hast forgotten thyself my lord thulos indeed i wonder little for many of my bawcocks deem that she is fairer in death than in life and turning from ilalotha while the weird spell dissolved from his senses he found xantlicha at his side her garments were disarrayed her hair was unbound and disheveled and she reeled slightly clutching him by the shoulder with sharpnailed fingers her full poppycrimson lips were curled by a vixenish fury and in her longlidded yellow eyes there blazed the jealousy of an amorous cat thulos overwhelmed by a strange confusion remembered but partially the enchantment to which he had succumbed and he was unsure whether or not he had actually kissed ilalotha and had felt her flesh quiver to his mouth verily he thought this thing could not have been and a waking dream had momentarily seized him but he was troubled by the words of xantlicha and her anger and by the halffurtive drunken laughters and ribald whispers that he heard passing among the people about the hall beware my thulos the queen murmured her strange anger seeming to subside for men say that she was a witch how did she die queried thulos from no other fever than that of love it is rumored then surely she was no witch thulos argued with a lightness that was far from his thoughts and feelings for true sorcery should have found the cure it was from love of thee said xantlicha darkly and as all women know thy heart is blacker and harder than black adamant no witchcraft however potent could prevail thereon her mood as she spoke appeared to soften suddenly thy absence has been long my lord come to me at midnight i will wait for thee in the south pavilion then eyeing him sultrily for an instant from under drooped lids and pinching his arm in such a manner that her nails pierced through cloth and skin like a cats talons she turned from thulos to hail certain of the haremeunuchs thulos when the queens attention was disengaged from him ventured to look again at ilalotha pondering meanwhile the curious remarks of xantlicha he knew that ilalotha like many of the courtladies had dabbled in spells and philtres but her witchcraft had never concerned him since he felt no interest in other charms or enchantments than those with which nature had endowed the bodies of women and it was quite impossible for him to believe that ilalotha had died from a fatal passion since in his experience passion was never fatal indeed as he regarded her with confused emotions he was again beset by the impression that she had not died at all there was no repetition of the weird halfremembered hallucination of other time and place but it seemed to him that she had stirred from her former position on the wine stained bier turning her face toward him a little as a woman turns to an expected lover that the arm he had kissed was outstretched a little farther from her side thulos bent nearer fascinated by the mystery and drawn by a stranger attraction that he could not have named again surely he had dreamt or had been mistaken but even as the doubt grew it seemed that the bosom of ilalotha stirred in faint respiration and he heard an almost inaudible but thrilling whisper come to me at midnight i will wait for thee in the tomb at this instant there appeared beside the catafalque certain people in the sober and rusty raiment of sextons who had entered the hall silently unperceived by thulos or by any of the company they carried among them a thinwalled sarcophagus of newly welded and burnished bronze it was their office to remove the dead woman and bear her to the sepulchral vaults of her family which were situated in the old necropolis lying somewhat to northward of the palacegardens thulos would have cried out to restrain them from their purpose but his tongue clove tightly nor could he move any of his members not knowing whether he slept or woke he watched the people of the cemetery as they placed ilalotha in the sarcophagus and bore her quickly from the hall unfollowed and still unheeded by the drowsy bacchanalians only when the somber cort–∏ge had departed was he able to stir from his position by the empty bier his thoughts were sluggish and full of darkness and indecision smitten by an immense fatigue that was not unnatural after his daylong journey he withdrew to his apartments and fell instantly into deathdeep slumber freeing itself gradually from the cypressboughs as if from the long stretched fingers of witches a waning and misshapen moon glared horizontally through the eastern window when thulos awoke by this token he knew that the hour drew toward midnight and recalled the assignation which queen xantlicha had made with him an assignation which he could hardly break without incurring the queens deadly displeasure also with singular clearness he recalled another rendezvous at the same time but in a different place those incidents and impressions of ilalothas funeral which at the time had seemed so dubitable and dreamlike returned to him with a profound conviction of reality as if etched on his mind by some mordant chemistry of sleep or the strengthening of some sorcerous charm he felt that ilalotha had indeed stirred on her bier and spoken to him that the sextons had borne her still living to the tomb perhaps her supposed demise had been merely a sort of catalepsy or else she had deliberately feigned death in a last effort to revive his passion these thoughts awoke within him a raging fever of curiosity and desire and he saw before him her pale inert luxurious beauty presented as if by enchantment direly distraught he went down by the lampless stairs and hallways to the moonlit labyrinth of the gardens he cursed the untimely exigence of xantlicha however as he told himself it was more than likely that the queen continuing to imbibe the liquors of tasuun had long since reached a condition in which she would neither keep nor recall her appointment this thought reassured him in his queerly bemused mind it soon became a certainty and he did not hasten toward the south pavilion but strolled vaguely amid the wan and somber boscage more and more it seemed unlikely that any but himself was abroad for the long unlit wings of the palace sprawled as in vacant stupor and in the gardens there were only dead shadows and pools of still fragrance in which the winds had drowned and over all like a pale monstrous poppy the moon distilled her deathwhite slumber thulos no longer mindful of his rendezvous with xantlicha yielded without further reluctance to the urgence that drove him toward another goal truly it was no less than obligatory that he should visit the vaults and learn whether or not he had been deceived in his belief concerning ilalotha perhaps if he did not go she would stifle in the shut sarcophagus and her pretended death would quickly become an actuality again as if spoken in the moonlight before him he heard the words she had whispered or seemed to whisper from the bier come to me at midnight i will wait for thee in the tomb with the quickening steps and pulses of one who fares to the warm petalsweet couch of an adored mistress he left the palacegrounds by an unguarded northern postern and crossed the weedy common between the royal gardens and the old cemetery unchilled and undismayed he entered those alwaysopen portals of death where ghoulheaded monsters of black marble glaring with hideously pitted eyes maintained their charnel postures before the crumbling pylons the very stillness of the lowbosomed graves the rigor and pallor of the tall shafts the deepness of bedded cypress shadows the inviolacy of death by which all things were invested served to heighten the singular excitement that had fired thulos blood it was as if he had drunk a philtre spiced with mummia all around him the mortuary silence seemed to burn and quiver with a thousand memories of ilalotha together with those expectations to which he had given as yet no formal image once with ilalotha he had visited the subterranean tomb of her ancestors and recalling its situation clearly he came without indirection to the lowarched and cedardarkened entrance rank nettles and fetid fumitories growing thickly about the seldomused adit were crushed down by the tread of those who had entered there before thulos and the rusty ironwrought door sagged heavily inward on its loose hinges at his feet there lay an extinguished flambeau dropped no doubt by one of the departing sextons seeing it he realized that he had brought with him neither candle nor lantern for the exploration of the vaults and found in that providential torch an auspicious omen bearing the lit flambeau he began his investigation he gave no heed to the piled and dusty sarcophagi in the first reaches of the subterrane for during their past visit ilalotha had shown to him a niche at the innermost extreme where in due time she herself would find sepulture among the members of that decaying line strangely insidiously like the breath of some vernal garden the languid and luscious odor of jasmine swam to meet him through the musty air amid the tiered presence of the dead and it drew him to the sarcophagus that stood open between others tightly lidded there he beheld ilalotha lying in the gay garments of her funeral with halfshut eyes and half parted lips and upon her was the same weird and radiant beauty the same voluptuous pallor and stillness that had drawn thulos with a necromantic charm i knew that thou wouldst come o thulos she murmured stirring a little as if involuntarily beneath the deepening ardor of his kisses that passed quickly from throat to bosom the torch that had fallen from thulos hand expired in the thick dust xantlicha retiring to her chamber betimes had slept illy perhaps she had drunk too much or too little of the dark ardent vintages perhaps her blood was fevered by the return of thulos and her jealousy still troubled by the hot kiss which he had laid on ilalothas arm during the obsequies a restlessness was upon her and she rose well before the hour of her meeting with thulos and stood at her chamber window seeking such coolness as the night air might afford the air however seemed heated as by the burning of hidden furnaces her heart appeared to swell in her bosom and stifle her and her unrest and agitation were increased rather than diminished by the spectacle of the moonlulled gardens she would have hurried forth to the tryst in the pavilion but despite her impatience she thought it well to keep thulos waiting leaning thus from her sill she beheld thulos when he passed amid the parterres and arbors below she was struck by the unusual haste and intentness of his steps and she wondered at their direction which could bring him only to places remote from the rendezvous she had named he disappeared from her sight in the cypresslined alley that led to the north gardengate and her wonderment was soon mingled with alarm and anger when he did not return it was incomprehensible to xantlicha that thulos or any man would dare to forget the tryst in his normal senses and seeking an explanation she surmised that the working of some baleful and potent sorcery was probably involved nor in the light of certain incidents that she had observed and much else that had been rumored was it hard for her to identify the possible sorceress ilalotha the queen knew had loved thulos to the point of frenzy and had grieved inconsolably after his desertion of her people said that she had wrought various ineffectual spells to bring him back that she had vainly invoked demons and sacrificed to them and had made futile invultuations and deathcharms against xantlicha in the end she had died of sheer chagrin and despair or perhaps had slain herself with some undetected poison but as was commonly believed in tasuun a witch dying thus with unslaked desires and frustrate cantrips could turn herself into a lamia vampire and procure thereby the consummation of all her sorceries the queen shuddered remembering these things and remembering also the hideous and malign transformation that was said to accompany the achievement of such ends for those who used in this manner the power of hell must take on the very character and the actual semblance of infernal beings too well she surmised the destination of thulos and the danger to which he had gone forth if her suspicions were true and knowing that she might face an equal danger xantlicha determined to follow him she made little preparation for there was no time to waste but took from beneath her silken bedcushion a small straightbladed dagger that she kept always within reach the dagger had been anointed from point to hilt with such venom as was believed efficacious against either the living or the dead bearing it in her right hand and carrying in the other a sloteyed lantern that she might require later xantlicha stole swiftly from the palace the last lees of the evenings wine ebbed wholly from her brain and dim ghastly fears awoke warning her like the voices of ancestral phantoms but firm in her determination she followed the path taken by thulos the path taken earlier by those sextons who had borne ilalotha to her place of sepulture hovering from tree to tree the moon accompanied her like a wormhollowed visage the soft quick patter of her cothurns breaking the white silence seemed to tear the filmy cobweb pall that withheld from her a world of spectral abominations and more and more she recalled of those legendries that concerned such beings as ilalotha and her heart was shaken within her for she knew that she would meet no mortal woman but a thing raised up and inspirited by the seventh hell but amid the chill of these horrors the thought of thulos in the lamias arms was like a red brand that seared her bosom now the necropolis yawned before xantlicha and her path entered the cavernous gloom of farvaulted funereal trees as if passing into monstrous and shadowy mouths that were tusked with white monuments the air grew dank and noisome as if filled with the breathing of open crypts here the queen faltered for it seemed that black unseen cacodemons rose all about her from the graveyard ground towering higher than the shafts and boles and standing in readiness to assail her if she went farther nevertheless she came anon to the dark adit that she sought tremulously she lit the wick of the doteyed lantern and piercing the gross underground darkness before her with its bladed beam she passed with illsubdued terror and repugnance into that abode of the dead and perchance of the undead however as she followed the first turnings of the catacomb it seemed that she was to encounter nothing more abhorrent than charnel mold and centurysifted dust nothing more formidable than the serried sarcophagi that lined the deeply hewn shelves of stone sarcophagi that had stood silent and undisturbed ever since the time of their deposition here surely the slumber of all the dead was unbroken and the nullity of death was inviolate almost the queen doubted that thulos had preceded her there till turning her light on the ground she discerned the print of his poulaines longtipped and slender in the deep dust amid those footmarks left by the rudely shod sextons and she saw that the footprints of thulos pointed only in one direction while those of the others plainly went and returned then at an undetermined distance in the shadows ahead xantlicha heard a sound in which the sick moaning of some amorous woman was bent with a snarling as of jackals over their meat her blood returned frozen upon her heart as she went onward step by slow step clutching her dagger in a hand drawn sharply back and holding the light high in advance the sound grew louder and most distinct and there came to her now a perfume as of flowers in some warm june night but as she still advanced the perfume was mixed with more and more of a smothering foulness such as she had never heretofore known and was touched with the reeking of blood a few paces more and xantlicha stood as if a demons arm had arrested her for her lanterns light had found the inverted face and upper body of thulos hanging from the end of a burnished newwrought sarcophagus that occupied a scant interval between others green with rust one of thulos hands clutched rigidly the rim of the sarcophagus while the other hand moving feebly seemed to caress a dim shape that leaned above him with arms showing jasminewhite in the narrow beam and dark fingers plunging into his bosom his head and body seemed but an empty hull and his hand hung skeletonthin on the bronze rim and his whole aspect was veindrawn as if he had lost more blood than was evident on his torn throat and face and in his sodden raiment and dripping hair from the thing stooping above thulos there came ceaselessly that sound which was half moan and half snarl and as xantlicha stood in petrific fear and loathing she seemed to hear from thulos lips an indistinct murmur more of ecstasy than pain the murmur ceased and his head hung slacklier than before so that the queen deemed him verily dead at this she found such wrathful courage as enabled her to step nearer and raise the lantern higher for even amid her extreme panic it came to her that by means of the wizardpoisoned dagger she might still haply slay the thing that had slain thulos waveringly the light crept aloft disclosing inch by inch that infamy which thulos had caressed in the darkness it crept even to the crimsonsmeared wattles and the fanged and ruddled orifice that was half mouth and half beak till xantlicha knew why the body of thulos was a mere shrunken hull in what the queen saw there remained nothing of ilalotha except the white voluptuous arms and a vague outline of human breasts melting momently into breasts that were not human like clay molded by a demon sculptor the arms too began to change and darken and as they changed the dying hand of thulos stirred again and fumbled with a caressing movement toward the horror and the thing seemed to heed him not but withdrew its fingers from his bosom and reached across him with members stretching enormously as if to claw the queen or fondle her with its dribbling talons it was then that xantlicha let fall the lantern and the dagger and ran with shrill endless shriekings and laughters of immitigable madness from the vault
