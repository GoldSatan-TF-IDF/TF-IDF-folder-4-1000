falling for rachel prologue nick couldnt figure out how hed been so damn stupid maybe it was more important to be part of the gang than he liked to admit maybe he was mad at the world in general and figured it was only right to get his licks in when he had the chance and certainly hed have lost face if hed backed out when reece and tj and cash were so fired up but hed never actually broken the law before not quite true he reminded himself as he pulled himself through the broken window and into the back of the electronics store but theyd only been little laws setting up a threecard monte scam over on madison for suckers and tourists hawking hot watches or gucci knockoffs up on fifth forging a couple of ids so that he could buy a beer hed worked in a chop shop for a while but it wasnt as if hed stolen the cars hed just broken them down for parts hed gotten stung a few times for fighting with the hombres but that was a matter of honor and loyalty breaking into a store and stealing calculators and portable stereos was a big leap while it had seemed like a lark over a couple of beers the reality of it was setting those brews to churning in his stomach the way nick saw it he was trapped as hed always been there was no easy way out hey man this is better than swiping candy bars right reeces eyes dark and surly scanned the storeroom shelves he was a short man with a rough complexion whod spent several of his twenty years in juvenile hall were gonna be rich tj giggled it was his way of agreeing with anything reece said cash who habitually kept his own counsel was already shoving boxes of video games in the black duffel he carried come on nick reece tossed him an armysurplus bag load it up sweat began to roll down nicks back as he shoved radios and minirecorders into the sack what the hell was he doing here he asked himself ripping off some poor slob who was just trying to make a living it wasnt like fleecing tourists or selling someone elses heat this was stealing for gods sake listen reece i he broke off when reece turned and shined the flashlight in nicks eyes got a problem bro trapped nick thought again copping out now wouldnt stop the others from taking what theyd come for and it would only bring him humiliation no no man no problem anxious to get it all over with he shoved more boxes in without bothering to look at them lets not get too greedy okay i mean we got to get the stuff out then we got to fence it we dont want to take more than we can handle his lips pulled back in a sneer reece slapped nick on the back thats why i keep you around your practical mind dont worry about turning the stuff i told you i got a connection right nick licked his dry lips and reminded himself he was a cobra it was all hed ever been all he ever would be cash tj take that first load out to the car reece flipped the keys make sure you lock it wouldnt want any bad guys stealing anything would we tjs giggles echoed off the ceiling as he wiggled out the window no sir he pushed his wraparound sunglasses back on his nose thieves everywhere these days right cash cash merely grunted and wrestled his way out the window that tjs a real idiot reece hefted a boxed vcr give me a hand with this nick i thought you said we were just going for the small stuff changed my mind reece pushed the box into nicks arms my old ladys been whining for one of these reece tossed back his hair before climbing through the window you know your problem nick too much conscience whats it ever gotten you now the cobras were family only time you got to have a conscience is with your family he held out his arms when nick put the vcr into them reece slipped off into the dark family nick thought reece was right the cobras were his family you could count on them hed had to count on them pushing all his doubts aside nick shouldered his bag he had to think of himself didnt he his share of tonights work would keep a roof over his head for another month or two he could have paid for his room the straight way if he hadnt gotten laid off from the deliverytruck job lousy economy he decided if he had to steal to make ends meet he could blame the government the idea made him snicker as he swung one leg out of the window reece was right he thought you had to look out for number one need a hand with that the unfamiliar voice had nick freezing halfway out the window in the shadowy light he saw the glint of a gun the flash of a badge he gave one fleeting panicky thought to shoving the bag at the silhouette and making a run for it shaking his head the cop stepped closer he was young dark with a weary kind of resignation in the eyes that warned nick that hed been this route before do yourself a favor the cop suggested just chalk it up to bad luck resigned nick slipped out of the window set the bag down faced the wall and assumed the position is there any other kind he muttered and let his mind wander as he was read his rights chapter one contents prev next with a briefcase in one hand and a halfeaten bagel in the other rachel raced up the courthouse steps she hated to be late detested it knowing shed drawn judge hatchetface snyder for the morning hearing only made her more determined to be inside and at the defense table by she had three minutes to spare and would have had twice that if she hadnt stopped by the office first how could she have known that her boss would be lying in wait with another case file two years of working as a public defender she reminded herself as she hit the doors at a run that was how she should have known she scanned the elevators gauged the waiting crowd and opted for the stairs cursing her heels she took them two at a time and swallowed the rest of the bagel there was no use fantasizing about the coffee she craved to wash it down with she screeched to a halt at the courtroom doors and took a precious ten seconds to straighten her blue serge jacket and smooth down her tousled chinlength black hair a quick check showed her that her earrings were still in place she looked at her watch and let out a deep breath right on time stanislaski she told herself as she moved sedately through the doors and into the courtroom her client a twentythreeyearold hooker with a heart of flint was being escorted in as rachel took her place the solicitation charges would probably have earned her no more than a light fine and time served but stealing the johns wallet had upped the ante as rachel had explained to her bitter client not all customers were too embarrassed to squawk when they lost two hundred in cash and a gold card all rise hatchetface strode in black robes flapping around all sixfootthree and two hundred and eighty pounds of him he had skin the color of a good cappuccino and a face as round and unfriendly as the pumpkins rachel remembered carving with her siblings every halloween judge snyder tolerated no tardiness no sass and no excuses in his courtroom rachel glanced over at the assistant district attorney who would be the opposing counsel they exchanged looks of sympathy and got to work rachel got the hooker off with ninety days her client was hardly brimming with gratitude as the bailiff led her away she had better luck with an assault case after all your honor my client paid for a hot meal in good faith when the pizza arrived cold he pointed out the problem by offering some to the delivery boy unfortunately his enthusiasm had him offering it a bit too heartily and during the ensuing scuffle said pizza was inadvertently dumped on the delivery boys head very amusing counselor fifty dollars time served rachel wrangled her way through the morning session a pickpocket a drunkanddisorderly two more assaults and a petty larceny they rounded things off at noon with a shoplifter a twotime loser it took all of rachels skill and determination to convince the judge to agree to a psychiatric evaluation and counseling not too shabby the ada was only a couple of years older than rachels twentysix but he considered himself an old hand i figure we broke even she smiled and shut her briefcase no way spelding i edged you out with the shoplifter maybe spelding who had been trying to wheedle his way into a date for weeks walked out beside her could be his psych will come back clean sure the guys seventytwo years old and steals disposable razors and greeting cards with flowers on them obviously hes perfectly rational you pds are such bleeding hearts but he said it lightly because he greatly admired rachels courtroom style as well as her legs tell you what ill buy you lunch and you can try to convince me why society should turn the other cheek sorry she shot him a quick smile and opted for the stairs again ive got a client waiting for me in jail she shrugged thats where i find them better luck next time spelding the precinct house was noisy and smelled strongly of stale coffee rachel entered with a little shiver the weatherman had been a little off that day with his promise of indian summer a thick nastylooking cloud cover was moving in over manhattan rachel was already regretting the fact that shed grabbed neither coat nor umbrella on her dash out of her apartment that morning with any luck she figured shed be back in her office within the hour and out of the coming rain she exchanged a few greetings with some of the cops she knew and picked up her visitors badge at the desk nicholas lebeck she told the desk sergeant attempted burglary yeah yeah the sergeant flipped through his papers your brother brought him in rachel sighed having a brother who was a cop didnt always make life easier so i hear did he make his phone call nope anyone come looking for him nope great rachel shifted her briefcase id like him brought up you got it looks like theyve given you another loser ray take conference room a thanks she turned dodging a swarthylooking man in handcuffs and the uniformed cop behind him she managed to snag a cup of coffee and took it with her into a small room that boasted one barred window a single long table and four scarred chairs taking a seat she flipped open her briefcase and dug out the paperwork on nicholas lebeck it seemed her client was nineteen and unemployed and rented a room on the lower east side she let out a little sigh at his list of priors nothing cataclysmic she mused but certainly enough to show a bent for trouble the attempted burglary had taken him up a step and it left her little hope of having him treated as a minor there had been several thousand dollars worth of electronic goodies in his sack when detective alexi stanislaski collared him shed be hearing from alex no doubt rachel thought there was nothing her brother liked better than to rub her nose in it when the door of the conference room opened she continued to sip her coffee as she took stock of the man being led in by a boredlooking policeman fiveten she estimated a hundred and forty needed some weight dark blond hair shaggy and nearly shoulderlength his lips were quirked in what looked like a permanent smirk it might have been an attractive mouth otherwise a tiny peridot stud that nearly matched his eyes gleamed in his earlobe the eyes too would have been attractive if not for the bitter anger she read there thank you officer at her slight nod the cop uncuffed her client and left them alone mr lebeck im rachel stanislaski your lawyer yeah he dropped into a chair then tipped it back last pd i had was short and skinny and had a bald spot looks like i got lucky this time on the contrary you were apprehended crawling out of a broken window of a storeroom of a locked store with an estimated six thousand dollars worth of merchandise in your possession the markup on that crap is incredible it wasnt easy to keep the sneer in place after a miserable night in jail but nick had his pride hey you got a cigarette on you no mr lebeck id like to get your hearing set as soon as possible so that we can arrange for bail unless of course you prefer to spend your nights in jail he shrugged his thin shoulders and tried to look unconcerned id just as soon not sweetcakes ill leave that to you fine and its stanislaski she said mildly ms stanislaski im afraid i was only given your file this morning on my way to court and had time for no more than a brief conversation with the da assigned to your case because of your previous record and the type of crime involved here the state had decided to try you as an adult the arrest was clean so you wont get a break there hey i dont expect breaks people rarely get them she folded her hands over his file lets cut to the chase mr lebeck you were caught and unless you want to weave some fairy tale about seeing the broken window and going in to make a citizens arrest he had to grin not bad it stinks youre guilty and since the arresting officer didnt make any mistakes and you have an unfortunate list of priors youre going to pay how much you pay is going to depend on you he continued to rock in his chair but a fresh line of sweat was sneaking down his spine a cell this time they were going to lock him in a cell not just for a few hours but for months maybe years i hear the jails are overcrowded costs the taxpayers a lot of money i figure the da would spring for a deal it was mentioned not just bitterness rachel realized not just anger she saw fear in his eyes now as well he was young and afraid and she didnt know how much she would be able to help him about fifteen thousand in merchandise was taken out of the store over and above what was in your possession you werent alone in that store lebeck you know it i know it the cops know it and so does the da you give them some names a lead on where that merchandise might be sitting right now and i can cut you a deal his chair banged against the floor the hell with that i never said anybody was with me nobody can prove it just like nobody can prove i took more than what i had in my hands when the cop took me rachel leaned forward it was a subtle move but one that had nicks eyes locking on hers im your lawyer lebeck and the one thing youre not going to do is lie to me you do and ill leave you twisting in the wind just like your buddies did last night her voice was flat passionless but he heard the anger simmering beneath he had to fight to keep from squirming in his chair you dont want to cut a deal she continued thats your choice so youll serve three to five instead of the six months in and two years probation i can get you either way ill do my job but dont sit there and insult me by saying you pulled this alone youre pennyante lebeck it pleased her to see the anger back in his face the fear had begun to soften her con games and sticky fingers this is the big leagues what you tell me stays with me unless you want it different but you play it straight with me or i walk you cant walk you were assigned and i can get reassigned then youll go through this with somebody else she began to pile papers back in her briefcase that would be your loss because im good im real good if youre so good how come youre working for the pds office lets just say im paying off a debt she snapped her briefcase closed so whats it going to be indecision flickered over his face for just a moment making him look young and vulnerable before he shook his head im not going to turn in my friends no deal she let out a short impatient breath you were wearing a cobra jacket when you were collared theyd taken that when they booked him just as theyd taken his wallet his belt and the handful of change in his pocket so what theyre going to go looking for your friends those same friends who are standing back and letting you take the heat all alone the da can push this to burglary and hang a twentythousanddollar theft over your head no names he said again no deal your loyaltys admirable and misplaced ill do what i can to have the charges reduced and have bail set i dont think itll be less than fifty thousand can you scrape ten percent together not a chance in hell he thought but he shrugged i can call in some debts all right then ill get back to you she rose then slipped a card out of her pocket if you need me before the hearing or if you change your mind about the deal give me a call she rapped on the door then swung through when it opened an arm curled around her waist she braced instinctively then let out a little hiss of breath when she looked up and saw her brother grinning at her rachel long time no see yeah it must be a day and a half grumpy his grin widened as he pulled her out of the corridor and into the squad room good sign his gaze skimmed over her shoulder and locked briefly on lebeck so they tied you up with that one tough break sweetheart she gave him a sisterly elbow in the ribs stop gloating and get me a decent cup of coffee resting a hip against the corner of his desk she rapped her fingertips against her briefcase nearby a short round man was holding a bandanna to his temple and moaning slightly as he gave a statement to another cop someone was talking in loud and rapid spanish a woman with a bruise on her cheek was weeping and rocking a fat toddler the squad room smelled of all of it the despair the anger the boredom rachel had always thought that if your senses were very keen you could just barely scent the justice beneath it all it was very much the same in her offices a few blocks away for a moment rachel pictured her sister natasha having breakfast with her family in her pretty kitchen in the big lovely house in west virginia or opening her colorful toy shop for the day the image made her smile a bit just as it did to imagine her brother mikhail carving something passionate or fanciful out of wood in his sunwashed new studio perhaps having a hasty cup of coffee with his gorgeous wife before she hurried off to her midtown office and here she was waiting for a cup of what would certainly be very bad coffee in a downtown precinct house filled with the sight and smells and sounds of misery alex handed her the coffee then eased down on the desk beside her thanks she sipped winced and watched a couple of hookers strut out of the holding cells a tall blearyeyed man with a nights worth of stubble shifted around them and followed a uniform through the door that led down to the cells rachel gave a little sigh whats wrong with us alexi he grinned again and slipped an arm around her what just because we like slogging through the dregs for a living for little pay and less gratitude nothing not a thing she chuckled and fueled her system with the motor oil disguised as coffee at least you just got a promotion detective stanislaski cant help it if im good you on the other hand are spinning your wheels putting criminals back on the streets im risking life and limb to keep clean she snorted scowling at him over the brim of the paper cup most of the people i represent arent doing anything more than trying to survive sure by stealing cheating and assaulting her temper began to heat i went to court this morning to represent an old man whod copped some disposable razors a real desperate case that one i guess they should have locked him up and thrown away the key so its okay to steal as long as what you take isnt particularly valuable he needed help not a jail sentence like that creep you got off last month who terrorized two old shopkeepers wrecked their store and stole the pitiful six hundred in the till shed hated that one truly hated it but the law was clear and had been made for a reason look you guys blew that one the arresting officer didnt read him his rights in his native language or arrange for a translator my client barely understood a dozen words of english she shook her head before alex could jump into one of his more passionate arguments i dont have time to debate the law with you i need to ask you about nicholas lebeck what about him you got the report you were the arresting officer yeah so i was on my way home and i happened to see the broken window and the light inside when i went to investigate i saw the perpetrator coming through the window carrying a sackful of electronics i read him his rights and brought him in what about the others alex shrugged and finished off the last couple of swallows of rachels coffee nobody around but lebeck come on alex twice as much was taken from the store as what my client allegedly had in his bag i figure he had help but i didnt see anyone else and your client exercised his right to remain silent he has a healthy list of priors kid stuff alex sneered you could say he didnt spend his childhood in the boy scouts hes a cobra he had the jacket alex agreed and the attitude hes a scared kid with a sound of disgust alex chucked the empty cup into a wastebasket hes no kid rach i dont care how old he is alex right now hes a scared kid sitting in a cell and trying to pretend hes tough it could have been you or mikhail even tash or me if it hadnt been for mama and papa hell rachel it could have been she insisted without the family without all the hard work and sacrifices any one of us could have gotten sucked into the streets you know it he did why did she think hed become a cop the point is we didnt its a basic matter of whats right and whats wrong sometimes people make bad choices because theres no one around to help them make good ones they could have spent hours debating the many shades of justice but he had to get to work youre too softhearted rachel just make sure it doesnt lead to being softheaded the cobras are one of the roughest gangs going dont start thinking your clients a candidate for boys town rachel straightened pleased that her brother remained slouched against the desk it meant they were eye to eye was he carrying a weapon alex sighed no did he resist arrest no but that doesnt change what he was doing or what he is it might not change what he was doing allegedly but it might very well say something about what he is preliminary hearings at two i know she smiled again and kissed him see you there hey rachel she turned at the doorway and looked back want to catch a movie tonight sure shed made it to the outside in two steps when her name was called again more formally this time ms stanislaski she paused flipping her hair back with one hand as she looked over her shoulder it was the tiredeyed stubblefaced man shed noticed before hard to miss she reflected as he hurried toward her he was over six feet by an inch or so and his baggy sweatshirt was held up by a pair of broad shoulders faded jeans frayed at the cuffs white at the stress points fit well over long legs and narrow hips it would have been hard not to miss the anger too it radiated from him and it was reflected in steelblue eyes set deep in a rough hollowcheeked face rachel stanislaski yes he caught her hand and in the process of shaking it dragged her down a couple of steps he might look lean and mean rachel thought but he had the grip of a bear trap im zackary muldoon he said as if that explained everything rachel only lifted a brow he certainly looked fit to spit nails and after that brief taste of his strength she wouldnt have put the feat past him but she wasnt easily intimidated particularly when she was standing in an area swarming with cops can i help you mr muldoon im counting on it he dragged a big hand through a tousled mop of hair as dark as her own he swore and took her elbow to pull her down the rest of the steps whats it going to take to get him out and why the hell did he call you and not me and why in gods name did you let him sit in a cell all night what kind of lawyer are you rachel shook her arm free no easy task and prepared to use her briefcase as a weapon if it became necessary shed heard about the black irish and their tempers but ukrainians were no slouches either mr muldoon i dont know who you are or what youre talking about and i happen to be very busy shed managed two steps when he whirled her around rachels tawny eyes narrowed dangerously look buster i dont care how busy you are i want some answers if you dont have time to help nick then well get another lawyer god knows why he chose some fancy broad in a designer suit in the first place his blue eyes shot fire the irish poets mouth hardening into a sneer she sputtered angry color flagging both cheeks she jabbed one stiffened cleartipped finger in his chest broad you just watch who you call broad pal or or youll get your boyfriend to lock me in a cell zack suggested yeah that was definitely a fancy face he thought in disgust buttersoft skin in pale gold and eyes like good irish whiskey what he needed was a street fighter and hed gotten society i dont know what kind of defense nick expects from some woman who spends her time kissing cops and making dates when shes supposed to be working its none of your business what i she took a deep breath nick are you talking about nicholas lebeck of course im talking about nicholas lebeck who the hell do you think im talking about his black brows drew together over his furious eyes and youd better come up with some answers lady or youre going to be off his case and out on your pretty butt hey rachel an undercover cop dressed like a wino sidled up behind her he eyed zack any problem here no though her eyes were blazing she offered him a half smile no im fine matt thanks she edged over to one side and lowered her voice i dont owe you any answers muldoon and insulting me is a poor way to gain my cooperation youre paid to cooperate he told her just how much are you hosing the boy for excuse me whats your fee sugar her teeth set the way she saw it sugar was only a marginal step up from broad im a public defender muldoon assigned to lebecks case that means he doesnt owe me a damn thing just like i dont owe you a pd he all but backed her off the sidewalk and into the building what the devil does nick need a pd for because hes broke and unemployed now if youll excuse me she set a hand on his chest and shoved shed have been better off trying to shove away the brick building at her back he lost his job but the words trailed off this time rachel read something other than anger in his eyes weariness she thought a trace of despair resignation he could have come to me and who the hell are you zack rubbed a hand over his face im his brother rachel pursed her lips lifted a brow she knew how the gangs worked and though zack looked roughandready enough to fit in with the cobras he also looked too old to be a cardcarrying member dont the cobras have an age limit what he let his hand drop and focused on her again with a fresh oath do i look like i belong to a street gang with her head tilted rachel ran her gaze from his battered hightops to his shaggy dark head he had the look of a street tough certainly of a man who could bulldoze his way down alleys pounding rivals with those bigfisted hands the hard hollowed face and hot eyes made her think hed enjoy cracking skulls particularly hers actually you could pass and your manners certainly reflect the code rude abrasive and rough he didnt give a damn what she thought of his appearance or his manners but it was time they set the record straight im nicks brother stepbrother if you want to be technical his mother married my father get it her eyes remained wary but there was some interest there now he said he didnt have any relatives for an instant she thought she saw hurt in those steelblue depths then it was gone hardened away hes got me whether he likes it or not and i can afford a real lawyer so why dont you fill me in and ill take it from there this time she didnt merely set her teeth she practically snarled i happen to be a real lawyer muldoon and if lebeck wants other counsel he can damn well ask for it himself he struggled to find the patience that always seemed to elude him well get into that later for now i want to know what the hells going on fine she snapped the word out as she looked at her watch you can have fifteen minutes of my time providing you take it while i eat i have to be back in court in an hour chapter two contents prev next from the way she looked elegant sex in a threepiece suit zack figured her for one of the trendy little restaurants that served complicated pasta dishes and white wine instead she stalked down the street her long legs eating up the sidewalk so that he didnt have to shorten his pace to keep abreast she stopped at a vendor and ordered a hot dog loaded with a soft drink then stepped aside to give zack room to make his selection the idea of eating anything that looked like a hot dog at what he considered the crack of dawn had his stomach shriveling zack settled for a soft drink the kind loaded with sugar and caffeine and a cigarette rachel took the first bite licked mustard off her thumb over the scent of onions and relish zack caught a trace of her perfume it was like walking through the jungle he thought with a frown all those ripe sweaty smells and then suddenly unexpectedly you could come across some exotic seductive vine tangled with vivid flowers hes charged with burglary rachel said with her mouth full not much chance of shaking it he was apprehended climbing out of the window with several thousand dollars worth of stolen merchandise in his possession stupid zack downed half the soft drink in a swallow he doesnt have to steal thats neither here nor there he was caught he was charged and he doesnt deny the act the das willing to deal offer probation and community service if nick cooperates zack chuffed out smoke then hell cooperate rachels left brow lifted then settled she had no doubt zackary muldoon thought he could prod push or punch anybody into anything i sincerely doubt it hes scared but hes stubborn and hes loyal to the cobras zack said something foul about the cobras rachel was forced to agree well that may be but it doesnt change the bottom line his record is fairly lengthy and it wont be easy to get around it its also mostly hustle and jive the fact that this is his first step into the big leagues might help reduce his sentence i think i can get him off with three years if he behaves hell only serve one zacks fingers dug into the aluminum can crushing it fear settled sickly in his stomach i dont want him to go to prison muldoon im a lawyer not a magician they got back the stuff he took didnt they that doesnt negate the crime but yes of course theres several thousand more outstanding ill make it good somehow zack heaved the can toward a waste can it tipped the edge joggled then fell inside listen ill make restitution on what was stolen nicks only nineteen if you can get the da to try him as a minor it would go easier the states tough on gang members and with his record i dont think it would happen if you cant do it ill find someone who can zack threw up a hand before she could tear into him i know i came down on you before sorry i work nights and im not my best in the morning even that much of an apology grated on him but he needed her i get a call an hour ago from one of nicks friends telling me hes been in jail all night when i get down here and see him its the same old story i dont need you i dont need anybody im handling it he tossed down his cigarette crushed it out lit another and i know hes scared down to the bone with something close to a sigh he jammed his hands in his pockets im all hes got ms stanislaski whatever it takes im not going to see him go to prison it was never easy for her to harden her heart but she tried she wiped her hands carefully on a paper napkin have you got enough money to cover the losses fifteen thousand he winced but nodded i can get it itll help how much influence do you have over nick next to none he smiled and rachel was surprised to note that the smile held considerable charm but that can change ive got an established business and a twobedroom apartment i can get you professional and character references whatever you need my records clean well i did spend thirty days in the brig when i was in the navy bar fight he shrugged it off i dont guess theyd hold it against me since it was twelve years ago rachel turned the possibilities over in her mind if im reading you right you want me to try to get the court to turn nick over to your care the probation and community service a responsible adult to look out for him all the damages paid you might not be doing him any favor muldoon hes my brother that she understood perfectly rachel cast her eyes skyward as the first drop of rain fell ive got to get back to the office if youve got the time you can walk with me ill make some calls see what i can do a bar rachel thought with a sigh as she tried to put together a rational proposition for the hearing that afternoon why did the man have to own a bar she supposed it suited him the big shoulders the big hands the crooked nose that she assumed had been broken and of course the rough dark irish looks that matched his temper but it would have been so much nicer if she could tell the judge that zackary muldoon owned a nice mens shop in midtown instead she was going to ask a judge to hand over the responsibility and the guardianship of a nineteenyearold boy with a record and an attitude to his thirtytwoyearold stepbrother who ran an east side bar called lower the boom there was a chance a slim one the da was still pushing for names but the shop owner had been greatly mollified with the promise of settlement no doubt hed inflated the price of his merchandise but that was muldoons problem not hers she didnt have much time to persuade the da that he didnt want to try nick as an adult taking what information shed managed to pry out of zack she snagged opposing counsel and settled into one of the tiny conference rooms in the courthouse come on haridan lets clean this mess up and save the courts time and the taxpayers money putting this kid in jail isnt the answer haridan balding on top and thick through the middle eased his bulk into a chair its my answer stanislaski hes a punk a gang member with a history of antisocial behavior some tourist scams and some pushyshovey assault charges were dropped come on we both know its minorleague hes minorleague weve got a scared troubled kid looking for his place with a gang we want him out of the gang no question but jail isnt the way she held up a hand before haridan could interrupt look his stepbrother is willing to help not only by paying for property you have absolutely no proof my client stole but by taking responsibility giving lebeck a job a home supervision all you have to do is agree to handling lebeck as a minor i want names he wont give them hadnt she gone back down and harassed nick for nearly an hour to try to pry one loose you can put him away for ten years and you still wont get one so whats the point you havent got a hardened criminal here yet lets not make him one they knocked that back and forth and haridan softened not out of the goodness of his heart but because his plate was every bit as full as rachels he had neither the time nor the energy to pursue one punk kid through the system im not dropping it down from burglary to nighttime breaking and entering on that he was going to stand firm but he would throw her a crumb even if we agree to handle him as a juvie the judge isnt going to let him walk with probation rachel gathered up her briefcase just leave the judge to me whod we pull haridan grinned beckett marlene c beckett was an eccentric like a magician she pulled unusual sentences out of her judges robes as if they were little white rabbits she was in her midforties dashingly attractive with a single streak of white hair that swept through a wavy cap of fireengine red personally rachel liked her a great deal judge beckett was a staunch feminist and former flower child who had proven that a woman an unmarried careeroriented woman could be successful and intelligent without being abrasive or whiny she might have been in a mans world but judge beckett was all woman rachel respected her admired her even hoped to follow in her footsteps one day she just wished shed been assigned to another judge as beckett listened to her unusual plea rachel felt her stomach sinking down to her knees becketts lips were pursed a bad sign one perfectly manicured nail was tapping beside the gavel rachel caught the judge studying the defendant and zack who sat in the front row behind him counselor youre saying the defendant will make restitution for all properties lost and that though the state is agreeable that he be tried as a minor you dont want him bound over for trial im proposing that trial may be waived your honor given the circumstances both the defendants mother and stepfather are deceased his mother died five years ago when the defendant was fourteen and his stepfather died last year mr muldoon is willing and able to take responsibility for his stepbrother if it please the court the defense suggests that once restitution is made and a stable home arranged a trial would be merely an unproductive way of punishing my client for a mistake he already deeply regrets with what might have been a snort beckett cast a look at nick do you deeply regret bungling your attempt at burglary young man nick lifted one shoulder and looked surly a sharp rap on the back of the head from his stepbrother had him snarling sure i he glanced at rachel the warning in her eyes did more to make him subside than the smack it was stupid undoubtedly judge beckett agreed mr haridan what is your stand on this the district attorneys office is not willing to drop charges your honor though we will agree to regard the defendant as a juvenile an offer to lessen or drop charges was made if the defendant would provide the names of his accomplices you want him to squeal on those he mistakenly im sure considers friends beckett lifted a brow at nick no dice no maam she made some sound that rachel couldnt interpret then pointed at zack stand up mr muldoon is it ill at ease zack did so maam your honor where were you when your young brother was getting himself mixed up with the cobras at sea i was in the navy until two years ago when i came back to take over my fathers business what rank chief petty officer maam mmhmm she took his measure as a judge and as a woman ive been in your bar a few years back you used to serve an excellent manhattan zack grinned we still do are you of the opinion mr muldoon that you can keep your brother out of trouble and make a responsible citizen of him i i dont know but i want a chance to try beckett tapped her fingers and sat back have a seat ms stanislaski the court is not of the opinion that a trial would be out of place in this matter your honor beckett cut rachel off with a single gesture i havent finished im going to set bail at five thousand dollars this brought on an objection from the da that was dealt with in exactly the same manner im also going to grant the defendant what well call a provisionary probation two months beckett said folding her hands i will set the trial date for two months from today if during that twomonth period the defendant is found to be walking the straight and narrow is gainfully employed refrains from associating with known members of the cobras and has not committed any crime this court will be amenable to extending that probation with the likelihood of a suspended sentence your honor haridan puffed out how can we be certain the defendant wont waltz in here in two months and claim to have upheld the provisions because he will be supervised by an officer of the court who will serve as coguardian with mr muldoon for the twomonth period and i will receive a written report on mr lebeck from that officer becketts lips curved i think im going to enjoy this rehabilitation mr haridan does not have to be accomplished in prison rachel restrained herself from giving haridan a smug grin thank you your honor youre quite welcome counselor have your report to me every friday afternoon by three my rachel blinked paled then gaped my report but your honor you cant mean for me to supervise mr lebeck that is precisely what i mean ms stanislaski i believe having a male and a female authority figure will do our mr lebeck a world of good yes your honor i agree but im not a social worker youre a public servant ms stanislaski so serve she rapped her gavel next case stunned speechless by the judges totally unorthodox ruling rachel moved to the back of the courtroom good going champ her brother muttered in her ear now youve got yourself hooked good how could she do that i mean how could she just do that everybody knows shes a little crazy furious he swung rachel out in the hall by an elbow theres no way in holy hell im letting you play babysitter for that punk beckett cant force you to no of course she cant after dragging a hand through her hair she shook alex off stop pulling at me and let me think theres nothing to think about youve got your own family and your own life watching over lebeck is out of the question and for all you know that brother of his is just as dangerous its bad enough i have to watch you defend these creeps no way im having you play big sister to one of them if hed sympathized with her predicament she might not have been quite as hasty if hed told her shed gotten a raw deal she probably would have agreed and set the wheels in motion to negate it but you dont have to watch me do anything alexi and i can play big sister to whomever i choose now why dont you take that big bad badge of yours and go arrest some harmless vagrant his blood boiled every bit as quickly as hers youre not doing this ill decide what im going to do now back off he cupped a hand firmly on her chin just as she poked it out ive got a good mind to the lady asked you to back off zacks voice was quiet like a snake before it strikes alex whipped his head around eyes hot and ready it took all of his training to prevent himself from throwing the first punch keep out of our business zack planted his feet and prepared i dont think so they looked like two snarling dogs about to go for the throat rachel pushed her way between them stop it right now this is no way to behave outside a courtroom muldoon is this how youre going to show nick responsibility by picking fights he didnt even glance at her but kept his eyes on alex i dont like to see women pushed around i can take care of myself she rounded on her brother youre supposed to be a cop for heavens sake and here you are acting like a rowdy schoolboy you think about this the court believes this is a viable solution so im obligated to try it damn it rachel alexs eyes went flat and cold when zack stepped forward again pal you mess with me or my sister youll be wearing your teeth in a glass by your bedside sister thoughtfully zack examined one face then the other oh yes the family resemblance was strong enough when you took a minute to study them they both had those wild good looks that came through the blood his anger cooled instantly that changed things he gave rachel another speculative look it changed a lot of things sorry i didnt realize it was a family argument you go ahead and yell at her all you want alex had to fight to keep his lips from twitching all right rachel youre going to listen to me she had to sigh then she had to take his face in her hands and kiss him since when have i ever listened to you go away alexi chase some bad guys and ill have to take a rain check on that movie tonight there was no arguing with her there never was changing tactics alex stared down zack you watch out for her muldoon and watch good because while youre at it im going to be watching you sounds fair come by the bar anytime officer first ones on the house muttering under his breath alex stalked away he turned once when rachel called something out to him in ukrainian with a reluctant smile he shook his head and kept walking translation zack asked just that i would see him sunday did you pay the bond yeah theyre going to release him in a minute zack took a moment to reevaluate now that he realized shed been kissing her brother that morning not a lover i take it your brother isnt too thrilled to see you tangled up with me and nick she gave zack a long bland look who is muldoon but since thats the court ruling lets go get started get started were going to pick up our charge and youre going to move him into your apartment after spending the better part of a decade sharing close quarters with a couple hundred sailors zack gave one last wistful thought to the dissolution of his privacy right he took rachel by the arm a gesture she tried not to resent i dont suppose youve got any rope in that briefcase of yours it wasnt necessary to tie nick up to gain his cooperation but it was close he sulked he argued he swore by the time theyd walked out of the courthouse to hail a cab zack was biting down on fury and nick had switched his resentment to rachel if this is the best deal you could cut youd better go back to law school ive got rights and the first one is to fire you your privilege lebeck rachel said idly checking her watch youre certainly free to seek other counsel but you cant fire me as your courtappointed guardian were stuck with each other for the next two months thats bull if you and that crazy judge think you can cook up zack made his move first but rachel merely elbowed him out of the way and went toetotoe with nick you listen to me you sorry spoiled sulky little jerk youve got two choices pretending to be a human being for the next eight weeks or going to prison for three years i dont give a damn which way you go but ill tell you this you think youre tough you think youve got all the answers you go inside for a week and with that pretty face of yours the cons will be on you like dogs on fresh meat youd be willing to deal then pal believe me youd be willing to deal that shut him up and rachel had the added satisfaction of seeing his angry flush die to a sickly pallor she gestured when a cab swung to the curb your choice tough guy she said and turned to zack ive got work to do i should be able to clear things up by around seven then ill be by to see how things are going ill keep dinner warm he said with a smirk then caught her hand before she could walk away thanks i mean it she would have shrugged it off his hand was hard as rock calluses over calluses he grinned youre all right counselor for a broad he climbed into the cab behind his brother sent her a quick salute as they pulled away shes right about you being a jerk nick zack said easily but you sure as hell picked a lawyer with firstclass legs nick said nothing but he did sneak a look out the rear window hed noticed rachels legs himself when they arrived at nicks room ten minutes later zack had to swallow another bout of temper it wouldnt do any good to yell at the kid every five minutes but why in the hell had he picked such a neighborhood hoods loitering on street comers drug deals negotiated out in broad daylight hookers already slicked up and stalking their prey he could smell the stench of overripe garbage and unwashed humanity his feet crunched on broken glass as they crossed the heaving sidewalk and entered the scarred and graffitiladen brick building the smells were worse here trapped inside where even the fitful september breeze couldnt reach zack maintained his silence as they climbed up three floors ignoring the shouted arguments behind closed doors and the occasional crash and weeping nick unlocked the door and stepped into a single room furnished with a sagging iron bed a broken dresser and a rickety wooden chair braced with a torn phone book a few heavymetal posters had been tacked to the stained walls in a pitiful attempt to give the room some personality helpless against the rage that geysered inside him zack let loose with a string of curses that turned the stale air blue and what the hell have you been doing with the money i sent home every month when i was at sea with the salary you were supposed to be earning from the delivery job youre living in garbage nick whats worse you chose to live in it not for a second would nick have admitted that most of his money had gone into the cobra treasury nor would he have admitted the shame he felt at having zack see how he lived its none of your damn business he shot back this is my place just like its my life you were never around were you just because you got tired of cruising around on some stupid destroyer doesnt give you the right to come back here and take over ive been back two years zack pointed out wearily and i spent a year of that watching the old man die you didnt bother to come around much did you nick felt a fresh wash of shame and a deep desperate sorrow that he was certain zack could never understand he wasnt my old man zacks head jerked up nicks hands fisted violent temper snapped and sizzled in the room the slightest move would have sparked it into flame slowly effortfully zack forced his body to relax im not going to waste my time telling you he did the best he could how the hell do you know nick tossed back you werent here you got out your way bro i got out mine which brings us full circle pack up what you want and lets go this is my place zack moved so quickly that the snarl caught in nicks throat he was up against the wall zacks big hands holding him in place while his thin body quivered with rage zacks face was so close to his all nick could see were those dark dangerous eyes for the next two months like it or not your place is with me now cut the crap and get some clothes together your free rides over he released nick knowing he had the strength and skill to snap his defiant young brother in half you got ten minutes kid youre working tonight by seven rachel was indulging a fantasy about a steamy bubble bath a glass of crisp white wine and an hour with a good book it helped ease the discomfort of the crowded subway car she braced her feet against the swaying kept her gaze focused on the middle distance there were a few roughlooking characters scattered through the car whom shed assessed and decided to ignore a wino was snoring in the seat behind her his face hidden under a newspaper at her stop she bulled her way out then started up the steps into the wet windy evening hunched in her jacket she fought with her umbrella then slogged the two blocks to lower the boom the beveled glass door was heavy she tugged it open and stepped out of the chill into the warmth sounds and scents of an established neighborhood bar it wasnt the dive shed been expecting but a wide woodpaneled room with a glossy mahogany bar trimmed in brass the stools were burgundy leather and every one was occupied neat tables were set around the room to accommodate more customers there were the scents of whiskey and beer cigarette smoke and grilled onions a jukebox played the blues over the hum of conversation she spotted two waitresses winding their way through the patrons no fishnet stockings and cleavage rachel mused both women were dressed in white slacks with modified sailor tops there was a great deal of laughter and she caught snatches of an argument as to whether the mets still had a chance to make the playoffs zack was in the center of the circular bar drawing a beer for a customer hed exchanged his sweatshirt for a cableknit turtleneck in navy blue oh yes she could see him on the deck of a ship rachel realized braced against the rolling face to the wind the bars nautical theme with its ships bells and anchors suited him she conjured up an image of him in uniform found it entirely too attractive and blinked it away she wasnt the fanciful type she reminded herself she was certainly no romantic above all she was not the kind of woman who walked into a bar and found herself attracted to some landlocked sailor with shaggy hair big shoulders and rough hands the only reason she was here was to uphold the courts ruling however distasteful it might be to be hooked up with zackary muldoon for two months she would do her duty but where was nick would you like a table miss rachel glanced around at a diminutive blonde hefting a large tray laden with sandwiches and beer no thanks ill just go up to the bar is this place always crowded the waitresss gray eyes brightened as she looked around the room is it crowded i didnt notice with a laugh she moved off while rachel walked to the bar she eased her way between two occupied stools rested a foot on the brass rail and waited to catch zacks eye well darling the man on her left had a plump pleasant face he shifted on his stool to get a better look dont think ive seen you in here before no since he looked old enough to be her father rachel granted him a small smile you havent pretty young girl like you shouldnt be here all alone he leaned back his stool creaking dangerously and slapped the man on her other side on the shoulder hey harry we ought to buy this lady a drink harry who continued to sip his beer and work a crossword puzzle in the dim light merely nodded sure thing pete set it up i need a fiveletter word for the possibility of danger or pain rachel glanced up zack was watching her his blue eyes dark and steady his bony face set and unsmiling she felt something hot streak up her spine peril she murmured and fought off a shudder yeah hey thanks pleased harry pushed up his reading glasses and smiled at her first drinks on me whatll you have honey pouillyfume zack set a glass of pale gold wine in front of her and the first ones on the house he lifted a brow that suit you counselor yes she let out the breath she hadnt been aware of holding thank you zack always gets the prettiest ones pete said with a sigh tip me another kid least you can do since you stole my girl he shot rachel a wink that had her relaxing with a smile again and how often does he steal your girls pete once twice a week its humiliating he grinned at zack over a fresh beer old zack did date one of my girls once remember that time you were home on leave zack you took my rosemary to the movies out to coney island shes married and working on her second kid now zack mopped up the bar with a cloth she broke my heart there isnt a female alive whos scratched your heart much less broken it this from the blond waitress who slapped an empty tray on the bar two house wines white a scotch water back and a draft harry you ought to buy yourself one of those little clipon lights before you ruin whats left of your eyes you broke my heart lola zack put some glasses on the tray why do you think i ran off and joined the navy because you knew how good youd look in dress whites she laughed hefted the tray then glanced at rachel you watch out for that one sweetie hes dangerous rachel sipped at her wine and tried to pretend the scents slipping out from the kitchen werent making her stomach rumble have you got a minute she asked zack i need to see where youre living pete let out a hoot and rolled his eyes whats the guy got he wanted to know more than youll ever have zack grinned at him and signaled to another bartender to cover for him i just seem to attract aggressive women cant keep their hands off me rachel finished off her wine before sliding from the stool i can restrain myself if i put my mind to it though it pains me to mar his reputation she said to pete im his brothers lawyer no fooling impressed pete took a closer look you the one who got the kid out of jail for the time being muldoon right this way for the tour he flipped up a section of the bar and stepped through again he took her arm try to keep up you know i dont need you to hold on to me ive been walking on my own for some time he pushed open a heavy swinging door that led to the kitchen i like holding on to you rachel got the impression of gleaming stainless steel and white porcelain the heavy scent of frying potatoes and grilling meat before her attention was absorbed by an enormous man he was dressed all in white and his full apron was splattered and stained because he towered over zack rachel estimated him at halfway to seven feet and a good threefifty if hed played football he would have been the entire defensive line his face was shiny from the kitchen heat and the color of india ink there was a scar running from one coalblack eye down to his massive chin his hamlike hands were delicately building a club sandwich rio this is rachel stanislaski nicks lawyer howdedo she caught the musical cadence of the west indies in his voice got that boy washing dishes like a champ only broke him five or six all night standing at a huge double sink up to the elbows in soapy water nick turned his head and scowled if you call cleaning up someone elses slop a job you can just now dont you be using that language around this lady here rio picked up a cleaver and brought it down with a thwack to cut the sandwich in two then four my mama always said nothing like washing dishes to give a body plenty of time for searching the soul you keep washing and searching boy nick would have liked to have said more oh hed have loved to but it was hard to argue with a sevenfoot man holding a meat cleaver he went back to muttering rio smiled and noted that rachel was eyeing the sandwich how bout i fix you some hot meal you can eat after you finish your business oh i her mouth was watering i really should get home zack hes going to see you home after youre done its too late for a woman to go walking the streets by herself i dont need dish her up some of your chili rio zack suggested as he pulled rachel toward a set of stairs this wont take long rachel found herself trapped hip to hip with him in a narrow staircase he smelled of the sea she realized of that salty slightly electric scent that meant a storm was brewing beyond the horizon its very kind of you to offer muldoon but i dont need a meal or an escort youll get both need them or not he turned effectively trapping her against the wall it felt good to have his body brush hers as good as hed imagined it would i never argue with rio i met him in jamaica about six years ago in a little bar tussle i watched him pick up a twohundredpound man and toss him through a wall now rios mostly a peaceful sort of man but if you get him riled theres no telling what he might do zack lifted a hand and wound a lock of rachels hair around his finger your hairs wet she slapped his hand away and tried to pretend her heart wasnt slamming in her throat its raining yeah i can smell it on you you sure are something to look at rachel she couldnt move forward couldnt move back so she did the only thing open to her she bristled like a cornered cat youre in my way muldoon my advice is to move your butt and save the irish charm for someone wholl appreciate it in a minute was that russian you yelled after your brother today ukrainian she said between her teeth ukrainian he considered that and her i never made it to the soviet union she lifted a brow neither have i now can we save this discussion until after ive seen the living arrangements all right he started up the steps again his hand on the small of her back its not much but i can guarantee its a large step up from the dump nick was living in i dont know why he he cut himself off and shrugged well its done rachel had a feeling it was just beginning chapter three contents prev next though it brought on all manner of headaches rachel took her new charge seriously she could handle the inconvenience the extra time sliced out of her personal life nicks surly and continued resentment what gave her the most trouble was the enforced proximity with zackary muldoon she couldnt dismiss him and she couldnt work around him having to deal with him on what was essentially a daytoday basis was sending her stress level through the roof if only she could pigeonhole him she thought as she walked from the subway to her apartment after a sunday dinner with her family it would somehow make things easier but after nearly a week of trying she hadnt even come close he was rough impatient and she suspected potentially violent yet he was concerned enough about his stepbrother to shell out money and much more vital time and energy to set the boy straight in his off hours he dressed in clothes more suited to the rag basket than his tall muscled frame yet when shed walked through his apartment over the bar shed found everything neat as a pin he was always putting his hands on her her arm her hair her shoulder but he had yet to make the kind of move she was forever braced to repel he fluted with his female customers but as far as rachel had been able to glean it stopped at flirtation hed never been married and though hed left his family for months even years at a time hed given up the sea and had landlocked himself when his father became too ill to care for himself he irritated her on principle but on some deeper darker level the very things about him that irritated her fanned little flames in her gut that rachel could only describe as pure lust shed tried to cool them by reminding herself that she wasnt the lusty type passionate yes when it came to her work her family and her ambitions but men though she enjoyed their companionship and their basic maleness had never been at the top of her list of priorities sex was even lower than that and it was very annoying to find herself itchy so who was zackary muldoon and would she be better off not knowing when he stepped out of the shadows into the glow of a streetlight she jolted and choked back a scream where the hell have you been i damn it you scared me to death she brought a trembling hand back out of her purse where it had shot automatically toward a bottle of mace oh she hated to be frightened detested having to admit she could be vulnerable what are you doing lurking out here in front of my building looking for you dont you ever stay home muldoon with me its party party party she stalked up the steps and jammed her key in the outer door what do you want nick took off she stopped halfway through the door and he bumped solidly into her what do you mean took off i mean he slipped out of the kitchen sometime this afternoon when rio wasnt looking i cant find him he was so furious with nick with rachel with himself that it took all of his control not to punch his fist through the wall ive been at it almost five hours and i cant find him all right dont panic her mind was already clicking ahead as she walked through the tiny lobby to the single gatefronted elevator its early just ten oclock he knows his way around thats the trouble disgusted with himself zack stepped in the car with her he knows his way around too well the rule was hed tell me when he was going and where ive got to figure hes hanging out with the cobras nicks not going to break that kind of tie overnight rachel continued to think as the elevator creaked its way up to the fourth floor we can drive ourselves crazy running around the city trying to hunt him down or we can call in the cavalry the cavalry she shoved the gate open and walked into the hallway alex no cops zack said quickly grabbing her arms im not setting the cops on him alex isnt just a cop hes my brother struggling to hold on to her own patience she pried his fingers from her arms and im an officer of the court zack if nicks breaking the provisions i cant ignore it im not going to see him tossed back in a cell barely a week after i got him out we got him out she corrected then unlocked her door if you didnt want my help and advice you shouldnt have come zack shrugged and stepped inside i guess i figured we could go out looking together the room was hardly bigger than the one nick had rented but it was all female not flouncy zack thought rachel wouldnt go for flounce there were vivid colors in the plump pillows tossed over a lowarmed sofa the scented candles were burned down to various lengths and mums were just starting to fade in a china vase there was a huge bronzeframed oval mirror on one wall its glass needed resilvering a threefoot sculpture in cool white marble dominated one corner it reminded zack of a mermaid rising up out of the sea there were smaller sculptures as well all of them passionate some of them bordering on the ferocious a timber wolf rearing out of a slab of oak twisted fingers of bronze and copper that looked like a fire just out of control a smooth and sinuous malachite cobra ready to strike there were shelves of books and dozens of framed photographs and there was the unmistakable scent of woman zack felt uncharacteristically awkward and clumsy and completely out of place he stuck his hands in his pockets certain hed knock over one of those slender tapers his mother had liked candles he remembered candles and flowers and blue china bowls ill make coffee rachel tossed her purse aside and walked into the adjoining kitchen yeah good restless zack roamed the room checked out the view through the cheerful striped curtains frowned over the photographs that were obviously of her family paced back to the sofa i dont know what im doing what makes me think i can play daddy to a kid nicks age i wasnt around for half his life he hates me hes got a right youve been doing fine rachel countered taking out cups and saucers youre not playing daddy youre being his brother if you werent around for half his life its because you had a life of your own and he doesnt hate you hes angry and full of resentment which is a long way from hate which he wouldnt have any right to now stop feeling sorry for yourself and get out the milk is that how you crossexamine not sure whether he was amused or annoyed zack opened the refrigerator no im much tougher than that in court i bet he shook his head at the contents of her refrigerator yogurt a package of bologna another of cheese several diet soft drinks a jug of white wine two eggs and half a stick of butter youre out of milk she swore then sighed so we drink it black did you and nick have a fight no i mean no more than usual he snarls i snarl back he swears i swear louder but we actually had what could pass for a conversation last night then watched an old movie on the tube after the bar closed ah progress she handed him his coffee in a dainty cup and saucer that felt like a childs tea set in his hands we get a lot of families in for lunch on sundays zack ignored the china handle and wrapped his fingers around the bowl of the cup he was down in thekitchen at noon i figured he might like to knock off early you know take some time for himself i went into the kitchen around four rio didnt want to rat on him so hed been covering for him for an hour or so i hoped hed just taken a breather but then i went out looking zack finished off the coffee then helped himself to more ive been pretty hard on him the last few days it seemed like the best way on my first ship my co was a regular captain bligh i hated the bastard until i realized hed turned us into a crew zack grinned a little hell i still hated him but i never forgot him stop beating yourself up she couldnt prevent herself from reaching out touching his arm it isnt as if you hanged him from the yardarm or whatever now sit down and try to relax let me talk to alex he did sit though he wasnt happy about it because he felt like an idiot trying to balance the delicate saucer on his knee he set it down on the table there wasnt an ashtray in sight so he clamped down on the urge for a cigarette he paid little attention to rachel until her voice rose in frustration then he smiled a little she was certainly full of fire punching out requests and orders with the aplomb of a seasoned seaman lord hed gotten so he looked forward to hearing that throaty impatient voice how many times over the past few days had he made up excuses to call her too many he admitted something about the lady had hooked him and zack wasnt sure whether he wanted to pry himself loose or be reeled in and the last thing he should be doing now was thinking of his libido he reminded himself he had to think about nick obviously rachels brother was resisting but she wasnt taking no for an answer when she switched to heated ukrainian zack reached over to toy with the spitting cobra in the center of the coffee table it drove him crazy when she talked in ukrainian tak she said satisfied that shed worn alex down i owe you one alexi she laughed a rich and fullblooded laugh that sent heat straight to zacks midsection all right all right so ill owe you two zack watched her hang up and cross long legs covered in a huntergreen material that was silky enough to whisper seductively when her thighs brushed together alex and his partner are going to cruise around check out some of the cobras known haunts theyll let us know if they see him so we wait we wait she rose and took a fresh legal pad from a drawer to pass the time you can fill me in a little more on nicks background you said his mother died when he was about fifteen what about his father his mother wasnt married before zack reached automatically for a cigarette then remembered recognizing the gesture rachel rose again and found a chipped ashtray thanks relieved he lit a cigarette cupping his fingers around the tip out of habit nadine was about eighteen when she got pregnant and the guy wasnt interested in family he took off and left her to fend for herself so she had nick and did what she could one day she came into the bar looking for work dad hired her how old was nick four or five nadine was barely making ends meet sometimes she couldnt get a sitter for him so dad told her to bring the kid along and id watch him he was okay zack said with a half smile i mean he was real quiet most of the time hed just watch you like he was expecting to get dumped on but he was smart hed just started school but he could already read and he could print some too anyway a couple months later nadine and my father got married dad was about twenty years older than she was but i guess they were both lonely my motherd been dead for more than ten years nadine and the kid moved in how did you how did nick adjust it seemed okay hell i was a kid myself restless again he rose to pace nadine bent over backward trying to please everyone thats the way she was my father he wasnt always easy you know and he put a lot of time into the bar we werent a norman rockwell kind of family but we did okay he glanced back at her photographs surprised at the quick twinge of envy i didnt mind the kid hanging around me much then i joined the navy right out of high school it was kind of a family tradition when nadine died it was hard on nick hard on my father i guess you could say they took it out on each other is that when nick started to get into trouble id say he got into his share before that but it got worse whenever id get back my father would be full of complaints the boy wouldnt do this he did that he was hanging around with punks he was looking for trouble and nick would skulk off or slam out if i said anything hed tell me to kiss his he shrugged you get the picture she thought she did a young boy unwanted by his father he begins to admire his new brother and then feels deserted by him as well he loses his mother and finds himself alone with a man old enough to be his grandfather a man who couldnt relate to him nothing permanent in his life except rejection im not a psychologist zack but id say he needs time to trust that you mean to stay part of his life this time around and i dont think taking a firm hand is wrong in fact i think thats just what hed understand from you and respect in the long run maybe that just needs to be balanced a bit she sighed and set her notes aside which is where i come in so far ive been just as rough on him lets try a little goodcopbadcop ill be the sympathetic ear believe me i understand hotheads and bad boys i grew up with them we can start by the phone rang and she snagged it hello uhhuh good thats good thanks alex she could see the relief in zacks eyes before she hung up they spotted him on his way back to the bar relief sparked quickly into anger when i get my hands on him youll ask in a very reasonable fashion where he was rachel told him and to make certain you do im going with you nick let himself into zacks apartment he figured hed been pretty clever hed managed to slip in and out of the kitchen without setting off rios radar the way they were watching him around here he thought he might as well be doing time everything was going wrong anyway he ducked into the kitchen and since zack wasnt around to say any different opened a beer hed just wanted to check in with the guys see what was happening on the street and theyd treated him like an outsider they didnt trust him nick thought resentfully as he swigged one long swallow then two reece had decided that since hed gotten out so quickly he must have ratted he thought hed convinced most of the gang that he was clean but when hed spilled the whole story from how hed been caught to how hed ended up washing dishes in zacks bar theyd laughed at him it hadnt been the good communal laughter hed shared with the cobras in the past it had been snide and nasty with tj giggling like a fool and reece smirking and playing with his switchblade only cash had been the least bit sympathetic saying how it was a raw deal not one of them had bothered to explain why theyd left him hanging when the cop showed up when hed left them hed gone by marias place theyd been seeing each other steadily for the past couple of months and hed been sure hed find a sympathetic ear and a nice warm body but shed been out with somebody else looked as though hed been dumped again all around nothing new nick told himself but the sting of rejection wasnt any easier to take this time damn it they were supposed to be his family they were supposed to stick up for him stand by him not shake him loose at the first hint of trouble he wouldnt have done it to them he told himself and heaved the empty beer bottle into the trash where it smashed satisfactorily no by god he wouldnt have done it to them when he heard the door open he set his face into bored lines and sauntered out of the kitchen hed expected zack but he hadnt expected rachel nick felt a heat that was embarrassment and something more try to creep up into his cheeks zack peeled off his jacket hoping he had a firm grip on his temper i guess youve got a good reason why you skipped out this afternoon i wanted some air nick pulled out a cigarette struck a match there a law against it we had an agreement zack said evenly you were supposed to check with me before you went out and tell me your plans no man you had an agreement last i looked it was a free country and people could go for a walk when they felt like it he gestured toward rachel you bring the lawyer to sue me or what listen kid im not a kid nick shot back you came and went as you damn well pleased when you were my age i wasnt a thief at your age incensed zack took two steps forward rachel snagged his arm why dont you go down and get me a glass of wine muldoon the kind you served me the other night will do just fine when he tried to shake her off she tightened her grip i want a moment alone with my client so take your time fine he bit off the word before he stalked to the door whatever she says pal youre on double kp next week and if you try to sneak off again ill have rio chain you to the sink he gave himself the sweet satisfaction of slamming the door nick took another puff on his cigarette and dropped onto the couch big talk he muttered hes always figured he could boss me around ive been on my own for years and its time he got that straight rachel sat down beside him she didnt bother to mention that she could smell the beer on his breath and he was underage why hadnt zack seen the raw need in nicks eyes why hadnt she seen it before its tough having to move in here after having a place of your own her voice was mild and without censure nick squinted through the smoke yeah he said cautiously i can hack it for a couple of months i guess when i first moved out i was a little older than you not much i was excited and scared and lonely i wouldnt have admitted to lonely if my life had depended on it ive got two older brothers they checked up on me constantly she laughed a little nick didnt crack a smile it infuriated me and it made me feel safe they still get on my back but i can usually find a way around them nick stared hard at the tip of his cigarette hes not my real brother oh lord he looked young she thought and so terribly sad i suppose that would depend on your definition of real she laid a hand on his knee prepared for him to shrug her off but he only switched his gaze from his cigarette to her fingers itd be easier for you to believe he doesnt care but youre not stupid nick there was a hot ball in his throat that he refused to believe was tears why should he care im nothing to him if he didnt care he wouldnt yell at you so much take it from me i come from a family where a raised voice is a sign of unswerving love he wants to look out for you i can look out for myself and have been she agreed but most of us can use a hand now and again he wont thank me for telling you all this but i think you should know she waited until he raised his eyes again hes had to take out a loan to pay for the stolen property and the damages thats bull nick shot back appalled did he lay that trip on you no i checked on it myself it seems old mr muldoons illness drained quite a bit of his savings and zacks zacks gotten the bar back on a pretty solid footing again but he didnt have enough to swing the costs a man doesnt put himself out like that for someone he doesnt care about the sick feeling in nicks gut had him crushing out the cigarette he just feels obligated thats all maybe either way it seems to me you owe him something nick at least you owe him a little cooperation over the next few weeks he was scared when he came looking for me tonight you probably dont want to believe that either zacks never been scared of anything he didnt come right out and say it but i think he believed youd taken off for good that he wasnt going to see you again where the hell would i go he demanded theres nobody he broke off ashamed to admit there was no one to go to we made a deal he muttered im not going to skip im glad to hear it and im not going to ask you where you went she added with a faint smile if i did id have to put it in my report to judge beckett and id rather not so well just say you went out for some air lost track of the time maybe the next time you feel like youve got to get out you could call me why because i know how it feels when you need to break loose he looked so lost that rachel skimmed a hand through his hair brushing it back from his face lighten up nick its not a crime to be friends with your lawyer either so what do you say you give me a break and try a little harder to get along with zack and ill do what i can to keep him off your back i know all kinds of tricks for handling nosy older brothers her scent was clouding his senses he didnt know why he hadnt noticed before how beautiful her eyes were how deep and wide and soft maybe you and i could go out sometime sure she saw the suggestiononly as a breakthrough in trust and she smiled rios a terrific cook but once in a while you just got to have pizza right yeah so i can call you absolutely she gave his hand a quick squeeze when his hand tightened over hers she was only mildly surprised before she could comment zack was pushing the door open again nick jumped up as if he were on a string zack passed rachel her wine then handed nick the gingerale bottle he had hooked under one finger taking his time he twisted off the top of the beer he had hooked under another so did you two finish your consultation for now rachel sipped her wine and lifted a brow at nick it wasnt easy especially after what shed told him zack had done but nick met his brothers eyes im sorry i took off the surprise was so great that zack had to swallow quickly or choke on his beer okay we can work out a schedule so you can have more free time what the hell did he do now uhrio could use some help swabbing down the kitchen things usually break up early on sunday nights sure no problem nick started for the door see you rachel when the door closed zack dropped down beside her shaking his head whatd you do hypnotize him not exactly well what the hell did you say to him she sighed tremendously pleased with herself and settled back thats privileged information he just needs someone to stroke his bruised ego now and again you two may not be biological brothers but your temperaments very similar oh he settled back as well swinging an arm around the top of the couch so that he could play with her hair hows that youre both hotheaded and stubborn which is easy for me to recognize as i come from a long line of the same enjoying the wine and the quiet she let her eyes close you dont like to admit you made a mistake and youd rather punch your way out of a problem than reason it through are you trying to say those are faults she had to laugh well just call them personality traits my family is ripe with passionate natures and what a passionate nature requires is an outlet my sister natasha had dance then her own business and her family my brother mikhail has his art alexi has his quest to right wrongs and i have the law as i see it you had the navy and now this bar nick hasnt found his yet he brushed a finger lightly over the nape of her neck felt the quick quiver that ran through her do you really consider the law enough of an outlet for passion the way i play it she opened her eyes but the smile that had started to curve her lips died away hed shifted and his face was close much too close and his hands had slipped down to her shoulders the warning bell that rang in her brain had come too late ive got to get home she said quickly ive got a nineoclock hearing ill take you in a minute i know the way muldoon ill take you he said again and something in his tone made it quite clear that he wasnt talking about walking her to her door he tugged the wineglass out of her hand and set it aside we were talking about passionate natures his fingers skimmed up through her hair fisted in it and outlets in an automatic defensive gesture her hand slammed against his chest but he continued to draw her closer i came here to help you muldoon she reminded him as his mouth hovered dangerously above hers not to play games just testing your theory counselor he nipped lightly at her lower lip once twice when that teasing sample stirred the juices he crushed his mouth to hers and devoured she could stop him of course she would stop him rachel told herself she knew how to defend herself against unwanted advances the trouble was she hadnt a clue as to how to defend herself against advances she didnt want to want his mouth was so avid so impatient so greedy she wondered if he would swallow her whole he used lips and tongue and teeth devastatingly if there was an instant some fraction of a heartbeat when she could have resisted it passed unnoticed and she was swamped by the hot wave that was his need or hers or what they made together on one long throaty moan she went under for the third time dragging him with her hed been prepared for her to slap or scratch and he would have accepted it would have forced himself to be satisfied with that quick tempting taste he was a man with large appetites but he had never been one to take what wasnt offered willingly she didnt offer she exploded in that blink of time before his mouth covered hers hed seen the fire come into her eyes that dark liquid fire that equaled passion when the kiss had gone from teasing to fevered she had answered pulling him far deeper into that hot well of desires than hed intended to go and that moan it sprinted along his spine that glorious feline sound that was both surrender and demand even as it died away she was wrapping herself around him pressing that incredibly lean and limber body against his in a way that had a chain of explosions rioting through his system she heard his breathy oath felt the long cushions of the couch press into her back as he shifted her for one wild moment all she could think was yes this was what she wanted this wild flurry of sensations this crazed mindless mating of flesh as his mouth raced down to savage her throat she arched against him craving the possession then he said her name groaned it the shock of hearing it ripped her back to reality she was grappling on a couch in a strange apartment with a man she barely knew no his hands were moving over her and they nearly dragged her back into the whirlwind desperate to pull away she shoved and struggled stop i said no he couldnt get his breath if someone had held a gun to his head he wouldnt have moved but the no stopped him he managed to lift his head and the reckless light in his eyes had her fighting against a shudder why because this is insane god she could still taste him on her lips and the churning for more of him was making her crazy get off me he could have strangled her for making him want to beg your call lady because his hands were unsteady he balled them into fists i thought you said you didnt play games she was humiliated furious and frustrated beyond belief as she saw it the best disguise was fullblown anger i dont youre the one who pushed yourself on me the simple fact is im not interested i guess thats why you were kissing me so hard my teeth are loose you kissed me she jabbed a finger at him and youre so damn big i couldnt stop you a simple no did he reminded her and lit a cigarette lets keep it honest counselor i wanted to kiss you ive been wanting to do that and more ever since i saw you sitting like a queen in that grubby station house now maybe you didnt feel the same way but when i kissed you you kissed me right back sometimes retreat was the best defense rachel snatched up her purse and jacket its done so theres nothing more to discuss wrong he was up and blocking her path we can finish discussing it while i take you home i dont want you to take me home im not having you take me home eyes blazing she swung her jacket over her shoulders and if you insist on following me there ill have you arrested for harassment he merely grabbed her by the arm try it she did something she wished shed done the first time she laid eyes on him she punched him in the stomach he let out a little whoosh of air and his eyes narrowed first ones free now we can walk to the subway or i can carry you there whats wrong with you she shouted cant you take no for an answer his response was to shove her back against the door and kiss the breath out of her if i didnt he said between his teeth we wouldnt be walking out of here right now when youve got me so wound up im going to have to live in a cold shower for the next week he yanked open the door now are you going to walk or are you going to ride over my shoulder she stuck out her chin and sailed past him shed walk all right but shed be damned if shed speak to him chapter four contents prev next at the end of a harried tenhour day rachel walked out of the courthouse she should have been feeling great her last client was certainly happy with the nonguilty verdict shed gotten for him but this time the victory hadnt managed to lift her spirits the only solution she could see was to pick up a quart of ice cream on the way home and gorge herself into a sugar coma it usually worked and since as a lawabiding citizen she couldnt relieve her tension by striding into lower the boom and shooting zackary muldoon through his thick skull it was the safest alternative she almost tripped over her own feet when she saw him rise from his perch at the bottom of the steps counselor he reached out a hand when she teetered steady as she goes what now she demanded jerking away doesnt it occur to you that even though ive been appointed by the court as nicks coguardian im entitled to an hour of personal time without you in my face he studied that face noting signs of fatigue as well as temper in those big tawny eyes you know honey i figured youd be in a better mood after winning a case like you just did lets try these with a flourish he brought his other hand from behind his back it was filled with gold bronze and rustcolored mums refusing to be charmed rachel gave them one long suspicious glare what are those for to replace the ones that are dying in your apartment when she made no move to take them he bit down on his impatience hed come to apologize damn it and it looked as though she was going to make him go through with it okay im sorry i got pushy the other night and after i got over wanting to choke you i realized youd gone out of your way to do me a favor and id repaid it by furious all over again he thrust the flowers at her hell lady all i did was kiss you all he did she thought tempted to toss the flowers down and grind them underfoot just kissing didnt jangle a womans system for better than thirtysix hours why dont you take your flowers and your charming apology and hold on he thought it better to stop her before she said something hed regret i said i was sorry and i meant it but maybe i should be more specific to ensure that shed stay put until he was finished he wrapped his fingers around the lapel of her plumcolored jacket im not sorry i kissed you any more than im going to be sorry the next time i kiss you i am sorry for the way i acted after you put on the brakes she lifted a brow the way you acted she repeated you mean like a jerk it gave her a great deal of pleasure to see a muscle twitch in his jaw okay a smart attorney knew when to accept a compromise lips pursed she studied the flowers are these a bribe muldoon the way she said his name with just a hint of a sneer told him hed gotten over the first hurdle yeah all right ill take them gee thanks now that his hands were free he tucked his thumbs in his front pockets i slipped in the courtroom about an hour ago and watched you oh she couldnt tell him how glad she was she hadnt seen him and not bad turning a vandalism charge around on the other guy the plaintiff she explained my client was justifiably frustrated after hed exhausted all reasonable attempts to have his landlord live up to the terms of his lease and spray painting the landlord from hell all over the guys brownstone on the upper west side was his way of relieving that frustration he certainly made his point my client had paid his rent on time and in good faith and the landlord consistently refused to acknowledge each and every request for repair and maintenance under the terms of the lease hey babe zack raised a hand palm out you dont have to sell me by the time you got through i was pulling for him there were murmurs in the visitors gallery about lynching the landlord his mouth was sober enough but his eyes danced with humor the contrast was all but irresistible her smile was quick and wicked i love justice reaching out he toyed with the tiny gold links circling her neck maybe youd like to celebrate your victory for the underdog want to go for a walk mistake the word popped fullblown into her mind but she could smell the spicy flowers and the evening was beautifully balmy i guess i would as long as its to my apartment i should put these in water let me take that hed tugged the briefcase out of her hand before she could object then she should have expected it he took her arm what do you carry in here bricks the laws a weighty business muldoon his grip on her forced her to slow her pace to his he strolled when she would have strode so hows it going with nick its better at least i think its better he balked at the idea of rio teaching him to cook but the idea of busing tables didnt seem to bother him much he still wont talk to me i mean really talk to me but its only been a week youve got seven more yeah he let go of her arm long enough to reach into his pocket and take out a handful of change he dropped it into a panhandlers cup in a gesture so automatic that rachel assumed he made a habit of it i figure if they could turn me from a green recruit into a sailor in about the same amount of time i have a pretty good shot at this do you miss it she tilted her head up to his being at sea not so much anymore sometimes i still wake up at night and think im aboard ship then there were the nightmares but that wasnt something a man shared with a woman once things are stable im planning on buying a boat maybe taking a couple of months and sailing down to the islands maybe a nice ketch fortytwo feet not too fancy he could already see it a trim little honey quick to the touch brass and mahogany gleaming white sails bulging in the wind he imagined rachel would look just fine standing at the bow you ever done any sailing not unless you count taking the ferry over to liberty island youd like it he skimmed his fingers lightly down her arm its what you might call an outlet rachel decided it was safer not to comment when they reached her building she turned to him holding out a hand for her briefcase thanks for the flowers and the walk ill probably come by the bar tomorrow after work and look in on nick instead of giving her the briefcase he closed his hand over hers i took the night off rachel i want to spend it with you her quick jolt of alarm both pleased and amused him excuse me maybe i should rephrase that id like to spend the night with you several nights running in fact but ill settle for the evening he managed to wind a lock of her hair around his finger before she remembered to bat his hand away some food some music i know a place that does both really well if the idea of a date makes you nervous im not nervous not exactly she thought anyway we can consider it a few hours between two people who have a mutual interest it couldnt hurt if we got to know each other a little better he pulled out his trump card for nicks sake she studied him much as she had the witness shed so ruthlessly crossexamined earlier you want to spend the evening with me for nicks sake giving up he grinned hell no theres bound to be some spillover benefit there but i want to spend the evening with you for purely selfish reasons i see well since you didnt perjure yourself i may be able to cut a deal it has to be an early evening somewhere i can dress comfortably and you wont how had he phrased it get pushy youre a tough one counselor you got it deal he said and gave her the briefcase fine come back in twenty minutes ill be ready a bar rachel thought a half hour later she should have known zack would spend his night off on a busmans holiday actually she supposed it was more of a club there was a threepiece band playing the blues on a small raised stage and there were a handful of couples dancing on a tiny square of floor surrounded by tables from the way he was greeted by the waitress he was obviously no stranger within moments they were settled at a table in a shadowy corner with a glass of wine for her and a mug of beer for him i come for the music he explained but the foods good too thats not something i mention to rio since ive seen the way he slices a club sandwich i cant hold that against you she squinted at the tiny menu what do you recommend trust me his thigh brushed hers as he shifted closer to toy with the stones dangling at her ear he smiled at her narrowed eyes and try the grilled chicken she discovered he could be trusted at least when it came to food enjoying every bite lulled by the music she began to relax you said the navy was a family tradition is that why you joined really i wanted to get out he nursed a second beer appreciating the way she plowed through the meal hed always been attracted to a woman with an appetite i wanted to see the world i only figured on the four years but then i reupped why i got used to being part of a crew and i liked the life looking out and seeing nothing but water or watching the land pull away when you headed out coming into port and seeing a place youd never seen before in nearly ten years i imagine you saw a lot of places the mediterranean the south pacific the indian ocean the persian gulf froze my fingers off in the north atlantic and watched sharks feed in the coral sea both fascinated and amused she propped her elbows on the table did you know you didnt mention one land mass doesnt one body of water look pretty much like another from the deck of a ship no he didnt think he could explain knew he wasnt lyrical enough to describe the varying hues of the water the subtle degrees of the power of the deep what it felt like to watch dolphins run or whales sound i guess you could say that a body of water has its own personality just like a body of land does you do miss it it gets in your blood how about you is the law a stanislaski family tradition no under the table her foot began to tap to the beat of the bass my fathers a carpenter so was his father why law because id grown up in a family whod known oppression they escaped ukraine with what they could carry in a wagon in the winter through the mountains eventually reaching austria i was born here the first of my family to be born here it sounds as though you regret it he was astute she decided more astute than shed given him credit for i suppose i regret not being a part of both sides they havent forgotten what it was like to taste freedom for the first time ive never known anything but freedom freedom and justice go hand in hand some might say you could be serving justice in a nice cushy law firm some might you had offers when her brows lifted he shrugged youre representing my brother i checked on you graduated top of your class at nycc passed the bar first shot then turned down three very lucrative offers from three very prestigious firms to work for peanuts as a public defender i had to figure either you were crazy or dedicated she swallowed a little bubble of temper and nodded and you left the navy with a chestful of medals including the silver star your file includes along with a few reprimands for insubordination a personal letter of gratitude from an admiral for your courage during a rescue at sea in a hurricane enjoying his squirm of embarrassment she lifted her glass in toast i checked too we were talking about you he began no you were smiling she cupped her chin on her hand so tell me muldoon why did you turn down a shot at officer candidate school didnt want to be a damn officer he muttered rising he grabbed her hand and hauled her to her feet lets dance she chuckled as he dragged her onto the crowded dance floor youre blushing i am not and shut up rachel tucked her tongue in her cheek it must be hell being a hero heres the deal zack held her lightly by the arms on the edge of the dance floor you drop the stuff about medals and admirals and i wont mention that you were class valedictorian she thought it over fair enough but i think he pulled her into his arms stop thinking it did the trick all right the moment she found herself pressed hard against him her mind clicked off she could still hear the music the low seductive alto sax the pulse of the bass the slow rhythms of the piano notes but rational thought vanished they werent dancing rachel was certain no one would call this lockedhard swaying embrace a dance but it would be foolish to try to pull away when there was so little room breathing wasnt all that important after all not when you could feel your own heart slamming against your ribs she hadnt intended to wind her arms quite so firmly around his neck but now that they were there there seemed little point in moving them besides if she skimmed her fingers up just a bit they could trail through his hair so that she could discover how fascinating that silky contrast was compared to the rockhard body molded to hers you fit he bent his head so that his mouth was against her ear i was a little too wound up to be sure the other night but i thought you would the subtle movements of his lips against her skin had her shivering before she could prevent it what fit he said again letting his hands follow those curvy lines down to her hips and back again thats only because im standing on my toes honey height doesnt have a thing to do with it he rubbed his cheek against her hair filling himself with the scent the texture you feel right you smell right you taste right shaken she turned her head before his mouth could finish its journey down the side of her face i could have you arrested for trying to seduce me in a public place thats all right i know a good lawyer he trailed his fingers under the back of her soft wool sweater to the heated skin beneath her breath caught then released unsteadily theyll have us both arrested ill post bail there was nothing but rachel under the sweater he was sure of it his mouth went dry as dust i want you alone biting off a groan he dipped his head to press his lips to her neck do you know what id do to you right now if i had you alone she shook her swimming head we should sit down we shouldnt do this i want to touch you every inch of you and taste you i want to make you crazy he already was if she didnt manage to slow things down her overcharged system was likely to explode two steps back she said on a long breath and took just that his hands remained at her waist but at least she could breathe again at least she managed two gulps of air before she looked into his eyes and the breath backed up in her lungs again too much too fast muldoon im not a spontaneous type of person what she was was a volcano ready to erupt he was damn sure going to be there when the ground started to shake but he didnt intend to scare her off either hey you want time i can give you an hour two if you really want me to suffer she shook her head edging back to the table lets just say ill let you know if and when im ready to take this any further she wants me to suffer zack said under his breath when she didnt sit he reached for his wallet i take it were leaving an early evening she reminded him and she wanted badly to get outside where the air could cool her blood a deals a deal he tossed bills onto the table why dont we walk back a little exercise might help us both sleep tonight a twentyblock hike rachel mused it couldnt hurt cold he asked a short time later no its nice but he slipped an arm around her shoulders anyway i dont often get a chance to just walk mostly its a dash from my place to the office from the office to the courthouse what do you do when youre not dashing oh i go to the movies windowshop visit the family in fact i was thinking it might be good for nick to go with me one sunday have some of mamas home cooking listen to one of papas stories see how my brothers harass me just nick she slanted him a look i suppose we could make room for nicks brother its been a long time since i since either of us had a family meal how about the cop i cant see him piping us aboard ill handle alex now that shed suggested it her mind began to turn quickly you know natasha and her family are due to visit in a couple of weeks things will be crowded and crazy it might be the perfect opportunity to toss nick into your notsoaveragefamily type of situation ill see what i can work out i know i thanked you before but i dont think i know how to tell you how much i appreciate what youre doing for him the court thats bilge rachel they reached the steps of her building and he turned her to face him youre not just filing weekly reports or representing a client you put yourself out for nick right from the start okay so ive got a weak spot for bad boys dont let it get around no what youve got is class and a good heart he liked the way she looked in the shadowy light the vitality that pulsed from her like breath the snap of energy and embarrassment in her eyes its a tough combination to beat she shrugged under his hands now youre going to make me blush muldoon so lets not get sloppy if things work out the way we want you can buy me more flowers at the end of the two months well call it square he let her back up one step but then held her firm she was uneasy but she wasnt surprised listen its been nice but i dont figure youre going to ask me in no she said definitely remembering how her body had reacted to him in a crowded club im not so ill just have to take care of this out here zack you know im not going to let you go without kissing you rachel to tease them both he skimmed his lips over her jaw especially when i only have to touch you to know all the wants not on my side this is never going to work she murmured but her arms were already sliding around him sure it will we just put our lips together and what happens happens this time she knew what to expect and braced it made no difference at all the same heat the same rush the same power the same reckless unrelenting need had she said it was too much no it wasnt enough she was afraid she could never get enough how could she have lived her entire life without knowing what it was to be truly needy im not getting involved this way she murmured against his mouth not with you not with anyone okay fine ruthlessly he dragged her head back and plundered a flash fire erupted between them until he felt singed down to the bone he all but whimpered when she nipped impatiently at his lower lip images began to cartwheel in his head him scooping her up and carrying her inside falling with her into a big soft bed making love with her on some white deserted beach with the sun beating down on her naked golden skin waves pounding against the shore as she cried out his name hey buddy the voice behind him was nothing more than an irritating buzzing in his head zack would cheerfully have ignored it but he felt the slight prick of a knife at his back keeping rachel behind him he turned and looked into the pale sootyeyed face of the mugger how about i let you keep the babe and you hand over your wallet hers too the mugger turned the knife so that the backwash of the streetlight caught the steel and lets make it fast blocking rachel with his body zack reached in his back pocket he could hear rachels unsteady breathing as she unzipped her bag it wasnt impulse but instinct the moment the muggers eyes shifted zack lunged with a scream in her throat and the mace in her hand rachel watched them struggle she saw the knife flash heard the awful crunch of fist against bone before the blade clattered to the sidewalk then the mugger was racing off into the dark and she and zack were as alone as theyd been seconds before he turned back to her she noted that he wasnt even breathing hard and that the gleam in his eyes had only sharpened where were we you idiot the words were little more than a whisper as she fought to get them out over the lump of fear in her throat dont you know any better than to jump someone holding a knife he could have killed you i didnt feel like losing my wallet he glanced down at the can in her hand whats that mace disgusted by the fact she hadnt even popped off the safety top she dropped it back in her purse id have given him a faceful if you hadnt gotten in the way next time ill step aside and let you handle it he frowned down at the trickle of blood on his wrist and swore without much heat i guess he nicked me she went pale as water youre bleeding i thought it was his annoyed more than hurt he poked a finger through the rip in the arm of his sweater i got this on corfu my last time through damn it eyes narrowed he stared down the street wondering if he had a chance of catching up with the mugger and taking the price of the sweater if not its sentimental value out of his hide let me see her fingers trembled as she pushed the sleeve up to examine the long shallow slash idiot she said again and began to fumble in her purse for her keys youll have to come inside and let me fix it i cant believe you did something so stupid it was the principle he began but she cut him off with a stream of ukrainian as she stabbed her key at the lock english he said pressing a hand to his stomach as it began to knot use english you dont know what it does to me when you talk in russian its not russian snatching his good arm she pulled him inside you were just showing off thats all oh its just like a man still pulling him she stalked into the elevator sorry he was fighting off a grin trying to look humble i dont know what got into me he certainly wasnt going to admit hed had worse scratches shaving testosterone she said between her teeth you cant help it she kept her hand on him until shed gotten them inside her apartment sit she ordered and dashed into the bathroom he sat making himself at home by propping his feet on her coffee table maybe i should have a brandy he called out in case im going into shock she hurried back out with bandages and a small bowl of soapy water do you feel sick scared all over again she pressed a hand to his brow are you dizzy lets see always willing to take advantage of an opportunity he grabbed a fistful of her hair and pulled her mouth to his yeah he said when he let her go you could say im feeling a little lightheaded fool she slapped his hand aside then sat down to clean the wound this could have been serious it was serious he told her i hate having someone poke me in the back with a knife when im kissing a woman honey if you dont stop shaking im going to have to get you a brandy im not shaking or if i am its just because im mad she tossed her hair back and glared at him dont you ever do that again aye aye sir to pay him back for the smirk she dumped iodine over the wound when he swore it was her turn to smile baby she said accusingly but then took pity on him and blew the heat away now hold still while i put a bandage on it he watched her work it was very pleasant to feel her fingers on his skin it seemed only natural that he should lean over to nibble at her ear fire streaked straight up her spine dont shifting out of reach she pulled his sleeve down over the fresh bandage were not going to pick things up now not here because if they did she knew there would be no backing off i want you rachel he caught her hand in his before she could stand i want to make love with you i know what you want i have to know what i want before we were interrupted downstairs i think that was pretty clear to you maybe after a deep breath she pulled her hand free and stood i told you i dont do things spontaneously and i certainly dont take a lover on impulse if i act on the attraction i feel for you ill do so with a clear head i dont think ive had a clear head since i laid eyes on you he stood as well but because it suddenly seemed important to both of them he kept his distance i realize how the saying goes about guys like me and women in every port thats not reality not my reality anyway im not going to tell you i spent every liberty curled up with a good book but its not my business im beginning to think it is or could be the look in his eyes kept her from arguing ive been on land for two years and there hasnt been anybody important he couldnt believe what he was saying what he felt compelled to say but the words just tumbled out ill be damned if theres ever been anyone like you in my life i have priorities she began the words sounded weak to her and i dont know if i want this kind of complication right now we have nick to think about as well and id rather we just take it slow take it slow he repeated i cant give you any promises on that i can promise that the first chance i get when its just you and me im going to do whatever it takes to shake up those priorities of yours she jammed nervous hands in her pockets i appreciate the warning muldoon and heres one for you i dont shake easily good his grin flashed before he walked to the door winnings no fun if its easy thanks for the first aid counselor lock your door he shut it quietly behind him and decided to walk home at this rate he was never going to get any sleep chapter five contents prev next she wasnt avoiding him exactly she was busy that was all her caseload didnt allow time for her to drop by zacks bar night after night and chat with the regulars it wasnt as if she were neglecting her duty she had slipped in a time or two to talk with nick in the kitchen if shed managed to get in and out without running into zack it was merely coincidence and a healthy survival instinct if she let her answering machine screen her calls at home it was simply because she didnt want to be disturbed unnecessarily besides he hadnt called the jerk at least she was making some progress where nick was concerned he had called her twice once at her office and once at home she found his suggestion that they catch a movie together a hopeful sign after all if he spent an evening with her he wouldnt be hanging out with the cobras looking for trouble after ninety minutes of car chases gunplay and the assorted mayhem of the actionadventure hed chosen they settled down in a brightly lit pizzeria okay nick so tell me how its going his answer was a shrug but rachel gave his arm a squeeze and pressed come on youve had two weeks to get used to things how are you feeling about it it could be worse he pulled out a cigarette its not so bad having a little change in my pocket and i guess rios not so bad its not like hes on my case all the time but zack is nick blew out a stream of smoke he liked to watch her through the haze it made her look more mysterious more exotic maybe hes laid off a little but its like tonight i got the night off right but he wants to know where im going who im going with when ill be back that kind of sh he caught himself that kind of stuff i mean hey im going to be twenty in a couple of months i dont need a keeper hes a pushy guy rachel said trying to strike a balance between sympathy and sternness but hes not only responsible for you in the eyes of the law he cares about you because his answering snort seemed more automatic than sincere she smiled his styles a little rough but id have to say his intentions are good hes going to have to give me some room youre going to have to earn it she squeezed his hand to take the sting out of her words what did you tell him about tonight i said i had a date and he should butt out nick grinned pleased when he saw the answering humor in rachels eyes hed have been very disappointed if hed realized she was amused at the term date its like hes got his life and i got mine you know what im saying yes she drew a deep appreciative breath as their pizza arrived and what do you want to do with your life nick i figure ill take what comes no ambitions she took the first bite watching him no dreams something flickered in his eyes before he lowered them i dont want to be serving drinks for a living thats for sure zack can have it after crushing out his cigarette he applied himself to the pizza and no way im going into the damn navy either he swung that one by me the other day and i shot it down bigtime well you seem to know what you dont want thats a step he reached out to toy with the little silver ring on her finger did you always want to be a lawyer pretty much for a while i wanted to be a ballerina like my sister thats when i was five it only took about three lessons for me to figure out it wasnt all tutus and toe shoes then i thought i might be a carpenter like the men in my family so i asked for a tool set for my birthday i think i was eight i managed to build a pretty fair book rack before i retired she smiled and his heart rate accelerated it took me a while to come to the conclusion that i couldnt be what natasha was or papa or mama or anyone else i had to find my own way she said it casually hoping the concept would take root so you went to law school mmm her eyes brightened as she studied him can you keep a secret sure perry mason laughing at herself she scooped up another slice i was fascinated by those old reruns you know how there would always be this murder and perry would take the case when his client looked doomed lieutenant tragg would have all this evidence and perry would have delia and paul drake out looking for clues to prove his clients innocence then theyd go to court lots of objections and your honor as usual the counsel for the defense is turning this proceeding into a circus it would look bad for perry hed be up against that smugfaced da hamilton berger nick said grinning right perry would play it real close to the vest dropping little hints to delia but never spilling the whole thing you just knew he had all the answers but he would string it out then always at the eleventh hour hed get the real murderer up on the witness stand and hed just hammer the truth out of him until the poor slob would crumble like a cookie and confess all then hed explain how hed figured it all out in the epilogue nick finished for her and you wanted to be perry mason you bet rachel agreed over a bite of pizza by the time i realized it wasnt that blackandwhite and it certainly wasnt that tidy i was hooked ray charles nick said half to himself what it just made me think how listening to ray charles made me want to play the piano rachel rested her chin on her folded hands and tried to ease the door open a little farther do you play not really i used to think it would be pretty cool sometimes id hang around this music store and fiddle around until they kicked me out the twinge of embarrassment made him brush the rest aside i got over it but once she had a purpose rachel wasnt easily shaken i always wished id learned tash got my mother a piano a few months ago when we found out shed always wanted to play all those years we were growing up she never mentioned it all those years her words trailed off and then she shook herself back to the matter at hand my sister married a musician spencer kimball kimball nicks eyes widened before he could prevent it the composer you know his work yeah he struggled to keep it cool a guy couldnt admit he listened to longhair music unless it was heavy metal some delighted with his reaction rachel continued just as casually at one of our visits down to see tash and her family we caught mama at the piano she got all flustered and kept saying how she was too old to learn and how foolish it was but then spence sat down with her to show her a few chords and you could see you could just see how much she wanted to learn so on mothers day we worked out this big elaborate plan to get her out of the house for a few hours anyway when she came back the piano was in the living room she cried rachel blinked the mist out of her own eyes and sighed she takes lessons twice a week now and shes practicing for her first recital thats cool nick murmured obscurely touched yeah its pretty cool she smiled at him i guess it proves its never too late to try when she offered a hand she wanted him to take it as a gesture of friendship and support what do you say we walk off some of this pizza yeah his fingers closed around hers and nicholas lebeck was in heaven he was content to listen to her talk to have her laugh shiver over him even the shadows of the girls who had weaved in and out of his life faded away they were nothing compared to the woman who walked beside him slim and soft and fragrant she listened when he talked and she was interested in what he had to say when she smiled up at him those exotic eyes flashing with humor his stomach tied itself into slippery knots he could have walked with her for hours this is it nick pulled up short standing in almost the exact spot his brother had a few nights before as his gaze skimmed over the building at her back he imagined what it would be like if she asked him in theyd have coffee and shed slip off her shoes and curl those long legs up as they talked hed be careful with her even gentle once his nerves settled im glad we could do this she was saying already taking out her keys i hope if youre feeling restless again or just need to talk to someone youll call me when i file my report with judge beckett tomorrow i think shell be pleased with the way things are working out are you his eyes locked on hers as he lifted a hand to her hair pleased with the way things are working out sure a little alarm shrilled in rachels head but she dismissed it as absurd i think youve taken a step in the right direction me too the alarm continued to beep as she backed up well have to do this again soon but ive got to get in now i have an early meeting okay ill call you she blinked as his hand slipped around to cup her neck ah nick his mouth closed over hers very warm very firm her eyes stayed open registering shock as her hand flew up to press against his shoulder his fingers tensed against her neck and she had the impression of a very lean very hard body before she managed to pull away nick she said again groping its okay he smiled tucked her hair behind her ear in a gesture that reminded her vividly of his brother ill be in touch he strolled away no good lord he was swaggering rachel thought as she stared after him with her mind whirling she let herself in oh boy she sighed as she paced the elevator what now what now how could she have been so stupid cursing herself she stomped off the elevator and toward her apartment this was great just great here shed been trying to make friends with nick and all the while hed been thinking she didnt want to think about what hed been thinking without taking off her jacket she paced the apartment there had to be a reasonable diplomatic way to handle this she told herself he was only nineteen he just had a crush she was overreacting then she remembered those umber fingers on the back of her neck the firm press of those lips the smooth and practiced way hed drawn her against him wrong rachel thought and closed her eyes she wasnt dealing with a childs puppy love but with a fullgrown mans desire dropping down onto the arm of the couch she dragged her hands through her hair she should have seen it coming she told herself she should have stopped it before it started she should have done a lot of things after twenty minutes of kicking herself she snatched up the phone she might be hipdeep in quicksand but she wasnt going to sink alone lower the boom let me talk to muldoon rachel snapped scowling at the sound of laughter and bar chatter that hummed through the receiver its rachel stanislaski you got it hey zack phone for you its the babe babe rachel thought narrowing her eyes babe she repeated out loud the moment zack had answered hey sugar im not responsible for the opinions of my bartenders he took a swallow of mineral water so you finally realized you couldnt keep away from me stuff it muldoon we need to talk tonight he stopped grinning and shifted the phone is there a problem damn right nick breezed through a couple of minutes ago he seemed fine when he headed upstairs hes upstairs she said calculating just make sure he stays up there im coming right over she hung up before he could ask any questions it wasnt exactly the way hed planned it zack thought as he mixed a couple of stingers his strategy had been to lie back for a few days let rachel simmer until she came to a boil and came looking for him she hadnt sounded lonely or aroused or vulnerable over the phone shed sounded mad as a hornet he cast his eyes up at the ceiling picturing the apartment overhead as he automatically added a twist to a glass of club soda obviously it had to do with nick where the hell had the boy been all evening he wondered what kind of trouble had he gotten himself into this time with half an ear zack took an order for two drafts a margarita on the rocks and a coffee black damned if hed thought the boy was in trouble zack reflected nick had looked relaxed calm even approachable when hed checked in zack remembered thinking that the date had been a rousing success and hed hoped to be able to ease the girls name out of his brother along with a bit more salient information he didnt figure nick needed a course in the birds and bees but he hoped to drop a few hints about responsibility protection and respect a steady girl a steady job a stable home they all seemed to be coming together so what the hell his thoughts broke off as he looked up rachel walked in cheeks flushed from the chilly evening eyes snapping as she crossed the room she peeled off her jacket to reveal one of those soft sweaters she often wore this one was the color of a good burgundy with a wide cowl neck that draped softly over the swell of her breasts it rode her hips and under it she wore snug black leggings that showed off those firstclass legs zack checked to make sure his tongue wasnt hanging out she stopped at the bar only long enough to glare at him in your office without waiting for a response she strode off well well lola watched rachel swing zacks office door open then shut it behind her with a loud click looks like the ladys got something on her mind yeah zack set the last glass on lolas tray all he could think was there was definitely a fire in the hole if nick comes back down tell him im tied up youre the boss right and he intended to remain the boss he swung through the bar and taking one bracing breath marched into his office rachel had tossed her jacket and purse aside and was pacing when the door opened she stopped swung her hair back and leveled a killing gaze at him dont you ever talk to him she demanded arent you making any effort to find out whats going on in his head what kind of a guardian are you anyway what the hell is this he threw up his hands in disgust i dont see or hear from you in days then you come stalking in here just so you can yell at me just simmer down counselor and remember im not some felon on the witness stand dont tell me to simmer down she tossed back it felt good really good to assuage her guilt and frustration with a pitched battle im the one whos going to have to deal with him and if you were any kind of a brother you would have known you could have warned me because his confidence as a brother was still at low tide he hissed out an oath rachel echoed it as he shoved her into a chair just sit down and take it from the top i assume were talking about nick of course were talking about nick she popped up again and was pushed right back down i dont have anything else to discuss with you well bypass that for now just what is it i should have known and warned you about that hed hed she blew out a breath struggling for the proper phrase that hed started to think of me as a woman how the hell is he supposed to think of you as a tuna i mean as a woman she said between her teeth do i have to spell it out his brows shot up then settled again as he reached for a cigarette dont be stupid rachel hes nineteen im not saying hes blind and wouldnt appreciate the way you look but hes got a girl he was out with her tonight you idiot she sprang up again and this time she thumped a fist on his chest he was out with me tonight out with you with a frown zack studied her what for we went to the movies had a pizza i wanted to get him to talk a little informally so when he called i said sure one step at a time nick called you and asked you out on a date it wasnt a date i didnt think it was a damn date since she didnt see anything handy to kick other than zacks shin she stalked a circle around his office again it seemed to me if we could develop a relationship a friendship she corrected hastily it would make things easier all around considering zack took a drag of his cigarette sounds reasonable so you took in a flick and had a pizza whats the problem did he get into a fight give you a hard time he stopped alarmed you didnt run in to any of the cobras no no no incensed she whirled around the room arent you listening to me i said he was thinking about me as a woman as a date as a oh boy she let out a long breath he kissed me zacks eyes turned into dark dangerous slits define kiss you know damn well what a kiss is you smack your lips up against somebodys she spun away then back i should have seen it coming but i didnt then before i realized what he was thinking wham wham zack repeated trying to stay calm he took his own turn around the room bumping his shoulders against hers okay listen i think youre making a big deal out of nothing he kissed you goodnight its a gesture hes just a kid no rachel said and her tone had zack turning back to her hes not temper was clawing to gain freedom as a result zacks voice was deadly calm did he try to no recognizing the signs she cut him off of course he didnt he just kissed me but it was the way listen zack i know the difference between a casual kiss goodnight between friends and and well a move and i can tell you nick has a very smooth move glad to hear it zack said between his teeth suddenly drained she dropped down onto the corner of his desk i dont know what to do ill straighten him out how i dont know how he shot back crushing out his cigarette ill be damned if im going to be competing with my kid brother the muttered aside had her narrowing her eyes im not a trophy muldoon i didnt mean with a shake of his head he leaned on the desk beside her look this throws me off course okay i figured nick was out making time with some pretty little teenager whose daddy would want her home by midnight and now i find out hes coming on to you if he wasnt my brother id go knock him around a little typical she muttered he ignored that and tried to think its probably normal for him to develop or think hes developed feelings for you dont you think maybe she tilted her head to slant zack a look i dont want to hurt him me either you could back off stay unavailable the way youve tried to be with me ive been busy all dignity she lifted her chin and were not talking about you in any case i considered that but im supposed to be his coguardian i cant do that longdistance besides he talked to me tonight he really talked and relaxed and showed me a little of whats underneath all that defiance if i cut him off now just when hes beginning to open up and trust me i dont know what damage i might do you cant string him along rachel i know that she wanted to lay her head on zacks shoulder just for a minute she looked down at her hands instead i need to find a way to let him know i want to be his friend just his friend without crushing his ego zack took her hand and when she didnt pull it away he twined his fingers in hers ill talk to him calmly he added when rachel frowned at him actually i wanted to dump the whole business in your lap but the more i think about it the more im sure hed only resent it coming from you how can you tell him im not interested without letting him know we discussed his feelings behind his back she shut her eyes and im not feeling very good about that either you had to tell me yeah i think i did just like i think im going to have to figure out what to do he ran his thumb over her knuckles were in this together remember how can i forget but you and nick are just getting your balance this is bound to tilt the scales zack i think its best if i try to handle it a smile played around the corners of her mouth i guess i should apologize for coming here and jumping on you at least it got you here well handle it he brought her hand to his lips enjoying the way her eyes darkened and became cautious you let him down easy and ill let him take it out on me after all i cant blame the kid for trying when im doing the same myself one has nothing to do with the other she pushed away from the desk but he continued to hold her hand im glad to hear it feeling better her lips quirked fighting always makes me feel better then sugar by the time were through with each other you should be feeling like a million bucks i dont suppose youd like to hang around for a couple of hours until i can close the bar no her heart picked up a beat at the thought a dark empty bar blues on the juke the world locked outside no i have to go im shorthanded tonight or id see you home ill put you in a cab i can put myself in a cab okay in a minute he caught her by the hips lifted her then set her on the desk ive missed you he murmured nuzzling her neck without thinking he certainly had a way of making her stop thinking she tilted her head to give him more access to her skin ive been busy i dont doubt youve been busy he moved up to nip at her earlobe but youve been stubborn i like that about you rachel right now i cant think of a damn thing i dont like about you this was a mistake any minute shed remember why it was a mistake she was sure of it you just want to talk me into bed his lips curved before they came down on hers oh yeah he fisted his hands in her hair and a deep sound of pleasure came from his throat when she arched against him howm i doing youre making things very difficult for me good thats good he was very close to pressing her back on the desk and doing all the things hed fantasized about during those long dark nights hed lain alone in bed thinking of her and she sighed the soft broken sound of it seemed to rip something inside his gut grinding out an oath he buried his face in her hair i sure pick my spots he muttered on the sidewalk with a mugger in my office with a barful of customers outside the door every time im around you i start acting like a kid in the back seat of a parked car she had to concentrate just to breathe as he continued to hold her just hold her she found herself stroking his hair counting his heartbeats warming toward him in a way that was entirely different from the flash heat of a moment before shed been right about the quicksand she realized and shed been right about not sinking alone were not kids she murmured no were not not quite sure he could trust himself he drew back taking both her hands in his i know its moving fast and i know its complicated but i want you theres no getting around it i knew this would happen if i came here tonight i came anyway muddled she shook her head i dont know what that says about me or about us i do know its not smart and im usually smart the best thing for me to do is walk out the door and go home he tugged on her hands bringing her off the desk and close to him again what are you going to do she wavered caught on the thin edge between temptation and common sense images of what could be swam giddily through her head and left her throat dry repercussions she couldnt quite see them clearly but she knew they existed and she was afraid they would be severe indeed im going to walk out the door and go home she let out an unsteady breath when he said nothing for now she grabbed up her jacket her purse when she reached the door his hand closed over hers on the knob a quick thrill of panicked excitement raced through her at the thought that he would simply turn the lock she wouldnt permit it of course she wouldnt permit it would she sunday was all he said her scattered thoughts scrambled to make sense of the word sunday i can shift things around and take the day off spend it with me relief confusion pleasure she had no idea which emotion was uppermost you want to spend sunday with me yeah you know take in a couple of museums maybe an art gallery a walk in the park have a fancy lunch somewhere i figure most of the time weve spent together so fars been after dark odd that hadnt occurred to her before i guess it has why dont we try a sunday afternoon i she couldnt think of a single reason why not all right why dont you come by around eleven ill be there she turned the knob then glanced back at him museums she said on a laugh is this on the level muldoon i happen to appreciate art he told her leaning forward to touch his lips to hers in a quiet kiss that rocked her back on her heels and beauty she slipped out quickly as she walked up to the corner to hail a cab it occurred to her she hadnt yet decided how best to handle nick and she sure as hell hadnt figured out how to handle nicks big brother chapter six contents prev next rachel was cursing when her buzzer sounded promptly at eleven oclock sunday morning securing an earring she pressed the intercom muldoon you sound out of breath sugar should i take that as a compliment come on up she said shortly and dont call me sugar after snapping off the intercom she flipped off her three security locks then gave herself one last look in the mirror shed forgotten her second earring grumbling she went on a quick search until she found it lying on the kitchen counter beside her empty coffee cup it was her day off damn it and she resented having it interrupted for work not because shed been looking forward to spending it with zack particularly it was just that it had been a long time since shed had a day to wander through museums and galleries and she broke off her silent complaining at the knock on the door come in its open anxious zack commented as he walked in then he lifted a brow and took one long look she was standing in the center of the room slim and lovely in a bronzetoned suede jacket and short skirt set off by a slightly mannish silk blouse in a flashy blue she was barefoot and he found his mouth watering as he watched her perform the feminine and oddly intimate task of securing a shiny gold knot to her ear you look nice thanks you too no what he looked was sexy she thought damn sexy in snug black jeans a midnightblue sweater and a bomber jacket in soft black leather but nice would have to do listen zack i tried to catch you before you left the bar im sorry i missed you is there a problem he watched as she wiggled one foot into a bronzecolored pump by the time shed wiggled into the second his palms were sweaty and hed missed what shed said sorry what i said my boss called about a half hour ago ive got an attempted murder i have to deal with that cut his fantasy off as quickly as a faceful of ice water a what attempted murder alexis precinct i can probably plead down to assault with a deadly weapon but i have to see him today so i can meet with the da in the morning she spread her hands im really sorry i didnt catch you before you came all the way over no problem ill go with you with me she liked the idea a little too much you dont want to spoil your day off spending it at a police station im taking the day off to be with you he reminded her and picked up her coat where shed tossed it over the back of the couch besides it wont take all day will it no probably no more than an hour but so lets get started he walked to her then turned her around so that he could slip the coat slowly on one arm then the other lowering his head he sniffed at her neck did you spray that stuff on for the felon or for me she shivered once before cautiously stepping away for me picking up her briefcase she held it between them like a shield i have to go by the office first we already have a file on the guy hes been around okay he tugged the briefcase away took her hand lets go counselor alex spotted his sister the moment she walked into the station since he wasnt any happier than she to be spending his sunday morning at work he immediately brightened giving rachel a hard time always lifted his spirits grinning he strolled over a greeting on his lips when he spotted the man hovering around her the humor in his eyes turned instantly to suspicion rach still clipping her visitors badge to her lapel she glanced up alex they got you too huh looks like muldoon isnt it thats right zack returned the steady stare and nodded nice to see you again officer detective alex corrected i didnt hear anything about lebeck being pulled in im not here about nick rachel recognized alexs unfriendly aggressive stance hed assumed it with every boy and man shed dated since shed turned fifteen im representing victor lomez now thats real slime but alex wasnt nearly as concerned about rachels client as he was with the reason the big irishman was carrying her briefcase so did you two run into each other outside no alexi rachel commandeered the coffee he was carrying though she knew it was worthless she shot him a warning glance zack and i had plans for the day what kind of plans the kind that arent any of your business she kissed his cheek as an excuse to get close enough to his ear to whisper knock it off leaning back she smiled at zack grab a seat muldoon and some of this horrible coffee like i said this shouldnt take too long i got all day he told her as she walked off to a conference room he turned back to alex and said blandly so you want to take me down to interrogation alex told himself he wasnt particularly amused and gestured with a jerk of his head in herell do it pleased him to be behind his desk while zack sat in the chair used to grill witnesses whats the story muldoon casually zack took out a cigarette he offered one to alex and lit up when alex shook his head you want to know what im doing with your sister he blew out a stream of smoke considering if youre any kind of detective you should be able to figure that one out shes beautiful shes smart shes a soft heart in a tough sexy shell taking another drag he watched alexs eyes narrow listen you want it straight or do you want me to tell you im just interested in her legal services watch your step because he understood the need to protect what he loved zack leaned forward stanislaski if you know rachel you know shes been watching my step nobody but nobody pushes her into something she doesnt want you figure you got her pegged are you kidding zacks smile came quickly and was friendly enough to make alexs shoulders relax there isnt a man alive who really understands a woman especially a smart one when he saw alexs eyes shift over his shoulder zack glanced around he saw a short wiry oilyskinned man being hauled toward the conference room by a uniformed cop is that the one yeah thats lomez zack hissed smoke through his teeth and swore roundly alex could only agree at the conference table rachel looked up though shed represented lomez on his last count of assault she was going over his file well lomez we meet again you took your sweet time getting here he dropped down in the seat and ignored the hovering cop but he was sweating bungling the mugging meant hed missed his connection he hadnt had a fix in fourteen hours you bring me a smoke this time no thank you officer rachel waited until she was alone with her client then folded her hands over his paperwork well you really pulled a prize this time out the woman you attacked was sixtythree i called the hospital this morning you should be relieved to know theyve bumped her condition up from critical to fair lomez shrugged his small black eyes gleaming at rachel he couldnt keep his hands still he began to beat a tattoo on the table with his fingertips as he tapped his feet his system was skidding to a much wilder rhythm hey if shed handed over her purse like i told her i wouldnt have had to get rough you know god he sickened her rachel thought fighting to remember she was a public servant and lomez however revolting was the public knifing a senior citizen isnt going to win you the key to the city its sure as hell going to buy you a lock damn it lomez she had twelve dollars his mouth was dry and his skin was cold then it wouldnt have cost her a lot to hand it over you just get me out thats your job and the minute he was back on the street hed pressure one of the other hombres to score for him i had to sit in that stinking cell all night youre charged with attempted murder rachel said flatly lomez tapped his damp hands against his thighs even his bones were screaming i didnt kill the old bitch rachel wished she hadnt finished the coffee at least she could have used it to wash some of the disgust out of her mouth you stuck a knife in her three times the officer responding pursued you as you fled the scene with the knife and the victims purse theyve got you cold lomez and your priors arent going to make the judge think leniency your repertoire includes assault assault and battery breaking and entering and two counts of possession i dont need a list i need bail odds are slim the das going to agree to bail and if he does itll be well out of your range now im going to do what i can to get him to toss the attempted murder you plead guilty to guilty my butt its going to be your butt she said evenly youre not going to walk away from this one lomez no matter how many rabbits i pull out of my hat youre not going to do short time this turn around plead guilty to assault with a deadly weapon its likely i can swing the judge for seven to ten sweat popped cold on his brow on his lips the hell with that because she was fast running out of patience she slapped his file closed it wont get any sweeter you cooperate and i should be able to keep you from spending the next twenty years in a cage he screamed at her then leaped across the table and struck before she had a chance to dodge the backhanded blow knocked her out of her chair and onto the floor where he fell on her you get me out he squeezed his hands on her throat too wired even to feel her nails rake his wrist you bitch you get me out or ill kill you at first she could only see his face the sick rage in it then it faded as red dots swam in front of her eyes choking she struck out smashing the heel of her hand against the bridge of his nose his blood splattered over her but his hands tightened a roaring filled her ears buzzing over the wild curses he shouted at her the red dots faded to gray as she bucked under him then her windpipe was free and she was sucking air down her burning throat someone was calling her name desperately and she was being lifted held tight she thought she smelled the scent of the sea before she fell limply into it cool fingers on her face wonderful strong hands clasped hard over hers comforting a sigh before waking agony rachel blinked her eyes open two faces were looming over hers equally grim with eyes that held both rage and fear woozily she lifted a hand to zacks cheek then alexs im all right her voice was husky bruises already forming on her throat just lie still alex murmured in ukrainian stroking her head with a hand that still throbbed from where it had connected with lomezs face can you drink some water she nodded i want to sit up as she focused on the room she realized she was lying on the faded couch in the captains office murmuring her thanks to her brother she sipped from the paper cup he held to her lips lomez in a cage where he belongs fighting off the tremors of reaction alex lowered his brow to hers he continued to speak in ukrainian kissing her brow her cheeks then sitting back on his heels to hold her hand you just relax an ambulance is on the way i dont need an ambulance reading the argument in his eyes she shook her head i dont she glanced down to see that her blouse was gaping open it was ruined of course she thought in disgust that and her suede skirt were spotted with blood his blood not mine she pointed out you broke his slimy lowlife nose alex snapped im glad my selfdefense class wasnt wasted when he began to swear she caught his hand alexi she began her voice low intense do you know what it is for me to accept that you risk your life every day every night do you know i accept only because i love you so much dont turn this around on me he said furiously that bastard nearly killed you he was so far gone it took three of us to drag him off she didnt want to think about that just yet she couldnt i played it wrong you i did she insisted but the point is we cant change what we are i wont change not even for you now cancel the ambulance and do something for me he called her a name a rude one in their native language it made her smile im no more of a horses ass than you i need to contact my office and explain i wont be able to represent lomez under the circumstances damn right you wont it was small satisfaction but he could hope for little more gently he touched his fingers to the bruise on her cheekbone hes going down rachel ill make damn sure he goes down for this if nothing else theres nothing you or anyone else can do thats for the courts to decide she got shakily to her feet and you will not call mama and papa when he said nothing she lifted a brow if you do ill have to tell them about your last undercover assignment the one where you went through the secondstory window go home he said giving up get some rest he turned away from her to study zack his opinion of him had changed a bit since zack had been one of the three whod hauled lomez off rachel alex had been a cop long enough to recognize murder in a mans eyes and it had shone darkly in zacks he assumed correctly that zack would have dealt with lomez himself regardless of cops if he hadnt been so busy cradling rachel in his arms youll get her there it wasnt a question count on it he said nothing else as alex left them unsteady and far from sure of herself rachel tried to smile some date huh a muscle jumped in his jaw as he studied her spattered blouse can you walk of course i can walk she hoped the little seed of annoyance his terse question planted helped her get across the room look im sorry things got messed up this way you dont have to do me a favor he said as he took her arm and led her through the squad room just shut up she obliged him though she was sorely tempted to tell him how foolish it was to indulge in a cab for the few blocks to her building it was better if she didnt talk she realized not only did it hurt but she was also afraid her voice would begin to shake as much as her body wanted to shed be alone in a few minutes she reminded herself then shed be able to indulge in a nice bout of trembling and weeping if she wanted to but not in front of zack not in front of anybody with a drunks exaggerated care she stepped out of the cab and onto the sidewalk mild shock she deduced it would pass shed make it pass thanks she began im sorry im taking you up look ive already ruined your morning it isnt necessary to but he was already half carrying her to the door didnt i tell you to shut up he pulled open her briefcase to look for her keys himself whitehot rage had his ringers fumbling didnt she know how pale she was couldnt she understand what it did to him inside to hear the way her voice rasped he pulled her through the door into the elevator and jabbed his ringer on the button i dont know what youre so mad about she muttered wincing a little as she swallowed you lost a couple of hours sure but do you know what i paid for this suit and ive only worn it twice tears sprang to her eyes and she blinked them back furiously as he dragged her down the hall to her apartment a pds salary isnt exactly princely she rubbed icecold hands together as he unlocked her door i had to eat yogurt for a month to afford it even on sale and i dont even like yogurt the first tear spilled out she dashed it away as she walked inside even if i could get it cleaned i wouldnt be able to wear it after she broke off and made an enormous effort to pull herself back she was babbling about a suit for gods sake maybe she was losing her mind okay she let out what she thought was a slow careful breath it hitched as it came out you got me home i appreciate it now go away he merely tossed her briefcase aside then tugged the coat from her shoulders sit down rachel i dont want to sit down another tear it was too late to stop it what i want is to be alone when her voice broke she pressed her hands to her face oh god leave me alone he picked her up moving to the couch to hold her in his lap stroking her back through the tremors feeling her tears hot and damp on his neck he forced his hands to be gentle even as the rage and fear worked inside him as she curled up against him he closed his eyes and murmured the useless words that always seemed to comfort she cried hard he realized but she didnt cry long she trembled violently but the trembling was soon controlled she didnt try to push away if she had he wouldnt have allowed it perhaps he was comforting her but holding her knowing she was safe and with him brought him tremendous comfort damn it when the worst was over she let her head lie weakly on his shoulder i told you to go away we had a deal remember youre spending the day with me his hands tightened once convulsively before he managed to gentle them again you scared me bigtime me too and if i go away im going to have to go back down there find a way to get to that son of a bitch and break him in half it was odd how a threat delivered so matteroffactly could seem twice as deadly as a shout then i guess youd better hang around until the impulse fades im really all right she told him but she left her head cuddled against his shoulder this was just reaction there was still an ice floe of fury in his gut that was his reaction and hed deal with it later it may be his blood rachel but theyre your bruises frowning she touched fingers gingerly to her cheek how bad does it look despite himself he chuckled lord i didnt know you were that vain she bristled pulling back far enough to scowl at him it has nothing to do with vanity i have a meeting in the morning and i dont need all the questions he cupped her chin tilted her head to the side take it from someone whos had his share of bruises sugar youre going to get the questions now forget about tomorrow he touched his lips very gently to the bruise and made her heart stutter have you got any tea bags any honey probably why since you wont go to the hospital youll have to put up with muldoon first aid he shifted her from his lap and propped her against the pillows their vivid colors only made her appear paler stay since the bout of weeping had tired her she didnt argue when zack came out of the kitchen five minutes later tea steaming in the cup in his hands she was out like a light she awakened groggy her throat on fire the room was dim and utterly quiet disorienting her pushing herself up on her elbows she saw that the curtains had been drawn the bright afghan her mother had crocheted years before had been tucked around her groaning only a little she tossed it aside and stood up steady she thought with some satisfaction you couldnt keep a stanislaski down but this one needed about a gallon of water to ease the flames in her throat rubbing her eyes she padded into the kitchen then let out a shriek that seared her abused throat when she spotted zack bending over the stove what the hell are you doing i thought you were gone nope he stirred the contents of the pot on the stove before turning to study her her color was back and the glazed look had faded from her eyes it would take a great deal longer for the bruises to disappear i had rio send over some soup do you think you can eat now i guess she pressed a hand to her stomach she was starving but she wasnt sure how she was going to manage getting anything down her throbbing throat what time is it about three shed slept nearly two hours she realized and found the idea of her dozing on the couch while zack puttered in the kitchen both embarrassing and touching you didnt have to hang around you know your throat would feel better sooner if you didnt talk so much go in and sit down since the scent of the soup was making her mouth water she obliged him after tugging the curtains open she sat at the little gateleg table by the window with some disgust she shrugged out of her stained jacket and tossed it aside as soon as shed indulged herself with some of rios soup she would shower and change obviously zack had found his way around her kitchen rachel mused as he came in carrying bowls and mugs on a tray thanks she saw his gaze light briefly on the jacket heat then flatten i pawed through some of your records while you were out it pleased him that he could speak casually when he wanted to break something someone mind if i put one on no go ahead watching the steam she stirred her soup while he put an old b b king album on her stereo and they said we had nothing in common relieved that he wasnt going to bring the incident up she smiled i stole it from mikhail he has very eclectic taste in music once zack was seated across from her she spooned up soup and swallowed gingerly sighed it soothed her fevered throat the way a mother soothes a fretful child wonderful whats in it i never ask rio never tells with a murmur of acknowledgment she continued to eat ill have to figure out how to bribe him my mother would love the recipe for this she switched to tea after the first sip her eyes opened wide you didnt have honey zack said mildly but you had brandy she took another more cautious sip it ought to dull the nerve endings thats the idea reaching across the table he took her hand feel any better lots i really am sorry you had your sunday wrecked dont make me tell you to shut up again she only smiled im starting to think youre not such a bad guy muldoon maybe i should have brought you soup before the soup helped she spooned up some more but not making me feel like an idiot when i was crying all over you did the trick you had pretty good cause being toughs not always the answer it usually works she sipped more of the brandylaced tea i didnt want to let go in front of alex he worries enough her lips curved you know how it is to have a younger sibling who refuses to see things the way you do you mean so youd like to rap their head against the wall yeah i know well whether alex likes to believe it or not i can handle my own life nick will too when the time comes hes not like that creep today zack said softly he never could be of course not concerned she pushed her bowl aside this time she took his hand you mustnt even think like that listen to me for two years ive seen them come in and go out some are twisted beyond redemption like lomez others are desperate and confused either battered by the streets or part of the streets working with them it gets to the point that if you dont burn out or just scab over you learn to recognize the nuances nicks been hurt and his selfesteem is next to zero he turned to a gang because he needed to be part of something anything now he has you no matter how much he might try to shake you loose he wants you he needs you maybe if he ever starts to trust me he might be able to turn a corner he hadnt realized how much it was weighing on him he wont talk to me about my father about what it was like when i was gone he will when hes ready the old man wasnt so bad rachel hed never have made father of the year but hell he let out a breath in disgust he was a hardnosed harddrinking irish son of a bitch who should never have given up the sea he ran our lives like we were green crewmen on a sinking ship all shouts and bluster and the back of his hand we never agreed on a damn thing families often dont he never got over my mother he was in the south pacific when she died which meant zack would have been alone a child alone her fingers tightened on his he came back mad as hell he was going to make a man out of me then nadine and nick came along and i was old enough to go my own way you could say i abandoned ship so he tried to make a man his kind of man out of nick youre beating yourself up again over something you cant change and couldnt have changed i guess i keep remembering how it was that first year i came back the old man was so fragile he couldnt remember things kept wandering out and getting lost damn it i knew nick was running wild but i didnt have my legs under me having to put the old man in a home watching him die there trying to keep the bar going nick got lost in the shuffle you found him again he started to speak again then sat back with a sigh hell of a time to be dumping this on you its all right i want to help youve already helped do you want more soup subject closed rachel realized she could press or she could give him room one favor deserved another she decided and smiled no thanks it really did the job he wanted to say more a whole lot more he wanted to hold her again and feel her head resting on his shoulder he wanted to sit and watch her sleep on the couch again and if he did any one of those things he wouldnt make it to the door ill clear it up and get out of your hair i imagine youd like some time alone she frowned after him as he walked into the kitchen she had wanted time alone hadnt she so why was she trying to think of ways to stall him keep him from walking out the door hey look she pushed away from the table to wander in after him he was already pouring the remaining soup in a container its still early we might be able to salvage some of the day you need rest i had rest feeling awkward she ran water over the bowls hed stacked in the sink we could probably make at least one museum or catch a matinee i dont want to think you spent your whole day off mopping up after me will you quit worrying about my day off zack slapped the container on a shelf in the refrigerator im the boss remember i can take another fine she slammed the water off see you around man youve got a short fuse amused he put his hands on her shoulders and rubbed dont get yourself worked up sugar all in all i had a very eventful day she closed her eyes feeling those rough fingers through the silk of her blouse any time muldoon he could smell her hair and he had to fight the urge to bury his face in it it wouldnt be possible to stop there you going to be all right alone i could call the cop to come stay with you no im fine gripping the edge of the counter she stared hard at the wall thanks for the first aid my pleasure damn it he was stalling when he should be out the door away from her maybe we can have an early dinner one night this week she pressed her lips together the way his hands were rubbing up and down her arms made her want to whimper sure ill check my schedule he turned her around he couldnt be sure if she moved into his arms or if hed pulled her there but he was holding her her lips were parting for his ill call you okay her eyes fluttered closed as the kiss deepened soon he felt the breath backing up in his lungs as she molded against him umhmm as his tongue danced over hers she gave a quick sigh that caught in the middle he tore his mouth away to nibble along her jaw one more thing yes im not leaving i know her arms curled around his neck as he lifted her its just chemistry right struggling to remember her bruises he rained soft kisses over her face nothing serious she shuddered nipping at his neck i cant afford to get involved i have plans nothing serious he agreed blood pounding in his head in his loins he jerked open a door and found himself facing a closet wheres the damn bedroom what she focused realized hed carried her out of the kitchen this is it the couch she nipped his ear it pulls out i can never mind he managed and settled for the rug chapter seven contents prev next he ripped her blouse it wasnt only passion that made him grab and tear he couldnt bear to see her wear it another moment to see that vivid blue stained with spots of blood yet the sound of it of the silk rending beneath his fingers and her gasp of shocked excitement spread fire through his gut the first time i saw you his breath was already short and fast when he tossed the mangled blouse aside from the first minute i wanted this wanted you i know she reached for him amazed at how deep and ripe a need could be me too its crazy she said against his mouth insane her skin trembled as he tugged the straps of her chemise from her shoulders to replace them with impatient lips incredible glorying in it she arched against him when he took her breasts in those greedy roughpalmed hands then his mouth oh his mouth hot and seeking closed over her to tug and suckle hurry was all she could think hurry hurry and her nails scraped heedlessly up his sides as she dragged his sweater over his head flesh to flesh was what she wanted skin already hot already damp the feel of his lips against her thundering heart had her locking her fists in his hair pressing him closer she fretted for more even as the storm built to a crisis point inside her she met she ached and she demanded her fingers dug into his broad shoulders when he slid down setting off hundreds of tiny eruptions by streaking hungry openmouthed kisses down her torso then back quickly back to drown her in desire with his lips on hers he couldnt stop himself from taking no matter that he had once imagined making slow tortuously slow love to her on some huge soft bed the desperation of what was overpowered any fantasy of what might have been she possessed him obsessed him no mystical siren could have stolen his mind and soul more completely a button popped from her skirt as he fought to drag it down her hips he thought he might go mad if he didnt rip aside all obstacles if he didnt see her all of her halfcrazed he peeled off her stockings and the delicate lace that had secured them somewhere through the roaring in his brain he heard her throaty cry when his fingers brushed against her thigh fighting to hold back he knelt between her legs filling himself with the sight of her slim and golden and naked her hair tousled around her face her eyes dark and heavy she reared up too desperate to wait even another moment her mouth closed avidly over his and her fingers tore at the snap of his jeans let me she said in a husky whisper no he slipped a hand behind her back to support her and brought the other down to cover the source of heat let me the volcano hed imagined erupted at the first touch her body shuddered quaked and he watched impossibly aroused as her head fell back not surrender even in his own delirium he understood that she was not surrendering it was abandonment the pure unleashed quest for pleasure he gave her more and gave to himself stroking that velvet fire letting his tongue slide over hers in a delicious matching rhythm how could she have known that desire could be dark and deadly or that she always so sure always so cautious would throw reason to the winds for more of the dangerous delights no not just more all of them she thought dizzily all of him she would have all locking her legs around his hips she took him into her she heard his gasp the first one ended with a groan she saw his eyes cobalt now and fixed on hers as he shifted to fill her a sword to the hilt then he moved and she with him lost in the whirlwind she heard nothing but the screaming of her own heart the bigger they are rachel murmured some time later hmm smiling to herself she lifted one of zacks hands let it go and watched it drop limply to the rug the harder they fall she rolled over and propped her elbows on his chest so that she could study him if she hadnt known better she would have thought he was sleeping or unconscious his breathing had slowed somewhat but his eyes were still closed it had been some time since hed moved a single muscle you know muldoon you look like you went ten rounds with the champ his lips curved it was about all he had the energy for you pack a hell of a punch sugar as a matter of principle she bit his shoulder dont call mesugar but since you mention it you didnt do too badly yourself he opened one eye too badly i melted you down to a gooey puddle true enough she admitted but she wouldnt stroke his ego by agreeing ill say that you have a certain unrefined style that is strangely appealing she trailed a fingertip down his chest but the simple fact is i had to carry you that got his other eye open she thought with satisfaction not that i minded i didnt have anything else pressing to do this afternoon you carried me metaphorically speaking his opinion of that was short and rude want to take me on again champ she fluttered her lashes any time any place here and now she was laughing as he rolled her over but the laughter ended on a hiss of pain when he bumped her bruised cheek klutz she said as he jerked back and swore im sorry come on zack she smiled wanting to lighten the concern in his eyes and bring back the laughter i was only kidding ignoring that he turned her head for a closer look at the mark on her cheek i should have put ice on that he didnt break the skin but its she could feel the tension hardening his shoulders instead of trying to stroke it away she pinched him listen buster i come from tough stock i got worse than that wrestling with my brothers if he ever gets out stop it very firmly she put her hands on either side of his face dont say anything you might regret remember im an officer of the court i wouldnt regret it he tugged her upward until she was sitting beside him they were circled he realized by the tattered remains of her clothes and i dont regret this except for the unrefined style she let out an impatient breath look if you cant take a joke learn to wait until im finished before you swipe at me okay i swear you come on faster than a typhoon he tucked her hair back and kissed her once hard i wasnt going to stay not today i figured a bout of hot sex wasnt the best encore after youd been strangled i wasnt he interrupted her close enough you know that i wanted you however i could get you rachel i sure as hell didnt make a secret of it but it occurs to me that you were upset and vulnerable and i took advantage of that she had to wait nearly a full minute before she could speak dont make me mad at you muldoon and dont insult me all im trying to say is i dont know what the hell im trying to say he muttered and tried again except well maybe i could have pulled that stupid couch out instead of using the floor eyes narrowed she leaned her face close to his her eyes were the color of gold doubloons and just as exotic i like the floor get it he was starting to feel better zack knew that tending to fragility was out of his league but this tough hardheaded woman was just his style watching her he picked up her ruined blouse i ripped your clothes off proud of yourself he tossed it aside yeah i can wait if you want to put some more on then i can rip them off you again she bit the inside of her lip but didnt quite defeat the smile those were ruined anyway next time ill have to bill you for damages im on a budget chuckling he flicked her earring with his finger im crazy about you her heart did a fast skip and shudder the statement was as romantic as a whispered endearment to her hey dont get sloppy on me crazy he said again amazed and delighted at the faint blush that stole into her cheeks and did i mention that your body makes me wild she was a great deal more comfortable with that no she tilted her head why dont you from stem to stern he said letting his hand speak more eloquently forward and aft port and starboard oh god she gave an exaggerated sigh and shiver salty talk i just love a man out of uniform more than willing to be aroused she nuzzled her lips against his tell me something sailor you bet which part is the stern ill show you very gently he touched his lips to her bruised throat honey we better pull that couch out before this gets out of hand again okay there was something unspeakably erotic about a callused finger stroking the underside of her breast if you want though the idea had merit the couch seemed entirely too far away or we could do it later tell you what if youd say something in ukrainian id forget we were on the floor and i promise to make you forget it too why should i say something in ukrainian because it drives me insane she tilted her head back are you putting me on uhuh his tongue traced a slow teasing circle on her lips go ahead say anything after a little sigh she twined her arms around his neck against his ear she murmured the words then chuckled when he groaned what did it mean he demanded busying himself by nibbling his way along her shoulder loosely translated i said you were a big pigheaded fool mmmare you sure you didnt say how much you wanted my body no this is how you say that she told him but by the time she was finished he was already obliging her in the dark he drew her close they had managed finally to pull out the bed now they were tangled in her sheets the afternoon had become evening and evening night id like to stay he said quietly i know it was silly she thought to be unhappy that he would go shed always jealously prized her nights alone but you cant its too soon to trust nick overnight if things were different damn he hadnt expected it to be so frustrating id like to take you back home with me id like to have you in my bed tonight wake up with you tomorrow hes not ready for that either she wasnt sure she was ready herself until i have a chance to smooth things out with him and make him understand its probably best if he doesnt know were what were they the question ran through both their heads neither of them voiced it youre right the mattress creaked as he shifted rachel i want to be with you again it doesnt just have to be in bed he traced the curve of her cheek or on the floor i want to be with you she touched her fingers to the back of his hand its good and thats enough yeah he was nearly sure it was i can take some time wednesday how about an early dinner id like that they fell into silence again until she sighed youd better go i know maybe sunday you and nick could come to dinner at my parents we talked about it before remember that would be good he kissed her again and the kiss went on and on just once more yes she enfolded him just once more rachel shifted the phone to her other ear scribbled on a legal pad and stared dubiously at the stack of files on her desk yes mrs macetti i understand what we need are a couple of good character witnesses for your son your priest perhaps or a teacher as she listened to the rapidfire broken english she wondered if she could catch the attention of any of her harried coworkers and hope that theyd feel sorry enough for her to bring her a cup of coffee i cant tell you that mrs macetti our chances are very good for a suspended sentence and probation since carlo wasnt driving but the fact is he was riding in a stolen car and she trailed off carefully folding the page shed written on uhhuh well as i explained before it would be rather difficult to convince anyone he didnt know the car was stolen since the locks had been sprung and the engine hotwired satisfied with the shape of her paper airplane she shot it out her door it was as good as a note in a bottle im sure hes a good boy mrs macetti rachel rolled her eyes bad companions yes lets hope that this experience will have him keeping his distance from the hombres mrs macetti mrs macetti rachel said trying to be firm im doing everything i can try to be optimistic and ill see you in court next week no no really ill call you yes i promise goodbye yes absolutely goodbye rachel hung up the phone then dropped her head on her desk ten minutes of trying to deal with the frantic mother of six was as exhausting as a full day in court tough day lifting her head rachel spotted nick in her doorway he had her paper airplane in one hand and a large paper cup in the other tough month her gaze locked on the steaming cup tell me thats coffee light no sugar he stepped in and offered it your note sounded desperate as she took the first sip he grinned i was coming down the hall and it hit me in the chest nice form i find they make excellent interoffice memos another sip and she felt the caffeine begin to pump through her system since you saved my life what can i do for you i was just kicking around thought maybe we could grab some lunch im sorry nick she gestured to the clutter on her desk im swamped they dont let you eat because he found he enjoyed seeing her here entrenched in the business of justice he eased a hip down on the corner of the desk oh they throw us some raw meat now and again lord he was flirting with her she realized rachel gauged the files piled in front of her calculated how much time she had before her meeting with the da to bargain on a half a dozen cases it was going to be close actually i would like to talk to you if you have a few minutes im on six to two tonight so ive got plenty of minutes good she stood easing by him to close the door the moment she turned back she realized hed taken that gesture the wrong way his hands went to her waist she had a moment to think that in a few years that combination of smooth moves and rough manners would devastate hordes of women then she managed to slip aside nick she began then hesitated sit down when he settled in her battered office chair she sat behind the desk were going on three weeks id like to know how youre feeling im cool what i mean is when we go back in front of judge beckett its very likely shell give you probation unless you make a big mistake in the meantime i dont plan on mistakes the chair creaked rustily as he leaned back going to jail isnt high on my list these days glad to hear it but she may also ask about your plans this might be the time to start thinking about that whether youd like to make the situation with zack more permanent permanent he gave a quick laugh hey i dont know about that ill probably want my own place you know zack and me well maybe were getting on a little better but he cramps my style kind of hard to have a lady over when big brother can walk in any time he flicked his green eyes over her face know what i mean an opening she thought and dived in do you have a girl his smile was very male and very attractive im more interested in women women with big brown eyes nick you know when i was walking over here i started to think how getting busted turned out to be a pretty lucky break he lifted her hand brushing his thumb over her knuckles before toying with her fingers his eyes never left hers otherwise i wouldnt have needed such a greatlooking lawyer nick im twentysix it wasnt what shed meant to say or how shed meant to say it but he only tilted his head yeah so and im your courtappointed guardian kind of an interesting situation his smile spread itll be over in about five weeks ill still be seven years older than you more like six he said easily but whos counting i am frustrated she started to rise then realized it would be best if she stayed in the position of authority behind the desk nick i like you very much and i meant what i said when i told you i wanted to be your friend you cant let the age thing bother you babe when he rose she realized shed miscalculated by staying behind the desk when he came around to sit on the edge of it she was trapped between him and the wall of course i can i was in college when you were starting puberty well ive finished now he grinned and traced his finger down her cheek and his eyes narrowed is that a bruise i ran into something she said and tried again the bottom line is im too old for you he frowned at the bruise another minute then lifted his eyes to hers i dont think so let me put it this way do you figure a woman shouldnt get tangled up with a guy six years older than she is thats entirely different sexist he said clucking his tongue here i figured youd be all for equal rights of course i am but she broke off with a hiss of breath gotcha regardless of age since that wasnt working she thought im your guardian and it would be wrong certainly unethical for me to encourage or agree to anything beyond that i care about what happens to you and if ive given you the impression that im interested in anything more than friendship im sorry he considered i guess you take your work pretty seriously yes i do i can dig it no pressure right relief made her sigh right she rose giving his hand a quick squeeze youre all right nick you too they both looked around when her phone began to shrill ill let you get back to serving justice he told her then had her mouth dropping open as he brought her hand to his lips five weeks isnt so long to wait but catch you later he strolled out leaving rachel wondering if it would help to beat her head against the wall nick was feeling great he had the whole day ahead of him money in his pocket and a gorgeous woman planted in his heart he had to grin when he thought about the way hed flustered her he hadnt realized it could be so satisfying to make a woman nervous and imagine a knockout like rachel worrying about her age shaking his head he jogged down to the subway maybe hed thought she was a couple of years younger but it didnt matter one way or the other everything about her was deadon perfect he wondered how zack would react when he saw nick lebeck strut into the bar one night with rachel on his arm he didnt imagine zack would think of him as a kid when everybody saw hed bagged a babe like rachel stanislaski wrong he told himself as he hopped on a car that would take him to times square that was no way to talk about a classy lady what theyd have was a relationship as the subway car rattled and squeaked he occupied himself by daydreaming about what theyd do together there would be dinners and long walks quiet talks theyd go listen to music and dance now and again theyd have a lazy evening snuggled up in front of the television nick considered it a sign of his commitment that he hadnt put sex at the top of the list on top of the world he came out into the bustle and blare of times square and decided to use some of his loose change for a little pinball the arcade was noisy and there was a loud rock backbeat blasting over the metallic sounds of beeps and buzzes though hed missed the freedom of being able to breeze into an arcade any time he chose he had to admit it felt good to be able to spend money hed earned no sneaking around no vague sense of guilt maybe he didnt have the gang to hang around with but he didnt feel nearly as lonely as hed thought he would it wasnt something hed admit out loud but he was getting a kick out of working in the kitchen with rio the big cook had plenty of stories many of them about zack when he listened to them nick almost felt as though hed been part of it of course he hadnt nick reminded himself using expert body english to play out the ball there was no possible way he could explain how miserable hed been when zack shipped out then hed had no one again his mother had tried he supposed but shed always been more shadow than substance in his life it had taken all her energy to put food on the table and clothes on his back shed had little of herself left over once that was done then there had been zack nick could still remember the first time hed seen his stepbrother in the kitchen of the bar zack had been sitting at the counter gobbling potato chips hed been tall and dark with an easy grin and a casually generous manner once nick had gotten up the courage to follow him around zack hadnt tried to shake him off it was zack whod brought him into an arcade the first time propped him up and shown him how to make the silver balls dance it was zack whod taken him to the macys parade zack who had patiently taught him to tie his shoes zack whod clobbered him when he chased a ball into traffic and it was zack who barely a year later had left him with a sick mother and an overbearing stepfather postcards and souvenirs hadnt filled the hole maybe zack wanted to make up for it nick thought with a shrug then swore when the ball slipped by the flipper and maybe deep down nick wanted to let him hey lebeck the slap on his shoulder nearly made nick lose the next ball where you been hiding ive been around nick sliced a quick glance at cash before concentrating on his game he wondered if cash would make any comment about him not wearing his cobra jacket yeah thought youd dropped down the sewer cash leaned against the machine as always appreciating nicks skill havent lost your touch ive got great hands ask the babes cash snorted and lighted a crushed cigarette his last since reece had copped less than ten cents on the dollar for the stolen merchandise cashs share was long gone man the chicks see that ugly face and you never get a chance to use your hands youve got your butt mixed up with my face nick eased back on his heels satisfied with his score and the free game hed finessed want to take this one sure after stepping behind the machine cash began to bull his way through the game you still hanging with your stepbrother yeah got a few more weeks before we go back to court cash lost the first ball and pumped up another you got a tough break nick i mean that man i feel real bad about the way it went down right no man really in his sincerity cash lost track of the ball and let it slip away we screwed up and you took the heat slightly mollified nick shrugged i can handle it still sucks but hey it cant be so bad working a bar plenty of juice right nick smiled he wasnt about to admit hed downed no more than two beers in the past three weeks and if zack got wind of that much thered be hell to pay you got it bro i guess the place does okay right i mean its popular and all does okay must be plenty of sexy ladies dropping in looking for action the neighborhood bar ran more to bluecollar workers and families but nick played along the place is lousy with them its pick and choose cash laughed appreciatively even as he blew his last ball want to go doubles why not nick dug in his pocket for more tokens so whats going on with the gang the usual tjs old man kicked him out so hes bunking with me jerk snores like a jackhammer man dont i know it i put up with him a couple of nights last summer couple of the hombres crossed over to our turf we handled them nick knew that meant fists maybe chains and bottles occasionally blades it was odd he thought but all that seemed so distant to him distant and useless yeah well was all he could think of to say some people never learn you know got a cigarette im tapped yeah top pocket nick racked up another ten thousand points while cash lit up hey i got a connection at this strip joint downtown could get you in yeah nick answered absently as he sent the ball bouncing sure id like to make that other business up to you maybe ill drop by one night and well hang out forget it no man really ill spring for the brew too dont tell me slippery lebeck cant slip out i can get out when i want just walk out the kitchen around the back yeah zacks usually tied up at the bar until three two on sundays i can get around rio when i want to or take the fire escape you got a place upstairs mmm your ball when they switched positions cash continued to question him making it casual the cash went in a safe in the office business usually peaked by one on wednesdays there were three ways in the front door the back and through the upstairs apartment by the time nick had trounced him three games in a row cash had all he needed he made his excuses and wandered out to meet with reece he didnt feel good about conning nick but he was a cobra chapter eight contents prev next zack stepped out of the shower grateful the endless afternoon was over he didnt mind paperwork or at least he didnt hate it well the truth was he hated it but accepted that it was a necessary evil hed made his orders paid his invoices and tallied his endofthemonth figures well maybe he was a week or so behind the end of the month but still he figured he was doing pretty well and so was the business it looked as though hed finally pulled it out of the hole his fathers illness and the resulting expenses had dug paying off the loan hed taken to square things for nick would pinch a little but in another year hed be able to do more than look at boats in catalogs he wondered how rachel would feel about taking a month off and sailing down to the caribbean he liked to imagine her lying out on the polished deck wearing some excuse for a bikini he liked the idea of watching her hair blow around her face when it caught the wind of course hed have to take some time to check the boat out test the rigging he thought hed be able to talk nick into a day sail or maybe a weekend he wanted the two of them to be able to get away away from the bar the city and the memories that tied them to both with a towel slung around his hips he walked to the bedroom to dress he hoped sincerely that the sunday dinner at the stanislaskis would crack the kids defenses a little more whenever rachel spoke about her family it made him think of what they of what nick had missed all the kid needed was a little time to see how things could be they were nearly halfway through the trial run and apart from a few skirmishes it had gone smoothly enough he had rachel to thank for that zack thought as he tugged on a pair of jeans he had rachel to thank for a lot of things not only had she given him a second chance with nick but shed added something incredible to his life something hed never expected to have something hed on a long breath he stared hard into the mirror when a man was going down for the third time he recognized the signs dont be an idiot muldoon he told his reflection keep it steady as she goes the lady wants to keep it simple and so do you it wouldnt do to forget it hot date feigning disinterest nick slouched against the doorjamb hed been passing and had caught the way zack was staring blindly into the mirror huh yeah i guess you could say that nick dragged a hand through his wet hair and scattered drops of water i didnt know you were back im on at six for reasons nick couldnt understand he was swamped by the memory of the times hed stood in the bathroom watching zack shave how it had made him feel when zack slapped shaving cream on his face rios got beef stew on special tonight too bad youll miss it zack grabbed a shirt you take my share or rioll make me eat it for breakfast nick grinned then remembered himself and smirked you take a lot of crap from him hes bigger than i am yeah right watching nick in the mirror zack buttoned his shirt he likes to think hes looking out for me it doesnt cost me anything to let him he ever tell you about how he got that scar down the side of his face he said something about a broken bottle and a drunk marine the drunk marine was going for my throat with that broken bottle rio got in his way the way i see it i owe rio a lot more than putting up with his nagging tucking in his shirt zack turned grinned and youre getting paid to put up with it hes okay nick would have liked to ask more like why a drunk marine had wanted to slice zacks throat but he was afraid zack would just shrug it off listen if you get lucky tonight dont worry about coming back zacks fingers paused on the snap of his jeans tucking his tongue in his cheek he wondered how rachel would take his brothers turn of phrase thanks for the thought but ill be home for bed check nick muttered call it what you want zack shot back then bit off an oath come hell or high water they were going to get through one conversation without raised voices listen i dont figure youre going to climb out the window hell you could do that while im here it could be the lady wont want company overnight mollified nick hooked his thumbs in his pockets they didnt teach you a hell of a lot in the navy did they bro in an old gesture theyd both nearly forgotten zack rubbed his knuckles over nicks head kiss my butt with his jacket slung over his shoulder he headed out and dont wait up im feeling lucky long after the door shut behind zack nick was still grinning rachel was just unlocking the outside door when zack strode up behind her good timing he said and pressed a kiss to the back of her neck for you maybe everything ran over today i was hoping to get back and soak in the tub before you got here you want to soak the minute they were in the elevator he had her against the wall go ahead ill scrub your back what a guy when his mouth closed over hers it hurt somewhere deep reminding her just how much shed wanted to be with him again you smell good must be these he pulled a paper cone filled with roses from behind his back her heart wanted to sigh but she resisted another bribe she couldnt resist the urge to bury her face in the blooms there was a guy selling them a couple of blocks down he looked like he could use a couple bucks softy she handed him her keys so that he could unlock her door and she could continue to sniff the roses keep it to yourself itll cost you after kicking the door closed with her foot she dumped her briefcase and laid the spray of roses on a table pay up muldoon she demanded tossing her arms around him there was such joy in it heat yes and the sweet sharp ache of need but the joy was so unexpected so fast and full that she laughed against his mouth as he twirled her around i missed you he continued to hold her inches off the floor oh yeah with her hands linked comfortably around his neck she smiled maybe i missed you too some how long are you going to hold me up here this way i can look right at you youre beautiful rachel it wasnt the words so much as the way he said them that brought a lump to her throat you dont have to soften me up i dont know how to tell you how beautiful except that sometimes when i look at you i remember how the sea looks right at sunrise when all that color spills out of the sky kind of seeps over the horizon and falls into the water just for a few minutes everythings so vivid so i dont know special when i look at you its like that her eyes had darkened with an emotion she couldnt begin to analyze all she could do was rest her cheek against his zack his name was a sigh and she knew she would cry any minute if she didnt lighten the mood roses and poetry all in one day i dont know what to say to you enchanted he buried his face in her hair thats a first were not going to get sloppy he finished for her laughing us are you kidding but when he sat on the couch he kept her cuddled in his lap let me see that bruise its nothing she said even as he tilted her head for a closer inspection the worst of it was that the word got out and i had to deal with all this sympathy and advice if those cops had kept their mouths shut i could have said id walked into a door take off the jacket and sweater she arched a brow youre such a romantic muldoon can it i want to see your neck its fine which is why youre wearing a sweater that comes up to your chin its very fashionable peel it off babe or ill have to do it for you her eyes lit ah threatening a public official after kicking off her shoes she tossed up her chin try it buster lets see how tough you are she didnt put up much of a fight but the initial wrestling was enough to arouse them both by the time he had her pinned to the couch her arms over her head and her wrists cuffed in his hand they were both breathing hard i took it easy on you she told him i could see that her jacket was crumpled on the floor beside them smiling zack began to inch her sweater upward letting his fingers skim over the silky material beneath her breath caught and released unsteadily thats not my neck she managed as his hand cupped and molded her breast just checking watching her always watching her he teased the nipple until it was hot and hard youre quick to the touch rachel his touch she thought trembling only his slowly determined to savor every moment he slipped the sweater up he released her wrists to tug it off then clasped them again zack he ignored her flexing hands my turn at the helm he said quietly i told you once i wanted to drive you crazy do you remember he was he already was i want to touch you you will he skimmed a fingertip over her neck first carefully studying the bruises they were fading to yellow i dont want to see you hurt again gently he lowered his head to trail a necklace of kisses over the marks not ever again it doesnt hurt her pulse jackhammered under his nuzzling lips i dont need to be seduced yes you do but youre afraid to be which makes the whole idea damn near irresistible youre just going to have to trust me he shifted so that he could unzip her skirt and slip it off i have places to take you his mouth lowered to hers rubbing then nibbling strange wonderful places then diving deep the journey wasnt calm but she had no choice but to go where he took her this eagerness for pleasure this immediacy of need was still so new that she had no defense against it his hand slid over her lingering here exploiting there while his mouth devoured hers with a relentless hunger no escape she thought desperately as he brought her close painfully close to that first tumultuous release she was trapped in him utterly lost in a tangled maze of sensations she writhed beneath his hand too steeped in her own needs to know how deliciously wanton her movements were i didnt have time to appreciate these last time zack trailed his fingers up the sheer stocking to the pristine white garter she would think them practical he knew he thought them erotic with an expert flick of his fingers that had her moaning he released one stocking then the other before tormenting them both by peeling them inch by lazy inch down her legs he had to kneel on the floor to taste her calves the backs of her knees the glorious satin skin of her thighs she cried out when he slid his tongue beneath her panties to sample the hot sensitive flesh underneath fighting impatience he tugged them off to give himself the freedom to taste more of her as the first wave swamped her she arched like a bow leaping into ukrainian when the aftershocks shuddered through her freed her hands groped for him until they were struggling together to strip off his clothes heat to heat she pressed against him overbalancing him until she straddled him and her mouth could merge hotly with his now was all he said all he could say as he gripped her hips i really did mean to take you out zack said when they lay on the couch in a tangle of limbs i bet he smiled recognized the sleepy satisfaction in her voice really we can get dressed and try again with a half laugh she pressed her lips to his chest his heart was still thundering youre not going anywhere muldoon not till im finished with you if you insist thats what free deliverys for how about chinese youre on whos going to get up and call she shifted for the pleasure of rubbing her cheek against his skin well flip for it he lost and rachel took advantage of the moment to grab a quick bracing shower when she came back her hair damp and curly a plain white terrycloth robe skimming her knees he was pouring them both a glass of wine i think im repeating myself he said offering her a glass but you sure look good wet hed tugged on his jeans but hadnt bothered with his shirt rachel trailed a finger down his chest you could have joined me wed have missed the delivery boy since hes bringing egg rolls you have a point she moved to the kitchen to get some plates then set them on the table by the window and i do have to refuel i only had time for a candy bar at lunch because the mood seemed right she lit candles nick dropped by the office oh i wish i had had more time she touched match to wick and watched the candle flare he caught me between phone calls and before a pleabargaining meeting he watched her move around the room in her practical terrycloth robe turning the light into romance with her candles he wondered if she realized how compelling that contrast was you dont have to explain to me rachel she shook out a match struck another it wasnt that she was superstitious but there was no use taking chances with three on a match i have to explain to myself he wanted to go to lunch and i just couldnt swing it i did talk to him about the situation about the fact that hes fallen in lust with you i wouldnt put it like that she sighed heavily when the intercom buzzed after flipping it on she released the security lock for the delivery boy hes simply misinterpreted gratitude and friendship zack took one long look at her in the candleglow whatever you say disgusted she went back to the table and sat youre buying muldoon he took out his wallet agreeably he had the tab and the tip ready when the delivery arrived after carrying three bulging bags to the table he unpacked the little white cartons in moments the air was filled with exotic aromas do you want to tell me the rest well rachel wound some noodles around her chopsticks i started off explaining the difference in our ages umm she chewed appreciatively he didnt buy it she said over a mouthful he had a very convincing argument and since i couldnt override it i changed tactics ive seen you in court he reminded her i explained the ethics of my being his guardian and how it wasnt possible for us to go beyond those terms thoughtful she scooped up some sweet and sour pork he seemed to understand that good i thought it was i mean he agreed with me he was very mature about it then when he was leaving he said how it wasnt so hard to wait five more weeks zack said nothing for a moment then with a half laugh he picked up his wine youve got to give the kid credit zack this is serious i know i know its sticky for both of us but you have to admire the way he turned it around on you i told you he was smooth after peeking in another carton she nibbled on some chilled chicken and bean sprouts dont you know any nice teenage girls you could nudge in his direction lolas got one zack said considering i think shes sixteen lola has a teenager three of them she likes to say she started young so that she could lose her mind before she turned forty i can feel her out about it it couldnt hurt im going to try again though im hoping the feeling will pass in another week or two i wouldnt count on it reaching across the table he linked his fingers with hers you stick in a mans mind does that mean youre thinking of me when youre mixing drinks and flirting with the customers i never flirt with pete she laughed i was thinking more of those two babes who drop in the blonde and the redhead they always order stingers you are observant counselor the redheads got her big green eyes on you theyre blue aha he shook his head amazed hed fallen so snugly into the trap it pays to know your regulars besides i like brown eyes especially when they lean toward gold she let his lips brush hers too late with her head close to his she laughed again its all right muldoon i can always borrow rios meat cleaver if you notice more than her eyes then im safe ive never paid any attention to those cute little freckles over her nose or that sexy dimple in her chin eyes narrowed rachel bit his lip get any lower and youll be in deep water thats okay im a strong swimmer hours later when zack crawled into a cold empty bed he warmed himself by thinking of it it had been nice just nice to laugh together over the cardboard boxes and chopsticks theyd sampled each others choices talking while the candles had burned low not about nick not about work but about dozens of other things then theyd made love again slowly sweetly while the night grew late around them hed had to leave her he had responsibilities but as he settled his body toward sleep he let his mind wander imagining what it could be like waking up with her feeling her stretch against him as the alarm rang watching her smiling to himself as she hurried around the apartment getting dressed for work shed be wearing one of those trim suits while they stood in the kitchen sharing coffee talking over their plans for the day sometimes theyd steal a quick lunch together because they both hated to have a whole day pass without touching when he could hed slip away from work so that he could walk home with her in the evening when he couldnt hed look forward to seeing her come through the door slide onto a stool at the bar where shed eat rios chili and flirt with him then they would go home together one balmy weekend they would set sail together hed teach her how to man the tiller theyd glide out over blue water with the sails billowing the waves were high as mountains rearing up to slap viciously at the ship the bellow of the wind was like a thousand women screaming burying a fear that he knew could be as destructive as the gale he scrambled over the pitching deck clinging to the slippery rail as he shouted orders the rain was lashing his face like a whip blinding him his redrimmed eyes stung from the salt water he knew the boat was out there radar had it but all he could see was wall after wall of deadly water the next wave swamped the deck sucking at him lightning cracked the sky like a bullet through glass the ship heeled he saw the seaman tumble heard the shout as his hands scrambled on the deck for purchase zack leaped snagging a sleeve then a wrist a line for gods sake get me a line and he was dragging the dead weight back from the rail wind and water wind and water there in a flash of lightning was the disabled boat lower the tow line make it fast as the lightning stuttered against the dark he could see three figures theyd lashed themselves on a man to the wheel a woman behind him a young girl to the mast they were fighting valiantly but a fortyfoot boat was no match for the fury of a hurricane at sea it was impossible to send out a launch he had to hope one of them could hold the boat steady while another secured the tow signal lights flashed instructions through the storm it happened fast another spear of lightning and the mast cracked falling like a tree under an ax horrified he watched the young girl being dragged with it into the swirling water no time to think pure instinct had zack grabbing a flotation device and diving into the face of the storm falling falling endlessly while the gale tumbled his body like dice in a gamblers hand black pitchblack then the white flare of lightning hitting a wall of water that felt like stone having it close relentlessly over your head like death zack awoke gasping for air and choking against the nightmare water sweat had soaked through to the sheets making him shiver in the chill with a groan he let his head fall back and waited for the first grinding ache of nausea to pass the room tilted once as he staggered to his feet from past experience zack knew to close his eyes until it righted again moving through the dark he went into the bathroom to splash the cold sweat from his face hey you okay nick was hovering in the doorway you sick or something no zack cupped a hand near the faucet catching enough water to ease his dry throat go back to bed nick hesitated studying zacks pale face you look sick damn it i said im fine beat it nicks eyes darkened with angry hurt before he swung away hey wait sorry zack let out a long breath nightmare puts me in a lousy mood you had a nightmare thats what i said embarrassed zack snatched up a towel to dry off it was hard for nick to imagine big bad zack having a nightmare or anything else that would make him sweat and go pale uh you want a drink yeah steadier now zack lowered the towel theres some of the old mans whiskey in the kitchen after a moment zack followed nick out he sat on the arm of a chair while nick splashed three fingers of whiskey into a tumbler he took it swallowed then hissed i cant figure out how he had a liver left at the end nick wished hed pulled pants over his briefs at least hed have had pockets to dip his hands into i think when he started to forget stuff it helped him to blame it on the whiskey instead of you know alzheimers yeah zack took another swallow let it lie on his tongue a moment so that his throat could get used to the idea i heard you thrashing around in there sounded pretty bad it was pretty bad zack tilted the glass watched the whiskey lap this way and that hurricane one mean bitch i never understood why they started naming them after guys too take it from me a hurricanes all woman he let his head fall back again let his eyes close its been nearly three years and i havent been able to shake this lady you want to nick cut himself off that should help you sleep zack knew what nick had wanted to ask and he did want to it might be best for both of them if they talked it through we were off of bermuda when we got the distress call we were the closest ship and the captain had to make a choice we turned back into the hurricane three civilians in a pleasure boat theyd been thrown off course and hadnt been able to make it to shore before the storm hit saying nothing nick sat on the arm of the couch so that he was facing his brother seventyfive knot winds and the seas they must have been forty feet ive been through a hurricane after its made landfall it can be bad real bad but its nothing like it is when its at sea you dont know scared until you see something like that hear something like that the lieutenant took a rap on the head it put him out we came close to losing some of the crew over the side sometimes it was black so black you couldnt see your own hands but you could see that water rising up then the lightning would hit and blind you how were you supposed to find them in all that we had them on radar the quartermaster couldve slipped that ship through the crack of dawn he was good we spotted them thirty degrees off to starboard theyd tied the kid little girl to the main mast the man and woman were fighting to keep it afloat but they were taking on water fast we had time i remember thinking we could pull it off then the mast cracked i thought i heard the girl scream but it was probably the wind because she went under pretty quick so i went in you went in nick repeated wideeyed you jumped in the water i was over the side before i thought about it i wasnt being a hero i just didnt think believe me if i had he let the words trail off then swallowed the rest of the whiskey it was like jumping off a skyscraper you dont think youre ever going to stop falling it was end over end forever giving you plenty of time to realize youve just killed yourself it was stupid if the wind had been wrong it would have just smashed me against the side of the ship but i was lucky and it tossed me toward the boat then i hit god it was like ramming fulllength into concrete he hadnt known until later that hed snapped his collarbone and dislocated his left shoulder i couldnt get my bearings the water kept heaving me around sucking me down it was so black the searchlight barely cut through there i was drowning and i couldnt even remember what i was doing it was blind luck that i found the mast she was all tangled up in the line i dont know how many times we went under while i was trying to get her loose my hands were numb and i was working blind then i had her and i managed to get the flotation on her they said i got the tow line secured but i dont remember i just remember hanging on to her and waiting for the next wave to finish us off next thing i was waking up in the infirmary the kid was sitting there wrapped in a blanket and holding my hand he smiled it helped to think about that part just that part she was one tough little monkey a damn admirals granddaughter you saved her life maybe for the first couple of months i jumped off that deck every time i closed my eyes now its only once or twice a year it still scares the breath out of me i didnt think you were scared of anything im scared of plenty zack said quietly as he met his brothers eyes for a while i was scared i wouldnt be able to stand on deck and look out at the water again i was scared to come back here knowing that once i did my whole life was going to change and im scared of ending up like the old man sick and feeble and used up i guess im scared youre going to walk out that door in a few weeks feeling the same about me you did when you walked in nick broke the gaze first staring over zacks shoulder at the shadowy wall i dont know how i feel you came back because you had to i stayed because there was no place else to go there was no arguing with the truth as far as zack could see nick had summed it up perfectly we never had much of a shot before you didnt hang around very long i couldnt get along with the old man you were the only one he cared about nick blurted out every day id have to hear about how great you were how you were making something out of yourself what a hero you were and how i was nothing he caught himself swallowed the need but thats cool you were his blood and i was just something that got dumped on him when my mother died he didnt feel that way he didnt zack insisted for gods sake nick when i lived with him he was never satisfied with me either i was here and my mother wasnt that was enough to make him miserable every time he looked at me hell he didnt mean it zack closed his eyes and missed the flicker of surprise that passed over nicks face it was just the way he was it took me years to realize he was always on my back because it was the only way he knew to be a father it was the same with you he wasnt my but this time nick trailed off without finishing the sentence or the thought toward the end he asked for you he really wanted to see you nick most of the times he came around like that he thought you were still a little kid and sometimes most times really he just got the two of us mixed up together then hed yell at me for both of us he said it with a smile a smile that nick didnt return im not blaming you for staying away or for holding all those years of criticism and complaints against him i understand that it was too late for him nick it doesnt have to be too late for you what does it matter to you youre all the family ive got he rose and laid a hand on nicks shoulder relaxing when it wasnt shoved off maybe when it comes right down to the bottom line youre all the family ive ever had i dont want to lose that i dont know how to be family nick murmured me either maybe we can figure it out together nick glanced up then away maybe were stuck with each other a few more weeks anyway it would do zack thought as he gave nicks shoulder a quick squeeze it would do for now thanks for the drink kid do me a favor and dont mention the nightmare business to anyone i can dig it nick watched zack start back toward the bedroom zack yeah he didnt know what he wanted to say just that it felt good that he felt good nothing night good night zack eased back into bed with a sigh certain hed sleep like a baby chapter nine contents prev next something had changed rachel couldnt put her finger on it but as she sat between zack and nick on the subway to brooklyn she knew there was something going on between them something different it made her nerves hum it made her wonder if shed made a mistake in bringing the problems of the men who flanked her into her parents home and her problem as well she admitted after all she wouldnt deny she cared about both of them more than what could be considered professional she felt a kinship with nick the youngersibling syndrome she supposed added to that shed been telling the simple truth when she confessed to zack that she had a weakness for bad boys she wanted to do more for nick lebeck than help him stay out of jail as for nicks big brother shed long since crossed all professional boundaries with him into what could only be termed a fullblown affair even sitting beside him in the rumbling car she thought about the last time theyd been together alone and it took no effort at all to imagine what it would be like the next time they could steal a few hours her mother was bound to sense it rachel mused nothing got past nadia stanislaski when it came to her children she wondered what her mother would think of him what she would think of the fact that her baby girl had taken a lover for two people who had vowed not to complicate matters she and zack had done a poor job of it rachel decided shed been so certain she could keep her priorities well in line accept the physical aspects of a relationship with a man she liked and respected without dwelling on the thorny issue of whathappensnext but she was thinking about zack too much already slotting herself as part of a couple when shed always been perfectly content to go along single now when she imagined moving along without him the picture turned dull and listless her problem rachel reminded herself after all they had made a pact and she never went back on her word it was something she would have to deal with when the time came much more immediate was the nagging sensation that the relationship of the men beside her had taken a fast turn without her being aware of it to offset the feeling she kept up a steady stream of conversation until they reached their stop its only a few blocks rachel said dragging her hair back as a brisk autumn wind swirled around them i hope you dont mind the walk zack lifted a brow i think we can handle it you seem nervous rachel she seem nervous to you nick pretty jumpy thats ridiculous she headed into the wind and the men fell in beside her its probably the thought of having a criminal type sit down to sunday dinner zack commented now shes going to have to count all the silverware shocked at the statement rachel started to respond but nick merely snorted and answered for himself if you ask me shes worried about inviting some irish sailor she has to worry if hell drink all the booze and pick a fight i can handle my liquor pal and i dont plan on picking a fight unless its with the cop nick crunched a dry leaf as it skittered across the sidewalk ill take the cop why theyre joking with each other rachel realized like brothers very much like brothers delighted she linked arms with both of them if either of you takes on alex youll be in for a surprise hes meaner than he looks and the only thing im nervous about is that i wont get my share of dinner ive seen both of you eat this from a woman who packs it away like a linebacker rachel narrowed her eyes at zack i merely have a healthy appetite he grinned down at her me too sugar she was wondering how to control the sudden leap of her heart rate when a car skidded to a halt in the street beside them hey the driver called out hey back rachel broke away to walk over to greet her brother and sisterinlaw bending into the tiny window of the mg she kissed mikhail and smiled at his wife still keeping him in line sydney cool and elegant beside her untamedlooking husband sydney smiled absolutely difficult jobs are my forte mikhail pinched his wifes thigh and nodded toward the sidewalk so whats the story there theyre my guests she gave mikhail a long warning look that she knew was wasted on him before calling to nick and zack come meet my brother and his longsuffering wife sydney mikhail this is zackary muldoon and nicholas lebeck his eyes shielded by dark glasses mikhail took a careful survey he had a brothers natural lack of faith in his sisters judgment which is the client today rachel said theyre both guests sydney leaned over and jammed her elbow sharply in mikhails ribs its very nice to meet you both of you youre in for quite a treat with nadias cooking so i hear zack kept his eyes on mikhail as he answered and lifted a proprietary hand to rachels shoulder mikhails fingers drummed on the steering wheel you own what a bar no actually im into white slavery that got a chuckle from nick before rachel shook her head go park your car as they retreated to the sidewalk nick smiled over at rachel i see what you mean now about older brothers being a pain must go with the position responsibility zack told him we just pass on the benefit of our experience no rachel said what you are is nosy amused she gestured toward the sound of voices and laughter mikhail and sydney were already at the door of the row house hugging and being hugged this is it when rachel spotted natasha she gave a cry of pleasure and dashed up the steps hanging back a little zack watched rachel embrace her sister natasha was slighter more delicately built with rich brown eyes misted with tears and tumbled raven curls raining down her back zacks first thought was that this could not be the mother of three rachel had described to him then a young boy of six or seven squeezed between the women and demanded attention you let in the cold this was bellowed from inside the house in a rumbling male voice that carried to the sidewalk and beyond you are not born in barn yes papa her voice sounded meek enough but rachel winked at her nephew as she lifted him up for a kiss my sister natasha she continued as they stood in the open doorway and my boyfriend brandon and she said when a toddler wandered up to hang on natashas legs katie you pick me up katie demanded homing in on nick okay she was already holding up her arms smiling flirtatiously nick cleared his throat and glanced at rachel for help when he only got a smile and a shrug he bent down awkwardly sure i guess an expert at such matters katie settled herself on his hip and wound an arm around his neck she enjoys men natasha explained when her father bellowed again she rolled her eyes come inside please zack was struck by the sounds and the scents home he realized this was a home and stepping inside made him realize hed never really had one himself the scents of ham and cloves and furniture polish the clash of mixed voices the carpet on the stairway leading to the second floor was worn at the edges testimony to the dozens of feet that had climbed up or down the furniture in the cramped living room was faded with sun and time crowded now with people a gleaming piano stood against one wall atop it was a bronze sculpture he recognized the faces of rachels family melded together cheek to cheek flanked by two older proud faces that could only be her parents he didnt know much about art but he understood that this represented a unity that could not be broken so you bring your friends then leave them in the cold yuri sat in an armchair cuddling a sprite of a girl his big workingmans arms nearly enveloped the pretty child who had a fairys blond hair and curious eyes its only a little cold rachel bent to kiss her father then the girl freddie you get prettier every time i see you freddie smiled and tried to pretend she wasnt staring at the young blond man who was holding her little sister but she had just turned thirteen and whole worlds were opening up to her rachel went through another round of introductions freddie turned the name nick lebeck over in her head while yuri shouted out orders alexi bring hot cider rachel take coats upstairs mikhail kiss your wife later go tell mama we have company within moments zack found himself seated on the couch scratching the ears of a big floppy dog named ivan and discussing the pros and cons of running a business with yuri nick felt desperately selfconscious with a baby on his knee she didnt seem to be in any hurry to get down and the little blond girl named freddie kept studying him with solemn gray eyes he glanced away wishing their mother would come along and do something anything katie snuggled up and began to toy with his earring pretty she said with a smile so sweet he couldnt help but respond i have earrings too see to show off her tiny gold hoops she turned her head this way and that cause im daddys little gypsy i bet unconsciously he lifted a hand to stroke her hair you kind of look like your aunt rachel i can take her freddie had worked up her courage and now she stood beside the couch smiling down at nick if shes bothering you nick merely moved his shoulders shes cool he struggled to find something to say the girl was chinadoll pretty he thought and as foreign to him as rachels ukraine uhyou dont look a whole lot like sisters freddies smile bloomed warm and her fledgling womans heart tapped a little faster hed noticed her mamas my stepmother technically i was about six when she and my father got married oh a step he thought that was something he knew about and sympathized with i guess it was a little rough on you though she was baffled freddie continued to smile after all he was talking to her and she thought he looked like a rock star why well you know nick found himself flustered under that steady gray stare having a stepmother a stepfamily thats just a word gathering her nerve she sat on the arm of the couch beside him we have a house in west virginia thats where dad met mama he teaches at the university and she owns a toy store have you ever been to west virginia nick was still stuck on her answer its just a word he could hear in the easy tone of her voice that she meant just that what oh no never been there inside the warm fragrant kitchen rachel was laughing with her sister katie certainly knows how to snag her man it was sweet the way he blushed here nadia thrust a bowl into her eldest daughters hands you make biscuits the boy had good eyes she said to rachel why is he in trouble sniffing a pot of simmering cabbage rachel smiled because he didnt have a mama and papa to yell at him and the older one nadia continued opening the oven to check her ham he has good eyes too and theyre on you maybe after smacking her daughters hand away nadia replaced the lid on the pot alex grumbles about them he grumbles about everything natasha cut shortening in the bowl and grinned i think its more to the point that rachel has her eye on zack every bit as much as he has his on her thanks a lot rachel said under her breath a woman who doesnt look at such a man needs glasses nadia said and made her daughters laugh when her curiosity got to be too much for her rachel opened the swinging door a crack and peeked out there was sydney sitting on the floor and keeping brandon entertained with a pile of race cars the men were huddled together arguing football freddie was perched on the arm of the sofa obviously in the first stages of infatuation with nick as for nick he seemed to have forgotten his embarrassment and was bouncing katie on his knee and zack she noted with a smile was leaning forward entrenched in the hot debate over the upcoming game by the time the table was set and groaning under the weight of platters of food zack was thoroughly fascinated with the stanislaskis they argued loudly but without any of the bitterness he remembered from his own confrontations with his father he discovered that mikhail was the artist who had crafted the sculpture on the piano as well as all the passionate pieces in rachels apartment yet he talked construction and building codes with his father not art natasha handled her children with a deft hand no one seemed to mind if brandon created a racket imitating race cars or if katie climbed all over the furniture but when it was time to stop they did so at little more than a word from their mother or father alex didnt seem like such a tough cop when he was being barraged by his familys teasing over his latest lady friend a woman mikhail claimed who had the iq of the cabbage he was heaping on his plate hey i dont mind that way i can do the thinking for her that earned an unladylike snort from rachel he wouldnt know how to handle a woman with a brain one day one will find him nadia predicted like sydney found my mikhail she didnt find me mikhail passed a bowl of boiled potatoes to his wife i found her she needed some spice in her life as i recall you needed someone to knock the chip off your shoulder it was always so yuri agreed shaking his fork he was a good boy but what is the word arrogant sydney suggested ah satisfied yuri dived into his meal but its not so bad for a man to be arrogant this is true nadia kept an eagle eye on katie who was concentrating on cutting her meat so long as he has a woman who is smarter is not hard to do female laughter and male catcalls had katie clapping her hands in delight nicholas nadia said pleased that he was going back for seconds you will go to school yes ah no maam she urged the basket of biscuits on him so you know what work you want i not exactly he is young nadia yuri said from across the table time to decide youre skinny he pursed his lips as he studied nick but have good arms you need work i give you job teach you to build speechless nick stared no one had ever offered to give him anything so casually the big broadfaced man who was plowing through the glazed ham didnt even know him thanks but im sort of working for zack it must be interesting to work in a bar brandon eat your vegetables or no more biscuits all the people you meet natasha continued saving katies glass from tipping on the floor without breaking rhythm you dont meet a whole lot of them in the kitchen nick muttered you have to be twentyone to tend bar or serve drinks zack reminded him noting nicks mutinous expression rachel broke in mama you should see zacks cook hes a giant from jamaica and he makes the most incredible food ive been trying to charm some recipes out of him i will give you one to trade make it the glaze for this ham and i guarantee hell give you anything zack sampled another bite its great you will take some home nadia ordered make sandwiches yes maam nick grinned rachel bided her time waiting until dinner was over and three of the four apple pies her mother had baked had been devoured with just a little urging nadia was persuaded to play the piano after a time she and spence played a duet the music flowing out over the sound of clattering dishes and conversation she saw the way nick glanced over watching listening as cleverly as a general aligning his troops she dropped down on the bench when spence and nadia took a break she held out a hand inviting nick to join her i shouldnt have had that second piece of pie she said with a sigh me either it was difficult to decide how to tell her the way the afternoon had made him feel he wouldnt have believed people lived this way your moms great yeah i think so very casually she turned and began to noodle with the keys she and papa love these sundays when we can all get together your dad he was saying how the house would get bigger when the kids left home but now he thinks theyll have to add on a couple of rooms to hold everyone i guess you get together like this a lot whenever we can they didnt seem to mind you brought me and zack along they like company she tried a chord wincing at the clash of notes this always looks so easy when spence or mama does it try this he put his hand over hers guiding her fingers ah better but i dont see how anyone can play different things with each hand at the same time you know you dont think about it that way you just have to let it happen well she trailed off and unable to resist he began to improvise blues when the music moved through him he forgot he was in a room crowded with people and let it take over even when the room fell silent he continued wrapped up in the pleasure of creating sound and feeling from the keys when he played he wasnt nick lebeck outcast he was someone he didnt really understand yet someone he couldnt quite see and yearned desperately to be always he eased into halfremembered tunes filling them out with his own interpretation letting the music swing with his mood from blues to boogiewoogie to jazz and back again when he paused grinning to himself from the sheer pleasure it had given him to play zack laid a hand on his shoulder and snapped him back to reality whered you learn to do that the amazement in zacks voice was reflected in his eyes i didnt know you could do that with a shrug nick wiped his suddenly nervous hands on his thighs i was just fooling around that was some fooling around cautious trying to put a label on the tone of zacks voice nick glanced back its no big deal grinning from ear to ear zack shook his head man to somebody who cant play chopsticks that was one whale of a big deal pride was bubbling through the amazement it was great really great the pleasure working its way into him made nick almost as uneasy as the criticism hed expected it was then he realized that everyone had stopped talking and was looking at him color crept into his cheeks look i said it was no big deal i was just banging on the keys that was some very talented banging with katie on his hip spencer moved to the piano ever think about studying seriously flabbergasted nick stared down at his hands it had been one thing to sit across the table from spencer kimball and another entirely to have the renowned composer discussing music with him no i mean not really i just fool around sometimes thats all youve got the touch and the ear catching rachels eye he passed her katie and changed positions with her so that he sat with nick on the edge of the piano bench know any muddy waters some you dig muddy waters sure he began to play the bass can you pick it up yeah nick laid his hands on the keys and grinned yeah not too shabby rachel murmured to zack he was still staring at his brother dumbfounded he never told me never a word when rachel reached for his hand he gripped hard i guess he did to you a little enough to make me want to try this i didnt know he was that good he really is isnt he overwhelmed he pressed his lips to rachels hair nick was too involved to notice though several pair of eyes observed the gesture looks like im going to have to get my hands on a piano rachel leaned her head against his shoulder youre all right muldoon it took him nearly a week to arrange it but taking another deep dip into his savings zack bought an upright piano with rachels help he dragged furniture around the apartment to make room for it puffing a bit her hands on her hips she surveyed the space they had cleared under the window i wonder if it wouldnt be better against that wall there youve already changed your mind three times this is it he took a long pull from a cold beer for better or worse youre not marrying the stupid piano youre arranging it and i really think keep thinking and ill pour this over your head he caught her chin to tilt her head up for a kiss and its not a stupid piano the guy assured me it was the best for the money dont get started on that again she eased closer to link her arms around his neck nick doesnt need a baby grand id just like to have done a little better for him muldoon she pressed her mouth to his you did good whens it supposed to get here twenty minutes ago wound up he began to pace if they blow this after i went through all that business to get nick out for a few hours rachel interrupted him amused and touched its going to be fine and i think it was inspired of you to use beer nuts to get him out of the way he was steaming with a grin zack dropped down on the couch argued with me for ten minutes about why the hell he had to go check on a missing delivery of beer nuts when he was getting paid to wash dishes i think hell forgive you when he gets back hey up there rios musical voice echoed up the stairway we got us one fine piano coming in best you come down and take a look rachel tried to stay out of the way though several times as they muscled and maneuvered the piano up those steep stairs she wanted to offer advice the best part was watching zack which she did the entire time the instrument was hauled set into place and tuned he worried over the piano like a mother hen wiping smudges from the surface opening and closing the lid on the bench that looks real fine rio folded his massive arms over his chest be good to have music when i cook you do right by that boy zack hes going to make himself somebody youll see now im going to fix us something special he grinned at rachel when you going to bring that mama of yours by here so we can talk food soon rachel promised shes going to bring you an old ukrainian recipe good then i give her my secret barbecue sauce i think she must be a fine woman he started out just as nick came clattering up the steps whats your hurry boy got a fire in your pocket damn beer nuts was all nick said as he pushed by he swung into the apartment ready for a fight listen bro the next time you want somebody to everything went out of his mind when he spotted the piano standing new and shiny under the window sorry about the wildgoose chase nervous zack jammed his hands in his pockets i wanted to get you out so we could get this in he shifted back on his heels when nick remained silent so what do you think nick swallowed hard what did you do rent it or something i bought it because his fingers itched to feel the keys he too stuck them in his pockets rachel nearly sighed they looked like two stray dogs that didnt know whether to fight or make friends you shouldnt have done that the strain in nicks voice made it come out curt and sharp why the hell not zack shot back his hands were now balled into fists and straining against denim its my money i thought it would be nice to have some music around here so do you want to try it out or not there was an ache spreading twisting in his gut and burning the back of his throat he had to get out i forgot something he muttered and strode stiffly out the door what the hell was that zack exploded he snatched up his beer then set it down again before he gave in to the temptation to hurl the bottle against the wall if that little son of a hold it rachels order snapped out as she thumped a fist against zacks chest oh the pair of you are a real prize he doesnt know how to say thank you and youre too stupid to see he was so overwhelmed he was practically on the verge of tears thats bull he all buttossed it back in my face idiot you gave him a dream its very possibly the first time anyone ever understood what he wanted deep down and gave him a shot at it he didnt know how to handle it zack any more than you would listen i he broke off and swore because it made sense what am i supposed to do now nothing cupping his face in her hands she pulled it toward hers to kiss him nothing at all im going to go talk to him okay she pulled back and started for the door rachel he took a deep breath before crossing to her i need you he watched surprise come into her eyes as he took her hands and brought them to his lips maybe i dont know how to handle that either something fluttered around her heart youre doing all right muldoon i dont think you understand he didnt either i really need you im right here but are you going to stay here once your obligation to nick is over the fluttering increased weve got a couple of weeks before we have to think about that its steady rachel she warned herself think it through its not just nick i care about she tightened her fingers on his briefly before drawing away let me go find him well talk about the rest of this later okay he stepped back from her and from what he was feeling but i think we are going to have to talk about it soon with a quick nod she hurried down the steps rio merely gestured toward the front of the bar and grateful she didnt have to talk for a moment she went out to look she found him standing on the sidewalk with his hands balled in his pockets staring at the lateafternoon traffic oh she knew a portion of what he was feeling how zackary muldoon could get inside you and pull your emotions apart before you had a chance to defend yourself later she promised herself she would think about what hed done to her emotions for now she would concentrate on nick she stepped up beside him and brushed at the hair on his shoulders you doing okay he didnt look at her just continued to watch the fits and starts of traffic why did he do that why do you think i didnt ask him for anything the best gifts are the ones we dont ask for he shifted meeting her eyes for the barest of moments did you talk him into it no trying to be patient she took him by the arms so that he had to face her open your eyes nick you saw the way he reacted when he heard you play he was so proud of you he could barely talk he wanted to give you something that would matter to you he didnt do it so youd be obligated to him but because he loves you thats what families do your family she gave him a quick shake and yours dont try to con me with that bull about not being real brothers you care just as much about him as he does about you i know how much it meant to you to walk in there and see that piano mama had the same look on her face on mothers day but it was easier for her to show what she was feeling you just need a little practice closing his eyes he laid his brow against hers i dont know what to say to him how to act nobodys ever ive never had anybody when i was a kid i just wanted to hang around him then he took off i know try to remember he wasnt much more than a kid himself when he did hes not going anywhere now rachel kissed both his cheeks as her mother might have done why dont you go back inside nick and do what you do best whats that she smiled at him play it by ear go on hes dying for you to try it out yeah okay he took a step back you coming no ive got some things to do some things to think about she thought correcting herself tell zack ill see him later but she waited after hed gone in standing on the sidewalk she watched the window and after a while very faintly she heard the sound of music chapter ten contents prev next yo rachel pete straightened on his stool and sucked in some of his comfortable stomach when he spotted rachel swinging through the front door of the bar how bout i buy you a drink i might just let you do that but her smile was for zack as she hung her coat on one of the hooks by the door as she crossed the room she shot a meaningful glance at the blonde who was seductively wrapped around a bar stool purring an order for another drink while she walked her fingers up zacks arm busy night lola juggled a tray as she passed that ones on her third stinger she said to rachel under her breath and those big blue eyes of hers have been crawling all over the boss for two hours thats all shell do unless she wants those eyes blackandblue lola gave a snap of appreciative laughter atta girl hey hold on a minute with a skill rachel admired lola served a full tray of drinks emptied ashtrays and replaced an empty basket of chips see the brunette by the juke with her lips pursed rachel studied the slim jeanclad hips and the waterfall of honeybrown hair dont tell me i have to worry about her too no do thats my oldest your daughter shes gorgeous yeah thats why i have to worry anyway zacks been hinting around about how hed like nick to meet some people closer to his own age so i talked her into coming in having one of rios burgers and nick looked actually he was pretty enthusiastic about busing tables tonight but he didnt make a move in her direction lookings good rachel mused it wouldnt bother you if he was interested enough to ask her out nicks okay besides my terri can take care of herself lola winked takes after her mom keep your pants on she shouted to the table of four that was signaling to her catch you later well now rachel eased onto the stool between harry and pete a glass of white wine was already waiting for her whats the latest sevenletter word for rapture harry told her ending in y rachel smiled into her wine ecstasy she said watching zack okay pleased with that he skimmed over the blank spaces in his puzzle heres another seven characterized by a lack of substance perfect she murmured shifting her gaze to the blonde who was leaning her cleavage over the bar try vacuous damn youre good harry she gave him a smile that had him going beet red im terrific keep an eye on things for me i want to talk to nick pete watched her go sighed if i was twenty years younger thirty pounds lighter didnt have a wife whod slit my wrists and still had all my hair yeah keep dreaming harry signaled for another round the minute she passed into the kitchen rachel took a deep breath it always smelled like heaven okay rio whats good tonight everythings always good he grinned wiping his big hands on his apron but tonight my fried chickens number one there must be a drumstick with my name on it hey nick now as at home here as she was in her mamas kitchen she eased against the counter where he was stacking the dishes hows it going by last count ive washed six thousand and eightytwo plates but he smiled when he said it zack mentioned you might be coming by tonight ive been looking for you rio handed her a plate heaped with fried chicken creamed potatoes and coleslaw if i came by any more often theyd have to roll me in and out the door you eat rio gestured with his spatula before he flipped burgers i like to see a woman with hips youre about to her willpower was nonexistent when she was faced with rios extraspicy chicken rachel began to eat where she stood definitely number one she said with her mouth full rio grinned so did you want to see me about anything in particular she asked nick no he brushed a hand down her hair i just wanted to see you whoops nick i really think weve only got a couple of weeks to go i know she shifted slightly putting the plate between them in fact i was able to speak to the da tell him about your progress he doesnt plan on making an objection to the suspended sentence and probation we expect from judge beckett i knew i could count on you but i wasnt just thinking about that she knew very well what he was thinking of and shed put off dealing with it long enough rio she set the plate aside i need to talk to nick for a minute can you handle things without him if we go upstairs no problem he just wash twice as fast when he come back she would be calm rachel promised herself as they started upstairs she would be logical and she would be in control okay nick she said the minute they stepped into the apartment and that was all she said because she found herself being thoroughly kissed stop her voice was muffled but it was firm and the hands she shoved against his shoulders did the rest ive missed you thats all he gentled his grip then released her completely when she stepped back its been a long time since we had a chance to be alone pressing her hands to her temples she sighed oh nick ive made a mess of this the confused churning of emotion was clear in her eyes as she stared at him i kept telling myself it would resolve itself even though i knew it wouldnt in a gesture that mirrored the helplessness she was feeling she let her hands drop to her sides i dont want to hurt you there was a quick warning twist in his gut people only said that stuff about not hurting you in that particular tone of voice when they were about to what are you talking about about you and me about you thinking theres a you and me she turned away hoping she could find the right words i tried to explain it to you before but i did a poor job of it you see initially i was so surprised that you would think of me that way i didnt with a sound of disgust she turned to face him again im not handling it any better now why dont you just say what you mean i care about you not only as my client but as a person that alltoofamiliar light came into his eyes i care about you too when he took a step toward her she lifted her hands palms out but not that way nick not romantically his eyes narrowed and she watched hurting as he absorbed the rejection youre not interested in me i am interested in you but not the way you think youd like me to be i get the picture trying to tough it out he hooked his thumbs in his front pockets you think im too young she thought about the way shed just been kissed and let out a long breath that argument doesnt seem altogether valid it should but youre not a typical teenager so what is it im just not your type when she thought of how much he and zack had in common she had to block a quick laugh that doesnt work either sorry that she was going to hurt him knowing she had to rachel did her best with the truth what i feel for you is the same sort of thing i feel for my brothers im sorry its not what you want nick but its all i can give she wanted to reach out touch his arm but she was afraid hed shrug her off im sorry too that i didnt put it just that way weeks ago i didnt seem to know how i feel like an idiot dont she couldnt keep herself from reaching out now taking his hand in hers theres nothing for you to feel like an idiot about you were attracted and you were honest about it and underneath all my confusion and dismay she added trying out a smile i was very flattered id rather you said you were tempted maybe her smile warmed squeezing his battered heart for a moment i hope it doesnt hurt you to have me say it but i do want to be your friend well you gave it to me straight and he supposed he would have to accept it a babe was just a babe he tried to tell himself but he knew there was no one else like rachel no hard feelings good she wanted to kiss him but figured it was best not to push her luck or his she did take his other hand i always wanted a younger brother he wasnt quite ready to take that position why for the purest of reasons she told him to have somebody i could push around when he smiled she felt the first genuine tug of relief come on get back to work she walked down with him certain they had progressed to the next stage to reassure herself she stayed in the kitchen for a few minutes pleased when she felt no lingering tension from nicks direction when she slipped out she looked immediately for zack in the office pete told her grinning you should go right on in thanks she was puzzled by the chuckles that rumbled around the bar but when she glanced back everyone looked busy and innocent too innocent rachel thought as she pushed open zacks office door he was there all right big as life standing in front of his shipshape desk there was a curvy blonde wrapped around him clinging like cellophane with one brow arched rachel took in the scene the blonde was doing her best to crawl up zacks body she nearly had him pinned to the desk and zack was tugging at the arms that roped his neck the expression on his face rachel mused a kind of baffled embarrassment was worth the price of admission all by itself listen honey i appreciate the offer really but im not he broke off when he spotted rachel that expression she decided was even better this one had traces of shock chagrin and apology all seasoned with a nice dollop of fear oh god he managed to pry one arm from around his neck and he tried to shake her off but she transferred her grip to his waist excuse me rachel said her tongue firmly in her cheek i can see youre busy damn it dont shut the door his eyes widened when the blonde shifted to give his bottom a nice intimate squeeze give me a break rachel you want a break she glanced back to where the regulars had moved closer craning their necks to catch the show he wants a break she told them very casually she strolled across the threshold which leg would you like me to break muldoon or would you prefer an arm maybe your neck have a heart the blonde was giggling now as she tugged at his sweater help me get her off shes plowed id think a big strong man like you could handle that all by yourself she moves like a damn eel he muttered come on babs let go ill call you a cab she was slithering over him rachel noted and with a sigh she took charge gripping the blondes artfully tangled mane in one hand she tugged hard the quick squeal of pain was very satisfying following up on it rachel shoved her face close youre trespassing dear babs weaved gave a glazedeyed grin i didnt see any signs consider yourself lucky i dont make you see stars using the hair as a leash rachel pulled the squeaking blonde to the door this way out ill take it from here lola slipped an arm around the blondes waist come on sweetie youre looking a little green hes just so damn cute babs sighed as she stumbled toward the ladies room with lola call her a cab zack shouted after one heated glare at the grinning faces of his customers he slammed the door shut listen rachel besides being mortified he was out of breath and he took a moment to steady himself it wasnt the way it looked oh the situation was too entertaining to resist she sauntered over to his desk scooted onto the edge and crossed her legs how did it look muldoon you know damn well he blew out a breath tucked his useless hands in his pockets she got herself wasted on a couple of stingers i came in to call her a cab and she followed me his brows drew together when rachel lifted a hand to examine her nails she attacked me want to press charges dont get cute with me as embarrassing moments went zack considered this in the top ten i was trying to defend myself i could see it was a pitched battle youre lucky you came out of it alive what was i supposed to do knock her cold he paced from one wall to the other i told her i wasnt interested but she wouldnt back off youre just so damn cute rachel said fluttering her lashes funny he tossed over his shoulder really funny youre going to play this one out all the way arent you bingo she picked up a letter opener from his desk tested the point thoughtfully as counsel for the defense i have to ask if you feel that strutting behind the bar in those snug black jeans i dont strut ill rephrase the question she flicked the tip of the letter opener with her thumb can you say and i remind you mr muldoon youre under oath can you tell this court you havent done anything to entice the defendant to make her believe you were available even willing i never well i might have before you as a man of the sea zack knew when to cut line he crossed his arms over his chest i take the fifth coward you bet he eyed the letter opener warily you dont plan to use that on any particularly sensitive part of my anatomy letting her gaze skim down rachel touched her tongue to her upper lip probably not his smile came slowly and was full of relief youre really not mad are you sugar that i walked in and found you in a compromising position with a blond bombshell after a quick laugh she shifted her grip on the letter opener why should i be mad sugar you may have saved my life he thought hed gauged her mood correctly but his approach was still cautious you dont know what she said she was going to do to me he gave a mock shudder and slipped his arms around her as if for support shes a yoga instructor oh my biting back a grin rachel patted his back what did she threaten you with well i think it went something like he leaned close to her ear whispering he heard rachels surprised chuckle and then oh my was all she could say she swallowed once do you think thats anatomically possible i think youd have to be doublejointed but we could give it a try wicked laughter gleaming in her eyes she tilted her head back i dont care what you say muldoon i think you liked being pawed uhuh he nuzzled her neck it was degrading i feel so cheap there there i saved you you were a regular viking and you know what they say about vikings she murmured as she turned her mouth to his go ahead he said invitingly use me oh i plan to the kiss was long and satisfying but as it began to heat he tore his mouth from hers to bury his face in her hair rachel you dont know how good you feel how right i know this feels right eyes shut tightly she held him close do you yes i think she let her words trail off into a sigh shed been doing a great deal of thinking over the past few days i think sometimes people just fit the way you told me once before he drew back cupping her face in his hands his eyes were very dark very intense on hers she wasnt entirely sure what she was reading in them but it made her heart triphammer into her throat we fit i know you said you didnt want to get involved that you have priorities she linked her fingers around his wrists i said a lot of things rachel i want you to move in with me he saw the surprise in her eyes and hurried on before she could answer i know you wanted to keep it simple so did i this doesnt have to be a complication youd have time to think about it we have to wait until everythings straightened out with nick but i need for you to know how much i want to be with you not just snatching time she let out an unsteady breath its a big step and you dont do things on impulse he lowered his lips to brush hers think about it think about this he whispered and took the kiss deep deep fathoms deep until thinking was impossible zack i need to nick burst into the office and froze he saw rachel pressed against his brother her hands fisted in his hair her eyes soft and clouded they cleared quickly enough and now there was alarm there and apology but as nick stared at them all he could see was the red mist of betrayal she shouted his name as nick leaped zack saw the blow coming and he let it connect it rocked him back on his heels he tasted blood instinct had him gripping nicks wrists to prevent another punch but nick twisted away agile as a snake and braced for the next round stop it heedless that the next fist could fly any second rachel stepped furiously between them shoving them apart this isnt the way clamping down on his own temper zack merely lifted her up and set her aside stay clear you want to go a round in here he said to nick or take it outside of all the anywhere you say nick snapped cutting rachel off you son of a bitch it was always you he shoved but the bright hurt in his eyes kept zack from striking back you always had to come out on top didnt you his breathing was labored as he rammed zack back against the wall all this crap about family well you know where you can stick it bro nick please rachel lifted a hand but let it drop when he turned those furious eyes on her just shut up that whole line of bull you handed me upstairs youve got real talent lady because i was buying it you knew how i felt and all the time youre making it with him behind my back nick it wasnt like that you lying bitch his head snapped back when zack clipped him with a backhand there was blood on both sides now you want to take a swing at me go ahead but you dont talk to her like that teeth gritted nick wiped the blood from his lip he wanted to hate needed to the hell with you the hell with both of you he swung on his heel and darted out oh god rachel covered her face but it did nothing to erase the image of the hurt shed seen in nicks eyes the damage she thought miserably that she had done what a mess im going after him leave him alone its my fault she said dropping her arms to her sides i have to try i said leave him alone damn it zack excuse me there was a rap on the door which nick had left hanging open rachel turned and bit back a groan judge beckett good evening ms stanislaski mr muldoon i dropped in for one of your famous manhattans perhaps you could mix one for me while i have a conference with your brothers attorney your honor rachel began my client i saw your client as he roared out of here your mouths bleeding mr muldoon she turned and shot a look at rachel counselor perfect timing rachel said under her breath ill handle this she said to zack dont worry and once nick works off a little steam hell come back smiling zack finished his temper was fading but guilt was moving full steam ahead i dont think so and its not your fault he wished he had more than his own empty sense of failure to give her hes my brother im responsible he shook his head before she could speak let me go fix the judge her drink he brushed by her rachel reached out to stop him then let her hand fall away there was nothing she could say to ease the hurt but she had a chance to minimize the damage with judge beckett she found the judge looking attractive and relaxed at a table on the far side of the bar yet the aura of power the woman had when wearing black robes on the bench wasnt diminished in the least by the trim blue slacks and white sweater she wore tonight have a seat counselor thank you beckett smiled tapping rosetipped nails on the edge of the table i can see the wheels turning how much do i tell her how much do i evade i always enjoy having you in my courtroom ms stanislaski you have style thank you rachel said again their drinks arrived and she took the time while they were served to gather her thoughts im afraid you might understandably misinterpret what you saw tonight your honor are you with a smile beckett sampled her drink she shifted her gaze to meet zacks and sent him an approving smile and what would you consider my interpretation obviously nick and his brother were arguing fighting beckett corrected stirring the cherry around in her drink before biting it from its stem arguing involves words and while words may leave scars they dont draw blood you dont have brothers do you your honor no i dont i do with a lift of a brow beckett sipped again all right ill sustain that what were they arguing about rachel eased around the boggy ground it was just a misunderstanding i wont deny both of them are hotheaded and that with their type of temperament a misunderstanding can sometimes evolve into an argument beckett suggested yes needing to make her point rachel leaned forward judge beckett nick has been making such incredible progress when i was first assigned to his case i very nearly dismissed him as just another street punk but there was something that made me reevaluate him haunted eyes do that to a woman surprised rachel blinked yes go on he was so young and yet hed already started to give up on himself and everyone else after i met zack and found out about nicks background it was easy to understand theres never been anyone permanent in his life anyone he felt he could count on and trust but with zack he wanted to no matter how tough and disinterested he tried to act the longer he was with zack the more you could see that they needed each other just how involved are you with your coguardian with her face carefully blank rachel sat back in her seat i believe thats irrelevant do you well she gestured with her hand continue for nearly two months nick has stayed out of trouble hes been handling the responsibilities zack has given him hes developing outside interests he plays the piano does he zack bought him one when he found out that doesnt seem like something that would make fists fly a faint smile played around her mouth as she gestured with her manhattan youre dodging the point counselor i want you to understand that this probationary period has been successful what happened tonight was simply a product of misunderstandings and hot tempers it was the exception rather than the rule youre not in court no your honor but i dont want you to hold this against my client when i am agreed pleased with what she saw in rachel what she heard and what she sensed beckett rattled the ice in her glass explain tonight it was my fault rachel said pushing her wine aside it was poor judgment on my part that caused nick to feel to believe he felt something beckett pursed her lips i begin to see hes a healthy young man and youre an attractive woman whos shown an interest in him and i blew it rachel said bitterly i thought id handled it i was so damn sure i was on top of everything i know the feeling beckett sampled a beer nut thoughtfully off the record start at the beginning hoping her own culpability would lighten nicks load even if it got her thrown off the case rachel explained beckett said nothing only nodding or making interested noises now and again and when he walked into the office and saw zack and me together she concluded all he saw was betrayal i know i had no right to become involved with zack excuses dont cut it rachel youre an excellent attorney that doesnt preclude your having a private life when it endangers my relationship with a client dont interrupt ill grant that you may have exercised poor judgment in this instance ill also grant that one cant always choose the time place or circumstances for falling in love i didnt say i was in love beckett smiled i noticed that its easier to beat yourself up about it if you tell yourself love had nothing to do with it her smile widened no rebuttal counselor just as well because i havent finished i could tell you youve lost your objectivity but you already know that i for one am not entirely sure objectivity is always the answer there are so many shades between right and wrong finding the one that fits is something we struggle with every day your client is trying to find his you may not be able to help i dont want to let him down better you should do whats possible to prevent him from letting himself down sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt youll discover how often it doesnt when its your turn to sit on the bench the understanding in becketts eyes had rachel reaching for her wine again i didnt know i was that transparent oh to one whos been there certainly amused beckett tapped her glass against rachels a few more years of seasoning counselor and youll make quite a competent judge that is what you want yes she met becketts eyes levelly thats exactly what i want good now since ive had a drink and im feeling rather mellow ill tell you something off the record it was almost thirty years ago that i was you so very close to who and what you are things were more difficult for women in our position than they are now theyre far from perfect now she added setting her glass aside but some of the battles are over i had to make choices those professionalversuspersonal choices that men rarely have to make do i have a family or do i have a career i dont regret choosing my career she glanced back at the bar at zack and sighed or only rarely but times change and even a professionally ambitious woman doesnt have to make an eitheror decision she can have both if shes clever you strike me as a clever woman i like to think so rachel murmured but it doesnt make it any less terrifying that kind of terror makes life worthwhile i dont think nerves will stop you counselor i dont think anything will in the meantime see that you and your client are prepared for the hearing when beckett rose rachel was instantly on her feet judge beckett about tonight i came in for a drink its a nice bar clean friendly as for my decision that will depend on what i see and hear in my courtroom understood yes thank you tell mr muldoon he makes an excellent manhattan with her emotions still in a state of upheaval rachel watched beckett stroll out how bad is it zack asked from behind her rachel merely shook her head reaching back to take his hand she likes the way you mix a drink turning to him she comforted him with a hug and i think ive just met another intelligent woman with a weakness for bad boys its going to be all right if nick doesnt come back hell be back she needed to believe it needed to make zack believe it hes mad and hes hurt but hes not stupid she gave his hand another quick squeeze and smiled up at him hes too much like you i shouldnt have hit him intellectually i agree emotionally because passion was a part of her life she shrugged it off ive seen my brothers pound on each other too often to believe its the end of the world ive got to go she touched a gentle kiss to his swollen lip when he comes back its probably best if im not here but i want you to call me when he shows up no matter what time it is i dont like you going home alone he said as he walked with her to where her coat was hanging ill take a cab the fact that he didnt argue made her realize just how distracted he was were going to work this out zack trust me yeah ill call you she stepped outside and headed down to the corner to hail a cab trust me shed told him she could only hope she deserved that trust chapter eleven contents prev next she nearly called alex when she got home but she was afraid that if her brother put out feelers even unofficially nick would only be more furious all she could do was wait and wait alone an odd triangle they made she thought as she wandered restlessly around her apartment with a rapidly cooling cup of tea nick young and defiant seeing rejection and betrayal everywhere even as he looked so desperately for his place in the world and zack so innately generous so fueled by passion and so vulnerable to his brother and herself the objective logical and ambitious attorney whod fallen in love with them both maybe she should be writing soap operas she thought as she dropped down on the couch she curled up her legs cupping her mug in both hands if she had the imagination for that at least she might be able to write herself out of this situation oh how had it happened she wondered and closed her tired eyes she was the one who had had things aligned so clearly hadnt she always known exactly where she was going and how she was going to get there every obstacle that could possibly block her path had been considered and weighed all the options all the ways of going around or through those obstacles had been calculated all of them except zackary muldoon by becoming involved with him by letting her emotions rule her head shed made a mess of everything it was entirely possible that nick pumped by hurt and frustration would race headlong into trouble before the night was over however understanding and compassionate judge beckett was if nick broke his probation she would have no choice but to sentence him even if the sentence was light how could she forgive herself how could zack forgive her for failing and worst of all how could nick rebound from that final rejection when society put him behind bars she wanted to believe hed go back to zack angry yes defiant certainly maybe even spoiling for a fight all those things could be dealt with if only he went back but if he didnt the sound of her buzzer had her jolting well aware that it was after midnight she unfolded herself hoping it was zack coming by to tell her nick was safe and sound yes i want to come up it was nicks voice edgy and demanding rachel had to bite back a cry of relief sure she kept her tone light as she released the lock come ahead she pressed her fingers against her eyes to push back the tears that filled them it was stupid to get so emotional hadnt logic told her hed have to come back hadnt she said as much to zack but when the knock rapped sharply at her door she was swinging it open and the words were tumbling out i was so worried i was going to go after you but i didnt know where to start to look oh nick im sorry im so sorry sorry it blew up in your face he shoved the door closed behind him he hadnt intended to come here but hed been walking walking then it had seemed like the only place to go sorry i came in and found you with zack it was far from over rachel realized what she saw in his eyes was just as dangerous as what had been in them when hed leaped across the office at zack im sorry i hurt you youre sorry i found out what you really are youre nothing but a liar i never lied to you every time you opened your mouth he hadnt moved away from the door and his hands were balled into fists whiteknuckled at his side you and zack the whole time you were pretending to care about me acting as if you liked being with me you were making it with him i do care she began but he cut her off i can see what a kick the two of you mustve gotten out of it poor pathetic nick mooning around trying to make something of himself because he had a case on the sexy lawyer i guess the two of you lay in bed and laughed yourself sick no it was never like that are you going to tell me you didnt go to bed with him he saw the truth in her eyes before her own temper kicked in youre out of line im not going to discuss his hands shot out snatching the lapels of her robe and swinging her around her back rammed hard into the door the first bubble of fear evaporated in her throat as nick pushed his face close to hers all she could see was his eyes sharp green and glinting with fury why did you do it why did you have to make a fool out of me why did it have to be my brother nick she had his wrists now and she tried to drag them away but rage had added weight to his sinewy strength do you know how it makes me feel to know that while i was imagining us you were with him and he knew he knew her breath was hitching but she fought to control it youre hurting me she thought the statement would come out calm even authoritative instead it was shaky and the fear underneath it clear even in his reckless state his eyes went blank for a moment then focused on his hands they were digging into her shoulders appalled he pulled them away and stared at her im going sometimes all you had was impulse rachel went with it and pressed her back against the door dont please dont go like this there was a churning in his stomach that was pure selfloathing i never pushed a woman around before its as low as it gets you didnt hurt me im okay what she was he noted was deathly pale youre shaking okay im shaking can we sit down i shouldnt have come here rachel i shouldnt have jumped on you that way im glad you came lets leave it at that for a minute please lets sit down because he was afraid shed stay pressed against the door trembling until he agreed he nodded youve got some things to toss back at me i figure i owe you that as he sat his shoulders slumped i guess youll ask to be taken off the case that has nothing to do with this but no she thought about picking up her cold tea but she was afraid her hands werent steady enough this is personal nick im the one who screwed up by blurring the lines i knew better theres no excuse inhaling deeply she linked her fingers in her lap what happened between zack and me wasnt planned and it certainly wasnt professional he gave a quick snort now youre going to tell me you couldnt help yourself no she said quietly i could have theres always a choice i didnt want to help myself her answer and the tone of it had him frowning hed been certain she would try to find an easy way out so you chose him what happened was immediate and maybe a little overwhelming she wasnt certain there were words to describe what had happened between her and zack in any case i could have stopped it or at least postponed it i didnt and that fault lies with me the fact that we were both your guardians made it a poor call but she shook her head no buts it was a poor call her eyes met his pleaded for trust we never thought of you as poor or pathetic we never laughed at you whatever you think of me dont let it ruin what youve started to get back with zack he moved in on me nick her voice held both patience and compassion he didnt you know he didnt he did know wondered if he had always known that his relationship with rachel had never been anything more than a fantasy but knowing it didnt ease the raw wounds of rejection i cared about you i know her eyes filled again and spilled over before she could prevent it im sorry god rachel dont he didnt think he could stand it first hed terrified her and now he was making her cry dont do that i wont but as quickly as she swiped at the tears more fell i just feel so lousy about it all when i look back i can see a dozen ways i shouldve handled things im usually in control her breath hitched as she fought for composure i hate i really hate that ive come between the two of you hey come on he was totally at a loss when he rose to cross to her he was surprised he didnt leave a trail of slime on her rug listen take it easy okay he patted her shoulder awkwardly ive been dumped before all that did was force her to fumble in the pocket of her robe for a tissue dont hate him because of this dont ask for miracles oh nick if you could only see through all the mistakes to what you mean to him no lectures since her tears seemed to be drying up he felt he could take a stand on that you carry on like youre in love with him he was stunned when he saw the look in her eyes the miserable heartsick look before they rilled again oh man while she crumpled into sobs he readjusted his thinking you mean its not just sex it was supposed to be his arm went around her tentatively and she leaned into it oh god how did i get into all this i dont want to be in love with anybody thats rough it occurred to nick that he was holding her close but there werent any tingles or tugs the hell of it was he was feeling almost brotherly no one had ever cried on his shoulder before or looked to him for support how about him is he stuck in the same groove i dont know she sniffled blew her nose we havent talked about it we arent going to talk about it the whole things ridiculous im ridiculous thoroughly ashamed she eased back lets just say its been an emotional night all around please dont say anything to him about this i figure thats up to you good i appreciate it still shaky she wiped at a stray tear with the back of her hand dont hate me too much i dont hate you he leaned back suddenly exhausted i dont know what i feel maybe i thought i could come up here tonight and prove to you i was the better man pretty stupid youre both pretty special she told him why else would a nice sensible woman like me fall for both of you he turned his head to give her a weak smile you sure can pick em yeah she touched his cheek i sure can tell me youre going back his lips flattened where else would i go that didnt satisfy her tell me youre going back to talk things through with him to work things out i cant tell you that when he started to stand she took his hand let me go back with you i want to help i need to feel as though ive made some of this up to the two of you you didnt do anything but fall for the wrong guy she took a great deal of comfort from the familiar smirk you may be right let me come anyway suit yourself you might want to wash your face your eyes are red great give me five minutes rachel could feel nick start to tense up half a block from lower the boom his shoulders were hunched his brows were lowered his hands were jammed in his pockets typical she thought the male animal ruffles his fur and bares his teeth to show the opposing male how tough he is she kept the observation to herself knowing neither of these males would appreciate it heres the idea she said pausing by the door it was a pretty slow night and its already after one well wait until the bar closes and you two can say your piece ill be mediator nick wondered if she had any idea how hard it was for him to face what was on the other side of that door whatever and if there are any punches thrown she added as she pulled the door open ill throw them that brought the ghost of a smile to his face it faded as soon as they stepped in rachel had been right it was a slow night as it often was in the middle of the week most of the regulars had already headed off to home and hearth a few diehards lingered at the bar which zack was manning alone lola was busy wiping down the tables she glanced up shot rachel a satisfied look then went back to work zack took a pull from a bottle of mineral water rachel saw his eyes change recognized the relief in them before the shutters came down hey barkeep rachel slid onto a stool got any coffee sure make it two she said sending a meaningful glance in nicks direction he said nothing but he did sit beside her theres an old ukrainian tradition she began when zack set the cups on the bar its called a family meeting are you up for it yeah zack inclined his head toward his brother i guess i can handle it what about you im here nick muttered hey a man obviously well on his way to being drunk leaned heavily on the bar a few stools away am i going to get another bourbon over here nope carrying the pot zack crossed over but you can have coffee on the house the man scowled through redrimmed eyes what the hell are you a social worker thats me i said i want a damn drink youre not going to get another one here the drunk reached out and grabbed a handful of zacks sweater considering zacks size rachel took this to be a testament to the bourbon already in his system this a bar or a church something flickered in zacks eyes rachel recognized it and was slipping out of her seat when nick clamped a warning hand on hers hell handle it he said simply zack lowered his gaze to the hands on his sweater then shifted it back to the irate customers face when he spoke his voice was surprisingly mild funny you should ask i knew this guy once down in new orleans he favored bourbon too one night he went from bar to bar knocking them back then staggering back out on the street story goes that he got so blind drunk he wandered into a church thinking it was another bar weaved his way up to the front you know where the altar is slammed his fist down and ordered himself a double then he dropped dead stone dead zack pried the fingers from his sweater the way i figure it if you drink enough bourbon so you dont know where you are you could wake up dead in church the man swore and snatched up the coffee i know where the hell i am thats good news we hate hauling out corpses rachel heard nicks muffled chuckle and grinned truth or lie she whispered probably some of both he always knows how to handle the drunks he wasnt doing very well with the blonde earlier what blonde another story rachel said and smiled into her coffee another time listen would you be more comfortable doing this upstairs or she broke off when she heard a crash from the kitchen lord it sounds like rio knocked over the refrigerator she started to rise and go check then froze the kitchen door swung open rio staggered out blood running down his face from a wound on his forehead behind him was a man in a stocking mask he was holding a very large gun to rios throat party time he snarled then shoved the big man forward with the butt of the gun jumped me rio said in disgust as he staggered against the bar come in front upstairs there was a quick giggle as two more armed men their features distorted by their nylon masks stepped in dont anybody move one of them accentuated the order by blasting away at the ships bell over the bar it clanged wildly lock the front door you jerk the first man gestured furiously and no shooting unless i say so everybody empty their pockets on the bar make it fast he gestured the third man into position so that the whole bar was covered wallets jewelry too hey you he lifted the barrel of the gun toward lola dump out those tips sweetheart you look like youd earn plenty nick didnt move couldnt he knew the voice despite the distorted features all three gunmen were easy for him to recognize tjs giggle and shambling walk cashs battered denim jacket the scar on reeces wrist where an hombre blade had caught him these were his friends his family what the hell are you doing he demanded as tj pranced around the bar scooping the take into a laundry bag empty them reece demanded youve got to be crazy do it he swung the barrel toward rachel and shut the hell up nick kept his eyes on reece as he complied this is the end man you crossed the line behind the mask reece only grinned on the floor he shouted facedown hands behind your heads not you he said to zack you empty out the cash register and you he grabbed rachels arm you look like mighty fine insurance anybody gets any ideas i cash her in leave her the hell nick zacks quick and quiet order cut him off back off as he emptied the till he watched reece you dont need her but i like her rachel swallowed as the hand tightened on her arm squeezing experimentally fresh meat he called out smacking his lips tj erupted into giggles maybe well take you along with us sweet thing show you a real good time the furious retort burned the tip of her tongue rachel gritted her teeth against it the heel of her foot on his instep she thought an elbow to his windpipe she could do it and the idea of taking him out had her blood pumping fast but if she did she knew the other two would open fire when nick strained forward reece locked his arm around rachels throat try it dishwasher his teeth flashed in a brutal challenge do it man take me on cool it reeces attitude toward the woman was making cash nervous come on we came for the money just the money i take what i want he watched as tj scooped the contents of the till into his sack wheres the rest slow night zack told him dont push me man theres a safe in the office open it fine zack moved slowly passing through the opening of the bar he had to control the urge to fight to grab the little sneeringvoiced punk and pound his face to pulp ill open it as soon as you let her go i got the gun reece reminded him i give the orders youve got the gun zack agreed ive got the combination you want whats in the safe you let her go go on cash urged his hands were sweating on the gun he held we dont need the babe shake her loose reece felt his power slipping as zack continued to watch him with cold blue eyes he wanted to make them tremble all of them he wanted them to cry and beg he was the head of the cobras he was in charge nobody was going to tell him any different open it he said between his teeth or ill blow a hole in you you wont get whats inside that way out of the corner of his eye zack saw rio shift from his prone position the big man was braced for whatever came this is my place zack continued i dont want anyone hurt in my place you let the lady go and you can take what you want lets trash the dump tj shouted and swung his gun at the glasses hanging over the bar shards went flying amusing him enough to have him breaking more lets kick butt and trash it he grabbed up a vodka on the rocks and slurped it down then howling he hurled the glass to the floor the sound of the wreckage and the muffled cries of the hostages on the floor pumped reece full of adrenaline yeah well trash this dump good over cashs halfhearted objections he fired at the overhead television blasting out the screen thats what im going to do to the safe i dont need a damn woman he shoved rachel aside and she overbalanced landing on her hands and knees and i dont need you he swung the gun toward zack savoring the moment he was about to take a life and that was new and darkly exciting this is how i give orders even as zack braced to jump nick was springing to his feet like a sprinter off the mark he lunged hurling full force into zack as reeces gun exploded there were screams dozens of them rachel swung out with a chair unaware that one of them was her own she felt the chair connect heard a grunt of pain she caught a glimpse of the mountain that was rio whiz past but she was already scrambling over to where zack and nick lay limp on the floor she saw the blood smelled it her hands were smeared with it the room was like a madhouse around her shouts crashes running feet she heard someone weeping someone else being sick oh god oh please she was pressing her hands against nicks chest as zack sat up shaking his head clear rachel youre then he saw his brother sprawled on the floor his face ghostly pale and the blood seeping rapidly through his shirt no nick no panicked zack grabbed for him fighting rachel off as she tried to press her hands to the wound stop you have to stop listen to me keep your hands there keep the pressure on ill get a towel with prayers whirling in her head she scrambled up to her feet and dashed behind the bar call an ambulance she shouted tell them to hurry because terror left no room for fumbling she clamped down on it kneeling by zack she pushed his hands aside and pressed the folded towel on nicks wound hes young hes strong the tears were falling even as she felt frantically for nicks pulse were not going to let him go zack rio crouched down they got away from me im sorry ill go after them no revenge glittered in his eyes ill go after them later get me a blanket for him rio and more towels ive got some lola passed them to rachel then dropped a hand on zacks head hes a hero zack we dont let our heroes die he got in the way zack said as grief welled into his throat damn kid was always getting in the way he looked at rachel then covered her hands with his over his brothers chest i cant lose him you wont she heard the first wail of sirens and shuddered with relief we wont endless hours in the waiting room pacing smoking drinking bitter coffee zack could still see how pale nick had been when they rushed him through emergency and into an elevator that snapped shut in zacks face helpless hospitals always made him feel so helpless only a year had passed since hed watched his father die in one slowly inevitably pitifully but not nick he could cling to that nick was young and death wasnt inevitable when you were young but the blood there had been so much blood he looked down at the hands that hed scrubbed clean and could still see his brothers life splattered across them in his hands that was all he could think nicks life had been in his hands zack he stiffened when rachel came up behind him and rubbed his shoulders how about a walk some fresh air he just shook his head she didnt press it was useless to suggest he try to rest she couldnt her eyes were burning but she knew that if she closed them she would see that last horrible instant the gun swinging toward zack nick leaping the explosion the blood im going to find food rio pushed himself off the sagging sofa the white bandage gleamed against his dark brow and youre going to eat what i bring you that boys going to need tending soon you cant tend when youre sick with his lips pressed tightly together he marched out into the hallway hes crazy about nick zack said half to himself its eating at him that he didnt round up three armed men all by himself well find them zack i thought he would hurt you i saw it in his eyes that kind of sickness cant be disguised by a mask he was going to hurt somebody wanted to hurt somebody and he had you i never even thought about nick its not your fault no she said sharply when he tried to pull away i wont let you do that to yourself there were a lot of people in that bar and you were doing your best to protect all of them what happened to nick happened because he was trying to protect you youre not going to turn an act of love into blame this time when she put her arms around him he went into them i need to talk to him i dont think i could handle it if i dont get to talk to him youre going to have plenty of time to talk im sorry alex hesitated at the doorway his heart was thumping as it had been ever since hed gotten the news rachel are you all right im fine she kept one arm firm around zacks waist as she turned its nick i know when the call came in i asked to handle it i thought it would be easier on everybody his eyes shifted to zacks held is that okay with you yeah i appreciate it ive already talked to a couple of cops why dont we sit down he waited while zack sat on the edge of a chair and lit another cigarette any news on your brothers condition they took him into surgery they havent told us anything i might be able to find something out why dont you tell me about these three creeps they wore stocking masks zack began wearily black clothes one of them wore a denim jacket rachel reached for zacks hand the one who shot nick was about fiveeight or nine she added black hair brown eyes there was a scar on his left wrist on the side about two inches long he wore engineers boots worn down at the heel good girl not for the first time alex thought that his sister would have made a damn good cop how about the other two the one who wanted to trash the place had a highpitched giggle zack remembered edgy skinny guy about fiveten rachel put in maybe a hundred and thirty i didnt get a good look at him but he had light hair sandy blond i think the third one was about the same height but stockier at a guess id say the guns made him nervous he was sweating a lot how about age hard to say she looked at zack young early twenties about what are the chances of catching them better with this alex closed his notebook look i wont con you it wont be easy now if they left prints and the prints are on file thats one thing but were going to work on it im going to work on it he added you could say ive got a vested interest yeah zack looked at rachel i guess you do not just for her alex said ive got a stake in the kid too i like to see the system work muldoon mr muldoon a woman of about fifty dressed in green scrubs came into the room when zack started to rise she gestured to him to stay where he was im dr markowitz your brothers surgeon how he had to pause and try again how is he tough as a concession to aching feet and lower back pain she sat on the arm of a chair you want all the technical jargon so i can show off or you want the bottom line the next lick of fear had his palms damp bottom line hes critical and hes damn lucky not only to have had me but to have taken a bullet at close range that missed the heart i put his chances now at about seventyfive percent with luck and the constitution of youth well be able to bump that up within twentyfour hours the coffee churned violently in his stomach are you telling me hes going to make it im telling you i dont like to work that hard and long on anyone and lose them were going to keep him in icu for now can i see him ill have someone come down and let you know when hes out of recovery she stifled a yawn and noted that shed spent yet another sunrise in an operating room you want all the crap about how hell be out for several more hours wont know youre there and how you should go home and get some rest no thanks she rubbed her eyes and smiled i didnt think so hes a goodlooking boy mr muldoon im looking forward to chatting with him thanks thanks a lot ill be checking in on him she rose stretched and narrowed her eyes at alex cop yes maam i can spot them a mile away she said and walked out chapter twelve contents prev the pain was a thin sheet of agony layered under dizziness every time nick surfaced he felt it wondered at it then slipped away again into a cocoon of comforting unconsciousness sometimes he tried to speak but the words were disjointed and senseless even to him he heard a disconcerting beeping annoying and consistent that he didnt recognize as his heartbeat on the monitor the squeak of crepesoled shoes against tile was muffled by the nice steady humming in his ears the occasional prodding and poking as his vital signs were checked and rechecked was only a minor disturbance in the huge dark lack of awareness that covered him sometimes there was a pressure on his hand as if someone were holding it and a murmuring someone speaking to him but he couldnt quite drum up the energy to listen once he dreamed of the sea in a hurricane and watched himself leap off the deck of a pitching ship into blackness but he never hit bottom he just floated away there were other dreams zack standing behind him at a pinball machine guiding his hands laughing at the whirl of bells and whistles then cash was there leaning on the machine the smoke from his crooked cigarette curling up in front of his face he saw rachel smiling at him in a brightly lit room the smell of pizza and garlic everywhere and her eyes were bright interested beautiful then they were drenched with tears overflowing with apologies the old man shouting at him he looked so sick as he stumbled to the top of the stairs youll never amount to anything knew it the first time i laid eyes on you then that blank slack look would come over his face and he could only whine where have you been wheres zack is he coming back soon but zack was gone hundreds of miles away there was no one to help rio frying potatoes and cackling over one of his own jokes and zack always back to zack coming through the kitchen you going to eat all the profits kid an easy grin a friendly swipe as he went out again the gleaming piano that polished dream and zack standing beside it grinning foolishly then the glitter of the overhead light on the barrel of a gun and zack with a grunt he threw off sleep tried to struggle up hey hey take it easy kid zack sprang up from the chair beside the bed to press a gentle hand on nicks shoulder its okay you got no place to go he tried to focus but the images around him kept slipping in and out like phantoms in shadows what his throat was sanddry and aching am i sick youve been better and so have i zack thought fighting to keep his hand from shaking as he lifted the plastic drinking cup they said you could suck on this if you came around again nick took a pull of water through the straw then another but didnt have the energy for a third at least his vision had cleared he took a long hard look at zack dark circles under tired eyes in a pale face prickled by a nights growth of beard you look like hell grinning zack rubbed a hand over the stubble you dont look so hot yourself let me call a nurse nurse nick shook his head almost imperceptibly then frowned at the iv is this a hospital it aint the ritz you hurting nick thought about it and shook his head cant tell feel dopey well you are swamped with relief zack laid a hand on nicks cheek left it there until embarrassment had it dropping away youre such a jerk nick nick was too bleary to hear the catch in zacks voice was there an accident i and then it came flooding back a tidal wave of memory at the bar his hand fisted on the sheets rachel is rachel all right shes fine been in and out of here i had rio browbeat her into getting something to eat you nick took another long look to reassure himself he didnt shoot you no you idiot his voice broke then roughened he shot you when his legs went watery zack sat again buried his face in his hands the hands were trembling nick stared utterly amazed as this man hed always thought was the next best thing to superhuman struggled for composure i could kill you for scaring me like this if you werent flat on your back already id damn well put you there but insults and threats delivered in a shaky voice held little power hey nick lifted a hand but wasnt sure what to do with it you okay no im not okay zack tossed back and rose to pace to the window he stared out seeing nothing until he felt some portion of control again yeah yeah im fine looks like youre going to be that way too they said theyd move you down to a regular room sometime soon if you rated it where am i now curious nick turned his head to study the room glass walls and blinking beeping machines wow high tech how long have i been out you came around a couple times before they said you wouldnt remember you babbled a lot oh yeah about what pinball machines steadier now zack walked back to the bed some girl named marcie or marlie remind me to pump you on that little number later it pleased him to see a faint smile curve nicks lips you asked for french fries what can i say its a weakness did i get any no maybe well sneak some in later are you hungry i dont know you didnt tell me how long zack reached for a cigarette remembered and sighed about twelve hours since they finished cutting you up and sewing you back together i figure if hed shot you in the head instead of the chest youd have walked away whistling he tapped his knuckles on nicks temple hard as a rock i owe you one a big one no you dont you saved my life nick let his heavy lids close its kind of like jumping off a ship in a hurricane you dont think about it know what i mean yeah zack right here i want to talk to a cop youve got to rest i need to talk to a cop nick said again as he drifted off i know who they were zack watched him sleep and since there was no one to see brushed gently at the hair on his brothers forehead i told you his condition is good dr markowitz repeated go home mr muldoon not a chance zack leaned against the wall beside the door to nicks room he was feeling a great deal better since theyd brought his brother out of icu but he wasnt ready to jump ship god save me from stubborn irishmen she aimed a hard look at rachel mrs muldoon do you have any influence with him im not mrs muldoon and no i think we might pry him away once he checks in on nick my brother shouldnt be with him much longer your brothers the cop she sighed and shook her head all right ill give you five minutes with my patient then youre out of here believe me ill call security and have them toss you out if necessary yes maam that goes for that giant whos been lurking around the corridors too ill take them both home rachel promised she looked around quickly as the door opened alexi were finished he couldnt keep the satisfied gleam out of his eyes ive got some rounding up to do he identified them zack demanded cold and hes raring to testify i want no chance alex said quickly noting zacks clenched fists the kid figured out how to do it the right way muldoon take a lesson keep him in line rach ill try she murmured as her brother hurried off zack if youre going in there to talk to him pull it together that son of a bitch shot my brother and hell pay for it with a curt nod zack walked by her and into nicks room he stood at the foot of the bed waiting how are you feeling okay he was exhausted after his interview with alex but he wasnt finished i need to talk to you to tell you explain it can wait no it was my fault the whole thing they were cobras zack they knew when to come in and how because i told them i didnt know i swear to god i didnt know what they were going to do i dont expect you to believe me zack waited a moment until he got his bearings why shouldnt i believe you nick squeezed his eyes tight i messed up like always he poured out the entire story of how hed run into cash at the arcade i thought we were just talking and all the time he was setting me up setting you up you trusted him zack came around the side of the bed to put a hand on nicks wrist you thought he was your friend thats not messing up nick its just trusting people who dont deserve it youre not like them when nicks eyes opened again zack took a firm hold of his hand if you messed up anything it was yourself by trying to be like them and thats done i wont let them get away with it we wont zack told him were in this together yeah nick said on a long breath okay theyre going to kick me out of here so you can get some rest ill be back tomorrow zack nick called out as his brother hit the door dont forget the fries you got it okay rachel asked when zack came out okay then he gathered her up held her hard and close she was slim and small and as steady as an anchor in a stormtossed sea come home with me please he murmured against her hair stay with me tonight lets go she pressed a kiss to his cheek i can buy a toothbrush on the way later when he fell into an exhausted sleep she lay beside him and kept watch she knew it was the first time hed done more than nod off in a chair in nearly fortyeight hours odd she thought as she watched his face in the faint shadowy light that sneaked through the windows shed never considered herself the nurturing type but it had been very satisfying to simply lie beside him and hold him until the strain and fatigue of the past few days had toppled him into sleep the bigger they are she thought again pressing a light kiss to his forehead still as tired as she was and as relieved she couldnt find escape in sleep herself how daunting it was to realize shed come to a point in her life where she wasnt sure of her moves love didnt run on logic it didnt follow neat lines or a list of priorities yet in a matter of days the bond that had brought them together would be broken they would go into court and it would be resolved one way or the other now was the time to face the whathappensnext hed asked her to move in with him rachel shifted to watch the pattern of shadows on the ceiling it could be enough or much too much her problem now was to decide what she could live with and what she could live without she was very much afraid that the one thing she couldnt live without was sleeping beside her he shuddered once made a strangled sound in his throat before ripping himself awake instantly she moved to soothe shh she touched a hand to his cheek to his shoulder stroking its all right everythings all right hurricanes he murmured groggy ill tell you about it sometime okay she rested a hand on his heart as if to slow its rapid pace go back to sleep muldoon youre worn out its nice that youre here real nice i like it too one brow arched as she felt his hand slide up her thigh dont start something you wont be able to finish i just want my tshirt back he moved his hand up her makeshift nightie until her warm soft breast filled his palm comfort arousal perfection just as i thought this is a completely nonregulation body the stirring started low and deep working its way through her youre pushing your luck i was having this dream about the navy his fatigue had everything moving in slow motion making it all the more erotic when he slipped the shirt up and off her arms seemed to flow over her head and down again like water it makes me remember what it was like being at sea for months without seeing a woman he lowered his mouth to flick his tongue over her or tasting one she sighed luxuriously and even that slight movement heightened his need tell me more his mouth met hers so soft so sweet when i woke up just now i could smell your hair your skin ive been waking up wanting you for weeks now i can wake up and have you just that easy huh yeah he lifted his head and smiled down at her just that easy she trailed a finger down his back as she considered ive got only one thing to say to you muldoon what all hands on deck with a laugh she rolled on top of him and it was very very easy youre not being sensible she said to nick as she walked up the courthouse steps beside him supporting his arm its the simplest thing in the world to get a postponement under the circumstances i want it over he repeated and glanced over at zack im with you far be it from me to fight the pair of you she said in disgust if you keel over im not an invalid youre two days out of the hospital she pointed out dr markowitz gave him the green light zack put in i dont care what dr markowitz gave him rachel a little winded from the climb but still game nick shook off her hand stop playing mother fine she tossed up her hands then lowered them again to fuss with nicks tie brush the shoulders of his jacket she caught zacks grin over nicks shoulder and scowled shut up muldoon aye aye sir he thinks hes so cute with the nautical talk she stood back to study her client he was still a little pale but he would do now are you sure you remember everything i explained to you rachel you went over the drill a dozen times letting out a huff of breath he turned to his brother can i have a minute with her sure zack tossed a look over his shoulder hands off yeah yeah the smirk was back but it was goodnatured rather than nasty listen rachel first i want to tell you how well it was really nice of your family to come by the hospital the way they did your mom he pushed restless hands in his pockets then pulled them out again bringing me cookies and all the other stuff your father coming by to hang out and play checkers it should have sounded corny he reflected but it didnt they came to see you because they wanted to yeah but well it was nice i even got a card from freddie and the cop he was okay alex has his moments what im trying to say is whatever happens today youve done a lot for me maybe i dont know where im going but i know where im not i owe that to you no you dont worried she might cry she made her tone brisk a little sure but most of it was right here she tapped a finger on his heart youre okay lebeck thanks one more thing he glanced over to be sure zack was out of earshot i know i made things a little sticky before zacks been making noises that you might be moving in i just wanted you to know that i wouldnt be in the way i havent decided what im going to do regardless you wouldnt be in the way youre family got it his lips curved im getting it if you decide to throw him over im available ill keep it in mind she gave his jacket one last tug lets go there was no reason to be nervous she told herself as she led nick to the defense table her statement was well prepared and she had a sympathetic judge on the bench she was terrified she rose with the rest of the court when judge beckett came in ignoring the twisting in her gut she gave nick a quick confident smile well well mr lebeck beckett began folding her hands how time flies i hear through the grapevine that you ran into a bit of trouble recently are you quite recovered your honor puzzled by the break in courtroom routine rachel rose sit sit sit beckett gestured with the back of her hand mr lebeck i asked how youre feeling im okay good im also informed that you identified the three desperadoes who broke into mr muldoons bar three members of the cobras an organization with which you were associated i believe who are now in custody awaiting trial rachel tried again your honor in my final report i read it thank you counselor you did an excellent job id prefer to hear from mr lebeck directly my question is why did you identify these men who a relatively short time ago you chose to protect stand up rachel hissed under her breath frowning nick complied maam was the question unclear shall i repeat it no i got it excellent and your answer they messed with my brother ah as if she were a teacher congratulating a muchimproved student beckett smiled and that changes the complexion of things forgetting all rachels prompting he took the natural stance the aggressive one listen they broke in busted rios head open shoved rachel around and waved guns all over the place it wasnt right maybe you think turning them in makes me a creep but reece was going to shoot my brother no way he was going to walk from that what i think it makes you lebeck is a clearthinking potentially responsible adult who has grasped not only the basic tenets of right and wrong but also of loyalty which is often more valuable you will likely make more mistakes in your life but i doubt you will make the kind that will bring you back into my courtroom now i believe the district attorney has something to say yes your honor the state drops all charges against nicholas lebeck all right rachel said springing to her feet is that it nick managed not quite beckett pulled the attention back to the bench i get to do this she slapped the gavel down now thats it with a laugh rachel threw her arms around nicks neck you did it she murmured to him i want you to remember that you did it im not going to jail he hadnt been able to allow anyone even himself to see how much that had terrified him he gave rachel one last squeeze before turning to zack im going home thats right zack held out a hand then with an oath he dragged nick into a hug play your cards right kid ill even give you a raise raise my butt im working my way up to partner if you gentlemen will excuse me i have other clients she gave each of them a highly unprofessional kiss we have to celebrate zack caught her hands there was nothing he could say too much that needed to be said seven oclock at the bar be there i wouldnt miss it rachel nick called out youre the best no she tossed a laugh over her shoulder but i will be she was a little late it couldnt be helped how could she have known shed get a case of criminal assault tossed at her at six oclock two years with the pds office she reminded herself grinning a little as she pushed open the door of the bar when the cheer went up she stopped cold there were streamers balloons and several people in incredibly stupid party hats a huge banner hung across the back wall next to rachel perry mason is a wimp it made her laugh even as rio hauled her onto his shoulders and carried her to the bar he set her down and someone thrust a glass of champagne in her hand some party zack tugged at her hair until she turned her face for a kiss i tried to make them wait for you but they got caught up ill catch up she began then her mouth dropped open mama weve already eating rios short ribs nadia informed her now your papa is going to dance with me maybe i dance with you later yuri informed his daughter as he swept nadia off for what was surely to be a polka you invited my parents and she shook her head in wonder thats alex stuffing meatballs in his face its a private party zack clinked his glass against hers nick made up the list take a look she craned her neck and spotted him at a table isnt that lolas daughter shes really impressed that hes been shot its one of the top ten ways to impress a woman ill keep it in mind want to dance she took another sip of champagne id bet a weeks pay you dont know how to polka you lose he said and grabbed her hand it went on for hours rachel lost track of the time as she sampled the enormous spread rio had prepared and washed it down with champagne she danced until her feet went numb and ultimately collapsed to sing ukrainian folk songs with her slightly snookered father good party yuri said swaying a bit while his wife helped him into his coat yes papa he grinned as he leaned toward rachel now i go home and make your mama feel like a girl big talk youll snore in truck on the way home he leered at his wife then you wake me up maybe she kissed her daughter you make me very proud thank you mama youre a smart girl rachel ill tell you what you should already know when you find a good man you lose nothing by taking hold and everything by letting go you understand me yes mama rachel looked over at zack i think i do this is good rachel watched them walk out arm in arm theyre pretty great nick said from behind her yes they are and your brothers not so bad for a cop im pretty fond of him all in all with a sigh she brushed a streamer from her hair looks like the partys over this one is smiling to himself he turned away to help rio gather up some of the mess if nick knew his brother and he was beginning to believe he did rachel was in for another surprise before the evening was over zack tolerated the cleanup crew for nearly twenty minutes before ordering rio home and nick to bed if he didnt get rachel to himself he was going to explode well get the rest tomorrow youre the boss rio gave rachel a wink as he shrugged into his coat for the time being zack shook a nearly empty bottle theres a little champagne left how about it i think i could choke it down she settled at the bar and aiming her best provocative look at him held out her glass buy me a drink sailor be my pleasure after filling her glass he slid the bottle aside theres nothing i can say or do to repay you dont start i want you to know how much i appreciate everything you made all the difference i was doing my job and following my conscience no one needs to thank me for that damn it rachel let me explain how i feel nick swung in from the kitchen if thats the best you can do bro you need all the help you can get the single glance zack shot in his direction was explosive go to bed on my way but he walked to the juke and popped in a few quarters after punching some buttons he turned back to them you two are a real case take it from someone who knows you both have weaknesses and cut to the chase with a shake of his head he dimmed the lights and walked out what the hell was that zack demanded dont ask me weaknesses i dont have any weaknesses zack grinned at her me either he came around the bar but its nice music real nice she agreed going willingly into his arms to sway there things have been a little hectic hmm just a little id like to talk to you about what i asked you a while back about moving in she shut her eyes shed already decided the answer was no as hard as it was to resist a half a loaf she would hold out for the whole one this may not be the time to go into it i cant think of a better one the thing is rachel i dont want you to move in you she stiffened then shoved away nearly toppling him over well thats just fine what i want stuff what you want she tossed back at him isnt that just typical after i clean up the mess for you you brush me off im not shut up muldoon ill have my say who could stop you he muttered her heels slapped the floor as she tried to walk off her anger youre out of order buster youre the one who kept pushing your way in pushing your way in she demonstrated by making shoving motions with her hands just wouldnt take no for an answer you didnt say no he reminded her thats irrelevant facing him she fisted her hands on her hips so you dont want me to move in fine my answer was an unqualified no anyway great he stepped closer so that he had to lean over to shout in her face because im not settling for you packing up a few things and coming by to play house i want you to marry me and if you think oh god she swayed back forward then pressed a hand to his chest for balance i have to sit down so sit he nipped her around the waist and plopped her down on the bar and just listen i know we said no longterm commitments you didnt want them and neither did i but were turning the page here rachel and theres a whole new set of rules zack i no youre not going to get me tangled up in an argument she was too good at winning those and hed be damned if he was going to lose this time ive thought this through youve got your priorities and thats fine he grabbed her hands hard rachel decided shed check for broken fingers later right now she couldnt feel anything but amazement all you have to do is add one to the list me i didnt plan on falling in love with you but thats the way it is so deal with it me either she murmured but he plowed on maybe you think you dont have room his grip tightened and he ignored her quick yelp what did you say i said me either me either what you said i didnt plan on falling in love with you and i said me either she let out a long shaky sigh when his hands slid limply from hers but thats the way it is so deal with it oh yeah yeah perched on the bar she linked her arms around his neck lowered her brow to his amazing she thought he was as scared as she was you beat me to it muldoon i was going to turn you down because i love you too much and i wasnt going to settle for anything less with you than everything its had me going in circles for days weeks he brought his mouth to hers i was going to try to ease you into it but i couldnt wait i even talked to your father about my intentions tonight unsure whether to laugh or groan she drew back you did not i plied him with vodka first just in case he told me he wanted more grandchildren she felt her heart swell id like to accommodate him something caught in his chest then broke beautifully free no kidding and here it was she thought looking down into his eyes a whole new set of rules a whole new life for the taking no kidding i want a family with you i want it all with you thats my choice he cupped her face in his hands youre everything ive wanted and never thought id have youre everything i wanted she repeated and pretended not to when she lowered her lips to his she felt the sting of tears in her throat were not going to get sloppy are we muldoon who us he grinned as she slid off the bar and into his arms not a chance
