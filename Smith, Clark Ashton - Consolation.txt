consolation by clark ashton smith forget forget and be not sorrowful at all ah tend no more in gardens of the terrene years this wormwood flowering tall with thy mellifluous tears be glad a fairer blossom blooms chimerical a golden rose eloigned with vale on vale of blue in realms beyond the sunset bourn of xanadu be glad though here the skies are like a leaden wall for still in saturn from their isle septentrion the black swans fly to seek the jungles of the sun forget forget and be not sorrowful at all
