the boy scout and other stories for boys by richard harding davis illustrated new york charles scribners sons copyright by charles scribners sons publishers note richard harding davis as a friend and fellow author has written of him was youth incarnate and there is probably nothing that he wrote of which a boy would not some day come to feel the appeal but there are certain of his stories that go with especial directness to a boys heart and sympathies and make for him quite unforgettable literature a few of these were made some years ago into a volume stories for boys and found a large and enthusiastic special public in addition to daviss general readers and the present collection from stories more recently published is issued with the same motive this book takes its title from the boy scout the first of its tales and it includes the boy who cried wolf blood will tell the immortal gallegher and the bar sinister daviss famous dog story it is a fresh volume added to what augustus thomas calls safe stuff to give to a young fellow who likes to take off his hat and dilate his nostrils and feel the wind in his face contents page the boy scout the boy who cried wolf gallegher blood will tell the bar sinister illustrations but how he demanded how do i get ashore frontispiece jimmie dropped the valise forced his cramped fingers into straight lines and saluted for gods sake hade begged let me go why its gallegher said the night editor in front of davids nose he shook a fist as large as a catchers glove she dug the shapeless hat into davids shoulder hes a coward ive done with him for a long time he kneels in the sawdust the boy scout and other stories for boys the boy scout a rule of the boy scouts is every day to do some one a good turn not because the copybooks tell you it deserves another but in spite of that pleasing possibility if you are a true scout until you have performed your act of kindness your day is dark you are as unhappy as is the grownup who has begun his day without shaving or reading the new york sun but as soon as you have proved yourself you may with a clear conscience look the world in the face and untie the knot in your kerchief jimmie reeder untied the accusing knot in his scarf at just ten minutes past eight on a hot august morning after he had given one dime to his sister sadie with that she could either witness the firstrun films at the palace or by dividing her fortune patronize two of the nickel shows on lenox avenue the choice jimmie left to her he was setting out for the annual encampment of the boy scouts at hunters island and in the excitement of that adventure even the movies ceased to thrill but sadie also could be unselfish with a heroism of a campfire maiden she made a gesture which might have been interpreted to mean she was returning the money i cant jimmie she gasped i cant take it off you you saved it and you ought to get the fun of it i havent saved it yet said jimmie im going to cut it out of the railroad fare im going to get off at city island instead of at pelham manor and walk the difference thats ten cents cheaper sadie exclaimed with admiration an you carryin that heavy grip aw thats nothin said the man of the family goodby mother so long sadie to ward off further expressions of gratitude he hurriedly advised sadie to take in the curse of cain rather than the mohawks last stand and fled down the front steps he wore his khaki uniform on his shoulders was his knapsack from his hands swung his suitcase and between his heavy stockings and his shorts his kneecaps unkissed by the sun as yet unscathed by blackberry vines showed as white and fragile as the wrists of a girl as he moved toward the l station at the corner sadie and his mother waved to him in the street boys too small to be scouts hailed him enviously even the policeman glancing over the newspapers on the newsstand nodded approval you a scout jimmie he asked no retorted jimmie for was not he also in uniform im santa claus out filling christmas stockings the patrolman also possessed a ready wit then get yourself a pair he advised if a dog was to see your legs jimmie escaped the insult by fleeing up the steps of the elevated an hour later with his valise in one hand and staff in the other he was tramping up the boston post road and breathing heavily the day was cruelly hot before his eyes over an interminable stretch of asphalt the heat waves danced and flickered already the knapsack on his shoulders pressed upon him like an old man of the sea the linen in the valise had turned to pig iron his pipestem legs were wabbling his eyes smarted with salt sweat and the fingers supporting the valise belonged to some other boy and were giving that boy much pain but as the motorcars flashed past with raucous warnings or that those who rode might better see the boy with bare knees passed at half speed jimmie stiffened his shoulders and stepped jauntily forward even when the joyriders mocked with oh you scout he smiled at them he was willing to admit to those who rode that the laugh was on the one who walked and he regretted oh so bitterly having left the train he was indignant that for his one good turn a day he had not selected one less strenuous that for instance he had not assisted a frightened old lady through the traffic to refuse the dime she might have offered as all true scouts refuse all tips would have been easier than to earn it by walking five miles with the sun at ninetynine degrees and carrying excess baggage twenty times james shifted the valise to the other hand twenty times he let it drop and sat upon it and then as again he took up his burden the good samaritan drew near he drew near in a low gray racingcar at the rate of forty miles an hour and within a hundred feet of jimmie suddenly stopped and backed toward him the good samaritan was a young man with white hair he wore a suit of blue a golf cap the hands that held the wheel were disguised in large yellow gloves he brought the car to a halt and surveyed the dripping figure in the road with tired and uncurious eyes illustration jimmie dropped the valise forced his cramped fingers into straight lines and saluted you a boy scout he asked with alacrity for the twentyfirst time jimmie dropped the valise forced his cramped fingers into straight lines and saluted the young man in the car nodded toward the seat beside him get in he commanded when james sat panting happily at his elbow the old young man to jimmies disappointment did not continue to shatter the speed limit instead he seemed inclined for conversation and the car growling indignantly crawled i never saw a boy scout before announced the old young man tell me about it first tell me what you do when youre not scouting jimmie explained volubly when not in uniform he was an officeboy and from pedlers and beggars guarded the gates of carroll and hastings stockbrokers he spoke the names of his employers with awe it was a firm distinguished conservative and longestablished the whitehaired young man seemed to nod in assent do you know them demanded jimmie suspiciously are you a customer of ours i know them said the young man they are customers of mine jimmie wondered in what way carroll and hastings were customers of the whitehaired young man judging him by his outer garments jimmie guessed he was a fifth avenue tailor he might be even a haberdasher jimmie continued he lived he explained with his mother at one hundred and fortysixth street sadie his sister attended the public school he helped support them both and he now was about to enjoy a wellearned vacation camping out on hunters island where he would cook his own meals and if the mosquitoes permitted sleep in a tent and you like that demanded the young man you call that fun sure protested jimmie dont you go camping out i go camping out said the good samaritan whenever i leave new york jimmie had not for three years lived in wall street not to understand that the young man spoke in metaphor you dont look objected the young man critically as though you were built for the strenuous life jimmie glanced guiltily at his white knees you ought ter see me two weeks from now he protested i get all sunburnt and hard hard as anything the young man was incredulous you were near getting sunstroke when i picked you up he laughed if youre going to hunters island why didnt you take the third avenue to pelham manor thats right assented jimmie eagerly but i wanted to save the ten cents sos to send sadie to the movies so i walked the young man looked his embarrassment i beg your pardon he murmured but jimmie did not hear him from the back of the car he was dragging excitedly at the hated suitcase stop he commanded i got ter get out i got ter walk the young man showed his surprise walk he exclaimed what is it a bet jimmie dropped the valise and followed it into the roadway it took some time to explain to the young man first he had to be told about the scout law and the one good turn a day and that it must involve some personal sacrifice and as jimmie pointed out changing from a slow suburban train to a racingcar could not be listed as a sacrifice he had not earned the money jimmie argued he had only avoided paying it to the railroad if he did not walk he would be obtaining the gratitude of sadie by a falsehood therefore he must walk not at all protested the young man youve got it wrong what good will it do your sister to have you sunstruck i think you are sunstruck youre crazy with the heat you get in here and well talk it over as we go along hastily jimmie backed away id rather walk he said the young man shifted his legs irritably then howll this suit you he called well declare that first one good turn a failure and start afresh do me a good turn jimmie halted in his tracks and looked back suspiciously im going to hunters island inn called the young man and ive lost my way you get in here and guide me thatll be doing me a good turn on either side of the road blotting out the landscape giant hands picked out in electriclight bulbs pointed the way to hunters island inn jimmie grinned and nodded toward them much obliged he called i got ter walk turning his back upon temptation he wabbled forward into the flickering heat waves the young man did not attempt to pursue at the side of the road under the shade of a giant elm he had brought the car to a halt and with his arms crossed upon the wheel sat motionless following with frowning eyes the retreating figure of jimmie but the narrowchested and knockkneed boy staggering over the sunbaked asphalt no longer concerned him it was not jimmie but the code preached by jimmie and not only preached but before his eyes put into practice that interested him the young man with white hair had been running away from temptation at forty miles an hour he had been running away from the temptation to do a fellow mortal a good turn that morning to the appeal of a drowning cжsar to help me cassius or i sink he had answered sink that answer he had no wish to reconsider that he might not reconsider he had sought to escape it was his experience that a sixtyhorsepower racingmachine is a jealous mistress for retrospective sentimental or philanthropic thoughts she grants no leave of absence but he had not escaped jimmie had halted him tripped him by the heels and set him again to thinking within the halfhour that followed those who rolled past saw at the side of the road a car with her engine running and leaning upon the wheel as unconscious of his surroundings as though he sat at his own fireplace a young man who frowned and stared at nothing the halfhour passed and the young man swung his car back toward the city but at the first roadhouse that showed a blueandwhite telephone sign he left it and into the iron box at the end of the bar dropped a nickel he wished to communicate with mr carroll of carroll and hastings and when he learned mr carroll had just issued orders that he must not be disturbed the young man gave his name the effect upon the barkeeper was instantaneous with the aggrieved air of one who feels he is the victim of a jest he laughed scornfully what are you putting over he demanded the young man smiled reassuringly he had begun to speak and though apparently engaged with the beerglass he was polishing the barkeeper listened down in wall street the senior member of carroll and hastings also listened he was alone in the most private of all his private offices and when interrupted had been engaged in what of all undertakings is the most momentous on the desk before him lay letters to his lawyer to the coroner to his wife and hidden by a mass of papers but within reach of his hand an automatic pistol the promise it offered of swift release had made the writing of the letters simple had given him a feeling of complete detachment had released him at least in thought from all responsibilities and when at his elbow the telephone coughed discreetly it was as though some one had called him from a world from which already he had made his exit mechanically through mere habit he lifted the receiver the voice over the telephone came in brisk staccato sentences that letter i sent this morning forget it tear it up ive been thinking and im going to take a chance ive decided to back you boys and i know youll make good im speaking from a roadhouse in the bronx going straight from here to the bank so you can begin to draw against us within an hour and hello will three millions see you through from wall street there came no answer but from the hands of the barkeeper a glass crashed to the floor the young man regarded the barkeeper with puzzled eyes he doesnt answer he exclaimed he must have hung up he must have fainted said the barkeeper the whitehaired one pushed a bill across the counter to pay for breakage he said and disappeared down pelham parkway throughout the day with the bill for evidence pasted against the mirror the barkeeper told and retold the wondrous tale he stood just where youre standing now he related blowing in milliondollar bills like youd blow suds off a beer if id knowed it was him id have hit him once and hid him in the cellar for the reward whod i think he was i thought he was a wiretapper working a con game mr carroll had not hung up but when in the bronx the beerglass crashed in wall street the receiver had slipped from the hand of the man who held it and the man himself had fallen forward his desk hit him in the face and woke him woke him to the wonderful fact that he still lived that at forty he had been born again that before him stretched many more years in which as the young man with the white hair had pointed out he still could make good the afternoon was far advanced when the staff of carroll and hastings were allowed to depart and even late as was the hour two of them were asked to remain into the most private of the private offices carroll invited gaskell the head clerk in the main office hastings had asked young thorne the bond clerk to be seated until the senior partner has finished with gaskell young thorne must remain seated gaskell said mr carroll if we had listened to you if wed run this place as it was when father was alive this never would have happened it hasnt happened but weve had our lesson and after this were going slow and going straight and we dont need you to tell us how to do that we want you to go away on a months vacation when i thought we were going under i planned to send the children on a seavoyage with the governess so they wouldnt see the newspapers but now that i can look them in the eye again i need them i cant let them go so if youd like to take your wife on an ocean trip to nova scotia and quebec here are the cabins i reserved for the kids they call it the royal suite whatever that is and the trip lasts a month the boat sails tomorrow morning dont sleep too late or you may miss her the head clerk was secreting the tickets in the inside pocket of his waistcoat his fingers trembled and when he laughed his voice trembled miss the boat the head clerk exclaimed if she gets away from millie and me shes got to start now well go on board tonight a halfhour later millie was on her knees packing a trunk and her husband was telephoning to the drugstore for a sponge bag and a cure for seasickness owing to the joy in her heart and to the fact that she was on her knees millie was alternately weeping into the trunktray and offering up incoherent prayers of thanksgiving suddenly she sank back upon the floor john she cried doesnt it seem sinful to sail away in a royal suite and leave this beautiful flat empty over the telephone john was having trouble with the drug clerk no he explained im not seasick now the medicine i want is to be taken later i know im speaking from the pavonia but the pavonia isnt a ship its an apartmenthouse he turned to millie we cant be in two places at the same time he suggested but think insisted millie of all the poor people stifling tonight in this heat trying to sleep on the roofs and fireescapes and our flat so cool and big and pretty and no one in it john nodded his head proudly i know its big he said but it isnt big enough to hold all the people who are sleeping tonight on the roofs and in the parks i was thinking of your brother and grace said millie theyve been married only two weeks now and theyre in a stuffy hall bedroom and eating with all the other boarders think what our flat would mean to them to be by themselves with eight rooms and their own kitchen and bath and our new refrigerator and the gramophone it would be heaven it would be a real honeymoon abandoning the drug clerk john lifted millie in his arms and kissed her for next to his wife nearest his heart was the younger brother the younger brother and grace were sitting on the stoop of the boardinghouse on the upper steps in their shirtsleeves were the other boarders so the bride and bridegroom spoke in whispers the air of the cross street was stale and stagnant from it rose exhalations of rotting fruit the gases of an open subway the smoke of passing taxicabs but between the street and the hall bedroom with its odors of a gasstove and a kitchen the choice was difficult weve got to cool off somehow the young husband was saying or you wont sleep shall we treat ourselves to icecream sodas or a trip on the weehawken ferryboat the ferryboat begged the girl where we can get away from all these people a taxicab with a trunk in front whirled into the street kicked itself to a stop and the head clerk and millie spilled out upon the pavement they talked so fast and the younger brother and grace talked so fast that the boarders although they listened intently could make nothing of it they distinguished only the concluding sentences why dont you drive down to the wharf with us they heard the elder brother ask and see our royal suite but the younger brother laughed him to scorn whats your royal suite he mocked to our royal palace an hour later had the boarders listened outside the flat of the head clerk they would have heard issuing from his bathroom the cooling murmur of running water and from his gramophone the jubilant notes of alexanders ragtime band when in his private office carroll was making a present of the royal suite to the head clerk in the main office hastings the junior partner was addressing champ thorne the bond clerk he addressed him familiarly and affectionately as champ this was due partly to the fact that twentysix years before thorne had been christened champneys and to the coincidence that he had captained the football eleven of one of the big three to the championship champ said mr hastings last month when you asked me to raise your salary the reason i didnt do it was not because you didnt deserve it but because i believed if we gave you a raise youd immediately get married the shoulders of the exfootball captain rose aggressively he snorted with indignation and why should i not get married he demanded youre a fine one to talk youre the most offensively happy married man i ever met perhaps i know i am happy better than you do reproved the junior partner but i know also that it takes money to support a wife you raise me to a hundred a week urged champ and ill make it support a wife whether it supports me or not a month ago continued hastings we could have promised you a hundred but we didnt know how long we could pay it we didnt want you to rush off and marry some fine girl some fine girl muttered mr thorne the finest girl the finer the girl hastings pointed out the harder it would have been for you if we had failed and you had lost your job the eyes of the young man opened with sympathy and concern is it as bad as that he murmured hastings sighed happily it was he said but this morning the young man of wall street did us a good turn saved us saved our creditors saved our homes saved our honor were going to start fresh and pay our debts and we agreed the first debt we paid would be the small one we owe you youve brought us more than weve given and if youll stay with us were going to see your fifty and raise it a hundred what do you say young mr thorne leaped to his feet what he said was wheren hells my hat but by the time he had found the hat and the door he mended his manners i say thank you a thousand times he shouted over his shoulder excuse me but ive got to go ive got to break the news to he did not explain to whom he was going to break the news but hastings must have guessed for again he sighed happily and then a little hysterically laughed aloud several months had passed since he had laughed aloud in his anxiety to break the news champ thorne almost broke his neck in his excitement he could not remember whether the red flash meant the elevator was going down or coming up and sooner than wait to find out he started to race down eighteen flights of stairs when fortunately the elevatordoor swung open you get five dollars he announced to the elevator man if you drop to the street without a stop beat the speed limit act like the building is on fire and youre trying to save me before the roof falls senator barnes and his entire family which was his daughter barbara were at the ritzcarlton they were in town in august because there was a meeting of the directors of the brazil and cuyaba rubber company of which company senator barnes was president it was a secret meeting those directors who were keeping cool at the edge of the ocean had been summoned by telegraph those who were steaming across the ocean by wireless up from the equator had drifted the threat of a scandal sickening grim terrible as yet it burned beneath the surface giving out only an odor but an odor as rank as burning rubber itself at any moment it might break into flame for the directors was it the better wisdom to let the scandal smoulder and take a chance or to be the first to give the alarm the first to lead the way to the horror and stamp it out it was to decide this that in the heat of august the directors and the president had foregathered champ thorne knew nothing of this he knew only that by a miracle barbara barnes was in town that at last he was in a position to ask her to marry him that she would certainly say she would that was all he cared to know a year before he had issued his declaration of independence before he could marry he told her he must be able to support a wife on what he earned without her having to accept money from her father and until he received a minimum wage of five thousand dollars they must wait what is the matter with my fathers money barbara had demanded thorne had evaded the direct question there is too much of it he said do you object to the way he makes it insisted barbara because rubber is most useful you put it in golf balls and auto tires and galoches there is nothing so perfectly respectable as galoches and what is there tainted about a raincoat thorne shook his head unhappily its not the finished product to which i refer he stammered its the way they get the raw material they get it out of trees said barbara then she exclaimed with enlightenmentoh she cried you are thinking of the congo there it is terrible that is slavery but there are no slaves on the amazon the natives are free and the work is easy they just tap the trees the way the farmers gather sugar in vermont father has told me about it often thorne had made no comment he could abuse a friend if the friend were among those present but denouncing any one he disliked as heartily as he disliked senator barnes was a public service he preferred to leave to others and he knew besides that if the father she loved and the man she loved distrusted each other barbara would not rest until she learned the reason why one day in a newspaper barbara read of the puju mayo atrocities of the indian slaves in the jungles and back waters of the amazon who are offered up as sacrifices to red rubber she carried the paper to her father what it said her father told her was untrue and if it were true it was the first he had heard of it senator barnes loved the good things of life but the thing he loved most was his daughter the thing he valued the highest was her good opinion so when for the first time she looked at him in doubt he assured her he at once would order an investigation but of course he added it will be many months before our agents can report on the amazon news travels very slowly in the eyes of his daughter the doubt still lingered i am afraid she said that that is true that was six months before the directors of the brazil and cuyaba rubber company were summoned to meet their president at his rooms in the ritzcarlton they were due to arrive in half an hour and while senator barnes awaited their coming barbara came to him in her eyes was a light that helped to tell the great news it gave him a sharp jealous pang he wanted at once to play a part in her happiness to make her grateful to him not alone to this stranger who was taking her away so fearful was he that she would shut him out of her life that had she asked for half his kingdom he would have parted with it and besides giving my consent said the rubber king for which no one seems to have asked what can i give my little girl to make her remember her old father some diamonds to put on her head or pearls to hang around her neck or does she want a vacant lot on fifth avenue the lovely hands of barbara rested upon his shoulders her lovely face was raised to his her lovely eyes were appealing and a little frightened what would one of those things cost asked barbara the question was eminently practical it came within the scope of the senators understanding after all he was not to be cast into outer darkness his smile was complacent he answered airily anything you like he said a million dollars the fingers closed upon his shoulders the eyes still frightened still searched his in appeal then for my weddingpresent said the girl i want you to take that million dollars and send an expedition to the amazon and i will choose the men men unafraid men not afraid of fever or sudden death not afraid to tell the truth even to you and all the world will know and they i mean you will set those people free senator barnes received the directors with an embarrassment which he concealed under a manner of just indignation my mind is made up he told them existing conditions cannot continue and to that end at my own expense i am sending an expedition across south america it will investigate punish and establish reforms i suggest on account of this damned heat we do now adjourn that night over on long island carroll told his wife all or nearly all he did not tell her about the automatic pistol and together on tiptoe they crept to the nursery and looked down at their sleeping children when she rose from her knees the mother said but how can i thank him by him she meant the young man of wall street you never can thank him said carroll thats the worst of it but after a long silence the mother said i will send him a photograph of the children do you think he will understand down at seabright hastings and his wife walked in the sunken garden the moon was so bright that the roses still held their color i would like to thank him said the young wife she meant the young man of wall street but for him we would have lost this her eyes caressed the garden the fruittrees the house with wide hospitable verandas tomorrow i will send him some of these roses said the young wife will he understand that they mean our home at a scandalously late hour in a scandalous spirit of independence champ thorne and barbara were driving around central park in a taxicab how strangely the lord moves his wonders to perform misquoted barbara had not the young man of wall street saved mr hastings mr hastings could not have raised your salary you would not have asked me to marry you and had you not asked me to marry you father would not have given me a weddingpresent and and said champ taking up the tale thousands of slaves would still be buried in the jungles hidden away from their wives and children and the light of the sun and their fellow men they still would be dying of fever starvation tortures he took her hand in both of his and held her fingertips against his lips and they will never know he whispered when their freedom comes that they owe it all to you on hunters island jimmie reeder and his bunkie sam sturges each on his canvas cot tossed and twisted the heat the moonlight and the mosquitoes would not let them even think of sleep that was bully said jimmie what you did today about saving that dog if it hadnt been for you hed ha drownded he would not said sammy with punctilious regard for the truth it wasnt deep enough well the scoutmaster ought to know argued jimmie he said it was the best one good turn of the day modestly sam shifted the limelight so that it fell upon his bunkie ill bet he declared loyally your one good turn was a better one jimmie yawned and then laughed scornfully me he scoffed i didnt do nothing i sent my sister to the movies the boy who cried wolf before he finally arrested him jimmie sniffen had seen the man with the golfcap and the blue eyes that laughed at you three times twice unexpectedly he had come upon him in a wood road and once on round hill where the stranger was pretending to watch the sunset jimmie knew people do not climb hills merely to look at sunsets so he was not deceived he guessed the man was a german spy seeking gun sites and secretly vowed to stalk him from that moment had the stranger known it he was as good as dead for a boy scout with badges on his sleeve for stalking and pathfinding not to boast of others for gardening and cooking can outwit any spy even had general badenpowell remained in mafeking and not invented the boy scout jimmie sniffen would have been one because by birth he was a boy and by inheritance a scout in westchester county the sniffens are one of the county families if it isnt a sarles its a sniffen and with brundages platts and jays the sniffens date back to when the acres of the first charles ferris ran from the boston post road to the coach road to albany and when the first gouverneur morris stood on one of his hills and saw the indian canoes in the hudson and in the sound and rejoiced that all the land between belonged to him if you do not believe in heredity the fact that jimmies greatgreatgrandfather was a scout for general washington and hunted deer and even bear over exactly the same hills where jimmie hunted weasels will count for nothing it will not explain why to jimmie from tarrytown to port chester the hills the roads the woods and the cowpaths caves streams and springs hidden in the woods were as familiar as his own kitchen garden nor explain why when you could not see a pease and elliman for sale sign nailed to a tree jimmie could see in the highest branches a last years birds nest or why when he was out alone playing indians and had sunk his scouts axe into a fallen log and then scalped the log he felt that once before in those same woods he had trailed that same indian and with his own tomahawk split open his skull sometimes when he knelt to drink at a secret spring in the forest the autumn leaves would crackle and he would raise his eyes fearing to see a panther facing him but there aint no panthers in westchester jimmie would reassure himself and in the distance the roar of an automobile climbing a hill with the muffler open would seem to suggest he was right but still jimmie remembered once before he had knelt at that same spring and that when he raised his eyes he had faced a crouching panther mebbe dad told me it happened to grandpop jimmie would explain or i dreamed it or mebbe i read it in a story book the german spy mania attacked round hill after the visit to the boy scouts of clavering gould the war correspondent he was spending the weekend with squire harry van vorst and as young van vorst besides being a justice of the peace and a master of beagles and president of the country club was also a local councilman for the round hill scouts he brought his guest to a campfire meeting to talk to them in deference to his audience gould told them of the boy scouts he had seen in belgium and of the part they were playing in the great war it was his peroration that made trouble and any day he assured his audience this country may be at war with germany and every one of you boys will be expected to do his bit you can begin now when the germans land it will be near new haven or new bedford they will first capture the munition works at springfield hartford and watervliet so as to make sure of their ammunition and then they will start for new york city they will follow the new haven and new york central railroads and march straight through this village i havent the least doubt exclaimed the enthusiastic war prophet that at this moment german spies are as thick in westchester as blackberries they are here to select camp sites and gun positions to find out which of these hills enfilade the others and to learn to what extent their armies can live on the country they are counting the cows the horses the barns where fodder is stored and they are marking down on their maps the wells and streams as though at that moment a german spy might be crouching behind the door mr gould spoke in a whisper keep your eyes open he commanded watch every stranger if he acts suspiciously get word quick to your sheriff or to judge van vorst here remember the scouts motto be prepared that night as the scouts walked home behind each wall and hayrick they saw spiked helmets young van vorst was extremely annoyed next time you talk to my scouts he declared youll talk on votes for women after what you said tonight every realestate agent who dares open a map will be arrested were not trying to drive people away from westchester were trying to sell them building sites you are not retorted his friend you own half the county now and youre trying to buy the other half im a justice of the peace explained van vorst i dont know why i am except that they wished it on me all i get out of it is trouble the italians make charges against my best friends for overspeeding and i have to fine them and my best friends bring charges against the italians for poaching and when i fine the italians they send me black hand letters and now every day ill be asked to issue a warrant for a german spy who is selecting gun sites and he will turn out to be a millionaire who is tired of living at the ritzcarlton and wants to own his own home and his own golflinks and hell be so hot at being arrested that hell take his millions to long island and try to break into the piping rock club and it will be your fault the young justice of the peace was right at least so far as jimmie sniffen was concerned the words of the war prophet had filled one mind with unrest in the past jimmies idea of a holiday had been to spend it scouting in the woods in this pleasure he was selfish he did not want companions who talked and trampled upon the dead leaves so that they frightened the wild animals and gave the indians warning jimmie liked to pretend he liked to fill the woods with wary and hostile adversaries it was a game of his own inventing if he crept to the top of a hill and on peering over it surprised a fat woodchuck he pretended the woodchuck was a bear weighing two hundred pounds if himself unobserved he could lie and watch off its guard a rabbit squirrel or most difficult of all a crow it became a deer and that night at supper jimmie made believe he was eating venison sometimes he was a scout of the continental army and carried despatches to general washington the rules of that game were that if any man ploughing in the fields or cutting trees in the woods or even approaching along the same road saw jimmie before jimmie saw him jimmie was taken prisoner and before sunrise was shot as a spy he was seldom shot or else why on his sleeve was the badge for stalking but always to have to make believe became monotonous even dry shopping along the rue de la paix when you pretend you can have anything you see in any window leaves one just as rich but unsatisfied so the advice of the war correspondent to seek out german spies came to jimmie like a day at the circus like a week at the danbury fair it not only was a call to arms to protect his flag and home but a chance to play in earnest the game in which he most delighted no longer need he pretend no longer need he waste his energies in watching unobserved a greedy rabbit rob a carrot field the game now was his fellowman and his enemy not only his enemy but the enemy of his country in his first effort jimmie was not entirely successful the man looked the part perfectly he wore an auburn beard disguising spectacles and he carried a suspicious knapsack but he turned out to be a professor from the museum of natural history who wanted to dig for indian arrowheads and when jimmie threatened to arrest him the indignant gentleman arrested jimmie jimmie escaped only by leading the professor to a secret cave of his own though on some one elses property where one not only could dig for arrowheads but find them the professor was delighted but for jimmie it was a great disappointment the week following jimmie was again disappointed on the bank of the kensico reservoir he came upon a man who was acting in a mysterious and suspicious manner he was making notes in a book and his runabout which he had concealed in a wood road was stuffed with blueprints it did not take jimmie long to guess his purpose he was planning to blow up the kensico dam and cut off the water supply of new york city seven millions of people without water without firing a shot new york must surrender at the thought jimmie shuddered and at the risk of his life by clinging to the tail of a motor truck he followed the runabout into white plains but there it developed the mysterious stranger so far from wishing to destroy the kensico dam was the state engineer who had built it and also a large part of the panama canal nor in his third effort was jimmie more successful from the heights of pound ridge he discovered on a hilltop below him a man working along upon a basin of concrete the man was a germanamerican and already on jimmies list of suspects that for the use of the german artillery he was preparing a concrete bed for a siege gun was only too evident but closer investigation proved that the concrete was only two inches thick and the hyphenated one explained that the basin was built over a spring in the waters of which he planned to erect a fountain and raise goldfish it was a bitter blow jimmie became discouraged meeting judge van vorst one day in the road he told him his troubles the young judge proved unsympathetic my advice to you jimmie he said is to go slow accusing everybody of espionage is a very serious matter if you call a man a spy its sometimes hard for him to disprove it and the name sticks so go slow very slow before you arrest any more people come to me first for a warrant so the next time jimmie proceeded with caution besides being a farmer in a small way jimmies father was a handy man with tools he had no union card but in laying shingles along a blue chalk line few were as expert it was august there was no school and jimmie was carrying a dinnerpail to where his father was at work on a new barn he made a crosscut through the woods and came upon the young man in the golfcap the stranger nodded and his eyes which seemed to be always laughing smiled pleasantly but he was deeply tanned and from the waist up held himself like a soldier so at once jimmie mistrusted him early the next morning jimmie met him again it had not been raining but the clothes of the young man were damp jimmie guessed that while the dew was still on the leaves the young man had been forcing his way through underbrush the stranger must have remembered jimmie for he laughed and exclaimed ah my friend with the dinnerpail its luck you havent got it now or id hold you up im starving jimmie smiled in sympathy its early to be hungry said jimmie when did you have your breakfast i didnt laughed the young man i went out to walk up an appetite and i lost myself but i havent lost my appetite which is the shortest way back to bedford the first road to your right said jimmie is it far asked the stranger anxiously that he was very hungry was evident its a halfhours walk said jimmie if i live that long corrected the young man and stepped out briskly jimmie knew that within a hundred yards a turn in the road would shut him from sight so he gave the stranger time to walk that distance and then diving into the wood that lined the road stalked him from behind a tree he saw the stranger turn and look back and seeing no one in the road behind him also leave it and plunge into the woods he had not turned toward bedford he had turned to the left like a runner stealing bases jimmie slipped from tree to tree ahead of him he heard the stranger trampling upon dead twigs moving rapidly as one who knew his way at times through the branches jimmie could see the broad shoulders of the stranger and again could follow his progress only by the noise of the crackling twigs when the noises ceased jimmie guessed the stranger had reached the wood road grassgrown and mosscovered that led to middle patent so he ran at right angles until he also reached it and as now he was close to where it entered the main road he approached warily but he was too late there was a sound like the whir of a rising partridge and ahead of him from where it had been hidden a gray touringcar leaped into the highway the stranger was at the wheel throwing behind it a cloud of dust the car raced toward greenwich jimmie had time to note only that it bore a connecticut state license that in the wheelruts the tires printed little vs like arrowheads for a week jimmie saw nothing of the spy but for many hot and dusty miles he stalked arrowheads they lured him north they lured him south they were stamped in soft asphalt in mud dust and freshspread tarvia wherever jimmie walked arrowheads ran before in his sleep as in his copybook he saw endless chains of vs but not once could he catch up with the wheels that printed them a week later just at sunset as he passed below round hill he saw the stranger on top of it on the skyline in silhouette against the sinking sun he was as conspicuous as a flagstaff but to approach him was impossible for acres round hill offered no other cover than stubble it was as bald as a skull until the stranger chose to descend jimmie must wait and the stranger was in no haste the sun sank and from the west jimmie saw him turn his face east toward the sound a storm was gathering drops of rain began to splash and as the sky grew black the figure on the hilltop faded into the darkness and then at the very spot where jimmie had last seen it there suddenly flared two tiny flashes of fire jimmie leaped from cover it was no longer to be endured the spy was signalling the time for caution had passed now was the time to act jimmie raced to the top of the hill and found it empty he plunged down it vaulted a stone wall forced his way through a tangle of saplings and held his breath to listen just beyond him over a jumble of rocks a hidden stream was tripping and tumbling joyfully it laughed and gurgled jimmie turned hot it sounded as though from the darkness the spy mocked him jimmie shook his fist at the enshrouding darkness above the tumult of the coming storm and the tossing treetops he raised his voice you wait he shouted ill get you yet next time ill bring a gun next time was the next morning there had been a hawk hovering over the chicken yard and jimmie used that fact to explain his borrowing the family shotgun he loaded it with buckshot and in the pocket of his shirt buttoned his license to hunt pursue and kill to take with traps or other devices he remembered that judge van vorst had warned him before he arrested more spies to come to him for a warrant but with an impatient shake of the head jimmie tossed the recollection from him after what he had seen he could not possibly be again mistaken he did not need a warrant what he had seen was his warrant plus the shotgun as a pathfinder should he planned to take up the trail where he had lost it but before he reached round hill he found a warmer trail before him stamped clearly in the road still damp from the rain of the night before two lines of little arrowheads pointed the way they were so fresh that at each twist in the road lest the car should be just beyond him jimmie slackened his steps after half a mile the scent grew hot the tracks were deeper the arrowheads more clearly cut and jimmie broke into a run then the arrowheads swung suddenly to the right and in a clearing at the edge of a wood were lost but the tires had pressed deep into the grass and just inside the wood he found the car it was empty jimmie was drawn two ways should he seek the spy on the nearest hilltop or until the owner returned wait by the car between lying in ambush and action jimmie preferred action but he did not climb the hill nearest the car he climbed the hill that overlooked that hill flat on the ground hidden in the goldenrod he lay motionless before him for fifteen miles stretched hills and tiny valleys six miles away to his right rose the stone steeple and the red roofs of greenwich directly before him were no signs of habitation only green forests green fields gray stone walls and where a road ran uphill a splash of white that quivered in the heat the storm of the night before had washed the air each leaf stood by itself nothing stirred and in the glare of the august sun every detail of the landscape was as distinct as those in a colored photograph and as still in his excitement the scout was trembling if he moves he sighed happily ive got him opposite across a little valley was the hill at the base of which he had found the car the slope toward him was bare but the top was crowned with a thick wood and along its crest as though establishing an ancient boundary ran a stone wall mosscovered and wrapped in poisonivy in places the branches of the trees reaching out to the sun overhung the wall and hid it in black shadows jimmie divided the hill into sectors he began at the right and slowly followed the wall with his eyes he took it apart stone by stone had a chipmunk raised his head jimmie would have seen him so when from the stone wall like the reflection of the sun upon a windowpane something flashed jimmie knew he had found his spy a pair of binoculars had betrayed him jimmie now saw him clearly he sat on the ground at the top of the hill opposite in the deep shadow of an oak his back against the stone wall with the binoculars to his eyes he had leaned too far forward and upon the glass the sun had flashed a warning jimmie appreciated that his attack must be made from the rear backward like a crab he wriggled free of the goldenrod and hidden by the contour of the hill raced down it and into the woods on the hill opposite when he came to within twenty feet of the oak beneath which he had seen the stranger he stood erect and as though avoiding a live wire stepped on tiptoe to the wall the stranger still sat against it the binoculars hung from a cord around his neck across his knees was spread a map he was marking it with a pencil and as he worked he hummed a tune jimmie knelt and resting the gun on the top of the wall covered him throw up your hands he commanded the stranger did not start except that he raised his eyes he gave no sign that he had heard his eyes stared across the little sunfilled valley they were half closed as though in study as though perplexed by some deep and intricate problem they appeared to see beyond the sunfilled valley some place of greater moment some place far distant then the eyes smiled and slowly as though his neck were stiff but still smiling the stranger turned his head when he saw the boy his smile was swept away in waves of surprise amazement and disbelief these were followed instantly by an expression of the most acute alarm dont point that thing at me shouted the stranger is it loaded with his cheek pressed to the stock and his eye squinted down the length of the brown barrel jimmie nodded the stranger flung up his open palms they accented his expression of amazed incredulity he seemed to be exclaiming can such things be get up commanded jimmie with alacrity the stranger rose walk over there ordered the scout walk backward stop take off those fieldglasses and throw them to me without removing his eyes from the gun the stranger lifted the binoculars from his neck and tossed them to the stone wall see here he pleaded if youll only point that damned blunderbuss the other way you can have the glasses and my watch and clothes and all my money only dont jimmie flushed crimson you cant bribe me he growled at least he tried to growl but because his voice was changing or because he was excited the growl ended in a high squeak with mortification jimmie flushed a deeper crimson but the stranger was not amused at jimmies words he seemed rather the more amazed im not trying to bribe you he protested if you dont want anything why are you holding me up im not returned jimmie im arresting you the stranger laughed with relief again his eyes smiled oh he cried i see have i been trespassing with a glance jimmie measured the distance between himself and the stranger reassured he lifted one leg after the other over the wall if you try to rush me he warned ill shoot you full of buckshot the stranger took a hasty step backward dont worry about that he exclaimed ill not rush you why am i arrested hugging the shotgun with his left arm jimmie stopped and lifted the binoculars he gave them a swift glance slung them over his shoulder and again clutched his weapon his expression was now stern and menacing the name on them he accused is weiss berlin is that your name the stranger smiled but corrected himself and replied gravely thats the name of the firm that makes them jimmie exclaimed in triumph hah he cried made in germany the stranger shook his head i dont understand he said where would a weiss glass be made with polite insistence he repeated would you mind telling me why i am arrested and who you might happen to be jimmie did not answer again he stooped and picked up the map and as he did so for the first time the face of the stranger showed that he was annoyed jimmie was not at home with maps they told him nothing but the penciled notes on this one made easy reading at his first glance he saw correct range yards this stream not fordable slope of hill degrees inaccessible for artillery wire entanglements here forage for five squadrons jimmies eyes flashed he shoved the map inside his shirt and with the gun motioned toward the base of the hill keep forty feet ahead of me he commanded and walk to your car the stranger did not seem to hear him he spoke with irritation i suppose he said ill have to explain to you about that map not to me you wont declared his captor youre going to drive straight to judge van vorsts and explain to him the stranger tossed his arms even higher thank god he exclaimed gratefully with his prisoner jimmie encountered no further trouble he made a willing captive and if in covering the five miles to judge van vorsts he exceeded the speed limit the fact that from the rear seat jimmie held the shotgun against the base of his skull was an extenuating circumstance they arrived in the nick of time in his own car young van vorst and a bag of golf clubs were just drawing away from the house seeing the car climbing the steep driveway that for a halfmile led from his lodge to his front door and seeing jimmie standing in the tonneau brandishing a gun the judge hastily descended the sight of the spy hunter filled him with misgiving but the sight of him gave jimmie sweet relief arresting german spies for a small boy is no easy task for jimmie the strain was great and now that he knew he had successfully delivered him into the hands of the law jimmies heart rose with happiness the added presence of a butler of magnificent bearing and of an athletic looking chauffeur increased his sense of security their presence seemed to afford a feeling of security to the prisoner also as he brought the car to a halt he breathed a sigh it was a sigh of deep relief jimmie fell from the tonneau in concealing his sense of triumph he was not entirely successful i got him he cried i didnt make no mistake about this one what one demanded van vorst jimmie pointed dramatically at his prisoner with an anxious expression the stranger was tenderly fingering the back of his head he seemed to wish to assure himself that it was still there that one cried jimmie hes a german spy the patience of judge van vorst fell from him in his exclamation was indignation anger reproach jimmie he cried jimmie thrust into his hand the map it was his exhibit a look what hes wrote commanded the scout its all military words and these are his glasses i took em off him theyre made in germany i been stalking him for a week hes a spy when jimmie thrust the map before his face van vorst had glanced at it then he regarded it more closely as he raised his eyes they showed that he was puzzled but he greeted the prisoner politely im extremely sorry youve been annoyed he said im only glad its no worse he might have shot you hes mad over the idea that every stranger he sees the prisoner quickly interrupted please he begged dont blame the boy he behaved extremely well might i speak with you alone he asked judge van vorst led the way across the terrace and to the smokingroom that served also as his office and closed the door the stranger walked directly to the mantelpiece and put his finger on a gold cup i saw your mare win that at belmont park he said she must have been a great loss to you she was said van vorst the week before she broke her back i refused three thousand for her will you have a cigarette the stranger waved aside the cigarettes i brought you inside he said because i didnt want your servants to hear and because i dont want to hurt that boys feelings hes a fine boy and hes a damned clever scout i knew he was following me and i threw him off twice but today he caught me fair if i really had been a german spy i couldnt have got away from him and i want him to think he has captured a german spy because he deserves just as much credit as though he had and because its best he shouldnt know whom he did capture van vorst pointed to the map my bet is he said that youre an officer of the state militia taking notes for the fall manoeuvres am i right the stranger smiled in approval but shook his head youre warm he said but its more serious than manoeuvres its the real thing from his pocketbook he took a visiting card and laid it on the table im sherry mccoy he said captain of artillery in the united states army he nodded to the hand telephone on the table you can call up governors island and get general wood or his aide captain dorey on the phone they sent me here ask them im not picking out gun sites for the germans im picking out positions of defense for americans when the germans come van vorst laughed derisively my word he exclaimed youre as bad as jimmie captain mccoy regarded him with disfavor and you sir he retorted are as bad as ninety million other americans you wont believe when the germans are shelling this hill when theyre taking your hunters to pull their cookwagons maybe youll believe then are you serious demanded van vorst and you an army officer thats why i am serious returned mccoy we know but when we try to prepare for what is coming we must do it secretly in underhand ways for fear the newspapers will get hold of it and ridicule us and accuse us of trying to drag the country into war thats why we have to prepare under cover thats why ive had to skulk around these hills like a chicken thief and he added sharply thats why that boy must not know who i am if he does the general staff will get a calling down at washington and ill have my ears boxed van vorst moved to the door he will never learn the truth from me he said for i will tell him you are to be shot at sunrise good laughed the captain and tell me his name if ever we fight over westchester county i want that lad for my chief of scouts and give him this tell him to buy a new scout uniform tell him it comes from you but no money could reconcile jimmie to the sentence imposed upon his captive he received the news with a howl of anguish you mustnt he begged i never knowed youd shoot him i wouldnt have caught him if id knowed that i couldnt sleep if i thought he was going to be shot at sunrise at the prospect of unending nightmares jimmies voice shook with terror make it for twenty years he begged make it for ten he coaxed but please promise you wont shoot him when van vorst returned to captain mccoy he was smiling and the butler who followed bearing a tray and tinkling glasses was trying not to smile i gave jimmie your ten dollars said van vorst and made it twenty and he has gone home you will be glad to hear that he begged me to spare your life and that your sentence has been commuted to twenty years in a fortress i drink to your good fortune no protested captain mccoy we will drink to jimmie when captain mccoy had driven away and his own car and the golf clubs had again been brought to the steps judge van vorst once more attempted to depart but he was again delayed other visitors were arriving up the driveway a touringcar approached and though it limped on a flat tire it approached at reckless speed the two men in the front seat were white with dust their faces masked by automobile glasses were indistinguishable as though preparing for an immediate exit the car swung in a circle until its nose pointed down the driveway up which it had just come raising his silk mask the one beside the driver shouted at judge van vorst his throat was parched his voice was hoarse and hot with anger a gray touringcar he shouted it stopped here we saw it from that hill then the damn tire burst and we lost our way where did he go who demanded van vorst stiffly captain mccoy the man exploded with an oath the driver with a shove of his elbow silenced him yes captain mccoy assented the driver eagerly which way did he go to new york said van vorst the driver shrieked at his companion then hes doubled back he cried hes gone to new haven he stooped and threw in the clutch the car lurched forward a cold terror swept young van vorst what do you want with him he called who are you over one shoulder the masked face glared at him above the roar of the car the words of the driver were flung back were secret service from washington he shouted hes from their embassy hes a german spy leaping and throbbing at sixty miles an hour the car vanished in a curtain of white whirling dust gallegher a newspaper story we had had so many officeboys before gallegher came among us that they had begun to lose the characteristics of individuals and became merged in a composite photograph of small boys to whom we applied the generic title of here you or you boy we had had sleepy boys and lazy boys and bright smart boys who became so familiar on so short an acquaintance that we were forced to part with them to save our own selfrespect they generally graduated into districtmessenger boys and occasionally returned to us in blue coats with nickelplated buttons and patronized us but gallegher was something different from anything we had experienced before gallegher was short and broad in build with a solid muscular broadness and not a fat and dumpy shortness he wore perpetually on his face a happy and knowing smile as if you and the world in general were not impressing him as seriously as you thought you were and his eyes which were very black and very bright snapped intelligently at you like those of a little blackandtan terrier all gallegher knew had been learnt on the streets not a very good school in itself but one that turns out very knowing scholars and gallegher had attended both morning and evening sessions he could not tell you who the pilgrim fathers were nor could he name the thirteen original states but he knew all the officers of the twentysecond police district by name and he could distinguish the clang of a fireengines gong from that of a patrolwagon or an ambulance fully two blocks distant it was gallegher who rang the alarm when the woolwich mills caught fire while the officer on the beat was asleep and it was gallegher who led the black diamonds against the wharf rats when they used to stone each other to their hearts content on the coalwharves of richmond i am afraid now that i see these facts written down that gallegher was not a reputable character but he was so very young and so very old for his years that we all liked him very much nevertheless he lived in the extreme northern part of philadelphia where the cotton and woollen mills run down to the river and how he ever got home after leaving the press building at two in the morning was one of the mysteries of the office sometimes he caught a night car and sometimes he walked all the way arriving at the little house where his mother and himself lived alone at four in the morning occasionally he was given a ride on an early milkcart or on one of the newspaper delivery wagons with its high piles of papers still damp and sticky from the press he knew several drivers of night hawks those cabs that prowl the streets at night looking for belated passengers and when it was a very cold morning he would not go home at all but would crawl into one of these cabs and sleep curled up on the cushions until daylight besides being quick and cheerful gallegher possessed a power of amusing the presss young men to a degree seldom attained by the ordinary mortal his clogdancing on the city editors desk when that gentleman was upstairs fighting for two more columns of space was always a source of innocent joy to us and his imitations of the comedians of the variety halls delighted even the dramatic critic from whom the comedians themselves failed to force a smile but galleghers chief characteristic was his love for that element of news generically classed as crime not that he ever did anything criminal himself on the contrary his was rather the work of the criminal specialist and his morbid interest in the doings of all queer characters his knowledge of their methods their present whereabouts and their past deeds of transgression often rendered him a valuable ally to our police reporter whose daily feuilletons were the only portion of the paper gallegher deigned to read in gallegher the detective element was abnormally developed he had shown this on several occasions and to excellent purpose once the paper had sent him into a home for destitute orphans which was believed to be grievously mismanaged and gallegher while playing the part of a destitute orphan kept his eyes open to what was going on around him so faithfully that the story he told of the treatment meted out to the real orphans was sufficient to rescue the unhappy little wretches from the individual who had them in charge and to have the individual himself sent to jail galleghers knowledge of the aliases terms of imprisonment and various misdoings of the leading criminals in philadelphia was almost as thorough as that of the chief of police himself and he could tell to an hour when dutchy mack was to be let out of prison and could identify at a glance dick oxford confidence man as gentleman dan petty thief there were at this time only two pieces of news in any of the papers the least important of the two was the big fight between the champion of the united states and the wouldbe champion arranged to take place near philadelphia the second was the burrbank murder which was filling space in newspapers all over the world from new york to bombay richard f burrbank was one of the most prominent of new yorks railroad lawyers he was also as a matter of course an owner of much railroad stock and a very wealthy man he had been spoken of as a political possibility for many high offices and as the counsel for a great railroad was known even further than the great railroad itself had stretched its system at six oclock one morning he was found by his butler lying at the foot of the hall stairs with two pistol wounds above his heart he was quite dead his safe to which only he and his secretary had the keys was found open and in bonds stocks and money which had been placed there only the night before was found missing the secretary was missing also his name was stephen s hade and his name and his description had been telegraphed and cabled to all parts of the world there was enough circumstantial evidence to show beyond any question or possibility of mistake that he was the murderer it made an enormous amount of talk and unhappy individuals were being arrested all over the country and sent on to new york for identification three had been arrested at liverpool and one man just as he landed at sydney australia but so far the murderer had escaped we were all talking about it one night as everybody else was all over the country in the local room and the city editor said it was worth a fortune to any one who chanced to run across hade and succeeded in handing him over to the police some of us thought hade had taken passage from some one of the smaller seaports and others were of the opinion that he had buried himself in some cheap lodginghouse in new york or in one of the smaller towns in new jersey i shouldnt be surprised to meet him out walking right here in philadelphia said one of the staff hell be disguised of course but you could always tell him by the absence of the trigger finger on his right hand its missing you know shot off when he was a boy you want to look for a man dressed like a tough said the city editor for as this fellow is to all appearances a gentleman he will try to look as little like a gentleman as possible no he wont said gallegher with that calm impertinence that made him dear to us hell dress just like a gentleman toughs dont wear gloves and you see hes got to wear em the first thing he thought of after doing for burrbank was of that gone finger and how he was to hide it he stuffed the finger of that glove with cotton sos to make it look like a whole finger and the first time he takes off that glove theyve got him see and he knows it so what youse want to do is to look for a man with gloves on ive been adoing it for two weeks now and i can tell you its hard work for everybody wears gloves this kind of weather but if you look long enough youll find him and when you think its him go up to him and hold out your hand in a friendly way like a buncosteerer and shake his hand and if you feel that his forefinger aint real flesh but just wadded cotton then grip to it with your right and grab his throat with your left and holler for help there was an appreciative pause i see gentlemen said the city editor dryly that galleghers reasoning has impressed you and i also see that before the week is out all of my young men will be under bonds for assaulting innocent pedestrians whose only offense is that they wear gloves in midwinter it was about a week after this that detective hefflefinger of inspector byrness staff came over to philadelphia after a burglar of whose whereabouts he had been misinformed by telegraph he brought the warrant requisition and other necessary papers with him but the burglar had flown one of our reporters had worked on a new york paper and knew hefflefinger and the detective came to the office to see if he could help him in his so far unsuccessful search he gave gallegher his card and after gallegher had read it and had discovered who the visitor was he became so demoralized that he was absolutely useless one of byrness men was a much more aweinspiring individual to gallegher than a member of the cabinet he accordingly seized his hat and overcoat and leaving his duties to be looked after by others hastened out after the object of his admiration who found his suggestions and knowledge of the city so valuable and his company so entertaining that they became very intimate and spent the rest of the day together in the meanwhile the managing editor had instructed his subordinates to inform gallegher when he condescended to return that his services were no longer needed gallegher had played truant once too often unconscious of this he remained with his new friend until late the same evening and started the next afternoon toward the press office as i have said gallegher lived in the most distant part of the city not many minutes walk from the kensington railroad station where trains ran into the suburbs and on to new york it was in front of this station that a smoothly shaven welldressed man brushed past gallegher and hurried up the steps to the ticket office he held a walkingstick in his right hand and gallegher who now patiently scrutinized the hands of every one who wore gloves saw that while three fingers of the mans hand were closed around the cane the fourth stood out in almost a straight line with his palm gallegher stopped with a gasp and with a trembling all over his little body and his brain asked with a throb if it could be possible but possibilities and probabilities were to be discovered later now was the time for action he was after the man in a moment hanging at his heels and his eyes moist with excitement he heard the man ask for a ticket to torresdale a little station just outside of philadelphia and when he was out of hearing but not out of sight purchased one for the same place the stranger went into the smokingcar and seated himself at one end toward the door gallegher took his place at the opposite end he was trembling all over and suffered from a slight feeling of nausea he guessed it came from fright not of any bodily harm that might come to him but of the probability of failure in his adventure and of its most momentous possibilities the stranger pulled his coat collar up around his ears hiding the lower portion of his face but not concealing the resemblance in his troubled eyes and closeshut lips to the likenesses of the murderer hade they reached torresdale in half an hour and the stranger alighting quickly struck off at a rapid pace down the country road leading to the station gallegher gave him a hundred yards start and then followed slowly after the road ran between fields and past a few framehouses set far from the road in kitchen gardens once or twice the man looked back over his shoulder but he saw only a dreary length of road with a small boy splashing through the slush in the midst of it and stopping every now and again to throw snowballs at belated sparrows after a ten minutes walk the stranger turned into a side road which led to only one place the eagle inn an old roadside hostelry known now as the headquarters for pothunters from the philadelphia game market and the battleground of many a cockfight gallegher knew the place well he and his young companions had often stopped there when out chestnutting on holidays in the autumn the son of the man who kept it had often accompanied them on their excursions and though the boys of the city streets considered him a dumb lout they respected him somewhat owing to his inside knowledge of dog and cockfights the stranger entered the inn at a side door and gallegher reaching it a few minutes later let him go for the time being and set about finding his occasional playmate young keppler kepplers offspring was found in the woodshed taint hard to guess what brings you out here said the tavernkeepers son with a grin its the fight what fight asked gallegher unguardedly what fight why the fight returned his companion with the slow contempt of superior knowledge its to come off here tonight you knew that as well as me anyway your sportin editor knows it he got the tip last night but that wont help you any you neednt think theres any chance of your getting a peep at it why tickets is two hundred and fifty apiece whew whistled gallegher wheres it to be in the barn whispered keppler i helped em fix the ropes this morning i did gosh but youre in luck exclaimed gallegher with flattering envy couldnt i jest get a peep at it maybe said the gratified keppler theres a winder with a wooden shutter at the back of the barn you can get in by it if you have some one to boost you up to the sill saay drawled gallegher as if something had but just that moment reminded him whos that gent who come down the road just a bit ahead of me him with the capecoat has he got anything to do with the fight him repeated keppler in tones of sincere disgust nooh he aint no sport hes queer dad thinks he come here one day last week about ten in the morning said his doctor told him to go out en the country for his health hes stuck up and citified and wears gloves and takes his meals private in his room and all that sort of ruck they was saying in the saloon last night that they thought he was hiding from something and dad just to try him asks him last night if he was coming to see the fight he looked sort of scared and said he didnt want to see no fight and then dad says i guess you mean you dont want no fighters to see you dad didnt mean no harm by it just passed it as a joke but mr carleton as he calls himself got white as a ghost an says ill go to the fight willing enough and begins to laugh and joke and this morning he went right into the barroom where all the sports were setting and said he was going into town to see some friends and as he starts off he laughs an says this dont look as if i was afraid of seeing people does it but dad says it was just bluff that made him do it and dad thinks that if he hadnt said what he did this mr carleton wouldnt have left his room at all gallegher had got all he wanted and much more than he had hoped for so much more that his walk back to the station was in the nature of a triumphal march he had twenty minutes to wait for the next train and it seemed an hour while waiting he sent a telegram to hefflefinger at his hotel it read your man is near the torresdale station on pennsylvania railroad take cab and meet me at station wait until i come gallegher with the exception of one at midnight no other train stopped at torresdale that evening hence the direction to take a cab the train to the city seemed to gallegher to drag itself by inches it stopped and backed at purposeless intervals waited for an express to precede it and dallied at stations and when at last it reached the terminus gallegher was out before it had stopped and was in the cab and off on his way to the home of the sporting editor the sporting editor was at dinner and came out in the hall to see him with his napkin in his hand gallegher explained breathlessly that he had located the murderer for whom the police of two continents were looking and that he believed in order to quiet the suspicions of the people with whom he was hiding that he would be present at the fight that night the sporting editor led gallegher into his library and shut the door now he said go over all that again gallegher went over it again in detail and added how he had sent for hefflefinger to make the arrest in order that it might be kept from the knowledge of the local police and from the philadelphia reporters what i want hefflefinger to do is to arrest hade with the warrant he has for the burglar explained gallegher and to take him on to new york on the owl train that passes torresdale at one it dont get to jersey city until four oclock one hour after the morning papers go to press of course we must fix hefflefinger sos hell keep quiet and not tell who his prisoner really is the sporting editor reached his hand out to pat gallegher on the head but changed his mind and shook hands with him instead my boy he said you are an infant phenomenon if i can pull the rest of this thing off tonight it will mean the reward and fame galore for you and the paper now im going to write a note to the managing editor and you can take it around to him and tell him what youve done and what i am going to do and hell take you back on the paper and raise your salary perhaps you didnt know youve been discharged do you think you aint agoing to take me with you demanded gallegher why certainly not why should i it all lies with the detective and myself now youve done your share and done it well if the mans caught the rewards yours but youd only be in the way now youd better go to the office and make your peace with the chief if the paper can get along without me i can get along without the old paper said gallegher hotly and if i aint agoing with you you aint neither for i know where hefflefinger is to be and you dont and i wont tell you oh very well very well replied the sporting editor weakly capitulating ill send the note by a messenger only mind if you lose your place dont blame me gallegher wondered how this man could value a weeks salary against the excitement of seeing a noted criminal run down and of getting the news to the paper and to that one paper alone from that moment the sporting editor sank in galleghers estimation mr dwyer sat down at his desk and scribbled off the following note i have received reliable information that hade the burrbank murderer will be present at the fight tonight we have arranged it so that he will be arrested quietly and in such a manner that the fact may be kept from all other papers i need not point out to you that this will be the most important piece of news in the country tomorrow yours etc michael e dwyer the sporting editor stepped into the waiting cab while gallegher whispered the directions to the driver he was told to go first to a districtmessenger office and from there up to the ridge avenue road out broad street and on to the old eagle inn near torresdale it was a miserable night the rain and snow were falling together and freezing as they fell the sporting editor got out to send his message to the press office and then lighting a cigar and turning up the collar of his greatcoat curled up in the corner of the cab wake me when we get there gallegher he said he knew he had a long ride and much rapid work before him and he was preparing for the strain to gallegher the idea of going to sleep seemed almost criminal from the dark corner of the cab his eyes shone with excitement and with the awful joy of anticipation he glanced every now and then to where the sporting editors cigar shone in the darkness and watched it as it gradually burnt more dimly and went out the lights in the shop windows threw a broad glare across the ice on the pavements and the lights from the lampposts tossed the distorted shadow of the cab and the horse and the motionless driver sometimes before and sometimes behind them after half an hour gallegher slipped down to the bottom of the cab and dragged out a laprobe in which he wrapped himself it was growing colder and the damp keen wind swept in through the cracks until the windowframes and woodwork were cold to the touch an hour passed and the cab was still moving more slowly over the rough surface of partly paved streets and by single rows of new houses standing at different angles to each other in fields covered with ashheaps and brickkilns here and there the gaudy lights of a drugstore and the forerunner of suburban civilization shone from the end of a new block of houses and the rubber cape of an occasional policeman showed in the light of the lamppost that he hugged for comfort then even the houses disappeared and the cab dragged its way between truck farms with desolatelooking glasscovered beds and pools of water halfcaked with ice and bare trees and interminable fences once or twice the cab stopped altogether and gallegher could hear the driver swearing to himself or at the horse or the roads at last they drew up before the station at torresdale it was quite deserted and only a single light cut a swath in the darkness and showed a portion of the platform the ties and the rails glistening in the rain they walked twice past the light before a figure stepped out of the shadow and greeted them cautiously i am mr dwyer of the press said the sporting editor briskly youve heard of me perhaps well there shouldnt be any difficulty in our making a deal should there this boy here has found hade and we have reason to believe he will be among the spectators at the fight tonight we want you to arrest him quietly and as secretly as possible you can do it with your papers and your badge easily enough we want you to pretend that you believe he is this burglar you came over after if you will do this and take him away without any one so much as suspecting who he really is and on the train that passes here at for new york we will give you out of the reward if however one other paper either in new york or philadelphia or anywhere else knows of the arrest you wont get a cent now what do you say the detective had a great deal to say he wasnt at all sure the man gallegher suspected was hade he feared he might get himself into trouble by making a false arrest and if it should be the man he was afraid the local police would interfere weve no time to argue or debate this matter said dwyer warmly we agree to point hade out to you in the crowd after the fight is over you arrest him as we have directed and you get the money and the credit of the arrest if you dont like this i will arrest the man myself and have him driven to town with a pistol for a warrant hefflefinger considered in silence and then agreed unconditionally as you say mr dwyer he returned ive heard of you for a thoroughbred sport i know youll do what you say youll do and as for me ill do what you say and just as you say and its a very pretty piece of work as it stands they all stepped back into the cab and then it was that they were met by a fresh difficulty how to get the detective into the barn where the fight was to take place for neither of the two men had to pay for his admittance but this was overcome when gallegher remembered the window of which young keppler had told him in the event of hades losing courage and not daring to show himself in the crowd around the ring it was agreed that dwyer should come to the barn and warn hefflefinger but if he should come dwyer was merely to keep near him and to signify by a prearranged gesture which one of the crowd he was they drew up before a great black shadow of a house dark forbidding and apparently deserted but at the sound of the wheels on the gravel the door opened letting out a stream of warm cheerful light and a mans voice said put out those lights dont youse know no better than that this was keppler and he welcomed mr dwyer with effusive courtesy the two men showed in the stream of light and the door closed on them leaving the house as it was at first black and silent save for the dripping of the rain and snow from the eaves the detective and gallegher put out the cabs lamps and led the horse toward a long low shed in the rear of the yard which they now noticed was almost filled with teams of many different makes from the hobsons choice of a livery stable to the brougham of the man about town no said gallegher as the cabman stopped to hitch the horse beside the others we want it nearest that lower gate when we newspaper men leave this place well leave it in a hurry and the man who is nearest town is likely to get there first you wont be afollowing of no hearse when you make your return trip gallegher tied the horse to the very gatepost itself leaving the gate open and allowing a clear road and a flying start for the prospective race to newspaper row the driver disappeared under the shelter of the porch and gallegher and the detective moved off cautiously to the rear of the barn this must be the window said hefflefinger pointing to a broad wooden shutter some feet from the ground just you give me a boost once and ill get that open in a jiffy said gallegher the detective placed his hands on his knees and gallegher stood upon his shoulders and with the blade of his knife lifted the wooden button that fastened the window on the inside and pulled the shutter open then he put one leg inside over the sill and leaning down helped to draw his fellowconspirator up to a level with the window i feel just like i was burglarizing a house chuckled gallegher as he dropped noiselessly to the floor below and refastened the shutter the barn was a large one with a row of stalls on either side in which horses and cows were dozing there was a haymow over each row of stalls and at one end of the barn a number of fencerails had been thrown across from one mow to the other these rails were covered with hay in the middle of the floor was the ring it was not really a ring but a square with wooden posts at its four corners through which ran a heavy rope the space enclosed by the rope was covered with sawdust gallegher could not resist stepping into the ring and after stamping the sawdust once or twice as if to assure himself that he was really there began dancing around it and indulging in such a remarkable series of fistic manoeuvres with an imaginary adversary that the unimaginative detective precipitately backed into a corner of the barn now then said gallegher having apparently vanquished his foe you come with me his companion followed quickly as gallegher climbed to one of the haymows and crawling carefully out on the fencerail stretched himself at full length face downward in this position by moving the straw a little he could look down without being himself seen upon the heads of whomsoever stood below this is bettern a private box aint it said gallegher the boy from the newspaper office and the detective lay there in silence biting at straws and tossing anxiously on their comfortable bed it seemed fully two hours before they came gallegher had listened without breathing and with every muscle on a strain at least a dozen times when some movement in the yard had led him to believe that they were at the door and he had numerous doubts and fears sometimes it was that the police had learnt of the fight and had raided kepplers in his absence and again it was that the fight had been postponed or worst of all that it would be put off until so late that mr dwyer could not get back in time for the last edition of the paper their coming when at last they came was heralded by an advanceguard of two sporting men who stationed themselves at either side of the big door hurry up now gents one of the men said with a shiver dont keep this door open no longern is needful it was not a very large crowd but it was wonderfully well selected it ran in the majority of its component parts to heavy white coats with pearl buttons the white coats were shouldered by long blue coats with astrakhan fur trimmings the wearers of which preserved a cliqueness not remarkable when one considers that they believed every one else present to be either a crook or a prizefighter there were wellfed wellgroomed clubmen and brokers in the crowd a politician or two a popular comedian with his manager amateur boxers from the athletic clubs and quiet closemouthed sporting men from every city in the country their names if printed in the papers would have been as familiar as the types of the papers themselves and among these men whose only thought was of the brutal sport to come was hade with dwyer standing at ease at his shoulder hade white and visibly in deep anxiety hiding his pale face beneath a cloth travellingcap and with his chin muffled in a woollen scarf he had dared to come because he feared his danger from the already suspicious keppler was less than if he stayed away and so he was there hovering restlessly on the border of the crowd feeling his danger and sick with fear when hefflefinger first saw him he started up on his hands and elbows and made a movement forward as if he would leap down then and there and carry off his prisoner singlehanded lie down growled gallegher an officer of any sort wouldnt live three minutes in that crowd the detective drew back slowly and buried himself again in the straw but never once through the long fight which followed did his eyes leave the person of the murderer the newspaper men took their places in the foremost row close around the ring and kept looking at their watches and begging the master of ceremonies to shake it up do there was a great deal of betting and all of the men handled the great rolls of bills they wagered with a flippant recklessness which could only be accounted for in galleghers mind by temporary mental derangement some one pulled a box out into the ring and the master of ceremonies mounted it and pointed out in forcible language that as they were almost all already under bonds to keep the peace it behooved all to curb their excitement and to maintain a severe silence unless they wanted to bring the police upon them and have themselves sent down for a year or two then two very disreputablelooking persons tossed their respective principals high hats into the ring and the crowd recognizing in this relic of the days when brave knights threw down their gauntlets in the lists as only a sign that the fight was about to begin cheered tumultuously this was followed by a sudden surging forward and a mutter of admiration much more flattering than the cheers had been when the principals followed their hats and slipping out of their greatcoats stood forth in all the physical beauty of the perfect brute their pink skin was as soft and healthylooking as a babys and glowed in the lights of the lanterns like tinted ivory and underneath this silken covering the great biceps and muscles moved in and out and looked like the coils of a snake around the branch of a tree gentleman and blackguard shouldered each other for a nearer view the coachmen whose metal buttons were unpleasantly suggestive of police put their hands in the excitement of the moment on the shoulders of their masters the perspiration stood out in great drops on the foreheads of the backers and the newspaper men bit somewhat nervously at the ends of their pencils and in the stalls the cows munched contentedly at their cuds and gazed with gentle curiosity at their two fellowbrutes who stood waiting the signal to fall upon and kill each other if need be for the delectation of their brothers take your places commanded the master of ceremonies in the moment in which the two men faced each other the crowd became so still that save for the beating of the rain upon the shingled roof and the stamping of a horse in one of the stalls the place was as silent as a church time shouted the master of ceremonies the two men sprang into a posture of defense which was lost as quickly as it was taken one great arm shot out like a pistonrod there was the sound of bare fists beating on naked flesh there was an exultant indrawn gasp of savage pleasure and relief from the crowd and the great fight had begun how the fortunes of war rose and fell and changed and rechanged that night is an old story to those who listen to such stories and those who do not will be glad to be spared the telling of it it was they say one of the bitterest fights between two men that this country has ever known but all that is of interest here is that after an hour of this desperate brutal business the champion ceased to be the favorite the man whom he had taunted and bullied and for whom the public had but little sympathy was proving himself a likely winner and under his cruel blows as sharp and clean as those from a cutlass his opponent was rapidly giving way the men about the ropes were past all control now they drowned kepplers petitions for silence with oaths and in inarticulate shouts of anger as if the blows had fallen upon them and in mad rejoicings they swept from one end of the ring to the other with every muscle leaping in unison with those of the man they favored and when a new york correspondent muttered over his shoulder that this would be the biggest sporting surprise since the heenansayers fight mr dwyer nodded his head sympathetically in assent in the excitement and tumult it is doubtful if any heard the three quickly repeated blows that fell heavily from the outside upon the big doors of the barn if they did it was already too late to mend matters for the door fell torn from its hinges and as it fell a captain of police sprang into the light from out of the storm with his lieutenants and their men crowding close at his shoulder in the panic and stampede that followed several of the men stood as helplessly immovable as though they had seen a ghost others made a mad rush into the arms of the officers and were beaten back against the ropes of the ring others dived headlong into the stalls among the horses and cattle and still others shoved the rolls of money they held into the hands of the police and begged like children to be allowed to escape the instant the door fell and the raid was declared hefflefinger slipped over the cross rails on which he had been lying hung for an instant by his hands and then dropped into the centre of the fighting mob on the floor he was out of it in an instant with the agility of a pickpocket was across the room and at hades throat like a dog the murderer for the moment was the calmer man of the two here he panted hands off now theres no need for all this violence theres no great harm in looking at a fight is there theres a hundreddollar bill in my right hand take it and let me slip out of this no one is looking here but the detective only held him the closer i want you for burglary he whispered under his breath youve got to come with me now and quick the less fuss you make the better for both of us if you dont know who i am you can feel my badge under my coat there ive got the authority its all regular and when were out of this d d row ill show you the papers he took one hand from hades throat and pulled a pair of handcuffs from his pocket its a mistake this is an outrage gasped the murderer white and trembling but dreadfully alive and desperate for his liberty let me go i tell you take your hands off of me do i look like a burglar you fool i know who you look like whispered the detective with his face close to the face of his prisoner now will you go easy as a burglar or shall i tell these men who you are and what i do want you for shall i call out your real name or not shall i tell them quick speak up shall i there was something so exultant something so unnecessarily savage in the officers face that the man he held saw that the detective knew him for what he really was and the hands that had held his throat slipped down around his shoulders or he would have fallen the mans eyes opened and closed again and he swayed weakly backward and forward and choked as if his throat were dry and burning even to such a hardened connoisseur in crime as gallegher who stood closely by drinking it in there was something so abject in the mans terror that he regarded him with what was almost a touch of pity for gods sake hade begged let me go come with me to my room and ill give you half the money ill divide with you fairly we can both get away theres a fortune for both of us there we both can get away youll be rich for life do you understand for life but the detective to his credit only shut his lips the tighter thats enough he whispered in return thats more than i expected youve sentenced yourself already come illustration for gods sake hade begged let me go two officers in uniform barred their exit at the door but hefflefinger smiled easily and showed his badge one of byrness men he said in explanation came over expressly to take this chap hes a burglar arlie lane alias carleton ive shown the papers to the captain its all regular im just going to get his traps at the hotel and walk him over to the station i guess well push right on to new york tonight the officers nodded and smiled their admiration for the representative of what is perhaps the best detective force in the world and let him pass then hefflefinger turned and spoke to gallegher who still stood as watchful as a dog at his side im going to his room to get the bonds and stuff he whispered then ill march him to the station and take that train ive done my share dont forget yours oh youll get your money right enough said gallegher and saay he added with the appreciative nod of an expert do you know you did it rather well mr dwyer had been writing while the raid was settling down as he had been writing while waiting for the fight to begin now he walked over to where the other correspondents stood in angry conclave the newspaper men had informed the officers who hemmed them in that they represented the principal papers of the country and were expostulating vigorously with the captain who had planned the raid and who declared they were under arrest dont be an ass scott said mr dwyer who was too excited to be polite or politic you know our being here isnt a matter of choice we came here on business as you did and youve no right to hold us if we dont get our stuff on the wire at once protested a new york man well be too late for tomorrows paper and captain scott said he did not care a profanely small amount for tomorrows paper and that all he knew was that to the stationhouse the newspaper men would go there they would have a hearing and if the magistrate chose to let them off that was the magistrates business but that his duty was to take them into custody but then it will be too late dont you understand shouted mr dwyer youve got to let us go now at once i cant do it mr dwyer said the captain and thats all there is to it why havent i just sent the president of the junior republican club to the patrolwagon the man that put this coat on me and do you think i can let you fellows go after that you were all put under bonds to keep the peace not three days ago and here youre at it fighting like badgers its worth my place to let one of you off what mr dwyer said next was so uncomplimentary to the gallant captain scott that that overwrought individual seized the sporting editor by the shoulder and shoved him into the hands of two of his men this was more than the distinguished mr dwyer could brook and he excitedly raised his hand in resistance but before he had time to do anything foolish his wrist was gripped by one strong little hand and he was conscious that another was picking the pocket of his greatcoat he slapped his hands to his sides and looking down saw gallegher standing close behind him and holding him by the wrist mr dwyer had forgotten the boys existence and would have spoken sharply if something in galleghers innocent eyes had not stopped him galleghers hand was still in that pocket in which mr dwyer had shoved his notebook filled with what he had written of galleghers work and hades final capture and with a running descriptive account of the fight with his eyes fixed on mr dwyer gallegher drew it out and with a quick movement shoved it inside his waistcoat mr dwyer gave a nod of comprehension then glancing at his two guardsmen and finding that they were still interested in the wordy battle of the correspondents with their chief and had seen nothing he stooped and whispered to gallegher the forms are locked at twenty minutes to three if you dont get there by that time it will be of no use but if youre on time youll beat the town and the country too galleghers eyes flashed significantly and nodding his head to show he understood started boldly on a run toward the door but the officers who guarded it brought him to an abrupt halt and much to mr dwyers astonishment drew from him what was apparently a torrent of tears let me go to me father i want me father the boy shrieked hysterically theyve rested father oh daddy daddy theyre agoin to take you to prison who is your father sonny asked one of the guardians of the gate kepplers me father sobbed gallegher theyre agoin to lock him up and ill never see him no more oh yes you will said the officer goodnaturedly hes there in that first patrolwagon you can run over and say good night to him and then youd better get to bed this aint no place for kids of your age thank you sir sniffed gallegher tearfully as the two officers raised their clubs and let him pass out into the darkness the yard outside was in a tumult horses were stamping and plunging and backing the carriages into one another lights were flashing from every window of what had been apparently an uninhabited house and the voices of the prisoners were still raised in angry expostulation three police patrolwagons were moving about the yard filled with unwilling passengers who sat or stood packed together like sheep and with no protection from the sleet and rain gallegher stole off into a dark corner and watched the scene until his eyesight became familiar with the position of the land then with his eyes fixed fearfully on the swinging light of a lantern with which an officer was searching among the carriages he groped his way between horses hoofs and behind the wheels of carriages to the cab which he had himself placed at the furthermost gate it was still there and the horse as he had left it with its head turned toward the city gallegher opened the big gate noiselessly and worked nervously at the hitching strap the knot was covered with a thin coating of ice and it was several minutes before he could loosen it but his teeth finally pulled it apart and with the reins in his hands he sprang upon the wheel and as he stood so a shock of fear ran down his back like an electric current his breath left him and he stood immovable gazing with wide eyes into the darkness the officer with the lantern had suddenly loomed up from behind a carriage not fifty feet distant and was standing perfectly still with his lantern held over his head peering so directly toward gallegher that the boy felt that he must see him gallegher stood with one foot on the hub of the wheel and with the other on the box waiting to spring it seemed a minute before either of them moved and then the officer took a step forward and demanded sternly who is that what are you doing there there was no time for parley then gallegher felt that he had been taken in the act and that his only chance lay in open flight he leaped up on the box pulling out the whip as he did so and with a quick sweep lashed the horse across the head and back the animal sprang forward with a snort narrowly clearing the gatepost and plunged off into the darkness stop cried the officer so many of galleghers acquaintances among the longshoremen and mill hands had been challenged in so much the same manner that gallegher knew what would probably follow if the challenge was disregarded so he slipped from his seat to the footboard below and ducked his head the three reports of a pistol which rang out briskly from behind him proved that his early training had given him a valuable fund of useful miscellaneous knowledge dont you be scared he said reassuringly to the horse hes firing in the air the pistolshots were answered by the impatient clangor of a patrolwagons gong and glancing over his shoulder gallegher saw its red and green lanterns tossing from side to side and looking in the darkness like the sidelights of a yacht plunging forward in a storm i hadnt bargained to race you against no patrolwagons said gallegher to his animal but if they want a race well give them a tough tussle for it wont we philadelphia lying four miles to the south sent up a faint yellow glow to the sky it seemed very far away and galleghers braggadocio grew cold within him at the loneliness of his adventure and the thought of the long ride before him it was still bitterly cold the rain and sleet beat through his clothes and struck his skin with a sharp chilling touch that set him trembling even the thought of the overweighted patrolwagon probably sticking in the mud some safe distance in the rear failed to cheer him and the excitement that had so far made him callous to the cold died out and left him weaker and nervous but his horse was chilled with the long standing and now leaped eagerly forward only too willing to warm the halffrozen blood in its veins youre a good beast said gallegher plaintively youve got more nerve than me dont you go back on me now mr dwyer says weve got to beat the town gallegher had no idea what time it was as he rode through the night but he knew he would be able to find out from a big clock over a manufactory at a point nearly threequarters of the distance from kepplers to the goal he was still in the open country and driving recklessly for he knew the best part of his ride must be made outside the city limits he raced between desolatelooking cornfields with bare stalks and patches of muddy earth rising above the thin covering of snow truck farms and brickyards fell behind him on either side it was very lonely work and once or twice the dogs ran yelping to the gates and barked after him part of his way lay parallel with the railroad tracks and he drove for some time beside long lines of freight and coal cars as they stood resting for the night the fantastic queen anne suburban stations were dark and deserted but in one or two of the blocktowers he could see the operators writing at their desks and the sight in some way comforted him once he thought of stopping to get out the blanket in which he had wrapped himself on the first trip but he feared to spare the time and drove on with his teeth chattering and his shoulders shaking with the cold he welcomed the first solitary row of darkened houses with a faint cheer of recognition the scattered lampposts lightened his spirits and even the badly paved streets rang under the beats of his horses feet like music great mills and manufactories with only a nightwatchmans light in the lowest of their many stories began to take the place of the gloomy farmhouses and gaunt trees that had startled him with their grotesque shapes he had been driving nearly an hour he calculated and in that time the rain had changed to a wet snow that fell heavily and clung to whatever it touched he passed block after block of trim workmens houses as still and silent as the sleepers within them and at last he turned the horses head into broad street the citys great thoroughfare that stretches from its one end to the other and cuts it evenly in two he was driving noiselessly over the snow and slush in the street with his thoughts bent only on the clockface he wished so much to see when a hoarse voice challenged him from the sidewalk hey you stop there hold up said the voice gallegher turned his head and though he saw that the voice came from under a policemans helmet his only answer was to hit his horse sharply over the head with his whip and to urge it into a gallop this on his part was followed by a sharp shrill whistle from the policeman another whistle answered it from a streetcorner one block ahead of him whoa said gallegher pulling on the reins theres one too many of them he added in apologetic explanation the horse stopped and stood breathing heavily with great clouds of steam rising from its flanks why in hell didnt you stop when i told you to demanded the voice now close at the cabs side i didnt hear you returned gallegher sweetly but i heard you whistle and i heard your partner whistle and i thought maybe it was me you wanted to speak to so i just stopped you heard me well enough why arent your lights lit demanded the voice should i have em lit asked gallegher bending over and regarding them with sudden interest you know you should and if you dont youve no right to be driving that cab i dont believe youre the regular driver anyway whered you get it it aint my cab of course said gallegher with an easy laugh its luke mcgoverns he left it outside cronins while he went in to get a drink and he took too much and me father told me to drive it round to the stable for him im cronins son mcgovern aint in no condition to drive you can see yourself how hes been misusing the horse he puts it up at bachmans livery stable and i was just going around there now galleghers knowledge of the local celebrities of the district confused the zealous officer of the peace he surveyed the boy with a steady stare that would have distressed a less skilful liar but gallegher only shrugged his shoulders slightly as if from the cold and waited with apparent indifference to what the officer would say next in reality his heart was beating heavily against his side and he felt that if he was kept on a strain much longer he would give way and break down a second snowcovered form emerged suddenly from the shadow of the houses what is it reeder it asked oh nothing much replied the first officer this kid hadnt any lamps lit so i called to him to stop and he didnt do it so i whistled to you its all right though hes just taking it round to bachmans go ahead he added sulkily get up chirped gallegher good night he added over his shoulder gallegher gave a hysterical little gasp of relief as he trotted away from the two policemen and poured bitter maledictions on their heads for two meddling fools as he went they might as well kill a man as scare him to death he said with an attempt to get back to his customary flippancy but the effort was somewhat pitiful and he felt guiltily conscious that a salt warm tear was creeping slowly down his face and that a lump that would not keep down was rising in his throat taint no fair thing for the whole police force to keep worrying at a little boy like me he said in shamefaced apology im not doing nothing wrong and im half froze to death and yet they keep anagging at me it was so cold that when the boy stamped his feet against the footboard to keep them warm sharp pains shot up through his body and when he beat his arms about his shoulders as he had seen real cabmen do the blood in his fingertips tingled so acutely that he cried aloud with the pain he had often been up that late before but he had never felt so sleepy it was as if some one was pressing a sponge heavy with chloroform near his face and he could not fight off the drowsiness that lay hold of him he saw dimly hanging above his head a round disk of light that seemed like a great moon and which he finally guessed to be the clockface for which he had been on the lookout he had passed it before he realized this but the fact stirred him into wakefulness again and when his cabs wheels slipped around the city hall corner he remembered to look up at the other big clockface that keeps awake over the railroad station and measures out the night he gave a gasp of consternation when he saw that it was halfpast two and that there was but ten minutes left to him this and the many electric lights and the sight of the familiar pile of buildings startled him into a semiconsciousness of where he was and how great was the necessity for haste he rose in his seat and called on the horse and urged it into a reckless gallop over the slippery asphalt he considered nothing else but speed and looking neither to the left nor right dashed off down broad street into chestnut where his course lay straight away to the office now only seven blocks distant gallegher never knew how it began but he was suddenly assaulted by shouts on either side his horse was thrown back on its haunches and he found two men in cabmens livery hanging at its head and patting its sides and calling it by name and the other cabmen who have their stand at the corner were swarming about the carriage all of them talking and swearing at once and gesticulating wildly with their whips they said they knew the cab was mcgoverns and they wanted to know where he was and why he wasnt on it they wanted to know where gallegher had stolen it and why he had been such a fool as to drive it into the arms of its owners friends they said that it was about time that a cabdriver could get off his box to take a drink without having his cab run away with and some of them called loudly for a policeman to take the young thief in charge gallagher felt as if he had been suddenly dragged into consciousness out of a bad dream and stood for a second like a halfawakened somnambulist they had stopped the cab under an electric light and its glare shone coldly down upon the trampled snow and the faces of the men around him gallegher bent forward and lashed savagely at the horse with his whip let me go he shouted as he tugged impotently at the reins let me go i tell you i havent stole no cab and youve got no right to stop me i only want to take it to the press office he begged theyll send it back to you all right theyll pay you for the trip im not running away with it the drivers got the collar hes rested and im only agoing to the press office do you hear me he cried his voice rising and breaking in a shriek of passion and disappointment i tell you to let go those reins let me go or ill kill you do you hear me ill kill you and leaning forward the boy struck savagely with his long whip at the faces of the men about the horses head some one in the crowd reached up and caught him by the ankles and with a quick jerk pulled him off the box and threw him on to the street but he was up on his knees in a moment and caught at the mans hand dont let them stop me mister he cried please let me go i didnt steal the cab sir shelp me i didnt im telling you the truth take me to the press office and theyll prove it to you theyll pay you anything you ask em its only such a little ways now and ive come so far sir please dont let them stop me he sobbed clasping the man about the knees for heavens sake mister let me go the managing editor of the press took up the indiarubber speakingtube at his side and answered not yet to an inquiry the night editor had already put to him five times within the last twenty minutes then he snapped the metal top of the tube impatiently and went upstairs as he passed the door of the local room he noticed that the reporters had not gone home but were sitting about on the tables and chairs waiting they looked up inquiringly as he passed and the city editor asked any news yet and the managing editor shook his head the compositors were standing idle in the composingroom and their foreman was talking with the night editor well said that gentleman tentatively well returned the managing editor i dont think we can wait do you its a halfhour after time now said the night editor and well miss the suburban trains if we hold the paper back any longer we cant afford to wait for a purely hypothetical story the chances are all against the fights having taken place or this hades having been arrested but if were beaten on it suggested the chief but i dont think that is possible if there were any story to print dwyer would have had it here before now the managing editor looked steadily down at the floor very well he said slowly we wont wait any longer go ahead he added turning to the foreman with a sigh of reluctance the foreman whirled himself about and began to give his orders but the two editors still looked at each other doubtfully as they stood so there came a sudden shout and the sound of people running to and fro in the reportorial rooms below there was the tramp of many footsteps on the stairs and above the confusion they heard the voice of the city editor telling some one to run to maddens and get some brandy quick no one in the composingroom said anything but those compositors who had started to go home began slipping off their overcoats and every one stood with his eyes fixed on the door it was kicked open from the outside and in the doorway stood a cabdriver and the city editor supporting between them a pitiful little figure of a boy wet and miserable and with the snow melting on his clothes and running in little pools to the floor why its gallegher said the night editor in a tone of the keenest disappointment gallegher shook himself free from his supporters and took an unsteady step forward his fingers fumbling stiffly with the buttons of his waistcoat mr dwyer sir he began faintly with his eyes fixed fearfully on the managing editor he got arrested and i couldnt get here no sooner cause they kept astopping me and they took me cab from under me but he pulled the notebook from his breast and held it out with its covers damp and limp from the rain but we got hade and heres mr dwyers copy and then he asked with a queer note in his voice partly of dread and partly of hope am i in time sir the managing editor took the book and tossed it to the foreman who ripped out its leaves and dealt them out to his men as rapidly as a gambler deals out cards then the managing editor stooped and picked gallegher up in his arms and sitting down began to unlace his wet and muddy shoes gallegher made a faint effort to resist this degradation of the managerial dignity but his protest was a very feeble one and his head fell back heavily oh the managing editors shoulder illustration why its gallegher said the night editor to gallegher the incandescent lights began to whirl about in circles and to burn in different colors the faces of the reporters kneeling before him and chafing his hands and feet grew dim and unfamiliar and the roar and rumble of the great presses in the basement sounded far away like the murmur of the sea and then the place and the circumstances of it came back to him again sharply and with sudden vividness gallegher looked up with a faint smile into the managing editors face you wont turn me off for running away will you he whispered the managing editor did not answer immediately his head was bent and he was thinking for some reason or other of a little boy of his own at home in bed then he said quietly not this time gallegher galleghers head sank back comfortably on the older mans shoulder and he smiled comprehensively at the faces of the young men crowded around him you hadnt ought to he said with a touch of his old impudence cause i beat the town blood will tell david greene was an employee of the burdett automatic punch company the manufacturing plant of the company was at bridgeport but in the new york offices there were working samples of all the punches from the little nickelplated hand punch with which conductors squeezed holes in railroad tickets to the big punch that could bite into an iron plate as easily as into a piece of pie davids duty was to explain these different punches and accordingly when burdett senior or one of the sons turned a customer over to david he spoke of him as a salesman but david called himself a demonstrator for a short time he even succeeded in persuading the other salesmen to speak of themselves as demonstrators but the shipping clerks and bookkeepers laughed them out of it they could not laugh david out of it this was so partly because he had no sense of humor and partly because he had a greatgreatgrandfather among the salesmen on lower broadway to possess a greatgreatgrandfather is unusual even a greatgrandfather is a rarity and either is considered superfluous but to david the possession of a greatgreatgrandfather was a precious and open delight he had possessed him only for a short time undoubtedly he always had existed but it was not until davids sister anne married a doctor in bordentown new jersey and became socially ambitious that david emerged as a son of washington it was sister anne anxious to get in as a daughter and wear a distaff pin in her shirtwaist who discovered the revolutionary ancestor she unearthed him or rather ran him to earth in the graveyard of the presbyterian church at bordentown he was no less a person than general hiram greene and he had fought with washington at trenton and at princeton of this there was no doubt that later on moving to new york his descendants became peaceloving salesmen did not affect his record to enter a society founded on heredity the important thing is first to catch your ancestor and having made sure of him david entered the society of the sons of washington with flying colors he was not unlike the man who had been speaking prose for forty years without knowing it he was not unlike the other man who woke to find himself famous he had gone to bed a timid nearsighted underpaid salesman without a relative in the world except a married sister in bordentown and he awoke to find he was a direct descendant of neck or nothing greene a revolutionary hero a friend of washington a man whose portrait hung in the state house at trenton davids life had lacked color the day he carried his certificate of membership to the big jewelry store uptown and purchased two rosettes one for each of his two coats was the proudest of his life the other men in the broadway office took a different view as wyckoff one of burdetts flying squadron of travelling salesmen said all grandfathers look alike to me whether theyre great or greatgreatgreat each one is as dead as the other id rather have a live cousin who could loan me a five or slip me a drink what did your greatgreat dad ever do for you well for one thing said david stiffly he fought in the war of the revolution he saved us from the shackles of monarchical england he made it possible for me and you to enjoy the liberties of a free republic dont try to tell me your grandfather did all that protested wyckoff because i know better there were a lot of others helped i read about it in a book i am not grudging glory to others returned david i am only saying i am proud that i am a descendant of a revolutionist wyckoff dived into his inner pocket and produced a leather photograph frame that folded like a concertina i dont want to be a descendant he said id rather be an ancestor look at those proudly he exhibited photographs of mrs wyckoff with the baby and of three other little wyckoffs david looked with envy at the children when im married he stammered and at the words he blushed i hope to be an ancestor if youre thinking of getting married said wyckoff youd better hope for a raise in salary the other clerks were as unsympathetic as wyckoff at first when david showed them his parchment certificate and his silver gilt insignia with on one side a portrait of washington and on the other a continental soldier they admitted it was dead swell they even envied him not the grandfather but the fact that owing to that distinguished relative david was constantly receiving beautifully engraved invitations to attend the monthly meetings of the society to subscribe to a fund to erect monuments on battlefields to mark neglected graves to join in joyous excursions to the tomb of washington or of john paul jones to inspect west point annapolis and bunker hill to be among those present at the annual banquet at delmonicos in order that when he opened these letters he might have an audience he had given the society his office address in these communications he was always addressed as dear compatriot and never did the words fail to give him a thrill they seemed to lift him out of burdetts salesrooms and broadway and place him next to things uncommercial untainted high and noble he did not quite know what an aristocrat was but he believed being a compatriot made him an aristocrat when customers were rude when mr john or mr robert was overbearing this idea enabled david to rise above their illtemper and he would smile and say to himself if they knew the meaning of the blue rosette in my buttonhole how differently they would treat me how easily with a word could i crush them but few of the customers recognized the significance of the button they thought it meant that david belonged to the y m c a or was a teetotaler david with his gentle manners and pale ascetic face was liable to give that impression when wyckoff mentioned marriage the reason david blushed was because although no one in the office suspected it he wished to marry the person in whom the office took the greatest pride this was miss emily anthony one of burdett and sons youngest most efficient and prettiest stenographers and although david did not cut as dashing a figure as did some of the firms travelling men miss anthony had found something in him so greatly to admire that she had out of office hours accepted his devotion his theatre tickets and an engagement ring indeed so far had matters progressed that it had been almost decided when in a few months they would go upon their vacations they also would go upon their honeymoon and then a cloud had come between them and from a quarter from which david had expected only sunshine the trouble befell when david discovered he had a greatgreatgrandfather with that fact itself miss anthony was almost as pleased as was david himself but while he was content to bask in anothers glory miss anthony saw in his inheritance only an incentive to achieve glory for himself from a hardworking salesman she had asked but little but from a descendant of a national hero she expected other things she was a determined young person and for david she was an ambitious young person she found she was dissatisfied she found she was disappointed the greatgreatgrandfather had opened up a new horizon had in a way raised the standard she was as fond of david as always but his tales of past wars and battles his accounts of present banquets at which he sat shoulder to shoulder with men of whom even burdett and sons spoke with awe touched her imagination you shouldnt be content to just wear a button she urged if youre a son of washington you ought to act like one i know im not worthy of you david sighed i dont mean that and you know i dont emily replied indignantly it has nothing to do with me i want you to be worthy of yourself of your grandpa hiram but how complained david what chance has a twentyfive dollar a week clerk it was a year before the spanishamerican war while the patriots of cuba were fighting the mother country for their independence if i were a son of the revolution said emily id go to cuba and help free it dont talk nonsense cried david if i did that id lose my job and wed never be able to marry besides whats cuba done for me all i know about cuba is i once smoked a cuban cigar and it made me ill did lafayette talk like that demanded emily did he ask what have the american rebels ever done for me if i were in lafayettes class sighed david i wouldnt be selling automatic punches theres your trouble declared emily you lack selfconfidence youre too humble youve got fighting blood and you ought to keep saying to yourself blood will tell and the first thing you know it will tell you might begin by going into politics in your ward or you could join the militia that takes only one night a week and then if we did go to war with spain youd get a commission and come back a captain emilys eyes were beautiful with delight but the sight gave david no pleasure in genuine distress he shook his head emily he said youre going to be awfully disappointed in me emilys eyes closed as though they shied at some mental picture but when she opened them they were bright and her smile was kind and eager no im not she protested only i want a husband with a career and one wholl tell me to keep quiet when i try to run it for him ive often wished you would said david would what run your career for you no keep quiet only it didnt seem polite to tell you so maybe id like you better said emily if you werent so darned polite a week later early in the spring of the unexpected happened and david was promoted into the flying squadron he now was a travelling salesman with a rise in salary and a commission on orders it was a step forward but as going on the road meant absence from emily david was not elated nor did it satisfy emily it was not money she wanted her ambition for david could not be silenced with a raise in wages she did not say this but david knew that in him she still found something lacking and when they said goodby they both were ill at ease and completely unhappy formerly each day when emily in passing david in the office said goodmorning she used to add the number of the days that still separated them from the vacation which also was to be their honeymoon but for the last month she had stopped counting the days at least she did not count them aloud david did not ask her why this was so he did not dare and sooner than learn the truth that she had decided not to marry him or that she was even considering not marrying him he asked no questions but in ignorance of her present feelings set forth on his travels absence from emily hurt just as much as he had feared it would he missed her needed her longed for her in numerous letters he told her so but owing to the frequency with which he moved her letters never caught up with him it was almost a relief he did not care to think of what they might tell him the route assigned david took him through the south and kept him close to the atlantic seaboard in obtaining orders he was not unsuccessful and at the end of the first month received from the firm a telegram of congratulation this was of importance chiefly because it might please emily but he knew that in her eyes the greatgreatgrandson of hiram greene could not rest content with a telegram from burdett and sons a year before she would have considered it a high honor a cause for celebration now he could see her press her pretty lips together and shake her pretty head it was not enough but how could he accomplish more he began to hate his greatgreatgrandfather he began to wish hiram greene had lived and died a bachelor and then dame fortune took david in hand and toyed with him and spanked him and pelted and petted him until finally she made him her favorite son dame fortune went about this work in an abrupt and arbitrary manner on the night of the st of march two trains were scheduled to leave the union station at jacksonville at exactly the same minute and they left exactly on time as never before in the history of any southern railroad has this miracle occurred it shows that when dame fortune gets on the job she is omnipotent she placed david on the train to miami as the train he wanted drew out for tampa and an hour later when the conductor looked at davids ticket he pulled the bellcord and dumped david over the side into the heart of a pine forest if he walked back along the track for one mile the conductor reassured him he would find a flag station where at midnight he could flag a train going north in an hour it would deliver him safely in jacksonville there was a moon but for the greater part of the time it was hidden by fitful hurrying clouds and as david stumbled forward at one moment he would see the rails like streaks of silver and the next would be encompassed in a complete and bewildering darkness he made his way from tie to tie only by feeling with his foot after an hour he came to a shed whether it was or was not the flag station the conductor had in mind he did not know and he never did know he was too tired too hot and too disgusted to proceed and dropping his suit case he sat down under the open roof of the shed prepared to wait either for the train or daylight so far as he could see on every side of him stretched a swamp silent dismal interminable from its black water rose dead trees naked of bark and hung with streamers of funereal moss there was not a sound or sign of human habitation the silence was the silence of the ocean at night david remembered the berth reserved for him on the train to tampa and of the loathing with which he had considered placing himself between its sheets but now how gladly would he welcome it for in the sleepingcar illsmelling close and stuffy he at least would have been surrounded by fellowsufferers of his own species here his companions were owls watersnakes and sleeping buzzards i am alone he told himself on a railroad embankment entirely surrounded by alligators and then he found he was not alone in the darkness illuminated by a match not a hundred yards from him there flashed suddenly the face of a man then the match went out and the face with it david noted that it had appeared at some height above the level of the swamp at an elevation higher even than that of the embankment it was as though the man had been sitting on the limb of a tree david crossed the tracks and found that on the side of the embankment opposite the shed there was solid ground and what once had been a wharf he advanced over this cautiously and as he did so the clouds disappeared and in the full light of the moon he saw a bayou broadening into a river and made fast to the decayed and rotting wharf an oceangoing tug it was from her deck that the man in lighting his pipe had shown his face at the thought of a warm engineroom and the company of his fellowcreatures davids heart leaped with pleasure he advanced quickly and then something in the appearance of the tug something mysterious secretive threatening caused him to halt no lights showed from her engineroom cabin or pilothouse her decks were empty but as was evidenced by the black smoke that rose from her funnel she was awake and awake to some purpose david stood uncertainly questioning whether to make his presence known or return to the loneliness of the shed the question was decided for him he had not considered that standing in the moonlight he was a conspicuous figure the planks of the wharf creaked and a man came toward him as one who means to attack or who fears attack he approached warily he wore high boots riding breeches and a sombrero he was a little man but his movements were alert and active to david he seemed unnecessarily excited he thrust himself close against david who the devil are you demanded the man from the tug howd you get here i walked said david walked the man snorted incredulously i took the wrong train explained david pleasantly they put me off about a mile below here i walked back to this flag station im going to wait here for the next train north the little man laughed mockingly oh no youre not he said if you walked here you can just walk away again with a sweep of his arm he made a vigorous and peremptory gesture you walk he commanded ill do just as i please about that said david as though to bring assistance the little man started hastily toward the tug ill find some one wholl make you walk he called you wait thats all you wait david decided not to wait it was possible the wharf was private property and he had been trespassing in any case at the flag station the rights of all men were equal and if he were in for a fight he judged it best to choose his own battleground he recrossed the tracks and sat down on his suit case in a dark corner of the shed himself hidden in the shadows he could see in the moonlight the approach of any other person theyre river pirates said david to himself or smugglers theyre certainly up to some mischief or why should they object to the presence of a perfectly harmless stranger partly with cold partly with nervousness david shivered i wish that train would come he sighed and instantly as though in answer to his wish from only a short distance down the track he heard the rumble and creak of approaching cars in a flash david planned his course of action the thought of spending the night in a swamp infested by alligators and smugglers had become intolerable he must escape and he must escape by the train now approaching to that end the train must be stopped his plan was simple the train was moving very very slowly and though he had no lantern to wave in order to bring it to a halt he need only stand on the track exposed to the glare of the headlight and wave his arms david sprang between the rails and gesticulated wildly but in amazement his arms fell to his sides for the train now only a hundred yards distant and creeping toward him at a snails pace carried no headlight and though in the moonlight david was plainly visible it blew no whistle tolled no bell even the passenger coaches in the rear of the sightless engine were wrapped in darkness it was a ghost of a train a flying dutchman of a train a nightmare of a train it was as unreal as the black swamp as the moss on the dead trees as the ghostly tugboat tied to the rotting wharf is the place haunted exclaimed david he was answered by the grinding of brakes and by the train coming to a sharp halt and instantly from every side men fell from it to the ground and the silence of the night was broken by a confusion of calls and eager greeting and questions and sharp words of command so fascinated was david in the stealthy arrival of the train and in her mysterious passengers that until they confronted him he did not note the equally stealthy approach of three men of these one was the little man from the tug with him was a fat redfaced irishamerican he wore no coat and his shirtsleeves were drawn away from his hands by garters of pink elastic his derby hat was balanced behind his ears upon his right hand flashed an enormous diamond he looked as though but at that moment he had stopped sliding glasses across a bowery bar the third man carried the outward marks of a sailor david believed he was the tallest man he had ever beheld but equally remarkable with his height was his beard and hair which were of a fierce brickdust red even in the mild moonlight it flamed like a torch whats your business demanded the man with the flamboyant hair i came here began david to wait for a train the tall man bellowed with indignant rage yes he shouted this is the sort of place any one would pick out to wait for a train in front of davids nose he shook a fist as large as a catchers glove dont you lie to me he bullied do you know who i am do you know who youre up against im the barkeeper person interrupted never mind who you are he said we know that find out who he is david turned appealingly to the barkeeper do you suppose id come here on purpose he protested im a travelling man you wont travel any tonight mocked the redhaired one youve seen what you came to see and all you want now is to get to a western union wire well you dont do it you dont leave here tonight as though he thought he had been neglected the little man in ridingboots pushed forward importantly tie him to a tree he suggested better take him on board said the barkeeper and send him back by the pilot when were once at sea he cant hurt us any illustration in front of davids nose he shook a fist as large as a catchers glove what makes you think i want to hurt you demanded david who do you think i am we know who you are shouted the fieryheaded one youre a blankettyblank spy youre a government spy or a spanish spy and whichever you are you dont get away tonight david had not the faintest idea what the man meant but he knew his selfrespect was being illtreated and his selfrespect rebelled you have made a very serious mistake he said and whether you like it or not i am leaving here tonight and you can go to the devil turning his back david started with great dignity to walk away it was a short walk something hit him below the ear and he found himself curling up comfortably on the ties he had a strong desire to sleep but was conscious that a bed on a railroad track on account of trains wanting to pass was unsafe this doubt did not long disturb him his head rolled against the steel rail his limbs relaxed from a great distance and in a strange singsong he heard the voice of the barkeeper saying nine ten and out when david came to his senses his head was resting on a coil of rope in his ears was the steady throb of an engine and in his eyes the glare of a lantern the lantern was held by a pleasantfaced youth in a golf cap who was smiling sympathetically david rose on his elbow and gazed wildly about him he was in the bow of the oceangoing tug and he saw that from where he lay in the bow to her stern her decks were packed with men she was steaming swiftly down a broad river on either side the gray light that comes before the dawn showed low banks studded with stunted palmettos close ahead david heard the roar of the surf sorry to disturb you said the youth in the golf cap but we drop the pilot in a few minutes and youre going with him david moved his aching head gingerly and was conscious of a bump as large as a tennis ball behind his right ear what happened to me he demanded you were sort of kidnapped i guess laughed the young man it was a raw deal but they couldnt take any chances the pilot will land you at okra point you can hire a rig there to take you to the railroad but why demanded david indignantly why was i kidnapped what had i done who were those men who from the pilothouse there was a sharp jangle of bells to the engineroom and the speed of the tug slackened come on commanded the young man briskly the pilots going ashore heres your grip heres your hat the ladders on the port side look where youre stepping we cant show any lights and its dark as but even as he spoke like a flash of powder as swiftly as one throws an electric switch as blindingly as a train leaps from the tunnel into the glaring sun the darkness vanished and the tug was swept by the fierce blatant radiance of a searchlight it was met by shrieks from two hundred throats by screams oaths prayers by the sharp jangling of bells by the blind rush of many men scurrying like rats for a hole to hide in by the ringing orders of one man above the tumult this one voice rose like the warning strokes of a firegong and looking up to the pilothouse from whence the voice came david saw the barkeeper still in his shirtsleeves and with his derby hat pushed back behind his ears with one hand clutching the telegraph to the engineroom with the other holding the spoke of the wheel david felt the tug like a hunter taking a fence rise in a great leap her bow sank and rose tossing the water from her in black oily waves the smoke poured from her funnel from below her engines sobbed and quivered and like a hound freed from a leash she raced for the open sea but swiftly as she fled as a thief is held in the circle of a policemans bullseye the shaft of light followed and exposed her and held her in its grip the youth in the golf cap was clutching david by the arm with his free hand he pointed down the shaft of light so great was the tumult that to be heard he brought his lips close to davids ear thats the revenue cutter he shouted shes been laying for us for three weeks and now he shrieked exultingly the old mans going to give her a race for it from excitement from cold from alarm davids nerves were getting beyond his control but how he demanded how do i get ashore you dont when he drops the pilot dont i how can he drop the pilot yelled the youth the pilots got to stick by the boat so have you david clutched the young man and swung him so that they stood face to face stick by what boat yelled david who are these men who are you what boat is this in the glare of the searchlight david saw the eyes of the youth staring at him as though he feared he were in the clutch of a madman wrenching himself free the youth pointed at the pilothouse above it on a blue board in letters of goldleaf a foot high was the name of the tug as david read it his breath left him a finger of ice passed slowly down his spine the name he read was the three friends the three friends shrieked david shes a filibuster shes a pirate wherere we going to cuba david emitted a howl of anguish rage and protest what for he shrieked the young man regarded him coldly to pick bananas he said i wont go to cuba shouted david ive got to work im paid to sell machinery i demand to be put ashore ill lose my job if im not put ashore ill sue you ill have the law david found himself suddenly upon his knees his first thought was that the ship had struck a rock and then that she was bumping herself over a succession of coral reefs she dipped dived reared and plunged like a hooked fish she flung herself in the air quivering from bow to stern no longer was david of a mind to sue the filibusters if they did not put him ashore if only they had put him ashore in gratitude he would have crawled on his knees what followed was of no interest to david nor to many of the filibusters nor to any of the cuban patriots their groans of selfpity their prayers and curses in eloquent spanish rose high above the crash of broken crockery and the pounding of the waves even when the searchlight gave way to a brilliant sunlight the circumstance was unobserved by david nor was he concerned in the tidings brought forward by the youth in the golf cap who raced the slippery decks and vaulted the prostrate forms as surefootedly as a hurdler on a cinder track to david in whom he seemed to think he had found a congenial spirit he shouted joyfully shes fired two blanks at us he cried now shes firing cannonballs thank god whispered david perhaps shell sink us but the three friends showed her heels to the revenue cutter and so far as david knew hours passed into days and days into weeks it was like those nightmares in which in a minute one is whirled through centuries of fear and torment sometimes regardless of nausea of his aching head of the hard deck of the waves that splashed and smothered him david fell into broken slumber sometimes he woke to a dull consciousness of his position at such moments he added to his misery by speculating upon the other misfortunes that might have befallen him on shore emily he decided had given him up for lost and married probably a navy officer in command of a battleship burdett and sons had cast him off forever possibly his disappearance had caused them to suspect him even now they might be regarding him as a defaulter as a fugitive from justice his accounts no doubt were being carefully overhauled in actual time two days and two nights had passed to david it seemed many ages on the third day he crawled to the stern where there seemed less motion and finding a boats cushion threw it in the lee scupper and fell upon it from time to time the youth in the golf cap had brought him food and drink and he now appeared from the cooks galley bearing a bowl of smoking soup david considered it a doubtful attention but he said youre very kind how did a fellow like you come to mix up with these pirates the youth laughed goodnaturedly theyre not pirates theyre patriots he said and im not mixed up with them my name is henry carr and im a guest of jimmy doyle the captain the barkeeper with the derby hat said david hes not a barkeeper hes a teetotaler carr corrected and hes the greatest filibuster alive he knows these waters as you know broadway and hes the salt of the earth i did him a favor once sort of mousehelpingthelion idea just through dumb luck i found out about this expedition the government agents in new york found out id found out and sent for me to tell but i didnt and i didnt write the story either doyle heard about that so he asked me to come as his guest and hes promised that after hes landed the expedition and the arms i can write as much about it as i darn please then youre a reporter said david im what we call a cub reporter laughed carr you see ive always dreamed of being a war correspondent the men in the office say i dream too much theyre always guying me about it but havent you noticed its the ones who dream who find their dreams come true now this isnt real war but its a near war and when the real thing breaks loose i can tell the managing editor i served as a war correspondent in the cubanspanish campaign and he may give me a real job and you like this groaned david i wouldnt if i were as sick as you are said carr but ive a stomach like a harlem goat he stooped and lowered his voice now here are two fake filibusters he whispered the men you read about in the newspapers if a mans a real filibuster nobody knows it coming toward them was the tall man who had knocked david out and the little one who had wanted to tie him to a tree all they ask whispered carr is money and advertisement if they knew i was a reporter theyd eat out of my hand the tall man calls himself lighthouse harry he once kept a lighthouse on the florida coast and thats as near to the sea as he ever got the other one is a daredevil calling himself colonel beamish he says hes an english officer and a soldier of fortune and that hes been in eighteen battles jimmy says hes never been near enough to a battle to see the redcross flags on the base hospital but theyve fooled these cubans the junta thinks theyre great fighters and its sent them down here to work the machine guns but im afraid the only fighting they will do will be in the sporting columns and not in the ring a half dozen seasick cubans were carrying a heavy oblong box they dropped it not two yards from where david lay and with a screwdriver lighthouse harry proceeded to open the lid carr explained to david that the three friends was approaching that part of the coast of cuba on which she had arranged to land her expedition and that in case she was surprised by one of the spanish patrol boats she was preparing to defend herself theyve got an automatic gun in that crate said carr and theyre going to assemble it youd better move theyll be tramping all over you david shook his head feebly i cant move he protested i wouldnt move if it would free cuba for several hours with very languid interest david watched lighthouse harry and colonel beamish screw a heavy tripod to the deck and balance above it a quickfiring onepounder they worked very slowly and to david watching them from the lee scupper they appeared extremely unintelligent i dont believe either of those thugs put an automatic gun together in his life he whispered to carr i never did either but ive put hundreds of automatic punches together and i bet that gun wont work whats wrong with it said carr before david could summon sufficient energy to answer the attention of all on board was diverted and by a single word whether the word is whispered apologetically by the smokingroom steward to those deep in bridge or shrieked from the tops of a sinking ship it never quite fails of its effect a sweating stoker from the engineroom saw it first land he hailed the seasick cubans raised themselves and swung their hats their voices rose in a fierce chorus cuba libre they yelled the sun piercing the morning mists had uncovered a coastline broken with bays and inlets above it towered green hills the peak of each topped by a squat blockhouse in the valleys and water courses like columns of marble rose the royal palms you must look carr entreated david its just as it is in the pictures then i dont have to look groaned david the three friends was making for a point of land that curved like a sickle on the inside of the sickle was nipe bay on the opposite shore of that broad harbor at the place of rendezvous a little band of cubans waited to receive the filibusters the goal was in sight the dreadful voyage was done joy and excitement thrilled the ships company cuban patriots appeared in uniforms with cuban flags pinned in the brims of their straw sombreros from the hold came boxes of smallarm ammunition of mausers rifles machetes and saddles to protect the landing a box of shells was placed in readiness beside the onepounder in two hours if we have smooth water shouted lighthouse harry we ought to get all of this on shore and then all i ask he cried mightily is for some one to kindly show me a spaniard his hearts desire was instantly granted he was shown not only one spaniard but several spaniards they were on the deck of one of the fastest gunboats of the spanish navy not a mile from the three friends she sprang from the cover of a narrow inlet she did not signal questions or extend courtesies for her the name of the oceangoing tug was sufficient introduction throwing ahead of her a solid shell she raced in pursuit and as the three friends leaped to full speed there came from the gunboat the sharp dry crackle of mausers with an explosion of terrifying oaths lighthouse harry thrust a shell into the breech of the quickfiring gun without waiting to aim it he tugged at the trigger nothing happened he threw open the breech and gazed impotently at the base of the shell it was untouched the ship was ringing with cries of anger of hate with ratlike squeaks of fear above the heads of the filibusters a shell screamed and within a hundred feet splashed into a wave from his mat in the lee scupper david groaned miserably he was far removed from any of the greater emotions its no use he protested they cant do its not connected whats not connected yelled carr he fell upon david he halflifted halfdragged him to his feet if you know whats wrong with that gun you fix it fix it he shouted or ill david was not concerned with the vengeance carr threatened for on the instant a miracle had taken place with the swift insidiousness of morphine peace ran through his veins soothed his racked body his jangled nerves the three friends had made the harbor and was gliding through water flat as a pond but david did not know why the change had come he knew only that his soul and body were at rest that the sun was shining that he had passed through the valley of the shadow and once more was a sane sound young man with a savage thrust of the shoulder he sent lighthouse harry sprawling from the gun with swift practised fingers he fell upon its mechanism he wrenched it apart he lifted it reset readjusted it ignorant themselves those about him saw that he understood saw that his work was good they raised a joyous defiant cheer but a shower of bullets drove them to cover bullets that ripped the deck splintered the superstructure smashed the glass in the air ports like angry wasps sang in a continuous whining chorus intent only on the gun david worked feverishly he swung to the breech locked it and dragged it open pulled on the trigger and found it gave before his forefinger he shouted with delight ive got it working he yelled he turned to his audience but his audience had fled from beneath one of the lifeboats protruded the ridingboots of colonel beamish the tall form of lighthouse harry was doubled behind a water butt a shell splashed to port a shell splashed to starboard for an instant david stood staring wideeyed at the greyhound of a boat that ate up the distance between them at the jets of smoke and stabs of flame that sprang from her bow at the figures crouched behind her gunwale firing in volleys to david it came suddenly convincingly that in a dream he had lived it all before and something like raw poison stirred in david something leaped to his throat and choked him something rose in his brain and made him see scarlet he felt rather than saw young carr kneeling at the box of ammunition and holding a shell toward him he heard the click as the breech shut felt the rubber tire of the brace give against the weight of his shoulder down a long shining tube saw the pursuing gunboat saw her again and many times disappear behind a flash of flame a bullet gashed his forehead a bullet passed deftly through his forearm but he did not heed them confused with the thrashing of the engines with the roar of the gun he heard a strange voice shrieking unceasingly cuba libre it yelled to hell with spain and he found that the voice was his own the story lost nothing in the way carr wrote it and the best of it is he exclaimed joyfully its true for a spanish gunboat had been crippled and forced to run herself aground by a tugboat manned by cuban patriots and by a single gun served by one man and that man an american it was the first seafight of the war over night a cuban navy had been born and into the limelight a cub reporter had projected a new hero a readymade warrantednottorun popular idol they were seated in the pilothouse jimmy doyle carr and david the patriots and their arms had been safely dumped upon the coast of cuba and the three friends was gliding swiftly and having caught the florida straits napping smoothly toward key west carr had just finished reading aloud his account of the engagement you will tell the story just as i have written it commanded the proud author your being south as a travelling salesman was only a blind you came to volunteer for this expedition before you could explain your wish you were mistaken for a secretservice man and hustled on board that was just where you wanted to be and when the moment arrived you took command of the ship and singlehanded won the naval battle of nipe bay jimmy doyle nodded his head approvingly you certainly did dave protested the great man i seen you when you done it at key west carr filed his story and while the hospital surgeons kept david there over one steamer to dress his wounds his fame and features spread across the map of the united states burdett and sons basked in reflected glory reporters besieged their office at the merchants downtown club the business men of lower broadway tendered congratulations of course its a great surprise to us burdett and sons would protest and wink heavily of course when the boy asked to be sent south wed no idea he was planning to fight for cuba or we wouldnt have let him go would we then again they would wink heavily i suppose you know they would say that hes a direct descendant of general hiram greene who won the battle of trenton what i say is blood will tell and then in a body every one in the club would move against the bar and exclaim heres to cuba libre when the olivette from key west reached tampa bay every cuban in the tampa cigar factories was at the dock there were thousands of them and all of the junta in high hats to read david an address of welcome illustration she dug the shapeless hat into davids shoulder and when they saw him at the top of the gangplank with his head in a bandage and his arm in a sling like a mob of maniacs they howled and surged toward him but before they could reach their hero the courteous junta forced them back and cleared a pathway for a young girl she was travelworn and pale her shirtwaist was disgracefully wrinkled her best hat was a wreck no one on broadway would have recognized her as burdett and sons most immaculate and beautiful stenographer she dug the shapeless hat into davids shoulder and clung to him david she sobbed promise me youll never never do it again the bar sinister preface when this story first appeared the writer received letters of two kinds one asking a question and the other making a statement the question was whether there was any foundation of truth in the story the statement challenged him to say that there was the letters seemed to show that a large proportion of readers prefer their dose of fiction with a sweetening of fact this is written to furnish that condiment and to answer the question and the statement in the dog world the original of the bullterrier in the story is known as edgewood cold steel and to his intimates as kid his father was lord minto a thoroughbred bullterrier well known in canada but the story of kids life is that his mother was a blackandtan named vic she was a lady of doubtful pedigree among her offspring by lord minto so i have been often informed by many canadian dogfanciers breeders and exhibitors was the only white puppy kid in a litter of blackandtans he made his first appearance in the show world in in toronto where under the judging of mr charles h mason he was easily first during that year when he came to our kennels and in the two years following he carried off many blue ribbons and cups at nearly every firstclass show in the country the other dog jimmy jocks who in the book was his friend and mentor was in real life his friend and companion woodcote jumbo or jaggers an aristocratic son of a long line of english champions he has gone to that place where some day all good dogs must go in this autobiography i have tried to describe kid as he really is and this year when he again strives for blue ribbons i trust should the gentle reader see him at any of the benchshows he will give him a friendly pat and make his acquaintance he will find his advances met with a polite and gentle courtesy the author part i the master was walking most unsteady his legs tripping each other after the fifth or sixth round my legs often go the same way but even when the masters legs bend and twist a bit you mustnt think he cant reach you indeed that is the time he kicks most frequent so i kept behind him in the shadow or ran in the middle of the street he stopped at many public houses with swinging doors those doors that are cut so high from the sidewalk that you can look in under them and see if the master is inside at night when i peep beneath them the man at the counter will see me first and say heres the kid jerry come to take you home get a move on you and the master will stumble out and follow me its lucky for us im so white for no matter how dark the night he can always see me ahead just out of reach of his boot at night the master certainly does see most amazing sometimes he sees two or four of me and walks in a circle so that i have to take him by the leg of his trousers and lead him into the right road one night when he was very nastytempered and i was coaxing him along two men passed us and one of them says look at that brute and the other asks which and they both laugh the master he cursed them good and proper but this night whenever we stopped at a public house the masters pals left it and went on with us to the next they spoke quite civil to me and when the master tried a flying kick they gives him a shove do you want us to lose our money says the pals i had had nothing to eat for a day and a night and just before we set out the master gives me a wash under the hydrant whenever i am locked up until all the sloppans in our alley are empty and made to take a bath and the masters pals speak civil and feel my ribs i know something is going to happen and that night when every time they see a policeman under a lamppost they dodged across the street and when at the last one of them picked me up and hid me under his jacket i began to tremble for i knew what it meant it meant that i was to fight again for the master i dont fight because i like fighting i fight because if i didnt the other dog would find my throat and the master would lose his stakes and i would be very sorry for him and ashamed dogs can pass me and i can pass dogs and id never pick a fight with none of them when i see two dogs standing on their hind legs in the streets clawing each others ears and snapping for each others windpipes or howling and swearing and rolling in the mud i feel sorry they should act so and pretend not to notice if hed let me id like to pass the time of day with every dog i meet but theres something about me that no nice dog can abide when i trot up to nice dogs nodding and grinning to make friends they always tell me to be off go to the devil they bark at me get out and when i walk away they shout mongrel and gutterdog and sometimes after my back is turned they rush me i could kill most of them with three shakes breaking the backbone of the little ones and squeezing the throat of the big ones but whats the good they are nice dogs thats why i try to make up to them and though its not for them to say it i am a streetdog and if i try to push into the company of my betters i suppose its their right to teach me my place of course they dont know im the best fighting bullterrier of my weight in montreal thats why it wouldnt be fair for me to take notice of what they shout they dont know that if i once locked my jaws on them id carry away whatever i touched the night i fought kelleys white rat i wouldnt loosen up until the master made a noose in my leash and strangled me and as for that ottawa dog if the handlers hadnt thrown red pepper down my nose i never would have let go of him i dont think the handlers treated me quite right that time but maybe they didnt know the ottawa dog was dead i did i learned my fighting from my mother when i was very young we slept in a lumberyard on the riverfront and by day hunted for food along the wharves when we got it the other trampdogs would try to take it off us and then it was wonderful to see mother fly at them and drive them away all i know of fighting i learned from mother watching her picking the ashheaps for me when i was too little to fight for myself no one ever was so good to me as mother when it snowed and the ice was in the st lawrence she used to hunt alone and bring me back new bones and shed sit and laugh to see me trying to swallow em whole i was just a puppy then my teeth was falling out when i was able to fight we kept the whole riverrange to ourselves i had the genuine long punishing jaw so mother said and there wasnt a man or a dog that dared worry us those were happy days those were and we lived well share and share alike and when we wanted a bit of fun we chased the fat old wharfrats my how they would squeal then the trouble came it was no trouble to me i was too young to care then but mother took it so to heart that she grew ailing and wouldnt go abroad with me by day it was the same old scandal that theyre always bringing up against me i was so young then that i didnt know i couldnt see any difference between mother and other mothers but one day a pack of curs we drove off snarled back some new names at her and mother dropped her head and ran just as though they had whipped us after that she wouldnt go out with me except in the dark and one day she went away and never came back and though i hunted for her in every court and alley and back street of montreal i never found her one night a month after mother ran away i asked guardian the old blind mastiff whose master is the night watchman on our slip what it all meant and he told me every dog in montreal knows he says except you and every master knows so i think its time you knew then he tells me that my father who had treated mother so bad was a great and noble gentleman from london your father had twentytwo registered ancestors had your father old guardian says and in him was the best bullterrier blood of england the most ancientest the most royal the winning blueribbon blood that breeds champions he had sleepy pink eyes and thin pink lips and he was as white all over as his own white teeth and under his white skin you could see his muscles hard and smooth like the links of a steel chain when your father stood still and tipped his nose in the air it was just as though he was saying oh yes you common dogs and men you may well stare it must be a rare treat for you colonials to see real english royalty he certainly was pleased with hisself was your father he looked just as proud and haughty as one of them stone dogs in victoria park them as is cut out of white marble and youre like him says the old mastiff by that of course meaning youre white same as him thats the only likeness but you see the trouble is kid well you see kid the trouble is your mother that will do i said for then i understood without his telling me and i got up and walked away holding my head and tail high in the air but i was oh so miserable and i wanted to see mother that very minute and tell her that i didnt care mother is what i am a streetdog theres no royal blood in mothers veins nor is she like that father of mine nor and thats the worst shes not even like me for while i when im washed for a fight am as white as clean snow she and this is our trouble she my mother is a blackandtan when mother hid herself from me i was twelve months old and able to take care of myself and as after mother left me the wharves were never the same i moved uptown and met the master before he came lots of other menfolks had tried to make up to me and to whistle me home but they either tried patting me or coaxing me with a piece of meat so i didnt take to em but one day the master pulled me out of a streetfight by the hind legs and kicked me good you want to fight do you says he ill give you all the fighting you want he says and he kicks me again so i knew he was my master and i followed him home since that day ive pulled off many fights for him and theyve brought dogs from all over the province to have a go at me but up to that night none under thirty pounds had ever downed me but that night so soon as they carried me into the ring i saw the dog was overweight and that i was no match for him it was asking too much of a puppy the master should have known i couldnt do it not that i mean to blame the master for when sober which he sometimes was though not as you might say his habit he was most kind to me and let me out to find food if i could get it and only kicked me when i didnt pick him up at night and lead him home but kicks will stiffen the muscles and starving a dog so as to get him uglytempered for a fight may make him nasty but its weakening to his insides and it causes the legs to wobble the ring was in a hall back of a public house there was a redhot whitewashed stove in one corner and the ring in the other i lay in the masters lap wrapped in my blanket and spite of the stove shivering awful but i always shiver before a fight i cant help gettin excited while the menfolks were aflashing their money and taking their last drink at the bar a little irish groom in gaiters came up to me and give me the back of his hand to smell and scratched me behind the ears you poor little pup says he you havent no show he says that brute in the taproom hell eat your heart out thats what you think says the master snarling ill lay you a quid the kid chews him up the groom he shook his head but kept looking at me so sorrylike that i begun to get a bit sad myself he seemed like he couldnt bear to leave off apatting of me and he says speaking low just like he would to a manfolk well good luck to you little pup which i thought so civil of him that i reached up and licked his hand i dont do that to many men and the master he knew i didnt and took on dreadful what ave you got on the back of your hand says he jumping up soap says the groom quick as a rat thats more than youve got on yours do you want to smell of it and he sticks his fist under the masters nose but the pals pushed in between em he tried to poison the kid shouts the master oh one fight at a time says the referee get into the ring jerry were waiting so we went into the ring i never could just remember what did happen in that ring he give me no time to spring he fell on me like a horse i couldnt keep my feet against him and though as i saw he could get his hold when he liked he wanted to chew me over a bit first i was wondering if theyd be able to pry him off me when in the third round he took his hold and i begun to drown just as i did when i fell into the river off the red c slip he closed deeper and deeper on my throat and everything went black and red and bursting and then when i were sure i were dead the handlers pulled him off and the master give me a kick that brought me to but i couldnt move none or even wink both eyes being shut with lumps hes a cur yells the master a sneaking cowardly cur he lost the fight for me says he because hes a cowardly cur and he kicks me again in the lower ribs so that i go sliding across the sawdust theres gratitude fer yer yells the master ive fed that dog and nussed that dog and housed him like a prince and now he puts his tail between his legs and sells me out he does hes a coward ive done with him i am id sell him for a pipeful of tobacco he picked me up by the tail and swung me for the menfolks to see does any gentleman here want to buy a dog he says to make into sausagemeat he says thats all hes good for then i heard the little irish groom say ill give you ten bob for the dog and another voice says ah dont you do it the dogs same as dead mebbe he is dead ten shillings says the master and his voice sobers a bit make it two pounds and hes yours but the pals rushed in again dont you be a fool jerry they say youll be sorry for this when youre sober the kids worth a fiver one of my eyes was not so swelled up as the other and as i hung by my tail i opened it and saw one of the pals take the groom by the shoulder you ought to give im five pounds for that dog mate he says thats no ordinary dog that dogs got good blood in him that dog has why his father that very dogs father i thought he never would go on he waited like he wanted to be sure the groom was listening illustration hes a coward ive done with him that very dogs father says the pal is regent royal son of champion regent monarch champion bullterrier of england for four years i was sore and torn and chewed most awful but what the pal said sounded so fine that i wanted to wag my tail only couldnt owing to my hanging from it but the master calls out yes his father was regent royal whos saying he wasnt but the pups a cowardly cur thats what his pup is and why ill tell you why because his mother was a blackandtan streetdog thats why i dont see how i got the strength but someway i threw myself out of the masters grip and fell at his feet and turned over and fastened all my teeth in his ankle just across the bone when i woke after the pals had kicked me off him i was in the smokingcar of a railroadtrain lying in the lap of the little groom and he was rubbing my open wounds with a greasy yellow stuff exquisite to the smell and most agreeable to lick off part ii well whats your name nolan well nolan these references are satisfactory said the young gentleman my new master called mr wyndham sir ill take you on as second man you can begin today my new master shuffled his feet and put his finger to his forehead thank you sir says he then he choked like he had swallowed a fishbone i have a little dawg sir says he you cant keep him says mr wyndham sir very short es only a puppy sir says my new master e wouldnt go outside the stables sir its not that says mr wyndham sir i have a large kennel of very fine dogs theyre the best of their breed in america i dont allow strange dogs on the premises the master shakes his head and motions me with his cap and i crept out from behind the door im sorry sir says the master then i cant take the place i cant get along without the dawg sir mr wyndham sir looked at me that fierce that i guessed he was going to whip me so i turned over on my back and begged with my legs and tail why you beat him says mr wyndham sir very stern no fear the master says getting very red the party i bought him off taught him that he never learnt that from me he picked me up in his arms and to show mr wyndham sir how well i loved the master i bit his chin and hands mr wyndham sir turned over the letters the master had given him well these references certainly are very strong he says i guess ill let the dog stay only see you keep him away from the kennels or youll both go thank you sir says the master grinning like a cat when shes safe behind the area railing hes not a bad bullterrier says mr wyndham sir feeling my head not that i know much about the smoothcoated breeds my dogs are st bernards he stopped patting me and held up my nose whats the matter with his ears he says theyre chewed to pieces is this a fighting dog he asks quick and roughlike i could have laughed if he hadnt been holding my nose i certainly would have had a good grin at him me the best under thirty pounds in the province of quebec and him asking if i was a fighting dog i ran to the master and hung down my head modestlike waiting for him to tell my list of battles but the master he coughs in his cap most painful fightin dawg sir he cries lor bless you sir the kid dont know the word es just a puppy sir same as you see a pet dog so to speak es a regular old ladys lapdog the kid is well you keep him away from my st bernards says mr wyndham sir or they might make a mouthful of him yes sir that they might says the master but when we gets outside he slaps his knee and laughs inside hisself and winks at me most sociable the masters new home was in the country in a province they called long island there was a high stone wall about his home with big iron gates to it same as godfreys brewery and there was a house with five red roofs and the stables where i lived was cleaner than the aлrated bakeryshop and then there was the kennels but they was like nothing else in this world that ever i see for the first days i couldnt sleep of nights for fear some one would catch me lying in such a cleanedup place and would chase me out of it and when i did fall to sleep id dream i was back in the old masters attic shivering under the rusty stove which never had no coals in it with the master flat on his back on the cold floor with his clothes on and id wake up scared and whimpering and find myself on the new masters cot with his hand on the quilt beside me and id see the glow of the big stove and hear the highquality horses belowstairs stamping in their strawlined boxes and id snoop the sweet smell of hay and harnesssoap and go to sleep again the stables was my jail so the master said but i dont ask no better home than that jail now kid says he sitting on the top of a bucket upside down youve got to understand this when i whistle it means youre not to go out of this ere yard these stables is your jail if you leave em ill have to leave em too and over the seas in the county mayo an old mother will ave to leave her bit of a cottage for two pounds i must be sending her every month or shell have naught to eat nor no thatch over er head i cant lose my place kid so see you dont lose it for me you must keep away from the kennels says he theyre not for the likes of you the kennels are for the quality i wouldnt take a litter of them woolly dogs for one wag of your tail kid but for all that they are your betters same as the gentry up in the big house are my betters i know my place and keep away from the gentry and you keep away from the champions so i never goes out of the stables all day i just lay in the sun on the stone flags licking my jaws and watching the grooms wash down the carriages and the only care i had was to see they didnt get gay and turn the hose on me there wasnt even a single rat to plague me such stables i never did see nolan says the head groom some day that dog of yours will give you the slip you cant keep a streetdog tied up all his life its against his natur the head groom is a nice old gentleman but he doesnt know everything just as though id been a streetdog because i liked it as if id rather poke for my vittles in ashheaps than have em handed me in a washbasin and would sooner bite and fight than be polite and sociable if id had mother there i couldnt have asked for nothing more but id think of her snooping in the gutters or freezing of nights under the bridges or whats worst of all running through the hot streets with her tongue down so wild and crazy for a drink that the people would shout mad dog at her and stone her waters so good that i dont blame the menfolks for locking it up inside their houses but when the hot days come i think they might remember that those are the dogdays and leave a little water outside in a trough like they do for the horses then we wouldnt go mad and the policemen wouldnt shoot us i had so much of everything i wanted that it made me think a lot of the days when i hadnt nothing and if i could have given what i had to mother as she used to share with me id have been the happiest dog in the land not that i wasnt happy then and most grateful to the master too and if id only minded him the trouble wouldnt have come again but one day the coachman says that the little lady they called miss dorothy had come back from school and that same morning she runs over to the stables to pat her ponies and she sees me oh what a nice little white little dog said she whose little dog are you says she thats my dog miss says the master is name is kid and i ran up to her most polite and licks her fingers for i never see so pretty and kind a lady you must come with me and call on my new puppies says she picking me up in her arms and starting off with me oh but please miss cries nolan mr wyndham give orders that the kids not to go to the kennels thatll be all right says the little lady theyre my kennels too and the puppies will like to play with him you wouldnt believe me if i was to tell you of the style of them qualitydogs if i hadnt seen it myself i wouldnt have believed it neither the viceroy of canada dont live no better there was forty of them but each one had his own house and a yard most exclusive and a cot and a drinkingbasin all to hisself they had servants standing round waiting to feed em when they was hungry and valets to wash em and they had their hair combed and brushed like the grooms must when they go out on the box even the puppies had overcoats with their names on em in blue letters and the name of each of those they called champions was painted up fine over his front door just like it was a public house or a veterinarys they were the biggest st bernards i ever did see i could have walked under them if theyd have let me but they were very proud and haughty dogs and looked only once at me and then sniffed in the air the little ladys own dog was an old gentleman bulldog hed come along with us and when he notices how taken aback i was with all i see e turned quite kind and affable and showed me about jimmy jocks miss dorothy called him but owing to his weight he walked most dignified and slow waddling like a duck as you might say and looked much too proud and handsome for such a silly name thats the runway and thats the trophyhouse says he to me and that over there is the hospital where you have to go if you get distemper and the vet gives you beastly medicine and which of these is your ouse sir asks i wishing to be respectful but he looked that hurt and haughty i dont live in the kennels says he most contemptuous i am a housedog i sleep in miss dorothys room and at lunch im let in with the family if the visitors dont mind they most always do but theyre too polite to say so besides says he smiling most condescending visitors are always afraid of me its because im so ugly says he i suppose says he screwing up his wrinkles and speaking very slow and impressive i suppose im the ugliest bulldog in america and as he seemed to be so pleased to think hisself so i said yes sir you certainly are the ugliest ever i see at which he nodded his head most approving but i couldnt hurt em as you say he goes on though i hadnt said nothing like that being too polite im too old he says i havent any teeth the last time one of those grizzly bears said he glaring at the big st bernards took a hold of me he nearly was my death says he i thought his eyes would pop out of his head he seemed so wrought up about it he rolled me around in the dirt he did says jimmy jocks an i couldnt get up it was low says jimmy jocks making a face like he had a bad taste in his mouth low thats what i call it bad form you understand young man not done in my set and and low he growled way down in his stomach and puffed hisself out panting and blowing like he had been on a run im not a street fighter he says scowling at a st bernard marked champion and when my rheumatism is not troubling me he says i endeavor to be civil to all dogs so long as they are gentlemen yes sir said i for even to me he had been most affable at this we had come to a little house off by itself and jimmy jocks invites me in this is their trophyroom he says where they keep their prizes mine he says rather grandlike are on the sideboard not knowing what a sideboard might be i said indeed sir that must be very gratifying but he only wrinkled up his chops as much as to say it is my right the trophyroom was as wonderful as any public house i ever see on the walls was pictures of nothing but beautiful st bernard dogs and rows and rows of blue and red and yellow ribbons and when i asked jimmy jocks why they was so many more of blue than of the others he laughs and says because these kennels always win and there was many shining cups on the shelves which jimmy jocks told me were prizes won by the champions now sir might i ask you sir says i wot is a champion at that he panted and breathed so hard i thought he would bust hisself my dear young friend says he wherever have you been educated a champion is a a champion he says he must win nine blue ribbons in the open class you follow me that is against all comers then he has the title before his name and they put his photograph in the sporting papers you know of course that i am a champion says he i am champion woodstock wizard iii and the two other woodstock wizards my father and uncle were both champions but i thought your name was jimmy jocks i said he laughs right out at that thats my kennel name not my registered name he says why certainly you know that every dog has two names now for instance whats your registered name and number says he ive got only one name i says just kid woodstock wizard puffs at that and wrinkles up his forehead and pops out his eyes who are your people says he where is your home at the stable sir i said my master is the second groom at that woodstock wizard iii looks at me for quite a bit without winking and stares all around the room over my head oh well says he at last youre a very civil young dog says he and i blame no one for what he cant help which i thought most fair and liberal and i have known many bullterriers that were champions says he though as a rule they mostly run with fireengines and to fighting for me i wouldnt care to run through the streets after a hosecart nor to fight says he but each to his taste i could not help thinking that if woodstock wizard iii tried to follow a fireengine he would die of apoplexy and seeing hed lost his teeth it was lucky he had no taste for fighting but after his being so condescending i didnt say nothing anyway says he every smoothcoated dog is better than any hairy old camel like those st bernards and if ever youre hungry down at the stables young man come up to the house and ill give you a bone i cant eat them myself but i bury them around the garden from force of habit and in case a friend should drop in ah i see my mistress coming he says and i bid you good day i regret he says that our different social position prevents our meeting frequent for youre a worthy young dog with a proper respect for your betters and in this country theres precious few of them have that then he waddles off leaving me alone and very sad for he was the first dog in many days that had spoke to me but since he showed seeing that i was a stabledog he didnt want my company i waited for him to get well away it was not a cheerful place to wait the trophyhouse the pictures of the champions seemed to scowl at me and ask what right such as i had even to admire them and the blue and gold ribbons and the silver cups made me very miserable i had never won no blue ribbons or silver cups only stakes for the old master to spend in the publics and i hadnt won them for being a beautiful highquality dog but just for fighting which of course as woodstock wizard iii says is low so i started for the stables with my head down and my tail between my legs feeling sorry i had ever left the master but i had more reason to be sorry before i got back to him the trophyhouse was quite a bit from the kennels and as i left it i see miss dorothy and woodstock wizard iii walking back toward them and also that a big st bernard his name was champion red elfberg had broke his chain and was running their way when he reaches old jimmy jocks he lets out a roar like a grainsteamer in a fog and he makes three leaps for him old jimmy jocks was about a fourth his size but he plants his feet and curves his back and his hair goes up around his neck like a collar but he never had no show at no time for the grizzly bear as jimmy jocks had called him lights on old jimmys back and tries to break it and old jimmy jocks snaps his gums and claws the grass panting and groaning awful but he cant do nothing and the grizzly bear just rolls him under him biting and tearing cruel the odds was all that woodstock wizard iii was going to be killed i had fought enough to see that but not knowing the rules of the game among champions i didnt like to interfere between two gentlemen who might be settling a private affair and as it were take it as presuming of me so i stood by though i was shaking terrible and holding myself in like i was on a leash but at that woodstock wizard iii who was underneath sees me through the dust and calls very faint help you he says take him in the hind leg he says hes murdering me he says and then the little miss dorothy who was crying and calling to the kennelmen catches at the red elfbergs hind legs to pull him off and the brute keeping his front pats well in jimmys stomach turns his big head and snaps at her so that was all i asked for thank you i went up under him it was really nothing he stood so high that i had only to take off about three feet from him and come in from the side and my long punishing jaw as mother was always talking about locked on his woolly throat and my back teeth met i couldnt shake him but i shook myself and every time i shook myself there was thirty pounds of weight tore at his windpipes i couldnt see nothing for his long hair but i heard jimmy jocks puffing and blowing on one side and munching the brutes leg with his old gums jimmy was an old sport that day was jimmy or woodstock wizard iii as i should say when the red elfberg was out and down i had to run or those kennelmen would have had my life they chased me right into the stables and from under the hay i watched the head groom take down a carriagewhip and order them to the right about luckily master and the young grooms were out or that day thered have been fighting for everybody well it nearly did for me and the master mr wyndham sir comes raging to the stables id half killed his best prizewinner he says and had oughter be shot and he gives the master his notice but miss dorothy she follows him and says it was his red elfberg what began the fight and that id saved jimmys life and that old jimmy jocks was worth more to her than all the st bernards in the swiss mountains wherever they may be and that i was her champion anyway then she cried over me most beautiful and over jimmy jocks too who was that tied up in bandages he couldnt even waddle so when he heard that side of it mr wyndham sir told us that if nolan put me on a chain we could stay so it came out all right for everybody but me i was glad the master kept his place but id never worn a chain before and it disheartened me but that was the least of it for the qualitydogs couldnt forgive my whipping their champion and they came to the fence between the kennels and the stables and laughed through the bars barking most cruel words at me i couldnt understand how they found it out but they knew after the fight jimmy jocks was most condescending to me and he said the grooms had boasted to the kennelmen that i was a son of regent royal and that when the kennelmen asked who was my mother they had had to tell them that too perhaps that was the way of it but however the scandal got out and every one of the qualitydogs knew that i was a streetdog and the son of a blackandtan these misalliances will occur said jimmy jocks in his oldfashioned way but no wellbred dog says he looking most scornful at the st bernards who were howling behind the palings would refer to your misfortune before you certainly not cast it in your face i myself remember your fathers father when he made his dйbut at the crystal palace he took four blue ribbons and three specials but no sooner than jimmy would leave me the st bernards would take to howling again insulting mother and insulting me and when i tore at my chain they seeing they were safe would howl the more it was never the same after that the laughs and the jeers cut into my heart and the chain bore heavy on my spirit i was so sad that sometimes i wished i was back in the gutter again where no one was better than me and some nights i wished i was dead if it hadnt been for the master being so kind and that it would have looked like i was blaming mother i would have twisted my leash and hanged myself about a month after my fight the word was passed through the kennels that the new york show was coming and such goings on as followed i never did see if each of them had been matched to fight for a thousand pounds and the gate they couldnt have trained more conscientious but perhaps thats just my envy the kennelmen rubbed em and scrubbed em and trims their hair and curls and combs it and some dogs they fatted and some they starved no one talked of nothing but the show and the chances our kennels had against the other kennels and if this one of our champions would win over that one and whether them as hoped to be champions had better show in the open or the limit class and whether this dog would beat his own dad or whether his little puppy sister couldnt beat the two of em even the grooms had their money up and day or night you heard nothing but praises of our dogs until i being so far out of it couldnt have felt meaner if i had been running the streets with a can to my tail i knew shows were not for such as me and so all day i lay stretched at the end of my chain pretending i was asleep and only too glad that they had something so important to think of that they could leave me alone but one day before the show opened miss dorothy came to the stables with mr wyndham sir and seeing me chained up and so miserable she takes me in her arms you poor little tyke says she its cruel to tie him up so hes eating his heart out nolan she says i dont know nothing about bullterriers says she but i think kids got good points says she and you ought to show him jimmy jocks has three legs on the rensselaer cup now and im going to show him this time so that he can get the fourth and if you wish ill enter your dog too how would you like that kid says she how would you like to see the most beautiful dogs in the world maybe youd meet a pal or two says she it would cheer you up wouldnt it kid says she but i was so upset i could only wag my tail most violent he says it would says she though being that excited i hadnt said nothing so mr wyndham sir laughs and takes out a piece of blue paper and sits down at the head grooms table whats the name of the father of your dog nolan says he and nolan says the man i got him off told me he was a son of champion regent royal sir but it dont seem likely does it says nolan it does not says mr wyndham sir shortlike arent you sure nolan says miss dorothy no miss says the master sire unknown says mr wyndham sir and writes it down date of birth asks mr wyndham sir i i unknown sir says nolan and mr wyndham sir writes it down breeder says mr wyndham sir unknown says nolan getting very red around the jaws and i drops my head and tail and mr wyndham sir writes that down mothers name says mr wyndham sir she was a unknown says the master and i licks his hand dam unknown says mr wyndham sir and writes it down then he takes the paper and reads out loud sire unknown dam unknown breeder unknown date of birth unknown youd better call him the great unknown says he whos paying his entrance fee i am says miss dorothy two weeks after we all got on a train for new york jimmy jocks and me following nolan in the smokingcar and twentytwo of the st bernards in boxes and crates and on chains and leashes such a barking and howling i never did hear and when they sees me going too they laughs fit to kill wot is this a circus says the railroad man but i had no heart in it i hated to go i knew i was no show dog even though miss dorothy and the master did their best to keep me from shaming them for before we set out miss dorothy brings a man from town who scrubbed and rubbed me and sandpapered my tail which hurt most awful and shaved my ears with the masters razor so you could most see clear through em and sprinkles me over with pipeclay till i shines like a tommys crossbelts upon my word says jimmy jocks when he first sees me wot a swell you are youre the image of your granddad when he made his dйbut at the crystal palace he took four firsts and three specials but i knew he was only trying to throw heart into me they might scrub and they might rub and they might pipeclay but they couldnt pipeclay the insides of me and they was blackandtan then we came to a garden which it was not but the biggest hall in the world inside there was lines of benches a few miles long and on them sat every dog in america if all the dog snatchers in montreal had worked night and day for a year they couldnt have caught so many dogs and they was all shouting and barking and howling so vicious that my heart stopped beating for at first i thought they was all enraged at my presuming to intrude but after i got in my place they kept at it just the same barking at every dog as he come in daring him to fight and ordering him out and asking him what breed of dog he thought he was anyway jimmy jocks was chained just behind me and he said he never see so fine a show thats a hot class youre in my lad he says looking over into my street where there were thirty bull terriers they was all as white as cream and each so beautiful that if i could have broke my chain i would have run all the way home and hid myself under the horse trough all night long they talked and sang and passed greetings with old pals and the homesick puppies howled dismal them that couldnt sleep wouldnt let no others sleep and all the electric lights burned in the roof and in my eyes i could hear jimmy jocks snoring peaceful but i could only doze by jerks and when i dozed i dreamed horrible all the dogs in the hall seemed coming at me for daring to intrude with their jaws red and open and their eyes blazing like the lights in the roof youre a street dog get out you street dog they yells and as they drives me out the pipe clay drops off me and they laugh and shriek and when i looks down i see that i have turned into a blackandtan they was most awful dreams and next morning when miss dorothy comes and gives me water in a pan i begs and begs her to take me home but she cant understand how well kid is she says and when i jumps into the masters arms and pulls to break my chain he says if he knew all as he had against him miss he wouldnt be so gay and from a book they reads out the names of the beautiful highbred terriers which i have got to meet and i cant make em understand that i only want to run away and hide myself where no one will see me then suddenly men comes hurrying down our street and begins to brush the beautiful bullterriers and the master rubs me with a towel so excited that his hands trembles awful and miss dorothy tweaks my ears between her gloves so that the blood runs to em and they turn pink and stand up straight and sharp now then nolan says she her voice shaking just like his fingers keep his head up and never let the judge lose sight of him when i hears that my legs breaks under me for i knows all about judges twice the old master goes up before the judge for fighting me with other dogs and the judge promises him if he ever does it again hell chain him up in jail i knew hed find me out a judge cant be fooled by no pipeclay he can see right through you and he reads your insides the judgingring which is where the judge holds out was so like a fightingpit that when i come in it and find six other dogs there i springs into position so that when they lets us go i can defend myself but the master smooths down my hair and whispers hold ard kid hold ard this aint a fight says he look your prettiest he whispers please kid look your prettiest and he pulls my leash so tight that i cant touch my pats to the sawdust and my nose goes up in the air there was millions of people awatching us from the railings and three of our kennelmen too making fun of the master and me and miss dorothy with her chin just reaching to the rail and her eyes so big that i thought she was agoing to cry it was awful to think that when the judge stood up and exposed me all those people and miss dorothy would be there to see me driven from the show the judge he was a fiercelooking man with specs on his nose and a red beard when i first come in he didnt see me owing to my being too quick for him and dodging behind the master but when the master drags me round and i pulls at the sawdust to keep back the judge looks at us carelesslike and then stops and glares through his specs and i knew it was all up with me are there any more asks the judge to the gentleman at the gate but never taking his specs from me the man at the gate looks in his book seven in the novice class says he theyre all here you can go ahead and he shuts the gate the judge he doesnt hesitate a moment he just waves his hand toward the corner of the ring take him away he says to the master over there and keep him away and he turns and looks most solemn at the six beautiful bullterriers i dont know how i crawled to that corner i wanted to scratch under the sawdust and dig myself a grave the kennelmen they slapped the rail with their hands and laughed at the master like they would fall over they pointed at me in the corner and their sides just shaked but little miss dorothy she presses her lips tight against the rail and i see tears rolling from her eyes the master he hangs his head like he had been whipped i felt most sorry for him than all he was so red and he was letting on not to see the kennelmen and blinking his eyes if the judge had ordered me right out it wouldnt have disgraced us so but it was keeping me there while he was judging the highbred dogs that hurt so hard with all those people staring too and his doing it so quick without no doubt nor questions you cant fool the judges they see inside you but he couldnt make up his mind about them highbred dogs he scowls at em and he glares at em first with his head on the one side and then on the other and he feels of em and orders em to run about and nolan leans against the rails with his head hung down and pats me and miss dorothy comes over beside him but dont say nothing only wipes her eye with her finger a man on the other side of the rail he says to the master the judge dont like your dog no says the master have you ever shown him before says the man no says the master and ill never show him again hes my dog says the master and he suits me and i dont care what no judges think and when he says them kind words i licks his hand most grateful the judge had two of the six dogs on a little platform in the middle of the ring and he had chased the four other dogs into the corners where they was licking their chops and letting on they didnt care same as nolan was the two dogs on the platform was so beautiful that the judge hisself couldnt tell which was the best of em even when he stoops down and holds their heads together but at last he gives a sigh and brushes the sawdust off his knees and goes to the table in the ring where there was a man keeping score and heaps and heaps of blue and gold and red and yellow ribbons and the judge picks up a bunch of em and walks to the two gentlemen who was holding the beautiful dogs and he says to each whats his number and he hands each gentleman a ribbon and then he turned sharp and comes straight at the master whats his number says the judge and master was so scared that he couldnt make no answer but miss dorothy claps her hands and cries out like she was laughing three twentysix and the judge writes it down and shoves master the blue ribbon i bit the master and i jumps and bit miss dorothy and i waggled so hard that the master couldnt hold me when i get to the gate miss dorothy snatches me up and kisses me between the ears right before millions of people and they both hold me so tight that i didnt know which of them was carrying of me but one thing i knew for i listened hard as it was the judge hisself as said it did you see that puppy i gave first to says the judge to the gentleman at the gate i did he was a bit out of his class says the gate gentleman he certainly was says the judge and they both laughed but i didnt care they couldnt hurt me then not with nolan holding the blue ribbon and miss dorothy hugging my ears and the kennelmen sneaking away each looking like hed been caught with his nose under the lid of the slopcan we sat down together and we all three just talked as fast as we could they was so pleased that i couldnt help feeling proud myself and i barked and leaped about so gay that all the bullterriers in our street stretched on their chains and howled at me just look at him says one of those i had beat whats he giving hisself airs about because hes got one blue ribbon says another of em why when i was a puppy i used to eat em and if that judge could ever learn to know a toy from a mastiff id have had this one but jimmy jocks he leaned over from his bench and says well done kid didnt i tell you so what he ad told me was that i might get a commended but i didnt remind him didnt i tell you says jimmy jocks that i saw your grandfather make his dйbut at the crystal yes sir you did sir says i for i have no love for the men of my family a gentleman with a showingleash around his neck comes up just then and looks at me very critical nice dog youve got miss wyndham says he would you care to sell him hes not my dog says miss dorothy holding me tight i wish he were hes not for sale sir says the master and i was that glad oh hes yours is he says the gentleman looking hard at nolan well ill give you a hundred dollars for him says he carelesslike thank you sir hes not for sale says nolan but his eyes get very big the gentleman he walked away but i watches him and he talks to a man in a golfcap and by and by the man comes along our street looking at all the dogs and stops in front of me this your dog says he to nolan pity hes so leggy says he if he had a good tail and a longer stop and his ears were set higher hed be a good dog as he is ill give you fifty dollars for him but before the master could speak miss dorothy laughs and says youre mr polks kennelman i believe well you tell mr polk from me that the dogs not for sale now any more than he was five minutes ago and that when he is hell have to bid against me for him the man looks foolish at that but he turns to nolan quicklike ill give you three hundred for him he says oh indeed whispers miss dorothy like she was talking to herself thats it is it and she turns and looks at me just as though she had never seen me before nolan he was agaping too with his mouth open but he holds me tight hes not for sale he growls like he was frightened and the man looks black and walks away why nolan cries miss dorothy mr polk knows more about bullterriers than any amateur in america what can he mean why kid is no more than a puppy three hundred dollars for a puppy and he aint no thoroughbred neither cries the master hes unknown aint he kid cant help it of course but his mother miss i dropped my head i couldnt bear he should tell miss dorothy i couldnt bear she should know i had stolen my blue ribbon but the master never told for at that a gentleman runs up calling three twentysix three twentysix and miss dorothy says here he is what is it the winners class says the gentleman hurry please the judge is waiting for him nolan tries to get me off the chain on to a showingleash but he shakes so he only chokes me what is it miss he says what is it the winners class says miss dorothy the judge wants him with the winners of the other classes to decide which is the best its only a form says she he has the champions against him now yes says the gentleman as he hurries us to the ring im afraid its only a form for your dog but the judge wants all the winners puppy class even we had got to the gate and the gentleman there was writing down my number who won the open asks miss dorothy oh who would laughs the gentleman the old champion of course hes won for three years now there he is isnt he wonderful says he and he points to a dog thats standing proud and haughty on the platform in the middle of the ring i never see so beautiful a dog so fine and clean and noble so white like he had rolled hisself in flour holding his nose up and his eyes shut same as though no one was worth looking at aside of him we other dogs even though we had a blue ribbon apiece seemed like lumps of mud he was a royal gentleman a king he was his master didnt have to hold his head with no leash he held it hisself standing as still as an iron dog on a lawn like he knew all the people was looking at him and so they was and no one around the ring pointed at no other dog but him oh what a picture cried miss dorothy hes like a marble figure by a great artist one who loved dogs who is he says she looking in her book i dont keep up with terriers oh you know him says the gentleman he is the champion of champions regent royal the masters face went red and this is regent royals son cries he and he pulls me quick into the ring and plants me on the platform next my father i trembled so that i near fell my legs twisted like a leash but my father he never looked at me he only smiled the same sleepy smile and he still kept his eyes half shut like as no one no not even his own son was worth his lookin at the judge he didnt let me stay beside my father but one by one he placed the other dogs next to him and measured and felt and pulled at them and each one he put down but he never put my father down and then he comes over and picks up me and sets me back on the platform shoulder to shoulder with the champion regent royal and goes down on his knees and looks into our eyes the gentleman with my father he laughs and says to the judge thinking of keeping us here all day john but the judge he doesnt hear him and goes behind us and runs his hand down my side and holds back my ears and takes my jaws between his fingers the crowd around the ring is very deep now and nobody says nothing the gentleman at the scoretable he is leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and his eyes very wide and the gentleman at the gate is whispering quick to miss dorothy who has turned white i stood as stiff as stone i didnt even breathe but out of the corner of my eye i could see my father licking his pink chops and yawning just a little like he was bored the judge he had stopped looking fierce and was looking solemn something inside him seemed atroubling him awful the more he stares at us now the more solemn he gets and when he touches us he does it gentle like he was patting us for a long time he kneels in the sawdust looking at my father and at me and no one around the ring says nothing to nobody then the judge takes a breath and touches me sudden its his he says but he lays his hand just as quick on my father im sorry says he the gentleman holding my father cries do you mean to tell me and the judge he answers i mean the other is the better dog he takes my fathers head between his hands and looks down at him most sorrowful the king is dead says he long live the king goodby regent he says the crowd around the railings clapped their hands and some laughed scornful and every one talks fast and i start for the gate so dizzy that i cant see my way but my father pushes in front of me walking very daintily and smiling sleepy same as he had just been waked with his head high and his eyes shut looking at nobody illustration for a long time he kneels in the sawdust so that is how i came by my inheritance as miss dorothy calls it and just for that though i couldnt feel where i was any different the crowd follows me to my bench and pats me and coos at me like i was a baby in a babycarriage and the handlers have to hold em back so that the gentlemen from the papers can make pictures of me and nolan walks me up and down so proud and the men shake their heads and says he certainly is the true type he is and the pretty ladies ask miss dorothy who sits beside me letting me lick her gloves to show the crowd what friends we is arent you afraid hell bite you and jimmy jocks calls to me didnt i tell you so i always knew you were one of us blood will out kid blood will out i saw your grandfather says he make his dйbut at the crystal palace but he was never the dog you are after that if i could have asked for it there was nothing i couldnt get you might have thought i was a snowdog and they was afeard id melt if i wet my pats nolan gave me a hot bath and chained me to the stove if i couldnt eat my food being stuffed full by the cook for i am a housedog now and let in to lunch whether there is visitors or not nolan would run to bring the vet it was all tommy rot as jimmy says but meant most kind i couldnt scratch myself comfortable without nolan giving me nasty drinks and rubbing me outside till it burnt awful and i wasnt let to eat bones for fear of spoiling my beautiful mouth what mother used to call my punishing jaw and my food was cooked special on a gasstove and miss dorothy gives me an overcoat cut very stylish like the champions to wear when we goes out carriagedriving after the next show where i takes three blue ribbons four silver cups two medals and brings home fortyfive dollars for nolan they gives me a registered name same as jimmys miss dorothy wanted to call me regent heir apparent but i was that glad when nolan says no kid dont owe nothing to his father only to you and hisself so if you please miss well call him wyndham kid and so they did and you can see it on my overcoat in blue letters and painted top of my kennel it was all too hard to understand for days i just sat and wondered if i was really me and how it all come about and why everybody was so kind but oh it was so good they was for if they hadnt been id never have got the thing i most wished after but because they was kind and not liking to deny me nothing they gave it me and it was more to me than anything in the world it came about one day when we was out driving we was in the cart they calls the dogcart because its the one miss dorothy keeps to take jimmy and me for an airing nolan was up behind and me in my new overcoat was sitting beside miss dorothy i was admiring the view and thinking how good it was to have a horse pull you about so that you neednt get yourself splashed and have to be washed when i hears a dog calling loud for help and i pricks up my ears and looks over the horses head and i sees something that makes me tremble down to my toes in the road before us three big dogs was chasing a little old ladydog she had a string to her tail where some boys had tied a can and she was dirty with mud and ashes and torn most awful she was too far done up to get away and too old to help herself but she was making a fight for her life snapping her old gums savage and dying game all this i see in a wink and then the three dogs pinned her down and i cant stand it no longer and clears the wheel and lands in the road on my head it was my stylish overcoat done that and i cursed it proper but i gets my pats again quick and makes a rush for the fighting behind me i hear miss dorothy cry theyll kill that old dog wait take my whip beat them off her the kid can take care of himself and i hear nolan fall into the road and the horse come to a stop the old ladydog was down and the three was eating her vicious but as i come up scattering the pebbles she hears and thinking its one more of them she lifts her head and my heart breaks open like some one had sunk his teeth in it for under the ashes and the dirt and the blood i can see who it is and i know that my mother has come back to me i gives a yell that throws them three dogs off their legs mother i cries im the kid i cries im coming to you mother im coming and i shoots over her at the throat of the big dog and the other two they sinks their teeth into that stylish overcoat and tears it off me and that sets me free and i lets them have it i never had so fine a fight as that what with mother being there to see and not having been let to mix up in no fights since i become a prizewinner it just naturally did me good and it wasnt three shakes before i had em yelping quick as a wink mother she jumps in to help me and i just laughed to see her it was so like old times and nolan he made me laugh too he was like a hen on a bank shaking the butt of his whip but not daring to cut in for fear of hitting me stop it kid he says stop it do you want to be all torn up says he think of the boston show says he think of chicago think of danbury dont you never want to be a champion how was i to think of all them places when i had three dogs to cut up at the same time but in a minute two of em begs for mercy and mother and me lets em run away the big one he aint able to run away then mother and me we dances and jumps and barks and laughs and bites each other and rolls each other in the road there never was two dogs so happy as we and nolan he whistles and calls and begs me to come to him but i just laugh and play larks with mother now you come with me says i to my new home and never try to run away again and i shows her our house with the five red roofs set on the top of the hill but mother trembles awful and says theyd never let me in such a place does the viceroy live there kid says she and i laugh at her no i do i says and if they wont let you live there too you and me will go back to the streets together for we must never be parted no more so we trots up the hill side by side with nolan trying to catch me and miss dorothy laughing at him from the cart the kids made friends with the poor old dog says she maybe he knew her long ago when he ran the streets himself put her in here beside me and see if he doesnt follow so when i hears that i tells mother to go with nolan and sit in the cart but she says no that shed soil the pretty ladys frock but i tells her to do as i say and so nolan lifts her trembling still into the cart and i runs alongside barking joyful when we drives into the stables i takes mother to my kennel and tells her to go inside it and make herself at home oh but he wont let me says she who wont let you says i keeping my eye on nolan and growling a bit nasty just to show i was meaning to have my way why wyndham kid says she looking up at the name on my kennel but im wyndham kid says i you cries mother you is my little kid the great wyndham kid the dogs all talk about and at that she being very old and sick and nervous as mothers are just drops down in the straw and weeps bitter well there aint much more than that to tell miss dorothy she settled it if the kid wants the poor old thing in the stables says she let her stay you see says she shes a blackandtan and his mother was a blackandtan and maybe thats what makes kid feel so friendly toward her says she indeed for me says nolan she can have the best there is id never drive out no dog that asks for a crust nor a shelter he says but what will mr wyndham do hell do what i say says miss dorothy and if i say shes to stay she will stay and i say shes to stay and so mother and nolan and me found a home mother was scared at first not being used to kind people but she was so gentle and loving that the grooms got fonder of her than of me and tried to make me jealous by patting of her and giving her the pick of the vittles but that was the wrong way to hurt my feelings thats all i think mother is so happy here that i tell her we ought to call it the happy hunting grounds because no one hunts you and there is nothing to hunt it just all comes to you and so we live in peace mother sleeping all day in the sun or behind the stove in the head grooms office being fed twice a day regular by nolan and all the day by the other grooms most irregular and as for me i go hurrying around the country to the benchshows winning money and cups for nolan and taking the blue ribbons away from father
