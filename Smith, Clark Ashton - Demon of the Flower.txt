demon of the flower clark ashton smith not as the plants and flowers of earth growing peacefully beneath a simple sun were the blossoms of the planet lophai coiling and uncoiling in double dawns tossing tumultuously under vast suns of jade green and balasruby orange swaying and weltering in rich twilights in auroracurtained nights they resembled fields of rooted servants that dance eternally to an otherworldly music many were small and furtive and crept viperwise on the ground others were tall as pythons rearing superbly in hieratic postures to the jeweled light some grew with single or dual stems that burgeoned forth into hydra heads and some were frilled and festooned with leaves that suggested the wings of flying lizards the pennants of faery lances the phylacteries of a strange sacerdotalism some appeared to bear the scarlet wattles of dragons others were tongued as if with black flames or the colored vapors that issue with weird writhings from out barbaric censers and others still were armed with fleshy nets or tendrils or with huge blossoms like bucklers perforated in battle and all were equipped with venomous darts and fangs all were alive restless and sentient they were the lords of lophai and all other life existed by their sufferance the people of the world had been their inferiors from unrecorded cycles and even in the most primitive myths there was no suggestion that any other order of things had ever prevailed and the plants themselves together with the fauna and mankind of lophai gave immemorial obeisance to that supreme and terrible flower known as the voorqual in which a tutelary demon more ancient than the twin suns was believed to have made its immortal avatar the voorqual was served by a human priesthood chosen from amid the royalty and aristocracy of lophai in the heart of the chief city lospar in an equatorial realm it had grown from antiquity on the summit of a high pyramid of sable terraces that loomed over the town like the hanging gardens of some greater babylon crowded with the lesser but deadly floral forms at the center of the broad apex the voorqual stood alone in a basin level with the surrounding platform of black mineral the basin was filled with a compost in which the dust of royal mummies formed an essential ingredient the demon flower sprang from a bulb so encrusted with the growth of ages that it resembled a stone urn above this there rose the gnarled and mighty stalk that had displayed in earlier times the bifurcation of a mandrake but whose halves had now grown together into a scaly furrowed thing like the tail of some mythic seamonster the stalk was variegated with hues of greening bronze of antique copper with the livid blues and purples of fleshly corruption it ended in a crown of stiff blackish leaves banded and spotted with poisonous metallic white and edged with sharp serrations as of savage weapons from below the crown issued a long sinuous arm scaled like the main stem and serpentining downward and outward to terminate in the huge upright bowl of a bizarre blossom as if the arm in sardonic fashion should hold out a hellish beggars cup abhorrent and monstrous was the bowl which like the leaves was legended to renew itself at intervals of a thousand years it smouldered with sullen ruby at the base it lightened into zones of dragons blood into belts of the rose of infernal sunset on the full swelling sides and it flamed at the rim to a hot yellowish nacarat red like the ichor of salamanders to one who dared peer within the cup was lined with sepulchral violet blackening toward the bottom pitted with myriad pores and streaked with turgescent veins of sulphurous green swaying in a slow lethal hypnotic rhythm with a deep and solemn sibilation the voorqual dominated the city of lospar and the world lophai below on the tiers of the pyramid the thronged ophidian plants kept time to this rhythm in their tossing and hissing and far beyond lospar to the poles of the planet and in all its longitudes the living blossoms obeyed the sovereign tempo of the voorqual boundless was the power exercised by this being over the people who for want of a better name i have called the humankind of lophai myriad and frightful were the legends that had gathered through aeons about the voorqual and dire was the sacrifice demanded each year at the summer solstice by the demon the filling of its proffered cup with the lifeblood of a priest or priestess chosen from amid the assembled hierophants who passed before the voorqual till the poised cup inverted and empty descended like a devils miter on the head of one of their number lunithi king of the realms about lospar and highpriest of the voorqual was the last if not the first of his race to rebel against this singular tyranny there were dim myths of some primordial ruler who had dared to refuse the required sacrifice and whose people in consequence had been decimated by a mortal war with the serpentine plants which obeying the angry demon had uprooted themselves everywhere from the soil and had marched on the cities of lophai slaying or vampirizing all who fell in their way lunithi from childhood had obeyed implicitly and without question the will of the floral overlord had offered the stated worship had performed the necessary rites to withhold them would have beem blasphemy he had not dreamt of rebellion till at the time of the annual choosing of the victim and thirty suns before the date of his nuptials with nala priestess of the voorqual he saw the hesitant inverted grail come down in deathly crimson on the fair head of his betrothed a sorrowful consternation a dark sullen dismay which he sought to smother in his heart was experienced by lunithi nala dazed and resigned in a mystic inertia of despair accepted her doom without question but a blasphemous doubt formed itself surreptitiously in the mind of the king trembling at his own impiety he asked himself if there was not some way in which he could save nala could cheat the demon of its ghastly tribute to do this and escape with impunity to himself and his subjects he knew that he must strike at the very life of the monster which was believed to be deathless and invulnerable it seemed impious even to wonder concerning the truth of this belief which had long assumed the force of a religious tenet and was held unanimously amid such reflections lunithi remembered an old myth about the existence of a neutral and independent being known as the occlith a demon coeval with the voorqual and allied neither to man nor the flower creatures this being was said to dwell beyond the desert of aphom in the otherwise unpeopled mountains of white stone above the habitat of the ophidian blossoms in latter days no man had seen the occlith for the journey through ayhom was not lightly to be undertaken but this entity was supposed to be immortal and it kept apart and alone meditating upon all things but interfering never with their processes however it was said to have given in earlier times valuable advice to a certain king who had gone forth from lospar to its lair among the white crags in his grief and desperation lunithi resolved to seek the occlith and question it anent the possibility of slaying the voorqual if by any mortal means the demon could be destroyed he would remove from lophai the longestablished tyranny whose shadow fell upon all things from the sable pyramid it was necessary for him to proceed with utmost caution to confide in no one to veil his very thoughts at all times from the occult scrutiny of the voorqual in the interim of five days between the choosing of the victim and the consummation of the sacrifice he must carry out his mad plan unattended and disguised as a simple hunter of beasts he left his palace during the short threehour night of universal slumber and stole forth toward the desert of aphom in the dawn of the balasruby sun he had reached the pathless waste and was toiling painfully over its knifesharp ridges of dark stone like the waves of a mounting ocean petrified in storm soon the rays of the green sun were added to those of the other and aphom became a painted inferno through which lunithi dragged his way crawling from scarp to glassy scarp or resting at whiles in the colored shadows there was no water anywhere but swift mirages gleamed and faded and the sifting sand appeared to run like rills in the bottom of deep valleys at setting of the first sun he came within sight of the pale mountains beyond aphom towering like cliffs of frozen foam above the deserts dark sea they were tinged with transient lights of azure of jade and orange in the going of the yellowred orb and the westward slanting of its binary then the lights melted into beryl and tourmaline and the green sun was regnant over all till it too went down leaving a twilight whose colors were those of seawater in the gloom lunithi reached the foot of the pale crags and there exhausted he slept till the second dawn rising he began his escalade of the white mountains they rose bleak and terrible before him against the hidden suns with cliffs that were like the sheer terraces of gods like the king who had preceded him in the ancient myth he found a precarious way that led upward through narrow broken chasms at last he came to the vaster fissure riving the heart of the white range by which it was alone possible to reach the legendary lair of the occlith the chasms beetling walls rose higher and higher above him shutting out the suns but creating with their whiteness a wan and deathly glimmer to illumine his way the fissure was such as might have been cloven by the sword of a macrocosmic giant it led downward steepening ever like a wound that pierced to the heart of lophai lunithi like all of his race was able to exist for prolonged periods without other nutriment than sunlight and water he had brought with him a metal flask filled with the aqueous elenent of lophai from which he drank sparingly as he descended the chasm for the white mountains were waterless and he feared to touch the pools and streams of unknown fluids upon which he came at intervals in the dusk there were sanguinecolored springs that fumed and bubbled before him to vanish in fathomless rifts and brooklets of mercurial metal green blue or amber that wound beside him like liquescent serpents and then slipped away into dark caverns acrid vapors rose from clefts in the chasm and lunithi felt himself among strange chemistries of nature in this fantastic world of stone which the plants of lophai could never invade he seemed to have gone beyond the voorquals grim diabolic tyranny at last he came to a clear watery pool occupying almost the entire width of the chasm in passing it he was forced to scramble along a narrow insecure ledge at one side a fragment of the marble stone breaking away beneath his footfall dropped into the pool as he gained the opposite edge and the hueless liquid foamed and hissed like a thousand vipers wondering as to its properties and fearful of the venomous hissing which did not subside for some time lunithi hurried on and came after an interval to the fissures end here he emerged in the huge craterlike pit that was the home of the occlith fluted and columned walls went up to a stupendous height on all sides and the sun of orange ruby now at zenith was pouring down a vertical cataract of gorgeous fires and shadows addorsed against the further wall of the pit in an upright posture he beheld that being known as the occlith which had the likeness of a high cruciform pillar of blue mineral shining with its own esoteric luster going forward he prostrated himself before the pillar and then in accents that quavered with a deep awe he ventured to ask the desired oracle for awhile the occlith maintained its aeonold silence peering timidly the king perceived the twin lights of mystic silver that brightened and faded with a slow rhythmic pulsation in the arms of the blue cross then from the lofty shining thing there issued a voice that was like the tinkling of mineral fragments tightly clashed together but which somehow shaped itself into articulate words it is possible said the occlith to slay the plant known as the voorqual in which an elder demon has its habitation though the flower has attained millennial age it is not necessarily immortal for all things have their proper term of existence and decay and nothing has been created without its corresponding agency of death i do not advise you to slay the plant but i can furnish you with the information which you desire in the mountain chasm through which you came to seek me there flows a hueless spring of mineral poison deadly to all the ophidian plantlife of this world the occlith went on and told lunithi the method by which the poison should be prepared and administered the chill toneless tinkling voice concluded i have answered your question if there is anything more that you wish to learn it would be well to ask me now prostrating himself again lunithi gave thanks to the occlith and considering that he had learned all that was requisite he did not avail himself of the opportunity to question further the strange entity of living stone and the occlith cryptic and aloof in its termless impenetrable meditation apparently saw fit to vouchsafe nothing more except in answer to a direct query withdrawing from the marblewalled abyss lunithi returned in haste along the chasm till reaching the pool of which the occlith had spoken he paused to empty his waterflask and fill it with the angry hissing liquid then he resumed his homeward journey at the end of two days after incredible fatigues and torments in the blazing hell of aphom he reached lospar in the time of darkness and slumber as when he had departed since his absence had been unannounced it was supposed that he had retired to the underground adyta below the pyramid of the voorqual for purposes of prolonged meditation as was sometimes his wont in alternate hope and trepidation dreading the miscarriage of his plan and shrinking still from its audacious impiety lunithi awaited the night preceding that double dawn of summer solstice when in a secret room of the black pyramid the monstrous offering was to be made ready nala would be slain by a fellowpriest or priestess chosen by lot and her lifeblood would drip from the channeled altar into a great cup and the cup would then be borne with solemn rites to the voorqual and its contents poured into the evilly supplicative bowl of the sanguinated blossom he saw little of nala during that interim she was more withdrawn than ever and seemed to have consecrated herself wholly to the coming doom to no one and least of all to his beloved did lunithi dare to hint a posssible prevention of the sacrifice there came the dreaded eve with a swiftly changing twilight of jeweled hues that turned to a darkness hung with auroral flame lunithi stole across the sleeping city and entered the pyramid whose blackness towered massively amid the frail architecture of buildings that were little more than canopies and lattices of stone with infinite care and caution he made the preparations prescribed by the occlith into the huge sacrificial cup of black metal in a room lit with stored sunlight he emptied the seething sibilant poison he had brought with him from the white mountains then opening adroitly a vein in one of his arms he added a certain amount of his own lifefluid to the lethal potion above whose foaming crystal it floated like a magic oil without mingling so that the entire cup to all appearance was filled with the liquid most acceptable to the satanic blossom bearing in his hands the black grail lunithi ascended a hewn stairway that led to the voorquals presence his heart quailing his senses swooning in chill gulfs of terror he emerged on the lofty summit above the shadowy town in a luminous azure gloom against the weird and iridescent streamers of light that foreran the double dawn he saw the dreamy swaying of the monstrous plant and heard its somnolent hissing that was answered drowsily by myriad blossoms on the tiers below a nightmare oppression black and tangible seemed to flow from the pyramid and to lie in stagnant shadow on all the lands of lophai aghast at his own temerity and deeming that his shrouded thoughts would surely be understood as he drew nearer or that the voorqual would be suspicious of an offering brought before the accustomed hour lunithi made obeisance to his floral suzerain the voorqual vouchsafed no sign that it had deigned to perceive his presence but the great flowercup with its flaring crimsons dulled to garnet and purple in the twilight was held forward as if in readiness to receive the hideous gift breathless and fainting with religious fear in a moment of suspense that seemed eternal lunithi poured the bloodmantled poison into the cup the venom boiled and hissed like a wizards brew as the thirsty flower drank it up and lunithi saw the scaled arm draw back tilting its demon grail quickly as if to repudiate the doubtful draught it was too late for the poison had been absorbed by the blossoms porous lining the tilting motion changed in midair to an agonized writhing of the reptilian arm and then the voorquals huge scaly stalk and pointed leafcrown began to toss in a deathly dance waving darkly against the auroral curtains of morn its deep hissing sharpened to an insupportable note fraught with the pain of a dying devil and looking down from the platform edge on which he crouched to avoid the swaying growth lunithi saw that the lesser plants on the terraces were now tossing in a mad unison with their master like noises in an ill dream he heard the chorus of their tortured sibilations he dared not look again at the voorqual till he became aware of a strange silence and saw that the blossoms below had ceased to writhe and were drooping limply on their stems then incredulous he knew that the voorqual was dead turning in triumph mingled with horror he beheld the flaccid stalk that had fallen prone on its bed of unholy compost he saw the sudden withering of the stiff sworded leaves of the gross and hellish cup even the stony bulb appeared to collapse and crumble before his eyes the entire stem its evil colors fading swiftly shrank and fell in upon itself like a sere empty serpentskin at the same time in some obscure manner lunithi was still aware of a presence that brooded above the pyramid even in the death of the voorqual it seemed to him that he was not alone then as he stood and waited fearing he knew not what he felt the passing of a cold and unseen thing in the gloom a thing that flowed across his body like the thick coils of some enormous python without sound in dark clammy undulations a moment more and it was gone and lunithi no longer felt the brooding presence he turned to go but it seemed that the dying night was full of an unconceived terror that gathered before him as he went down the long somber stairs slowly he descended a weird despair was upon him he had slain the voorqual had seen it wither in death yet he could not believe the thing he had done the lifting of the ancient doom was still no more than an idle myth the twilight brightened as he passed through the slumbering city according to custom no one would be abroad for another hour then the priests of the voorqual would gather for the annual bloodoffering midway between the pyramid and his own palace lunithi was more than startled to meet the maiden nala pale and ghostly she glided by him with a swift and swaying movement almost serpentine which differed oddly from her habitual languor lunithi dared not accost her when he saw her shut unheeding eyes like those of a somnambulist and he was awed and troubled by the strange ease the unnatural surety of her motion which reminded him of something which he feared to remember in a turmoil of fantastic doubt and apprehension he followed her threading the exotic maze of lospar with the fleet and sinuous glide of a homing serpent nala entered the sacred pyramid lunithi less swift than she had fallen behind and he knew not where she had gone in the myriad vaults and chambers but a dark and fearsome intuition drew his steps without delay to the platform of the summit he knew not what he should find but his heart was drugged with an esoteric hopelessness and he was aware of no surprise when he came forth in the varicolored dawn and beheld the thing which awaited him the maiden nala or that which he knew to be nala was standing in the basin of evil compost above the withered remains of the voorqual she had undergone was still undergoing a monstrous and diabolic metamorphosis her frail slight body had assumed a long and dragonlike shape and the tender skin was marked off in incipient scales that darkened momentarily with a mottling of baleful hues her head was no longer recognizable as such and the human lineaments were flaring into a weird semicircle of pointed leafbuds her lower limbs had joined together had rooted themselves in the ground one of her arms was becomimg a part of the reptilian bole and the other was lengthening into a scaly stem that bore the darkred bud of a sinister blossom more and more the monstrosity took on the similitude of the voorqual and lunithi crushed by the ancient awe and dark terrible faith of his ancestors could feel no longer any doubt of its true identity soon there was no trace of nala in the thing before him which began to sway with a sinuous pythonlike rhythm and to utter a deep and measured sibilation to which the plants on the lower tiers responded he knew then that the voorqual had returned to claim its sacrifice and preside forever above the city lospar and the world lophai
