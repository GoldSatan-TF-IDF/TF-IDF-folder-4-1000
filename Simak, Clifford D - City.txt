city clifford d simak editors preface these are the stories that the dogs tell when the fires burn high and the wind is from the north then each family circle gathers at the hearthstone and the pups sit silently and listen and when the storys done they ask many questions what is man theyll ask or perhaps what is a city or what is a war there is no positive answer to any of these questions there are suppositions and there are theories and there are many educated guesses but there are no answers in the family circle many a storyteller has been forced to fall back on the ancient explanation that it is nothing but a story there is no such thing as a man or city that one does not search for truth in a simple tale but takes it for its pleasure and lets it go at that explanations such as these while they may do to answer pups are no explanations one does search for truth in such simple tales as these the legend consisting of eight tales has been told for countless centuries so far as can be determined it has no historic starting point the most minute study of it fails entirely to illustrate the stages of its development there is no doubt that through many years of telling it has become stylized but there is no way to trace the direction of its stylization that it is ancient and as some writers claim that it may be of nondoggish origin in part is borne out by the abundance of jabberwocky which studs the taleswords and phrases which have no meaning now and may have never had a meaning through telling and retelling these words and phrases have become accepted have been assigned through context a certain arbitrary value but there is no way of knowing whether or not these arbitrary values even approximate the original meaning of the words this edition of the tales will not attempt to enter into the many technical arguments concerning the existence or nonexistence of man of the puzzle of the city of the several theories relating to war or of the many other questions which arise to plague the student who would seek in the legend some evidence of its having roots in some basic or historic truth the purpose of this edition is only to give the full unexpurgated text of the tales as they finally stand chapter notes are utilized to point out the major points of speculation but with no attempt at all to achieve conclusions for those who wish some further understanding of the tales or of the many points of consideration which have arisen over them there are ample texts written by dogs of far greater competence than the present editor recent discovery of fragments of what originally must have been an extensive body of literature has been advanced as the latest argument which would attribute at least part of the legend to mythological man rather than to the dogs but until it can be proved that man did in fact exist argument that the discovered fragments originated with man can have but little point particularly significant or disturbing depending upon the viewpoint that one takes is the fact that the apparent title of the literary fragment is the same as the title of one of the tales in the legend here presented the word itself of course is entirely meaningless the first question of course is whether there ever was such a creature as man at the moment in the absence of positive evidence the sober consensus must be that there was not that man as presented in the legend is a figment of folklore invention man may have risen in the early days of doggish culture as an imaginary being a sort of racial god on which the dogs might call for help to which they might retire for comfort despite these sober conclusions however there are those who see in man an actual elder god a visitor from some mystic land or dimensions who came and stayed awhile and helped and then passed on to the place from which he came there still are others who believe that man and dog may have risen together as two cooperating animals may have been complementary in the development of a culture but that at some distant point in time they reached the parting of the ways of all the disturbing factors in the tales the most disturbing is the suggestion of reverence which is accorded man it is hard for the average reader to accept this reverence as mere storytelling it goes far beyond the perfunctory worship of a tribal god one almost instinctively feels that it must be deeprooted in some now forgotten belief or rite involving the prehistory of our race there is little hope now of course that any of the many areas of controversy which revolve about the legend ever will be settled here then are the tales to be read as you see fitfor pleasure only for some sign of historical significance for some hint of hidden meaning our best advice to the average reader dont take them too much to heart for complete confusion if not madness lurks along the road notes on the first tale there is no doubt that of all the tales the first is the most difficult for the casual reader not only is its nomenclature trying but its logic and its ideas seem at first reading to be entirely alien this may be because in this story and the next a dog plays no part is not even mentioned from the opening paragraph in this first tale the reader is pitchforked into an utterly strange situation with equally strange characters to act out its solution this much may be said for the tale howeverby the time one has laboured his way through it the rest of the tales by comparison seem almost homey overriding the entire tale is the concept of the city while there is no complete understanding of what a city might be or why it should be it is generally agreed that it must have been a small area accommodating and supporting a large number of residents some of the reasons for its existence are superficially explained in text but bounce who has devoted a lifetime to the study of the tales is convinced that the explanation is no more than the clever improvisations of an ancient storyteller to support an impossible concept most students of the tales agree with bounce that the reasons as given in the tale do not square with logic and some rover among them have suspected that here we may have an ancient satire of which the significance has been lost most authorities in economics and sociology regard such an organization as a city an impossible structure not only from the economic standpoint but from the sociological and psychological as well no creature of the highly nervous structure necessary to develop a culture they point out would be able to survive within such restricted limits the result if it were tried these authorities say would lead to mass neuroticism which in a short period of time would destroy the very culture which had built the city rover believes that in the first tale we are dealing with almost pure myth and that as a result no situation or statement can be accepted at face value that the entire tale must be filled with a symbolism to which the key has long been lost puzzling however is the fact that if it is a mythconcept and nothing more that the form by now should not have rounded itself into the symbolic concepts which are the hallmark of the myth in the tale there is for the average reader little that can be tagged as mythcontent the tale itself is perhaps the most angular of the lotrawboned and slung together with none of the touches of finer sentiment and lofty ideals which are found in the rest of the legend the language of the tale is particularly baffling phrases such as the classic dadburn the kid have puzzled semanticists for many centuries and there is today no closer approach to what many of the words and phrases mean than there was when students first came to pay some serious attention to the legend the terminology for man has been fairly well worked out however the plural for this mythical race is men the racial designation is human the females are women or wives the pups are children a male pup is a boy a female pup a girl aside from the concept of the city another concept which the reader will find entirely at odds with his way of life and which may violate his very thinking is the idea of war and of killing killing is a process usually involving violence by which one living thing ends the life of another living thing war it would appear was mass killing carried out on a scale which is inconceivable rover in his study of the legend is convinced that the tales are much more primitive than is generally supposed since it is his contention that such concepts as war and killing could never come out of our present culture that they must stem from some era of savagery of which there exists no record tige who is almost alone in his belief that the tales are based on actual history and that the race of man did exist in the primordial days of the dogs beginning contends that this first tale is the story of the actual breakdown of mans culture he believes that the tale as we know it today may be a mere shadow of some greater tale a gigantic epic which at one time may have measured fully as large or larger than todays entire body of the legend it does not seem possible he writes that so great an event as the collapse of a mighty mechanical civilization could have been condensed by the tales contemporaries into so small a compass as the present tale what we have here says tige is only one of many tales which told the entire story and that the one which does remain to us may be no more than a minor one i city gramp stevens sat in a lawn chair watching the mower at work feeling the warm soft sunshine seep into his bones the mower reached the edge of the lawn clucked to itself like a contented hen made a neat turn and trundled down another swath the bag holding the clippings bulged suddenly the mower stopped and clicked excitedly a panel in its side snapped open and a cranelike arm reached out grasping steel fingers fished around in the grass came up triumphantly with a stone clutched tightly dropped the stone into a small container disappeared back into the panel again the lawn mower gurgled purred on again following its swath gramp grumbled at it with suspicion some day he told himself that dadburned thing is going to miss a lick and have a nervous breakdown he lay back in the chair and stared up at the sunwashed sky a helicopter skimmed far overhead from somewhere inside the house a radio came to life and a torturing crash of music poured out gramp hearing it shivered and bunkered lower in the chair young charlie was settling down for a twitch session dadburn the kid the lawn mower chuckled past and gramp squinted at it maliciously automatic he told the sky ever blasted thing is automatic now getting so you just take a machine off in a corner and whisper in its ear and it scurries off to do the job his daughters voice came to him out of the window pitched to carry above the music father gramp stirred uneasily yes betty now father you see you move when that lawn mower gets to you dont try to outstubborn it after all its only a machine last time you just sat there and made it cut around you i never saw the beat of you he didnt answer letting his head nod a bit hoping she would think he was asleep and let him be father she shrilled did you hear me he saw it was no good sure i heard you he told her i was just flexing to move he rose slowly to his feet leaning heavily on his cane might make her feel sorry for the way she treated him when she saw how old and feeble he was getting hed have to be careful though if she knew he didnt need the cane at all shed be finding jobs for him to do and on the other hand if he laid it on too thick shed be having that fool doctor in to pester him again grumbling be moved the chair out into that portion of the lawn that had been cut the mower rolling past chortled at him fiendishly some day gramp told it im going to take a swipe at you and bust a gear or two the mower hooted at him and went serenely down the lawn from somewhere down the grassy street came a jangling of metal a stuttered coughing gramp ready to sit down straightened up and listened the sound came more clearly the rumbling backfire of a balky engine the clatter of loose metallic parts an automobile yelped gramp an automobile by cracky he started to gallop for the gate suddenly remembered tha the was feeble and subsided into a rapid hobble must be that crazy ole johnson he told himself hes the only one left thats got a car just too dadburned stubborn to give it up it was ole gramp reached the gate in time to see the rusty dilapidated old machine come bumping around the corner rocking and chugging along the unused street steam hissed from the overheated radiator and a cloud of blue smoke issued from the exhaust which had lost its muffler five years or more ago ole sat stolidly behind the wheel squinting his eyes trying to duck the roughest places although that was hard to do for weeds and grass had overrun the streets and it was hard to see what might be underneath them gramp waved his cane hi ole he shouted ole pulled up setting the emergency brake the car gasped shuddered coughed died with a horrible sigh what you burning asked gramp little bit of everything said ole kerosene some old tractor oil i found out in a barrel some rubbing alcohol gramp regarded the fugitive machine with forthright admiration them was the days he said had one myself used to be able to do a hundred miles an hour still ok said ole if you only could find the stuff to run them or get the parts to fix them up to three four years ago i used to be able to get enough gasoline but aint seen none for a long time now quit making it i guess no use having gasoline they tell me when you have atomic power sure said champ guess maybe thats right but you cant smell atomic power sweetest thing i know the smell of burning gasoline these here helicopters and other gadgets they got took all the romance out of travelling somehow he squinted at the barrels and baskets piled in the back seat got some vegetables he asked yup said ole some sweet corn and early potatoes and a few baskets of tomatoes thought maybe i could sell them champ shook his head you wont ole they wont buy them folks has got the notion that this new hydroponics stuff is the only garden sass thats fit to eat sanitary they say and better flavoured wouldnt give a hoot in a tin cup for all they grow in them tanks they got ole declared belligerently dont taste right to me somehow like i tell martha foods got to be raised in the soil to have any character he reached down to turn over the ignition switch dont know as its worth trying to get the stuff to town he said the way they keep the roads or the way they dont keep them rather twenty years ago the state highway out there was a strip of good concrete and they kept it patched and ploughed it every winter did anything spent any amount of money to keep it open and now they just forgot about it the concretes all broken up and some of it has washed out brambles are growing in it had to get out and cut away a tree that fell across it one place this morning aint it the truth agreed champ the car exploded into life coughing and choking a cloud of dense blue smoke rolled out from under it with a jerk it stirred to life and lumbered down the street gramp clumped back to his chair and found it dripping wet the automatic mower having finished its cutting job had rolled out the hose was sprinkling the lawn muttering venom gramp stalked around the corner of the house and sat down on the bench beside the back porch he didnt like to sit there but it was the only place he was safe from the hunk of machinery out in front for one thing the view from the bench was slightly depressing fronting as it did on street after street of vacant deserted houses and weedgrown unkempt yards it had one advantage however from the bench he could pretend be was slightly deaf and not hear the twitch music the radio was blaring out a voice called from the front yard bill bill where be you gramp twisted around here i am mark back of the house hiding from that dadburned mower mark bailey limped around the corner of the house cigarette threatening to set fire to his bushy whiskers bit early for the game aint you asked grump cant play no game today said mark he hobbled over and sat down beside grump on the bench were leaving he said cramp whirled on him youre leaving yeah moving out into the country lucinda finally talked herb into it never gave him a minutes peace i guess said everyone was moving away to one of them nice country estates and she didnt see no reason why we couldnt cramp gulped where to dont rightly know said mark aint been there myself to north some place up on one of the lakes got ten acres of land lucinda wanted a hundred but herb put down his foot and said ten was enough after all one city lot was enough for all these years betty was pestering johnny too said gramp but hes holding out against her says he simply cant do it says it wouldnt look right him the secretary of the chamber of commerce and all if he went moving away from the city folks are crazy mark declared plumb crazy thats a fact cramp agreed country crazy thats what they are look across there he waved his hand at the streets of vacant houses can remember the time when those places were as pretty a bunch of homes as you ever laid your eyes on good neighbours they were women ran across from one back door to another to trade recipes and the men folks would go out to cut the grass and pretty soon the mowers would all be sitting idle and the men would be ganged up chewing the fat friendly people mark but look at it now mark stirred uneasily got to be getting back bill just sneaked over to let you know we were lighting out lucindas got me packing shed be sore if she knew id run out cramp rose stiffly and held out his hand ill be seeing you again you be over for one last game mark shook his head afraid not bill they shook hands awkwardly abashed sure will miss them games said mark me too said gramp i wont have nobody once youre gone so long bill said mark so long said champ he stood and watched his friend hobble around the house felt the cold claw of loneliness reach out and touch him with icy fingers a terrible loneliness the loneliness of ageof age and the outdated fiercely gramp admitted it he was outdated he belonged to another age he had outstripped his time lived beyond his years eyes misty he fumbled for the cane that lay against the bench slowly made his way towards the sagging gate that opened on to the deserted street back of the house the years had moved too fast years that had brought the family plane and helicopter leaving the auto to rust in some forgotten place the unused roads to fall into disrepair years that had virtually wiped out the tilling of the soil with the rise of hydroponics years that had brought cheap land with the disappearance of the farm as an economic unit had sent city people scurrying out into the country where each man for less than the price of a city lot might own broad acres years had revolutionized the construction of homes to a point where families simply walked away from their old homes to the new ones that could be bought custommade for less than half the price of a prewar structure and could be changed at small cost to accommodate need of additional space or just a passing whim gramp sniffed houses that could be changed each year like one would shift around the furniture what kind of thing was that he plodded slowly down the dusty path that was all that remained of what a few years before had been a busy residencial street a street of ghosts cramp told himselfof furtive little ghosts that whispered in the night ghosts of playing children ghosts of upset tricycles and canted coaster wagons ghosts of gossiping housewives ghosts of shouted greetings ghosts of flaming fireplaces and chimneys smoking of a winter night little puffs of dust rose around his feet and whitened the cuffs of his trousers there was the old adams place across the way adams had been mighty proud of it he remembered grey field stone front and picture windows now the stone was green with creeping moss and the broken windows gaped with ghastly leer weeds choked the lawn and blotted out the stoop an elm tree was pushing its branches against the gable gramp could remember the day adams had planted that elm tree for a moment he stood there in the grassgrown street feet in the dust both hands clutching the curve of his cane eyes closed through the fog of years he heard the cry of playing children the barking of conrads yapping pooch from down the street and there was adams stripped to the waist plying the shovel scooping out the hole with the elm tree roots wrapped in burlap lying on the lawn may fortyfour years ago just after he and adams had come home from the war together footsteps padded in the dust and gramp startled opened his eyes before him stood a young man a man of thirty perhaps maybe a bit less good morning said gramp i hope said the young man that i didnt startle you you saw me standing here asked gramp like a danged fool with my eyes shut the young man nodded i was remembering said gramp you live around here just down the street the last one in this part of the city perhaps you can help me then try me said gramp the young man stammered well you see its like this im on a sort of well you might call it a sentimental pilgrimage i understand said gramp so am i my name is adams said the young man my grandfather used to live around here somewhere i wonder right over there said gramp together they stood and stared at the house it was a nice place once gramp told him your granddaddy planted that tree right after he came home from the war i was with him all through the war and we came home together that was a day for you its a pity said young adams a pity but gramp didnt seem to hear him your granddaddy he asked i seem to have lost track of him hes dead said young adams quite a number of years ago he was messed up with atomic power said gramp thats right said adams proudly got into it just as soon as it was released to industry right after the moscow agreement right after they decided said gramp they couldnt fight a war thats right said adams its pretty hard to fight a war said gramnp when theres nothing you can aim at you mean the cities said adams sure said granip and theres a funny thing about it wave all the atom bombs you wanted to and you couldnt scare them out but give them cheap land and family planes and they scattered just like so many dadburned rabbits john i webster was striding up the broad stone steps of the city hall when the walking scarecrow carrying a rifle under his arm caught up with him and stopped him howdy mr webster said the scarecrow webster stared then recognition crinkled his face its levi he said how are things going levi levi lewis grinned with snagged teeth fair to middling gardens are coming along and the young rabbits are getting to be good eating you arent getting mixed up in any of the hell raising thats being laid to the houses asked webster no sir declared levi aint none of us squatters mixed up in any wrongdoing were lawabiding godfearing people we are only reason were there is we cant make a living no place else and us living in them places other people up and left aint harming no one police are just blaming us for the thievery and other things thats going on knowing we cant protect ourselves theyre making us the goats im glad to hear that said webster the chief wants to burn the houses if he tries that said levi hell run against something he aint counting on they run us off our farms with this tank farming of theirs but they aint going to run us any farther he spat across the steps wouldnt happen you might have some jingling money on you he asked im fresh out of cartridges and with them rabbits coming up webster thrust his fingers into a vest pocket pulled out a half dollar levi grinned thats obliging of you mr webster ill bring a mess of squirrels come fall the squatter touched his hat with two fingers and retreated down the steps sun glinting on the rifle barrel webster turned up the steps again the city council session already was in full swing when he walked into the chamber police chief jim maxwell was standing by the table and mayor paul carter was talking dont you think you may be acting a bit hastily jim in urging such a course of action with the houses no i dont declared the chief except for a couple of dozen or so none of those houses are occupied by their rightful owners or rather their original owners every one of them belongs to the city now through tax forfeiture and they are nothing but an eyesore and a menace they have no value not even salvage value wood we dont use wood any more plastics are better stone we use steel instead of stone not a single one of those houses have any material of marketable value and in the meantime they are becoming the haunts of petty criminals and undesirable elements grown up with vegetation as the residential sections are they make a perfect hideout for all types of criminals a man commits a crime and heads straight for the houses once there hes safe for i could send a thousand men in there and he could elude them all they arent worth the expense of tearing down and yet they are if not a menace at least a nuisance we should get rid of them and fire is the cheapest quickest way wed use all precautions what about the legal angle asked the mayor i checked into that a man has a right to destroy his own property in any way he may see fit so long as it endangers no one elses the same law i suppose would apply to a municipality alderman thomas griffin sprang to his feet youd alienate a lot of people he declared youd be burning down a lot of old homesteads people still have some sentimental attachments if they cared for them snapped the chief why didnt they pay the taxes and take care of them why did they go running off to the country just leaving the houses standing ask webster here he can tell you what success he had trying to interest the people in their ancestral homes youre talking about that old home week farce said griffin it failed of course it failed webster spread it on so thick that they gagged on it thats what a chamber of commerce mentality always does alderman forrest king spoke up angrily theres nothing wrong with a chamber of commerce griffin simply because you failed in business is no reason griffin ignored him the day of high pressure is over gentlemen the day of high pressure is gone forever ballyhoo is something that is dead and buried the day when you could have tallcorn days or dollar days or dream up some fake celebration and deck the place up with bunting and pull in big crowds that were ready to spend money is past these many years only you fellows dont seem to know it the success of such stunts as that was its appeal to mob psychology and civic loyalty you cant have civic loyalty with a city dying on its feet you cant appeal to mob psychology when there is no mobwhen every man or nearly every man has the solitude of forty acres gentlemen pleaded the mayor gentlemen this is distinctly out of order king sputtered into life walloped the table no lets have it out webster is over there perhaps he can tell us what he thinks webster stirred uncomfortably i scarcely believe he said i have anything to say forget it snapped griffin and sat down but king still stood his face crimson his mouth trembling with anger webster he shouted webster shook his head you came here with one of your big ideas shouted king you were going to lay it before the council step up man and speak your piece webster rose slowly grimlipped perhaps youre too thickskulled he told king to know why i resent the way you have behaved king gasped then exploded thickskulled you would say that to me weve worked together and ive helped you youve never called me that before youve ive never called you that before said webster levelly naturally not i wanted to keep my job well you havent got a job roared king from this minute on you havent got a job shut up said webster king stared at him bewildered as if someone had slapped him across the face and sit down said webster and his voice bit through the room like a sharpedged knife kings knees caved beneath him and he sat down abruptly the silence was brittle i have something to say said webster something that should have been said long ago something all of you should hear that i should be the one who would tell it to you is the one thing that astounds me and yet perhaps as one who has worked in the interests of this city for almost fifteen years i am the logical one to speak the truth alderman griffin said the city is dying on its feet and his statement is correct there is but one fault i would find with it and that is its understatement the city this city any city already is dead the city is an anachronism it has outlived its usefulness hydroponics and the helicopter spelled its downfall in the first instance the city was a tribal place an area where the tribe banded together for mutual protection in later years a wall was thrown around it for additional protection then the wall finally disappeared but the city lived on because of the conveniences which it offered trade and commerce it continued into modern times because people were compelled to live close to their jobs and the jobs were in the city but today that is no longer true with the family plane one hundred miles today is a shorter distance than five miles back in men can fly several hundred miles to work and fly home when the day is done there is no longer any need for them to live cooped up in a city the automobile started the trend and the family plane finished it even in the first part of the century the trend was noticeablea movement away from the city with its taxes its stuffiness a move towards the suburb and closein acreages lack of adequate transportation lack of finances held many to the city but now with tank farming destroying the value of land a man can buy a huge acreage in the country for less than he could a city lot forty years ago with planes powered by atomic there is no longer any transportation problem he paused and the silence held the mayor wore a shocked look kings lips moved but no words came griffin was smiling so what have we asked webster ill tell you what we have street after street block after block of deserted houses houses that the people just up and walked away from why should they have stayed what could the city offer them none of the things that it offered the generations before them for progress has wiped out the need of the citys benefits they lost something some monetary consideration of course when they left the houses but the fact that they could buy a house twice as good for half as much the fact that they could live as they wished to live that they could develop what amounts to family estates after the best tradition set them by the wealthy of a generation agoall these things outweighed the leaving of their homes and what have we left a few blocks of business houses a few acres of industrial plants a city government geared to take care of a million people without the million people a budget that has run the taxes so high that eventually even business houses will move to escape those taxes tax forfeitures that have left us loaded with worthless property thats what we have left if you think any chamber of commerce any ballyhoo any barebrained scheme will give you the answers youre crazy there is only one answer and that is simple the city as a human institution is dead it may struggle on a few more years but that is all mr webster said the mayor but webster paid him no attention but for what happened today he said i would have stayed on and played doll house with you i would have gone on pretending that the city was a going concern would have gone on kidding myself and you but there is gentlemen such a thing as human dignity the icy silence broke down in the rustling of papers the muffled cough of some embarrassed listener but webster was not through the city failed he said and it is well it failed instead of sitting here in mourning above its broken body you should rise to your feet and shout your thanks it failed for if this city had not outlived its usefulness as did every other cityif the cities of the world had not been deserted they would have been destroyed there would have been a war gentleman an atomic war have you forgotten the s and the s have you forgotten waking up at night and listening for the bomb to come knowing that you would not hear it when it came knowing that you would never hear again if it did come but the cities were deserted and industry was dispersed and there were no targets and there was no war some of you gentlemen he said many of you gentlemen are alive today because the people left your city now for gods sake let it stay dead be happy that its dead its the best thing that ever happened in all human history john j webster turned on his heel and left the room outside on the broad stone steps he stopped and stared up at the cloudless sky saw the pigeons wheeling above the turrets and spires of the city hall he shook himself mentally like a dog coming out of a pool he had been a fool of course now hed have to hunt for a job and it might take time to find one he was getting a bit old to be hunting for a job but despite his thoughts a little tune rose unbidden to his bps he walked away briskly lips pursed whistling soundlessly no more hypocrisy no more lying awake nights wondering what to doknowing that the city was dead knowing that what he did was a useless task feeling like a heel for taking a salary that he knew he wasnt earning sensing the strange nagging frustration of a worker who knows his work is nonproductive he strode towards the parking lot heading for his helicopter now maybe he told himself they could move out into the country the way betty wanted to maybe he could spend his evenings tramping land that belonged to him a place with a stream definitely it had to have a stream he could stock with trout he made a mental note to go up into the attic and check his fly equipment martha johnson was waiting at the barnyard gate when the old car chugged down the lane ole got out stiffly face rimmed with weariness sell anything asked martha ole shook his head it aint no use they wont buy farmraised stuff just laughed at me showed me ears of corn twice as big as the ones i had just as sweet and with more even rows showed me melons that had almost no rind at all better tasting too they said he kicked at a clod and it exploded into dust there aint no getting around it be declared tank farming sure has ruined us maybe we better fix to sell the farm suggested martha ole said nothing you could get a job on a tank farm she said harry did likes it real well ole shook his head or maybe a gardener said martha you would make a right smart gardener ritzy folks thats moved out to big estates like to have gardeners to take care of flowers and things more classy than doing it with machines ole shook his head again couldnt stand to mess around with flowers he declared not after raising corn for more than twenty years maybe said martha we could have one of them little planes and running water in the house and a bathtub instead of taking a bath in the old washtub by the kitchen fire couldnt run a plane objected ole sure you could said martha simple to run they are why them anderson kids aint no more than kneehigh to a cricket and they fly one all over one of them got fooling around and fell out once but i got to think about it said ole desperately i got to think he swung away vaulted a fence headed for the fields martha stood beside the car and watched him go one lone tear rolled down her dusty cheek mr taylor is waiting for you said the girl john i webster stammered but i havent been here before he didnt know i was coming mr taylor insisted the girl is waiting for you she nodded her head towards the door it read bureau of human adjustment but i came here to get a job protested webster i didnt come to be adjusted or anything this is the world committees placement service isnt it that is right the girl declared wont you see mr taylor since you insist said webster the girl clicked over a switch spoke into the intercommunicator mr webster is here sir send him in said a voice hat in hand webster walked through the door the man behind the desk had white hair but a young mans face he motioned towards a chair youve been trying to find a job he said yes said webster but please sit down said taylor if youre thinking about that sign on the door forget it well not try to adjust you i couldnt find a job said webster ive hunted for weeks and no one would have me so finally i came here you didnt want to come here no frankly i didnt a placement service it has well it has an implication i do not like taylor smiled the terminology may be unfortunate youre thinking of the employment services of the old days the places where men went when they were desperate for work the government operated places that tried to find work for men so they wouldnt become public charges im desperate enough confessed webster but i still have a pride that made it hard to come but finally there was nothing else to do you see i turned traitor you mean said taylor that you told the truth even when it cost you your job the business world not only here but all over the world is not ready for that truth the businessman still clings to the city myth to the myth of salesmanship in time to come he will realize he doesnt need the city that service and honest values will bring him more substantial business than salesmanship ever did ive wondered webster just what made you do what you did i was sick of it said webster sick of watching men blundering along with their eyes tight shut sick of seeing an old tradition being kept alive when it should have been laid away sick of kings simpering civic enthusiasm when all cause for enthusiasm had vanished taylor nodded webster do you think you could adjust human beings webster merely stared i mean it said taylor the world committee has been doing it for years quietly unobtrusively even many of the people who had been adjusted dont know they have been adjusted changes such as have come since the creation of the world committee out of the old united nations have meant much human maladjustment the advent of workable atomic power took jobs away from hundreds of thousands they had to be trained and guided into new jobs some with the new atomics some into other lines of work the advent of tank farming swept the farmers off their land they perhaps have supplied us with our greatest problem for other than the special knowledge needed to grow crops and handle animals they had no skills most of them had no wish for acquiring skills most of them were bitterly resentful at having been forced from the livelihood which they inherited from their forebears and being natural individualists they offered the toughest psychological problems of any other class many of them declared webster still are at loose ends theres a hundred or more of them squatting out in the houses living from hand to mouth shooting a few rabbits and a few squirrels doing some fishing raising vegetables and picking wild fruit engaging in a little petty thievery now and then and doing occasional begging on the uptown streets you know these people asked taylor i know some of them said webster one of them brings me squirrels and rabbits on occasions to make up for it he bums ammunition money theyd resent being adjusted wouldnt they violently said webster you know a farmer by the name of ole johnson still sticking to his farm still unreconstructed webster nodded what if you tried to adjust him hed run me off the farm said webster men like ole and the squatters said taylor are our special problems now most of the rest of the world is fairly welladjusted fairly well settled into the groove of the present some of them are doing a lot of moaning about the past but thats just for effect you couldnt drive them back to their old ways of life years ago with the advent of industrial atomics in fact the world committee faced a hard decision should changes that spelled progress in the world be brought about gradually to allow the people to adjust themselves naturally or should they be developed as quickly as possible with the committee aiding in the necessary human adjustment it was decided rightly or wrongly that progress should come first regardless of its effect upon the people the decision in the main has proved a wise one we knew of course that in many instances this readjustment could not be made too openly in some cases as in large groups of workers who had been displaced it was possible but in most individual cases such as our friend ole it was not these people must be helped to find themselves in this new world but they must not know that theyre being helped to let them know would destroy confidence and dignity and human dignity is the keystone of any civilization i knew of course about the readjustments made within industry itself said webster but i had not heard of the individual cases we could not advertise it taylor said its practically undercover but why are you telling me all this now because wed like you to come in with us have a hand at adjusting ole to start with maybe see what could be done about the squatters next i dont know said webster wed been waiting for you to come in said taylor we knew youd finally have to come here any chance you might have had at any kind of job would have been queered by king he passed the word along youre blackballed by every chamber of commerce and every civic group in the world today probably i have no choice said webster we didnt want you to feel that way about it taylor said take a while to think it over then come back even if you dont want the job well find you another onein spite of king outside the office webster found a scarecrow figure waiting for him it was levi lewis snaggletoothed grin wiped off rifle under his arm some of the boys said they seen you go in here he explained so i waited for you whats the trouble webster asked for levis face spoke eloquently of trouble its them police said levi he spat disgustedly the police said webster and his heart sank as he said the words for he knew what the trouble was yeah said levi theyre fixing to burn us out so the council finally gave in said webster i just came from police headquarters declared levi i told them they better go easy i told them thered be guts strewed all over the place if they tried it i got the boys posted all around the place with orders not to shoot till theyre sure of hitting you cant do that levi said webster sharply i cant retorted levi i done it already they drove us off the farms forced us to sell because we couldnt make a living and they arent driving us no farther we either stay here or we die here and the only way theyll burn us out is when theres no one left to stop them he shucked up his pants and spat again and we aint the only ones that feel that way be declared gramp is out there with us gramp sure gramp the old guy that lives with you hes sort of taken over as our commanding general says he remembers tricks from the war them police have never heard of he sent some of the boys over to one of them legion halls to swipe a cannon says he knows where we can get some shells for it from the museum says well get it all set up and then send word that if the police make a move well shell the loop look levi will you do something for me sure will mr webster will you go in and ask for a mr taylor insist on seeing him tell him im already on the job sure will but where are you going im going up to the city hall sure you dont want me along no declared webster ill do better alone and levi yes tell gramp to hold up his artillery dont shoot unless he has tobut if he has to lay it on the line the mayor is busy said raymond brown his secretary thats what you think said webster starting for the door you cant go in there webster yelled brown he leaped from his chair came charging around the desk reaching for webster webster swung broadside with his arm caught brown across the chest swept him back against the desk the desk skidded and brown waved his arms lost his balance thudded to the floor webster jerked open the mayors door the mayors feet thumped off his desk i told brown he said webster nodded and brown told me whats the matter carter afraid king might find out i was here afraid of being corrupted by some good ideas what do you want snapped carter i understand the police are going to burn the houses thats right declared the mayor righteously theyre a menace to the community what community look here webster you know theres no community just a few of you lousy politicians who stick around so you can claim residence so you can be sure of being elected every year and drag down your salaries its getting to the point where all you have to do is vote for one another the people who work in the stores and shops even those who do the meanest jobs in the factories dont live inside the city limits the businessmen quit the city long ago they do business here but they arent residents but this is still a city declared the mayor i didnt come to argue that with you said webster i came to try to make you see that youre doing wrong by burning those houses even if you dont realize it the houses are homes to people who have no other homes people who have come to this city to seek sanctuary who have found refuge with us in a measure they are our responsibility theyre not our responsibility gritted the mayor whatever happens to them is their own hard luck we didnt ask them here we dont want them here they contribute nothing to the community youre going to tell me theyre misfits well can i help that youre going to say they cant find jobs and ill tell you they could find jobs if they tried to find them theres work to be done theres always work to be done theyve been filled up with this new world talk and they figure its up to someone to find the place that suits them and the job that suits them you sound like a rugged individualist said webster you say that like you think its funny yapped the mayor i do think its funny said webster funny and tragic that anyone should think that way today the world would be a lot better off with some rugged individualism snapped the mayor look at the men who have gone places meaning yourself asked webster you might take me for example carter agreed i worked hard i took advantage of opportunity i had some foresight i did you mean you licked the correct boots and stepped in the proper faces said webster youre the shining example of the kind of people the world doesnt want today you positively smell musty your ideas are so old youre the last of the politicians carter just as i was the last of the chamber of commerce secretaries only you dont know it yet i did i got out even when it cost me something i got out because i had to save my selfrespect your kind of politics is dead they are dead because any tinhorn with a loud mouth and a brassy front could gain power by appeal to mob psychology and you havent got mob psychology any more you cant have mob psychology when people dont give a damn what happens to a thing thats dead alreadya political system that broke down under its own weight get out of here screamed carter get out before i have the cops come and throw you out you forget said webster that i came in to talk about the houses it wont do you any good snarled carter you can stand and talk till doomsday for all the good it does those houses burn thats final how would you like to see the loop a mass of rubbish asked webster your comparison said carter is grotesque i wasnt talking about comparisons said webster you werent the mayor stared at him what were you talking about then only this said webster the second the first torch touches the houses the first shell will land on the city hall and the second one will hit the first national theyll go on down the line the biggest targets first carter gaped then a flush of anger crawled from his throat up into his face it wont work webster he snapped you cant bluff me any cockandbull story like that its no cockandbull story declared webster those men have cannon out there pieces from in front of legion halls from the museums and they have men who know how to work them they wouldnt need them really its practically pointblank range like shooting the broadside of a barn carter reached for the radio but webster stopped him with an upraised hand better think a minute carter before you go flying off the handle youre on a spot go ahead with your plan and you have a battle on your hands the houses may burn but the loop is wrecked the business men will have your scalp for that carters hand retreated from the radio from far away came the sharp crack of a rifle better call them off warned webster carters face twisted with indecision another rifle shot another and another pretty soon said webster it will have gone too far so far that you cant stop it a thudding blast rattled the windows of the room carter leaped from his chair webster felt suddenly cold and weak but he fought to keep his face straight and his voice calm carter was staring out of the window like a man of stone im afraid said webster that its gone too far already the radio on the desk chirped insistently red light flashing carter reached out a trembling hand and snapped it on carter a voice was saying carter carter webster recognized that voicethe bullthroated tone of police chief jim maxwell what is it asked carter they had a big gun said maxwell it exploded when they tried to fire it ammunition no good i guess one gun asked carter only one gun i dont see any others i heard rifle fire said carter yeah they did some shooting at us wounded a couple of the boys but theyve pulled back now deeper into the brush no shooting now ok said carter go ahead and start the fires webster started forward ask him ask him but carter clicked the switch and the radio went dead what was it you wanted to ask nothing said webster nothing that amounted to anything he couldnt tell carter that gramp had been the one who knew about firing big guns couldnt tell him that when the gun exploded gramp had been there hed have to get out of here get over to the gun as quickly as possible it was a good bluff webster carter was saying a good bluff but it petered out the mayor turned to the window that faced towards the houses no more firing he said they gave up quick youll be lucky snapped webster if six of your policemen come back alive those men with the rifles are out in the brush and they can pick the eye out of a squirrel at a hundred yards feet pounded in the corridor outside two pairs of feet racing towards the door the mayor whirled from his window and webster pivoted around gramp he yelled hi johnny puffed gramp skidding to a stop the man behind gramp was a young man and he was waving something in his handa sheaf of papers that rustled as he waved them what do you want asked the mayor plenty said gramp he stood for a moment catching back his breath and said between puffs meet my friend henry adams adams asked the mayor sure said gramp his granddaddy used to live here out on twentyseventh street oh said the mayor and it was as if someone had smacked him with a brick oh you mean f j adams bet your boots said gramp him and me we were in the war together used to keep me awake nights telling me about his boy back home carter nodded to henry adams as mayor of the city he said trying to regain some of his dignity i welcome you to its not a particularly fitting welcome adams said i understand you are burning my property your property the mayor choked and his eyes stared in disbelief at the sheaf of papers adams waved at him yeah his property shrilled gramp he just bought it we just come from the treasurers office paid all the back taxes and penalties and all the other things you legal thieves thought up to slap against them houses but but the mayor was grasping for words gasping for breath not all of it perhaps just the old adams property lock stock and barrel said gramp triumphantly and now said adams to the mayor if you would kindly tell your men to stop destroying my property carter bent over the desk and fumbled at the radio his hands suddenly all thumbs maxwell he shouted maxwell maxwell what do you want maxwell yelled back stop setting those fires yelled carter start putting them out call out the fire department do anything but stop those fires cripes said maxwell i wish youd make up your mind you do what i tell you screamed the mayor you put out those fires all right said maxwell all right keep your shirt on but the boys wont like it they wont like getting shot at to do something you changed your mind about carter straightened from the radio let me assure you mr adams he said that this is all a big mistake it is adams declared solemnly a very great mistake mayor the biggest one you ever made for a moment the two of them stood there looking across the room at one another tomorrow said adams i shall file a petition with the courts asking dissolution of the city charter as owner of the greatest portion of the land included in the corporate limits both from the standpoint of area and valuation i understand i have a perfect legal right to do that the mayor gulped finally brought out some words upon what grounds he asked upon the grounds said adams that there is no further need of it i do not believe i shall have too hard a time to prove my case but but that means yeah said gramp you know what it means it means you are out right on your car a park said gramp waving his arm over the wilderness that once had been the residential section of the city a park so that people can remember how their old folks lived the three of them stood on tower hill with the rusty old water tower looming above them its sturdy steel legs planted in a sea of waisthigh grass not a park exactly explained henry adams a memorial rather a memorial to an era of communal life that will be forgotten in another hundred years a preservation of a number of peculiar types of construction that arose to suit certain conditions and each mans particular tastes no slavery to any architectural concepts but an effort made to achieve better living in another hundred years men will walk through those houses down there with the same feeling of respect and awe they have when they go into a museum today it will be to them something out of what amounts to a primeval age a steppingstone on the way to the better fuller life artists will spend their lives transferring those old houses to their canvases writers of historical novels will come here for the breath of authenticity but you said you meant to restore all the houses make the lawns and gardens exactly like they were before said webster that will take a fortune and after that another fortune to keep them in shape i have too much money said adams entirely too much money remember my grandfather and father got into atomics on the ground floor best crap player i ever knew your granddaddy was said gramp used to take me for a cleaning every pay day in the old days said adams when a man had too much money there were other things he could do with it organized charities for example or medical research or something like that but there are no organized charities today not enough business to keep them going and since the world committee has hit its stride there is ample money for all the research medical or otherwise anyone might wish to do i didnt plan this thing when i came back to see my grandfathers old house just wanted to see it that was all hed told me so much about it how be planted the tree in the front lawn and the rose garden he had out back and then i saw it and it was a mocking ghost it was something that had been left behind something that had meant a lot to someone and had been left behind standing there in front of that house with gramp that day it came to me that i could do nothing better than preserve for posterity a cross section of the life their ancestors lived a thin blue thread of smoke rose above the trees far below webster pointed to it what about them the squatters stay said adams if they want to there will be plenty of work for them to do and therell always be a house or two that they can have to live in theres just one thing that bothers me i cant be here all the time myself ill need someone to manage the project itll be a lifelong job he looked at webster go ahead johnny said gramp webster shook his head bettys got her heart set on that place out in the country you wouldnt have to stay here said adams you could fly in every day from the foot of the hill came a hail its ole yelled gramp he waved his cane hi ole come on up they watched ole striding up the hill waiting for him silently wanted to talk to you johnny said ole got an idea waked me out of a sound sleep last night go ahead said webster ole glanced at adams hes all right said webster hes henry adams maybe you remember his grandfather old f j i remember him said ole nuts about atomic power he was how did he make out he made out rather well said adams glad to hear that ole said guess i was wrong said he never would amount to nothing daydreamed all the time how about that idea webster asked you heard about dude ranches aint you ole asked webster nodded place said ole where people used to go and pretend they were cowboys pleased them because they really didnt know all the hard work there was in ranching and figured it was romanticlike to ride horses and look asked webster you arent figuring on turning your farm into a dude ranch are you nope said ole not a dude ranch dude farm maybe folks dont know too much about farms any more since there aint hardly no farms and theyll read about the frost being on the pumpkin and how pretty a webster stared at ole theyd go for it ole be declared theyd kill one another in the rush to spend their vacation on a real honesttogod oldtime farm out of a clump of bushes down the hillside burst a shining thing that chattered and gurgled and screeched blades flashing a cranelike arm waving what the asked adams its that dadburned lawn mower yelped gramp i always knew the day would come when it would strip a gear and go completely off its nut notes on the second tale still alien by all other standards the second tale strikes a more familiar note than did the first here for the first time the reader gains an impression that this tale might have been born about a doggish campfire a situation unthinkable so far as the first tale is concerned here is voiced some of the high moral and ethical concepts which the dogs have come to value here too is a struggle which a dog can understand even though the struggle does reveal the mental and moral deterioration of its central character for the first time too a character emerges which has a familiar ringthe robot in the robot jenkins first introduced in this story one comes to know a character which for thousands of years has been a puppish favourite jenkins is regarded by tige as the real hero of the legend in him he sees an extension of mans influence beyond the day of mans disappearance a mechanical device by which human thought continued to guide the dogs long after man himself was gone we still have our robots valuable and lovable little contraptions that exist for one purpose onlyto furnish us with hands throughout the years however a dogs robot has become so much a part of him that no dog now regards his robot as a thing apart tiges insistence that the robot is an invention of man a heritage that our race carries forward from man has been sturdily attacked by most other students of the legend the idea that the robot may have been fashioned and given to the dogs as an aid to the development of their culture bounce believes is an idea which must be summarily ruled out by the very virtue of its romanticism it is he contends a story device on the face of it and as such must necessarily be suspect from the first there is no way now of knowing how the dogs evolved a robot those few scholars who have given some time to a study of the development of robotry point out that the highly specialized use to which the robot is put does indeed argue that it was invented by a dog to be so specialized they argue the robot must necessarily have been invented and developed by the race for whose particular use it is so singularly fitted no one other than a dog they contend could have done so good a job on so intricate a tool to say that no dog today could build a robot is begging the question no dog today could build a robot because there is no need to build one since the robots build themselves when there was a need it is quite evident that a dog did build a robot and by building a robot endowed with the reproductive urge which resulted in his building others like himself solved the problem in a typically doggish manner in this story likewise is introduced an idea which runs through the rest of the legend and which for long has puzzled all students and most readers that is the idea that one may move physically off this world out into space crossing it to reach other worlds while the idea in most part has been regarded as pure fantasy which of course has its proper place in any legend a good deal of study has been devoted to it most studies have confirmed the belief that such a thing is impossible such a belief would argue that the stars which we see at night are mighty worlds at great distances from our worlds everyone knows of course that they are only lights hanging in the sky and that most of them are very near to us bounce advances what may be the best explanation for the origin of the acrossspace world idea it is he says no more than an ancient storytellers twist on the cobbly worlds the existence of which the dogs have known since dim antiquity huddling place the drizzle sifted from the leaden skies like smoke drifting through the barebranched trees it softened the hedges and hazed the outlines of the buildings and blotted out the distance it glinted on the metallic skins of the silent robots and silvered the shoulders of the three humans listening to the intonations of the blackgarbed man who read from the book cupped between his hands for i am the resurrection and the life the mossmellowed graven figure that reared above the door of the crypt seemed straining upwards every crystal of its yearning body reaching towards something that no one else could see straining as it had strained since that day of long ago when men had chipped it from the granite to adorn the family tomb with a symbolism that had pleased the first john j webster in the last years he held of life and whosoever liveth and believeth in me jerome a webster felt his sons fingers tighten on his arm heard the muffled sobbing of his mother saw the lines of robots standing rigid heads bowed in respect to the master they had served the master who now was going hometo the final home of all numbly jerome a webster wondered if they understoodif they understood life and deathif they understood what it meant that nelson f webster lay there in the casket that a man with a book intoned words above him nelson f webster fourth of the line of websters who had lived on these acres had lived and died here scarcely leaving and now was going to his final rest in that place the first of them had prepared for the rest of themfor that long line of shadowy descendants who would live here and cherish the things and the ways and the life that the first john j webster had established jerome a webster felt his jaw muscles tighten felt a little tremor run across his body for a moment his eyes burned and the casket blurred in his sight and the words the man in black was saying were one with the wind that whispered in the pines standing sentinel for the dead within his brain remembrance marchedremembrance of a greyhaired man stalking the hills and fields sniffing the breeze of an early morning standing legs braced before the flaring fireplace with a glass of brandy in his hand pridethe pride of land and life and the humility and greatness that quiet living breeds within a man contentment of casual leisure and surety of purpose independence of assured security comfort of familiar surroundings freedom of broad acres thomas webster was joggling his elbow father he was whispering father the service was over the blackgarbed man had closed his book six robots stepped forward lifted the casket slowly the three followed the casket into the crypt stood silently as the robots slid it into its receptacle closed the tiny door and affixed the plate that read nelson f webster that was all just the name and dates and that jerome a webster found himself thinking was enough there was nothing else that needed to be there that was all those others had the ones that called the family rollstarting with william stevens gramp stevens they had called him webster remembered father of the wife of that first john j webster who was here himselfl and after him his son charles f webster and his son john j ii webster could remember john j iia grandfather who had slept beside the fire with his pipe hanging from his mouth eternally threatening to set is whiskers aflame websters eyes strayed to another plate mary webster the mother of the boy here at his side and yet not a boy he kept forgetting that thomas was twenty now in a week or so would be leaving for mars even as in his younger days he too had gone to mars all here together he told himself the websters and their wives and children here in death together as they had lived together sleeping in the pride and security of bronze and marble with the pines outside and the symbolic figure above the agegreened door the robots were waiting standing silently their task fulfilled his mother looked at him youre head of the family now my son she told him he reached out and hugged her close against his side head of the familywhat was left of it just the three of them now his mother and his son and his son would be leaving soon going out to mars but he would come back come back with a wife perhaps and the family would go on the family wouldnt stay at three most of the big house wouldnt stay closed off as it now was closed off there had been a time when it had rung with the life of a dozen units of the family living in their separate apartments under one big roof that time he knew would come again the three of them turned and left the crypt took the path back to the house looming like a huge grey shadow in the mist a fire blazed in the hearth and the book lay upon his desk jerome a webster reached out and picked it up read the title once again martian physiology with especial reference to the brain by jerome a webster md thick and authoritativethe work of a lifetime standing almost alone in its field based upon the data gathered during those five plague years on marsyears when he had laboured almost day and night with his fellow colleagues of the world committees medical commission dispatched on an errand of mercy to the neighbouring planet a tap sounded on the door come in he called the door opened and a robot glided in your whisky sir thank you jenkins webster said the minister sir said jenkins has left oh yes i presume that you took care of him i did sir gave him the usual fee and offered him a drink he refused the drink that was a social error webster told him ministers dont drink im sorry sir i didnt know he asked me to ask you to come to church sometime i told him sir that you never went anywhere that was quite right jenkins said webster none of us ever go anywhere jenkins headed for the door stopped before he got there turned around if i may say so sir that was a touching service at the crypt your father was a fine human the finest ever was the robots were saying the service was very fitting dignified like sir he would have liked it had he known my father said webster would be even more pleased to hear you say that jenkins thank you sir said jenkins and went out webster sat with the whisky and the book and the firefelt the comfort of the wellknown room close in about him felt the refuge that was in it this was home it had been home for the websters since that day when the first john j had come here and built the first unit of the sprawling house john j had chosen it because it had a trout stream or so he always said but it was something more than that it must have been webster told himself something more than that perhaps at first it had only been the trout stream the trout stream and the trees and meadows the rocky ridge where the mist drifted in each morning from the river maybe the rest of it had grown grown gradually through the years through years of family association until the very soil was soaked with something that approached but wasnt quite tradition something that made each tree each rock each foot of soil a webster tree or rock or clod of soil it all belonged john j the first john j had come after the breakup of the cities after men had forsaken once and for all the twentieth century huddling places had broken free of the tribal instinct to stick together in one cave or in one clearing against a common foe or a common fear an instinct that had become outmoded for there were no fears or foes man revolting against the herd instinct economic and social conditions had impressed upon him in ages past a new security and a new sufficiency had made it possible to break away the trend had started back in the twentieth century more than two hundred years before when men moved to country homes to get fresh air and elbow room and a graciousness in life that communal existence in its strictest sense never had given them and here was the end result a quiet living a peace that could only come with good things the sort of life that men had yearned for years to have a manorial existence based on old family homes and leisurely acres with atomics supplying power and robots in place of serfs webster smiled at the fireplace with its blazing wood that was an anachronism but a good onesomething that man had brought forward from the caves useless because atomic heating was betterbut more pleasant one couldnt sit and watch atomics and dream and build castles in the flames even the crypt out there where they had put his father that afternoon that was family too all of a piece with the rest of it the sombre pride and leisured life and peace in the old days the dead were buried in vast plots all together stranger cheek by jowl with stranger he never goes anywhere that is what jenkins had told the minister and that was right for what need was there to go anywhere it all was here by simply twirling a dial one could talk face to face with anyone one wished could go by sense if not in body anywhere one wished could attend the theatre or hear a concert or browse in a library halfway around the world could transact any business one might need to transact without rising from ones chair webster drank the whisky then swung to the dialled machine beside his desk he spun dials from memory without resorting to the log he knew where he was going his finger flipped a toggle and the room melted awayor seemed to melt there was left the chair within which he sat part of the desk part of the machine itself and that was all the chair was on a hillside swept with golden grass and dotted with scraggly windtwisted trees a hillside that straggled down to a lake nestling in the grip of purple mountain spurs the spurs darkened in long streaks with the bluishgreens of distant pine climbed in staggering stairs melting into the bluetinged snowcapped peaks that reared beyond and above them in jagged sawtoothed outline the wind talked harshly in the crouching trees and ripped the long grass in sudden gusts the last rays of the sun struck fire from the distant peaks solitude and grandeur the long sweep of tumbled land the cuddled lake the knifelike shadows on the faroff ranges webster sat easily in his chair eyes squinting at the peaks a voice said almost at his shoulder may i come in a soft sibilant voice wholly unhuman but one that webster knew he nodded his head by all means juwain he turned slightly and saw the elaborate crouching pedestal the furry softeyed figure of the martian squatting on it other alien furniture loomed indistinctly beyond the pedestal half guessed furniture from that dwelling out on mars the martian flipped a furry hand towards the mountain range you love this he said you can understand it and i can understand how you understand it but to me there is more terror than beauty in it it is something we could never have on mars webster reached out a hand but the martian stopped him leave it on he said i know why you came here i would not have come at a time like this except i thought perhaps an old friend it is kind of you said webster i am glad that you have come your father said juwain was a great man i remember how you used to talk to me of him those years you spent on mars you said then you would come back sometime why is it youve never come why said webster i just never do not tell me said the martian i already know my son said webster is going to mars in a few days i shall have him call on you that would be a pleasure said juwain i shall be expecting him he stirred uneasily on the crouching pedestal perhaps he carries on tradition no said webster he is studying engineering he never cared for surgery he has a right observed the martian to follow the life that he has chosen still one might be permitted to wish one could webster agreed but that is over and done with perhaps he will be a great engineer space structure talks of ships out to the stars perhaps suggested juwain your family has done enough for medical science you and your father and his father said webster before him your book declared juwain has put mars in debt to you it may focus more attention on martian specialization my people do not make good doctors they have no background for it queer how the minds of races run queer that mars never thought of medicineliterally never thought of it supplied the need with a cult of fatalism while even in your early history when men still lived in caves there are many things said webster that you thought of and we didnt things we wonder now how we ever missed abilities that you developed and we do not have take your own speciality philosophy but different than ours a science while ours never was more than ordered fumbling yours an orderly logical development of philosophy workable practical applicable an actual tool juwain started to speak hesitated then went ahead i am near to something something that may be new and startling something that will be a tool for you humans as well as for the martians ive worked on it for years starting with certain mental concepts that first were suggested to me with arrival of the earthmen i have said nothing for i could not be sure and now suggested webster you are sure not quite said juwain not positive but almost they sat in silence watching the mountains and the lake a bird came and sat in one of the scraggly trees and sang dark clouds piled up behind the mountain ranges and the snowtipped peaks stood out like graven stone the sun sank in a lake of crimson hushed finally to the glow of a fire burned low a tap sounded from a door and webster stirred in his chair suddenly brought back to the reality of the study of the chair beneath him juwain was gone the old philosopher had come and sat an hour of contemplation with his friend and then had quietly slipped away the rap came again webster leaned forward snapped the toggle and the mountains vanished the room became a room again dusk filtered through the high windows and the fire was a rosy flicker in the ashes come in said webster jenkins opened the door dinner is served sir he said thank you said webster he rose slowly from the chair your place sir said jenkins is laid at the head of the table ah yes said webster thank you jenkins thank you very much for reminding me webster stood on the broad ramp of the space field and watched the shape that dwindled in the sky with faint flickering points of red lancing through the wintry sunlight for long minutes after the shape was gone he stood there hands gripping the railing in front of him eyes still staring up into the sky his lips moved and they said goodbye son but there was no sound slowly he came alive to his surroundings knew that people moved about the ramp saw that the landing field seemed to stretch interminably to the far horizon dotted here and there with humpbacked things that were waiting spaceships scooting tractors worked near one hangar clearing away the last of the snowfall of the night before webster shivered and thought that it was queer for the noonday sun was warm and shivered again slowly he turned away from the railing and headed for the administration building and for one brainwrenching moment he felt a sudden fearan unreasonable and embarrassing fear of that stretch of concrete that formed the ramp a fear that left him shaking mentally as he drove his feet towards the waiting door a man walked towards him briefcase swinging in his hand and webster eyeing him wished fervently that the man would not speak to him the man did not speak passed him with scarcely a glance and webster felt relief if he were back home webster told himself he would have finished lunch would now be ready to lie down for his midday nap the fire would be blazing on the hearth and the flicker of the flames would be reflected from the andirons jenkins would bring him a liqueur and would say a word or twoinconsequential conversation he hurried towards the door quickening his step anxious to get away from the barecold expanse of the massive ramp funny how he had felt about thomas natural of course that he should have hated to see him go but entirely unnatural that he should in those last few minutes find such horror welling up within him horror of the trip through space horror of the alien land of marsalthough mars was scarcely alien any longer for more than a century now earthmen had known it had fought it lived with it some of them had even grown to love it but it had only been utter will power that had prevented him in those last few seconds before the ship had taken off from running out into the field shrieking for thomas to come back shrieking for him not to go and that of course never would have done it would have been exhibitionism disgraceful and humiliatingthe sort of a thing a webster could not do after all he told himself a trip to mars was no great adventure not any longer there had been a day when it had been but that day was gone for ever he himself in his earlier days had a made a trip to mars had stayed there for five long years that had beenhe gasped when he thought of itthat had been almost thirty years ago the babble and hum of the lobby hit him in the face as the robot attendant opened the door for him and in that babble ran a vein of something that was almost terror for a moment he hesitated then stepped inside the door closed softly behind him he stayed close to the wall to keep out of peoples way headed for a chair in one corner he sat down and huddled back forcing his body deep into the cushions watching the milling humanity that seethed out in the room shrill people hurrying people people with strange unneighbourly faces strangersevery one of them not a face he knew people going places heading out for the planets anxious to be off worried about last details rushing here and there out of the crowd loomed a familiar face webster hunched forward jenkins he shouted and then was sorry for the shout although no one seemed to notice the robot moved towards him stood before him tell raymond said webster that i must return immediately tell him to bring the copter in front at once i am sorry sir said jenkins but we cannot leave at once the mechanics found a flaw in the atomics chamber they are installing a new one it will take several hours surely said webster impatiently that could wait until some other time the mechanic said not sir jenkins told him it might go at any minute the entire charge of power yes yes agreed webster i suppose so he fidgeted with his hat i just remembered be said something i must do something that must be done at once i must get home i cant wait several hours he hitched forward to the edge of the chair eyes staring at the milling crowd facesfacesperhaps you could televise suggested jenkins one of the robots might be able to do it there is a booth wait jenkins said webster he hesitated a moment there is nothing to do back home nothing at all but i must get there i cant stay here if i have to ill go crazy i was frightened out there on the ramp im bewildered and confused here i have a feelinga strange terrible feeling jenkins i i understand sir said jenkins your father had it too webster gasped my father yes sir that is why he never went anywhere he was about your age sir when he found it out he tried to make a trip to europe and he couldnt he got halfway there and turned back he had a name for it webster sat in stricken silence a name for it he finally said of course theres a name for it my father had it my grandfatherdid he have it too i wouldnt know that sir said jenkins i wasnt created until after your grandfather was an elderly man but he may have he never went anywhere either you understand then said webster you know how it is i feel like im going to be sickphysically ill see if you can charter a copteranything just so we get home yes sir said jenkins he started off and webster called him back jenkins does anyone else know about this anyone no sir said jenkins your father never mentioned it and i felt somehow that he wouldnt wish me to thank you jenkins said webster webster huddled back into his chair again feeling desolate and alone and misplaced alone in a humming lobby that pulsed with lifea loneliness that tore at him that left him limp and weak homesickness downright shameful homesickness he told himself something that boys are supposed to feel when they first leave home when they first go out to meet the world there was a fancy word for itagoraphobia the morbid dread of being in the midst of open spacesfrom the greek root for the fearliterally of the market place if he crossed the room to the television booth he could put in a call talk with his mother or one of the robotsor better yet just sit and look at the place until jenkins came for him he started to rise then sank back in the chair again it was no dice just talking to someone or looking in on the place wasnt being there he couldnt smell the pines in the wintry air or hear familiar snow crunch on the walk beneath his feet or reach out a hand and touch one of the massive oaks that grew along the path he couldnt feel the heat of the fire or sense the sure deft touch of belonging of being one with a tract of ground and the things upon it and yetperhaps it would help not much maybe but some he started to rise from the chair again and froze the few short steps to the booth held terror a terrible overwhelming terror if he crossed them he would have to run run to escape the watching eyes the unfamiliar sounds the agonizing nearness of strange faces abruptly he sat down a womans shrill voice cut across the lobby and he shrank away from it he felt terrible he felt like hell he wished jenkins would get a hustle on the first breath of spring came through the window filling the study with the promise of melting snows of coming leaves and flowers of northbound wedges of waterfowl streaming through the blue of trout that lurked in pools waiting for the fly webster lifted his eyes from the sheaf of papers on his desk sniffed the breeze felt the cool whisper of it on his cheek his hand reached out for the brandy glass found it empty and put it back he bent back above the papers once again picked up a pencil and crossed out a word critically he read the final paragraphs the fact that of the two hundred and fifty men who were invited to visit me presumably on missions of more than ordinary importance only three were able to come does not necessarily prove that all but those three are victims of agoraphobia some may have had legitimate reasons for being unable to accept my invitation but it does indicate a growing unwillingness of men living under the mode of earth existence set up following the breakup of the cities to move from familiar places a deepening instinct to stay among the scenes and possessions which in their mind have become associated with contentment and graciousness of life what the result of such a trend will be no one can clearly indicate since it applies to only a small portion of earths population among the larger families economic pressure forces some of the sons to seek their fortunes either in other parts of the earth or on one of the other planets many others deliberately seek adventure and opportunity in space while still others become associated with professions or trades which made a sedentary existence impossible he flipped the page over went on to the last one it was a good paper he knew but it could not be published not just yet perhaps after he had died no one so far as he could determine had ever so much as realized the trend had taken as matter of course the fact that men seldom left their homes why after all should they leave their homes certain dangers may be recognized in the televisor muttered at his elbow and he reached out to flip the toggle the room faded and he was face to face with a man who sat behind a desk almost as if he sat on the opposite side of websters desk a greyhaired man with sad eyes behind heavy lenses for a moment webster stared memory tugging at him could it be he asked and the man smiled gravely i have changed he said so have you my name is clayborne remember the martian medical commission clayborne id often thought of you you stayed on mars clayborne nodded ive read your book doctor it is a real contribution ive often thought one should be written wanted to myself but i didnt have the time just as well i didnt you did a better job especially on the brain the martian brain webster told him always intrigued me certain peculiarities im afraid i spent more of those five years taking notes on it than i should have there was other work to do a good thing you did said clayborne thats why im calling you now i have a patienta brain operation only you can handle it webster gasped his hands trembling youll bring him here clayborne shook his head he cannot be moved you know him i believe juwain the philosopher juwain said webster hes one of my best friends we talked together just a couple of days ago the attack was sudden said clayborne hes been asking for you webster was silent and coldcold with a chill that crept upon him from some unguessed place cold that sent perspiration out upon his forehead that knotted his fists if you start immediately said clayborn you can be here on time ive already arranged with the world committee to have a ship at your disposal instantly the utmost speed is necessary but said webster but i cannot come you cant come its impossible said webster i doubt in any case that i am needed surely you yourself i cant said clayborne no one can but you no one else has the knowledge you hold juwains life in your hands if you come he lives if you dont he dies i cant go into space said webster anyone can go into space snapped clayborne its not like it used to be conditioning of any sort desired is available but you dont understand pleaded webster you no i dont said clayborne frankly i dont that anyone should refuse to save the life of his friend the two men stared at one another for a long moment neither speaking i shall tell the committee to send the ship straight to your home said clayborne finally i hope by that time you will see your way clear to come clayborne faded and the wall came into view againthe wall and books the fireplace and the paintings the wellloved furniture the promise of spring that came through the open window webster sat frozen in his chair staring at the wall in front of him juwain the furry wrinkled face the sibilant whisper the friendliness and understanding that was his juwain grasping the stuff that dreams are made of and shaping them into logic into rules of life and conduct juwain using philosophy as a tool as a science as a stepping stone to better living webster dropped his face into his hands and fought the agony that welled up within him clayborne had not understood one could not expect him to understand since there was no way for him to know and even knowing would he understand even he webster would not have understood it in someone else until he bad discovered it in himselfthe terrible fear of leaving his own fire his own land his own possessions the little symbolisms that he had erected and yet not he himself alone but those other websters as well starting with the first john j men and women who had setup a cult of life a tradition of behaviour he jerome a webster had gone to mars when he was a young man and had not felt or suspected the psychological poison that ran through his veins even as thomas a few months ago had gone to mars but thirty years of quiet life here in the retreat that the websters called a home had brought it forth had developed it without his even knowing it there had in fact been no opportunity to know it it was clear how it had developedclear as crystal now habit and mental pattern and a happiness association with certain thingsthings that had no actual value in themselves but had been assigned a value a definite concrete value by one family through five generations no wonder other places seemed alien no wonder other horizons held a hint of horror in their sweep and there was nothing one could do about itnothing that is unless one cut down every tree and burned the house and changed the course of waterways even that might not do iteven that the televisor purred and webster lifted his head from his hands reached out and thumbed the tumbler the room became a flare of white but there was no image a voice said secret call secret call webster slid back a panel in the machine spun a pair of dials heard the hum of power surge into a screen that blocked out the room secrecy established he said the white flare snapped out and a man sat across the desk from him a man be had seen many times before in televised addresses in his daily paper henderson president of the world committee i have had a call from clayborne said henderson webster nodded without speaking he tells me you refuse to go to mars i have not refused said webster when clayborne cut off the question was left open i had told him it was impossible for me to go but he had rejected that did not seem to understand webster you must go said henderson you are the only man with the necessary knowledge of the martian brain to perform this operation if it were a simple operation perhaps someone else could do it but not one such as this that may be true said webster but its not just a question of saving a life said henderson even the life of so distinguished a personage as juwain it involves even more than that juwain is a friend of yours perhaps he hinted of something he has found yes said webster yes he did a new concept of philosophy a concept declared henderson that we cannot do without a concept that will remake the solar system that will put mankind ahead a hundred thousand years in the space of two generations a new direction of purpose that will aim towards a goal we heretofore bad not suspected bad not even known existed a brand new truth you see one that never before had occurred to anyone websters hands gripped the edge of the desk until his knuckles stood out white if juwain dies said henderson that concept dies with him may be lost forever ill try said webster ill try hendersons eyes were hard is that the best that you can do that is the best said webster but man you must have a reason some explanation none said webster that i would care to give deliberately he reached out and flipped up the switch webster sat at the desk and held his hands in front of him staring at them hands that had skill held knowledge hands that could save a life if he could get them to mars hands that could save for the solar system for mankind for the martians an ideaa new ideathat would advance them a hundred thousand years in the next two generations but hands chained by a phobia that grew out of this quiet life decadencea strangely beautifuland deadlydecadence man had forsaken the teeming cities the huddling places two hundred years ago he had done with the old foes and the ancient fears that kept him around the common camp fire had left behind the hobgoblins that had walked with him from the caves and yetand yet here was another huddling place not a huddling place for ones body but ones mind a psychological campfire that still held a man within the circle of its light still webster knew he must leave that fire as the men had done with the cities two centuries before he must walk off and leave it and he must not look back he had to go to marsor at least start for mars there was no question there at all he had to go whether he would survive the trip whether he could perform the operation once he had arrived he did not know he wondered vaguely whether agoraphobia could be fatal in its most exaggerated form he supposed it could he reached out a hand to ring then hesitated no use having jenkins pack he would do it himselfsomething to keep him busy until the ship arrived from the top shelf of the wardrobe in the bedroom he took down a bag and saw that it was dusty he blew on it but the dust still clung it had been there for too many years as he packed the room argued with him talked in that mute tongue with which inanimate but familiar things may converse with a man you cant go said the room you cant go off and leave me and webster argued back half pleading half explanatory i have to go cant you understand its a friend an old friend i will be coming back packing done webster returned to the study slumped into his chair he must go and yet he couldnt go but when the ship arrived when the time had come he knew that he would walk out of the house and towards the waiting ship he steeled his mind to that tried to set it in a rigid pattern tried to blank out everything but the thought that he was leaving things in the room intruded on his brain as if they were part of a conspiracy to keep them there things that he saw as if he were seeing them for the first time old remembered things that suddenly were new the chronometer that showed both earthian and martian time the days of the month the phases of the moon the picture of his dead wife on the desk the trophy he had won at prep school the framed short snorter bill that had cost him ten bucks on his trip to mars he stared at them half unwilling at first then eagerly storing up the memory of them in his brain seeing them as separate components of a room he had accepted all these years as a finished whole never realizing what a multitude of things went to make it up dusk was falling the dusk of early spring a dusk that smelled of early pussy willows the ship should have arrived long ago he caught himself listening for it even as he realized that he would not hear it a ship driven by atomic motors was silent except when it gathered speed landing and taking off it floated like thistledown with not a murmur in it it would be here soon it would have to be here soon or he could never go much longer to wait he knew and his highkeyed resolution would crumble like a mound of dust in beating rain not much longer could he hold his purpose against the pleading of the room against the flicker of the fire against the murmur of the land where five generations of websters had lived their lives and died he shut his eyes and fought down the chill that crept across his body he couldnt let it get him now he told himself he had to stick it out when the ship arrived he still must be able to get up and walk out of the door to the waiting port a tap came on the door come in webster called it was jenkins the light from the fireplace flickering on his shining metal hide had you called earlier sir he asked webster shook his bead i was afraid you might have jenkins explained and wondered why i didnt come there was a most extraordinary occurrence sir two men came with a ship and said they wanted you to go to mars they are here said webster why didnt you call me he struggled to his feet i didnt think sir said jenkins that you would want to be bothered it was so preposterous i finally made them understand you could not possibly want to go to mars webster stiffened felt chill fear gripping at his heart hands groping for the edge of the desk he sat down in the chair sensed the walls of the room closing in about him a trap that would never let him go notes on the third tale to the thousands of readers who love this tale it is distinguished as the one in which the dogs first appear to the student it is much more than that basically it is a tale of guilt and futility here the breakdown of the human race continues with man assaulted by a sense of guilt and plagued by the instability which results in the human mutants the tale attempts to rationalize the mutations attempts even to explain the dogs as modifications of the primordial strain no race the story says can become improved if there are no mutations but there is no word concerning the need of a certain static factor in society to ensure stability throughout the legend it becomes abundantly clear that the human race placed little value upon stability tige who has combed the legend to bolster up contention that the tales actually are human in their origin believes that no doggish storyteller would have advanced the theory of mutation a concept which runs counter to everything in the canine creed a viewpoint such as this he claims must have sprung from some alien mind bounce however points out that throughout the legend viewpoints which are diametrically opposed to canine logic often are presented in a favourable light this he says is no more than the mark of a good storytellera twisting of values for certain dramatic shock effect that man is presented deliberately as a character who realizes his own shortcomings there can be no doubt at all in this tale the human grant talks about a groove of logic and it is apparent that he senses something wrong with human logic he tells nathaniel that the human race is always worried he fastens an almost infantile hope upon the juwain theory as something which might yet save the human race and grant in the end seeing the trend of destruction inherent in his race passes the destiny of humanity on to nathaniel of all the characters which appear in the legend nathaniel may be the only one having an actual historic basis in other tales which have come from the racial past the name nathaniel is often mentioned while it is patently impossible that nathaniel could have accomplished all the deeds which are attributed to him in these tales it is generally believed that he actually lived and was a figure of importance the basis of that importance of course has been lost in the gulf of time the webster family of humans which was introduced in the first tale continues to hold a prominent place throughout the rest of the legend while this may be another piece of evidence to support tiges belief it is possible that the webster family once again may be no more than a mark of good storytelling a device used to establish a link of continuity in a series of tales which otherwise are not too closely linked to one who reads too literally the implication that the dogs are a result of mans intervention may prove to be somewhat shocking rover who has never seen in the legend anything beyond pure myth thinks that here we are dealing with an ancient attempt to explain racial origin to cover up actual lack of knowledge the tale develops an explanation which amounts to divine intervention it is an easy and to the primitive mind a plausible and satisfactory way to explain something of which nothing at all is known iii census richard grant was resting beside the little spring that gushed out of the hillside and tumbled in a flashing stream across the twisting trail when the squirrel rushed past him and shinnied up a towering hickory tree behind the squirrel in a cyclone of churning autumnfallen leaves came the little black dog when he saw grant the dog skidded to a stop stood watching him tail wagging eyes adance with fun grant grinned hello there he said hi said the dog grant jerked out of his easy slouch jaw hanging limp the dog laughed back at him red dish rag of a tongue lolling from its mouth grant jerked a thumb at the hickory your squirrels up there thanks said the dog i know it i can smell him startled grant looked swiftly around suspecting a practical joke ventriloquism maybe but there was no one in sight the woods were empty except for himself and the dog the gurgling spring the squirrel chattering in the tree the dog walked closer my name he said is nathaniel the words were there there was no doubt of it almost like human speech except they were pronounced carefully as one who was learning the language might pronounce them and a brogue an accent that could not be placed a certain eccentricity of intonation i live over the hill declared nathaniel with the websters he sat down beat his tail upon the ground scattering leaves he looked extremely happy grant suddenly snapped his fingers bruce webster now i know should have thought of it before glad to meet you nathaniel who are you asked nathaniel me im richard grant enumerator whats an enum enumer an enumerator is someone who counts people grant explained im taking a census there are lots of words said nathaniel that i cant say he got up walked over to the spring and lapped noisily finished he plunked himself down beside the man want to shoot the squirrel he asked want me to sure thing said nathaniel but the squirrel was gone together they circled the tree searching its almost bare branches there was no bushy tail sticking out from behind the boll no beady eyes staring down at them while they had talked the squirrel had made his getaway nathaniel looked a bit crestfallen but he made the best of it why dont you spend the night with us he invited then come morning we could go hunting spend all day at it grant chuckled i wouldnt want to trouble you i am used to camping out nathaniel insisted bruce would be glad to see you and grandpa wouldnt mind he dont know half what goes on anyway whos grandpa his real name is thomas said nathaniel but we all call him grandpa he is bruces father awful old now just sits all day and thinks about a thing that happened long ago grant nodded i know about that nathaniel juwain yeah thats it agreed nathaniel what does it mean grant shook his head wish i could tell you nathaniel wish i knew he hoisted the pack to his shoulder stooped and scratched the dog behind the ear nathaniel grimaced with delight thanks he said and started up the path grant followed thomas webster sat in his wheel chair on the lawn and stared out across the evening hills ill be eightysix tomorrow he was thinking eightysix thats a hell of a long time for a man to live maybe too long especially when he cant walk any more and his eyes are going bad elsie will have a silly cake for me with lots of candles on it and the robots all will bring me a gift and those dogs of bruces will come in and wish me happy returns of the day and wag their tails at me and there will be a few televisor callsalthough not many perhaps and ill pound my chest and say im going to live to be a hundred and everyone will grin behind their hands and say listen to the old fool eightysix years and there were two things i meant to do one of them i did and the other one i didnt a cawing crow skimmed over a distant ridge and slanted down into the valley shadow from far away down by the river came the quacking of a flock of mallards soon the stars would be coming out came out early this time of year he liked to look at them the stars he patted the arms of the chair with fierce pride the stars by lord were his meat an obsession perhapsbut at least something to wipe out that stigma of long ago a shield to keep the family from the gossip of historic busybodies and bruce was helping too those dogs of his a step sounded in the grass behind him your whisky sir said jenkins thomas webster stared at the robot took the glass off the tray thank you jenkins he said he twirled the glass between his fingers how long jenkins have you been lugging drinks to this family your father sir said jenkins and his father before him any news asked the old man jenkins shook his head no news thomas webster sipped the drink that means then that theyre well beyond the solar system too far out even for the pluto station to relay halfway or better to alpha centauri if only i live long enough you will sir jenkins told him i feel it in my bones you declared the old man havent any bones he sipped the drink slowly tasting it with expert tongue watered too much again but it wouldnt do to say anything no use flying off the handle at jenkins that doctor telling jenkins to water it a bit more depriving a man of proper drinking in his final years whats that down there he asked pointing to the path that straggled up the hill jenkins turned to look it appears sir he said that nathaniels bringing someone home the dogs had trooped in to say good night had left again bruce webster grinned after them great gang he said he turned to grant i imagine nathaniel gave you quite a start this afternoon grant lifted the brandy glass squinted through it at the light he did he said just for a minute and then i remembered things id read about what youre doing here it isnt in my line of course but your work has been popularized written up in more or less nontechnical language your line asked webster i thought grant laughed i see what you mean a census taker an enumerator all of that i grant you webster was puzzled just a bit embarrassed i hope mr grant that i havent not at all grant told him im used to being regarded as someone who writes down names and ages and then goes on to the next group of human beings that was the old idea of a census of course a nose counting nothing more a matter of statistics after all the last census was taken more than three hundred years ago and times have changed you interest me said webster you make this nose counting of yours sound almost sinister it isnt sinister protested grant its logical its an evaluation of the human population not just how many of them there are but what are they really like what are they thinking and doing webster slouched lower in his chair stretching his feet out towards the fire upon the hearth dont tell me mr grant that you intend to psychoanalyse me grant drained the brandy glass set it on the table i dont need to he said the world committee knows all it needs to know about the folks like you but it is the othersthe ridge runners you call them here up north theyre jackpine savages farther south theyre something else a hidden populationan almost forgotten population the ones who took to the woods the ones who scampered off when the world committee loosened the strings of government webster grunted the governmental strings had to be loosened he declared history will prove that to anyone even before the world committee came into being the governmental setup of the world was burdened by oxcart survivals there was no more reason for the township government three hundred years ago than there is for a national government today youre absolutely right grant told him and yet when the grip of government was loosened its hold upon the life of each man was loosened the man who wanted to slip away and live outside his government losing its benefits and escaping its obligations found it an easy thing to do the world committee didnt mind it had more things to worry over than the irresponsibles and malcontents and there were plenty of them the farmers for instance who lost their way of life with the coming of hydroponics many of them found it hard to fit into industrial life so what so they slipped away they reverted to a primitive life they raised a few crops they hunted game they trapped they cut wood did a little stealing now and then deprived of a livelihood they went back to the soil all the way back and the soil took care of them that was three hundred years ago said webster the world committee didnt mind about them then it did what it could of course but as you say it didnt really mind if a few slipped through its fingers so why this sudden interest now just i guess grant told him that theyve got around to it he regarded webster closely studying the man relaxed before the fire his face held power the shadows of the leaping flames etching planes upon his features turning them almost surrealistic grant hunted in his pocket found his pipe jammed tobacco in the bowl there is something else he said eh asked webster there is something else about this census theyd take it anyhow perhaps because a picture of earths population must always be an asset a piece of handy knowledge but that isnt all mutants said webster grant nodded thats right i hardly expected anyone to guess it i work with mutants webster pointed out my whole life is bound up with mutations queer bits of culture have been turning up said grant stuff that has no precedent literary forms which bear the unmistakable imprint of fresh personalities music that has broken away from traditional expression art that is like nothing ever seen before and most of it anonymous or at least hidden under pseudonyms webster laughed such a thing of course is utter mystery to the world committee it isnt that so much as something else grant explained the committee is not so concerned with art and literature as it is with other thingsthings that dont show up if there is a backwoods renaissance taking place it would first come to notice naturally through new art and literary forms but a renaissance is not concerned entirely with art and literature webster sank even lower in his chair and cupped his hands beneath his chin i think i see he said what you are driving at they sat for long minutes in silence broken only by the crackling of the fire by the ghostly whisper of an autumn wind in the trees outside there was a chance once said webster almost as if he were speaking to himself a chance for new viewpoints for something that might have wiped out the muddle of four thousand years of human thought a man muffed that chance grant stirred uncomfortably then sat rigid afraid webster might have seen him move that man said webster was my grandfather grant knew he must say something that he could not continue to sit there unspeaking juwain may have been wrong he said he might not have found a new philosophy that is a thought declared webster we have used to console ourselves and yet it is unlikely juwain was a great martian philosopher perhaps the greatest mars had ever known if he could have lived there is no doubt in my mind he would have developed that new philosophy but he didnt live he didnt live because my grandfather couldnt go to mars it wasnt your grandfathers fault said grant he tried to agoraphobia is a thing that a man cant fight webster waved the words aside that is over and done with it is a thing that cannot be recaptured we must accept that and go on from there and since it was my family since it was grandfather grant stared shaken by the thought that occurred to him the dogs thats why yes the dogs said webster from far away in the river bottoms came a crying sound one with the wind that talked in the trees outside a raccoon said webster the dogs will hear him and be rearing to get out the cry came again closer it seemed although that must have been imagination webster had straightened in the chair was leaning forward staring at the flames after all why not he asked a dog has a personality you can sense that in every one you meet no two are exactly alike in mood and temperament all of them are intelligent in varying degrees and that is all thats needed a conscious personality and some measure of intelligence they didnt get an even break thats all they had two handicaps they couldnt talk and they couldnt walk erect and because they couldnt walk erect they had no chance to develop hands but for speech and hands we might be dogs and dogs be men id never thought of it like that said grant not of your dogs as a thinking race no said webster and there was a trace of bitterness running in his words no of course you didnt you thought of them as most of the rest of the world still thinks of them as curiosities as sideshow animals as funny pets pets that can talk with you but its more than that grant i swear to you it is thus far man has come alone one thinking intelligent race all by itself think of how much farther how much faster it might have gone had there been two races two thinking intelligent races working together for you see they would not think alike theyd check their thoughts against one another what one couldnt think of the other could the old story of two heads think of it grant a different mind than the human mind but one that will work with the human mind that will see and understand things the human mind cannot that will develop if you will philosophies the human mind could not he spread his hands towards the fire long fingers with bonehard merciless knuckles they couldnt talk and i gave them speech it was not easy for a dogs tongue and throat are not designed to speak but surgery did it an expedient at first surgery and grafting but now now i hope i think it is too soon to say grant was leaning forward tensed you mean the dogs are passing on the changes you have made that there are hereditary evidences of the surgical corrections webster shook his bead it is too soon to say another twenty years maybe i can tell you he lifted the brandy bottle from the table held it out thanks said grant i am a poor host webster told him you should have helped yourself he raised the glass against the fire i had good material to work with a dog is smart smarter than you think the ordinary run of the mill dog recognizes fifty words or more a hundred is not unusual add another hundred and he has a working vocabulary you noticed perhaps the simple words that nathaniel used almost basic english grant nodded one and two syllables he told me there were a lot of words he couldnt say there is much more to do said webster so much more to do reading for example a dog doesnt see as you and i do i have been experimenting with lensescorrecting their eyesight so they can see as we do and if that fails theres still another way man must visualize the way a dog seeslearn to print books that dogs can read the dogs asked grant what do they think of it the dogs said webster believe it or not grant theyre having the time of their merry lives he stared into the fire god bless their hearts he said following jenkins grant climbed the stairs to bed but as they passed a partially opened door a voice hailed them that you stranger grant stopped jerked around jenkins said in a whisper thats the old gentleman sir often he cannot sleep yes called grant sleepy asked the voice not very grant told him come in for a while the old man said thomas webster sat propped up in bed striped nightcap on his head he saw grant staring at it getting bald he rasped dont feel comfortable unless i got something on cant wear my hat to bed he shouted at jenkins what you standing there for dont you see he needs a drink yes sir said jenkins and disappeared sit down said thomas webster sit down and listen for a while talking will help me go to sleep and besides we dont see new faces every day grant sat down what do you think of that son of mine the old man asked grant started at the unusual question why i think hes splendid the work hes doing with the dogs the old man chuckled him and his dogs ever tell you about the time nathaniel tangled with a skunk of course i havent havent said more than a word or two to you he ran his hands along the bed covering long fingers picking at the fabric nervously got another son you know allen call him al tonight hes the farthest from earth that man has ever been heading for the stars grant nodded i know i read about it the alpha centauri expedition my father was a surgeon said thomas webster wanted me to be one too almost broke his heart i guess when i didnt take to it but if he could know hed be proud of us tonight you mustnt worry about your son said grant the old mans glare silenced him i built that ship myself designed it watched it grow if its just a matter of navigating space itll get where it is going and the kid is good he can ride that crate through hell itself he hunched himself straighter in the bed knocking his nightcap askew against the piledup pillows and i got another reason to think hell get there and back didnt think much about it at the time but lately ive been recalling it thinking it over wondering if it mightnt mean well if it might not be he gasped a bit for breath mind you im not superstitious of course youre not said grant you bet im not said webster a sign of some sort perhaps suggested grant a feeling a hunch none of those declared the old man an almost certain knowledge that destiny must be with me that i was meant to build a ship that would make the trip that someone or something decided it was about time man got out to the stars and took a hand to help him along a bit you sound as if youre talking about an actual incident said grant as if there were some positive happening that makes you think the expedition will succeed you bet your boots said webster thats just exactly what i mean it happened twenty years ago out on the lawn in front of this very house he pulled himself even straighter gasped for breath wheezing i was stumped you understand the dream was broken years spent for nothing the basic principle i had evolved to get the speed necessary for interstellar flight simply wouldnt work and the worst of it was i knew it was almost right i knew there was just one little thing one theoretical change that must be made but i couldnt find it so i was sitting out there on the lawn feeling sorry for myself with a sketch of the plan in front of me i lived with it you see i carried it everywhere i went figuring maybe that by just looking at it the thing that was wrong would pop into my mind you know how it does sometimes grant nodded while i was sitting there a man came along one of the ridge runners you know what a ridge runner is sure said grant well this fellow came along kind of limberjointed chap ambling along as if he didnt have a trouble in the world he stopped and looked over my shoulder and asked me what i dad spaceship drive i told him he reached down and took it and all what was the use he couldnt understand a thing about it and it was no good anyhow and then he handed it back to me and jabbed his finger at one place thats your trouble he said and then he turned and galloped off and i sat staring after him too done in to say a single word to even call him back the old man sat bolt upright in the bed staring at the wall nightcap canted crazily outside the wind sucked along the eaves with hollow hooting and in that welllighted room there seemed to be shadows although grant knew there werent any did you ever find him asked grant the old man shook his head hide nor hair he said jenkins came through the door with a glass set it on the bedside table ill be back sir be said to grant to show you to your room no need of it said grant just tell me where it is if you wish sir said jenkins its the third one down ill turn on the light and leave the door ajar they sat listening to the robots feet go down the hall the old man glanced at the glass of whisky and cleared his throat i wish now he said id had jenkins bring me one why thats all right said grant take this one i dont really need it sure you dont not at all the old man stretched out his hand took a sip sighed gustily now thats what i call a proper mix he said doctor makes jenkins water mine there was something in the house that got under ones skin something that made one feel like an outsideruncomfortable and naked in the quiet whisper of its walls sitting on the edge of his bed grant slowly unlaced his shoes and dropped them on the carpet a robot who had served the family for four generations who talked of men long dead as if he had brought them a glass of whisky only yesterday an old man who worried about a ship that slid through the spacedarkness beyond the solar system another man who dreamed of another race a race that might go hand in paw with man down the trail of destiny and over it all almost unspoken and yet unmistakable the shadow of jerome a websterthe man who had failed a friend a surgeon who had failed his trust juwain the martian philosopher had died on the eve of a great discovery because jerome a webster couldnt leave this house because agoraphobia chained him to a plot a few miles square on stockinged feet grant crossed to the table where jenkins had placed his pack loosening the straps he opened it brought out a thick portfolio back at the bed again he sat down and hauled out sheafs of papers thumbed through them records hundreds of sheets of records the story of hundreds of human lives set down on paper not only the things they told him or the questions that they answered but dozens of other little thingsthings he had noted down from observation from sitting and watching from living with them for an hour or day for the people that he ferreted out in these tangled hills accepted him it was his business that they should accept him they accepted him because he came on foot briarscratched and weary with a pack upon his shoulder to him clung none of the modernity that would have set him apart from them made them suspicious of him it was a tiresome way to make a census but it was the only way to make the kind the world committee wantedand needed for somewhere sometime studying sheets like these that lay upon the bed some man like him would find a thing he sought would find a clue to some life that veered from the human pattern some betraying quirk of behaviourism that would set out one life against all the others human mutations were not uncommon of course many of them were known men who held high position in the world most of the world committee members were mutants but like the others their mutational qualities and abilities bad been modified and qualified by the pattern of the world by unconscious conditioning that had shaped their thoughts and reaction into some conformity with other fellow men there had always been mutants else the race would not have advanced but until the last hundred years or so they had not been recognized as such before that they had merely been great businessmen or great scientists or great crooks or perhaps eccentrics who had rained no more than scorn or pity at the hands of a race that would not tolerate divergence from the norm those who had been successful had adapted themselves to the world around them had bent their greater mental powers into the pattern of acceptable action and this dulled their usefulness limited their capacity hedged their ability with restrictions set up to fit less extraordinary people even as today the known mutants ability was hedged unconsciously by a pattern that had been seta groove of logic that was a terrible thing but somewhere in the world there were dozens probably hundreds of other humans who were just a little more than humanpersons whose lives had been untouched by the rigidity of complex human life their ability would not be hedged they would know no groove of logic from the portfolio grant brought out a pitifully thin sheaf of papers clipped together read the title of the script almost reverently unfinished philosophical proposition and related notes of juwain it would take a mind that knew no groove of logic a mind unhampered by the pattern of four thousand years of human thought to carry on the torch the dead hand of the martian philosopher had momentarily lifted a torch that lit the way to a new concept of life and purpose that showed a path that was easier and straighter a philosophy that would have put mankind ahead a hundred thousand years in two short generations juwain had died and in this very house a man had lived out his haunted years listening to the voice of his dead friend shrinking from the censure of a cheated race a stealthy scratch came at the door startled grant stiffened listened it came again then a little silky whine swiftly grant stuffed the papers back in the portfolio strode to the door as he opened it nathaniel oozed in like a sliding black shadow oscar he said doesnt know im hero oscar would give it to me if he knew i was whos oscar oscars the robot that takes care of us grant grinned at the dog what do you want nathaniel i want to talk to you said nathaniel youve talked to everyone else to bruce and grandpa but you havent talked to me and im the one that found you ok invited grant go ahead and talk youre worried said nathaniel grant wrinkled his brow thats right perhaps i am the human race is always worried you should know that by now nathaniel youre worrying about juwain just like grandpa is not worrying protested grant just wondering and hoping whats the matter with juwain demanded nathaniel and who is he and hes no one really declared grant that is he was someone once but he died years ago hes just an idea now a problem a challenge something to think about i can think said nathaniel triumphantly i think a lot sometimes but i mustnt think like human beings bruce tells me i mustnt he says i have to think dog thoughts and let human thoughts alone he says dog thoughts are just as good as human thoughts maybe a whole lot better grant nodded soberly there is something to that nathaniel after all you must think differently than man you must theres lots of things that dogs know that men dont know bragged nathaniel we can see things and hear things that men cant see nor hear sometimes we howl at night and people cuss us out but if they could see and hear what we do theyd be scared too stiff to move bruce says were were psychic asked grant thats it declared nathaniel i cant remember all them words grant picked his pyjamas off the table how about spending the night with me nathaniel you can have the foot of the bed nathaniel stared at him round eyed gee you mean you want me to sure i do if were going to be partners dogs and men we better start out on an even footing now i wont get the bed dirty said nathaniel honest i wont oscar gave me a bath tonight he flipped an ear except he said i think he missed a flea or two grant stared in perplexity at the atomic gun a handy thing it performed a host of services ranging from cigarette lighter to deadly weapon built to last a thousand years it was foolproof or so the advertisements said it never got out of kilterexcept now it wouldnt work he pointed it at the ground and shook it vigorously and still it didnt work he tapped it gently on a stone and got no results darkness was dropping on the tumbled bills somewhere in the distant river valley an owl laughed irrationally the first stars small and quiet came out in the east and in the west the greentinged glow that marked the passing of the sun was fading into night the pile of twigs was laid before the boulder and other wood lay near at hand to keep the campfire going through the night but if the gun wouldnt work there would be no fire grant cursed under his breath thinking of chilly sleeping and cold rations he tapped the gun on the rock again harder this time still no soap a twig crunched in the dark and grant shot bolt upright beside the shadowy trunk of one of the forest giants that towered into the gathering dusk stood a figure tall and gangling hello said grant something wrong stranger my gun replied grant then cut short the words no use in letting this shadowy figure know he was unarmed the man stepped forward hand outstretched wont work eh grant felt the gun lifted from his grasp the visitor squatted on the ground making chuckling noises grant strained his eyes to see what he was doing but the creeping darkness made the others hands an inky blur weaving about the bright metal of the gun metal clicked and scraped the man sucked in his breath and laughed metal scraped again and the man arose holding out the gun all fixed he said maybe better than it was before a twig crunched again hey wait yelled grant but the man was gone a black ghost moving among the ghostly trunks a chill that was not of the night came seeping from the ground and travelled slowly up grants body a chill that set his teeth on edge that stirred the short hairs at the base of his skull that made goose flesh spring out upon his arms there was no sound except the talk of water whispering in the dark the tiny stream that ran just below the campsite shivering he knelt beside the pile of twigs pressed the trigger a thin blue flame lapped out and the twigs burst into flame grant found old dave baxter perched on the top rail of the fence smoke pouring from the shortstemmed pipe almost hidden in his whiskers howdy stranger said dave climb up and squat a while grant climbed up stared out over the cornshocked field gay with the gold of pumpkins just walkin asked old dave or snoopin snooping admitted grant dave took the pipe out of his mouth spat put it back in again the whiskers draped themselves affectionately and dangerously about it diggin asked old dave nope said grant had a feller through here four five years ago said dave that was worsen a rabbit dog for diggin found a place where there had been an old town and just purely tore up the place pestered the life out of me to tell him about the town but i didnt rightly remember much heard my grandpappy once mention the name of the town but danged if i aint forgot it this here feller bad a slew of old maps that he was all the time wavin around and studying trying to figure out what was what but i guess he never did know hunting for antiques said grant mebbe old dave told him kept out of his way the best i could but he wasnt no worsen the one that was tryin to trace some old road that ran through this way once he had some maps too left figurin hed found it and i didnt have the heart to tell him what hed found was a path the cows had made he squinted at grant cagily you aint huntin no old roads be you nope said grant im a census taker youre what census taker explained grant take down your name and age and where you live what for government wants to know said grant we dont bother the govment none declared old dave what calls the govment got botherin us government wont bother you any grant told him might even take a notion to pay you something some day never can tell in that case said old dave its different they perched on the fence staring across the fields smoke curled up from a chimney hidden in a sunny hollow yellow with the flame of birches a creek meandered placidly across a dun autumncoloured meadow and beyond it climbed the hills tier on tier of golden maple trees hunched on the rail grant felt the heat of the autumn sun soak into his back smelled the stubbled field a good life he told himself good crops wood to burn plenty of game to hunt a happy life he glanced at the old man huddled beside him saw the unworried wrinkles of kindly age that puckered up his face tried for a moment to envision a life like thisa simple pastoral life akin to the historic days of the old american frontier with all the frontiers compensations none of its dangers old dave took the pipe out of his face waved it at the field still lots of work to do he announced but it aint agittin done them kids aint worth the power to blow em up huntin all the time fishin too machinery breakin down just aint been around for quite a spell great hand at machinery joe is joe your son no crazy feller that lives off in the woods somewhere walks in and fixes things up then walks off and leaves scarcely ever talks dont wait for a man to thank him just up and leaves been doin it foryears now grandpappy told me how he first came when he was a youngster still coming now grant gasped wait a second it cant be the same man now said old dave thats the thing wont believe it stranger but he aint a mite older now than when i first saw him funny sort of cuss lots of wild tales about him grandpappy always told about how he fooled around with ants ants sure built a houseglasshouse you know over an ant hill and heated it come winter thats what grandpappy always said claimed hed seen it but i dont believe a word of it grandpappy was the biggest liar in seven counties admitted it hisself a brasstongued bell clanged from the sunny hollow where the chimney smoked the old man climbed down from the fence tapped out his pipe squinting at the sun the bell boomed again across the autumn stillness thats ma said old dave dinners on squirrel dumplings more than likely good eatin as you ever hooked a tooth into lets get a hustle on a crazy fellow who came and fixed things and didnt wait for thanks a man who looked the same as he did a hundred years ago a chap who built a glasshouse over an ant hill and heated it come winter it didnt make sense and yet old baxter hadnt been lying it wasnt another one of those tall yarns that had sprung up and still ran their course out here in the backwoods amounting now to something that was very close to folklore all of the folklore had a familiar ring a certain similarity a definite pattern of underlying wit that tagged it for what it was and this wasnt it there was nothing humorous even to the backwoods mind in housing and heating an ant hill to qualify for humour a tale like that would have to have a snapper and this tale didnt have one grant stirred uneasily on the cornshuck mattress pulling the heavy quilt close around his throat funny he thought the places that i sleep in tonight a cornshuck mattress last night an open campfire the night before that a soft mattress and clean sheets in the webster house the wind sucked up the hollow and paused on its way to flap a loose shingle on the house came back to flap it once again a mouse skittered somewhere in the darkened place from the bed across the loft came the sound of regular breathingtwo of the baxter younger fry slept there a man who came and fixed things and didnt wait for thanks that was what had happened with the gun that was what had been happening for years to the baxters haywire farm machinery a crazy feller by the name of joe who didnt age and had a handy bent at tinkering a thought came into grants head he shoved it back repressed it there was no need of arousing hope snoop around some ask guarded questions keep your eyes open grant dont make your questions too pointed or theyll shut up like a clam funny folk these ridge runners people who had no part of progress who wanted no part of it people who had turned their backs upon civilization returning to the unhampered life of soil and forest sun and rain plenty of room for them here on earth lots of room for everyone for earths population had dwindled in the last two hundred years drained by the pioneers who flocked out to settle other planets to shape the other worlds of the system to the economy of mankind plenty of room and soil and game maybe it was the best way after all grant remembered he had often thought that in the months he had tramped these hills at times like this with the comfort of the handmade quilt the rough efficiency of the cornshuck mattress the whisper of the wind along the shingled roof times like when be sat on the top rail of the fence and looked at the groups of golden pumpkins loafing in the sun a rustle came to him across the dark the rustle of the cornshuck mattress where the two boys slept then the pad of bare feet coming softly across the boards you asleep mister came the whisper nope want to crawl in with me the youngster ducked under the cover put cold feet against grants stomach grandpappy tell you about joe grant nodded in the dark said he hadnt been around lately tell you about the ants sure did what do you know about the ants me and bill found them just a little while ago keeping it a secret we aint told anyone but you but we gotta tell you i guess youre from the govment there really was a glasshouse over the hill yes and andthe boys voice gasped with excitement and that aint all them ants had carts and there was chimneys coming out of the hill and smoke comin from the chimneys and and yes what else we didnt wait to see anything else bill and me got scared we ran the boy snuggled deeper into the cornshucks gee ever hear of anything like it ants pulling carts the ants were pulling carts and there were chimneys sticking from the hill chimneys that belched tiny acrid puffs of smoke that told of smelting ores head throbbing with excitement grant squatted beside the nest staring at the carts that trundled along the roads leading off into the grassroots land empty carts going out loaded carts coming backloaded with seeds and here and there dismembered insect bodies tiny carts moving rapidly bouncing and jouncing behind the harnessed ants the glassite shield that once had covered the nest still was there but it was broken and had fallen into disrepair almost as if there were no further use of it as if it had served a purpose that no longer existed the glen was wild broken land that tumbled down towards the river bluffs studded with boulders alternating with tiny patches of meadow and clumps of mighty oaks a hushed peace that one could believe had never heard a voice except to talk of wind in treetops and the tiny voices of the wild things that followed secret paths a place where ants might live undisturbed by plough or vagrant foot continuing the millions of years of senseless destiny that dated from a day before there was anything like manfrom a day before a single abstract thought had been born on the earth a closed and stagnant destiny that had no purpose except that ants might live and now someone had uncoiled the angle of that destiny had set it on another path had given the ants the secret of the wheel the secret of working metalshow many other cultural handicaps bad been lifted from this ant hill breaking the bottleneck of progress hunger pressure perhaps would be one cultural handicap that would have been lifted for the ants providing of abundant food which gave them leisure for other things beyond the continued search for sustenance another race on the road to greatness developing along the social basis that had been built in that long gone day before the thing called man had known the stir of greatness where would it lead what would the ant be like in another million years would ant and mancould ant and man find any common denominator as dog and man would find for working out a cooperative destiny grant shook his head that was something the chances were against for in dog and man ran common blood while ant and man were things apart life forms that were never meant to understand the other they had no common basis such as had been joined in the paleolithic days when dog and man dozed beside a fire and watched against the eyes that roved out in the night grant sensed rather than heard the rustle of feet in the high grass back of him erect he whirled around and saw the man before him a gangling man with stooping shoulders and hands that were almost hamlike but with sensitive fingers that tapered white and smooth you are joe asked grant the man nodded and you are a man who has been hunting me grant gasped why perhaps i have not you personally perhaps but someone like you someone different said joe why didnt you stay the other night asked grant why did you run off i wanted to thank you for fixing up the gun joe merely stared at him unspeaking but behind the silent lips grant sensed amusement a vast and secret amusement how in the world asked grant did you know the gun was broken had you been watching me i heard you think it was you heard me think yes said joe i hear you thinking now grant laughed a bit uneasily it was disconcerting but it was logical it was the thing that he should have expectedthis and more he gestured at the hill those ants are yours joe nodded and the amusement again was bubbling just behind his lips what are you laughing for snapped grant i am not laughing joe told him and somehow grant felt rebuked rebuked and small like a child that has been slapped for something it should have known better than to do you should publish your notes said grant they might be correlated with the work that websters doing joe shrugged his shoulders i have no notes he said no notes the lanky man moved towards the ant hill stood staring down at it perhaps he declared youve figured out why i did it grant nodded gravely i might have wondered that experimental curiosity more than likely maybe compassion for a lower form of life a feeling perhaps that just because man himself got the head start doesnt give him a monopoly on advancement joes eyes glittered in the sunlight curiositymaybe i hadnt thought of that he hunkered down beside line bill ever wonder why the ant advanced so far and then stood still why he built a nearly perfect social organization and let it go at that what it was that stopped him in his tracks hunger pressure for one thing grant said that and hibernation declared the lanky man hibernation you see wiped out the memory pattern from one season to the next each spring they started over began from scratch again they never were able to benefit from past mistakes cash in on accumulated knowledge so you fed them and heated the hill said joe so they wouldnt have to hibernate so they wouldnt have to start out fresh with the coming of each spring the carts i made a couple left them there it took ten years but they finally figured out what they were for grant nodded at the smokestacks they did that themselves joe told him anything else joe lifted his shoulders wearily how should i know but man you watched them even if you didnt keep notes you watched joe shook his head i havent laid eyes on them for almost fifteen years i only came today because i heard you here these ants you see dont amuse me any more grants mouth opened then shut tight again finally he said so thats the answer thats why you did it amusement there was no shame on joes face no defence just a pained expression that said he wished theyd forget all about the ants his mouth said sure why else that gun of mine i suppose that amused you too not the gun said joe not the gun grants brain said of course not the gun you dumbbell but you yourself youre the one that amused him and youre amusing him right now fixing up old dave baxters farm machinery then walking off without a word doubtless had been a screaming joke and probably hed hugged himself and rocked for days with silent mirth after that time up at the webster house when hed pointed out the thing that was wrong with old thomas websters space drive like a smartaleck playing tricks on an awkward puppy joes voice broke his thoughts youre an enumerator arent you why dont you ask me the questions now that youve found me you cant go off and not get it down on paper my age especially im one hundred and sixtythree and im scarcely adolescent another thousand years at least he hugged his knobby knees against his chest and rocked slowly back and forth another thousand years and if i take good care of myself but that isnt all of it grant told him trying to keep his voice calm there is something more something that you must do for us for us for society said grant for the human race why grant stared you mean that you dont care joe shook his head and in the gesture there was no bravado no defiance of convention it was just blunt statement of the fact money suggested grant joe waved his hands at the hills about them at the spreading river valley i have this he said i have no need of money fame perhaps joe did not spit but his face looked like he had the gratitude of the human race it doesnt last said joe and the old mockery was in his words the vast amusement just behind his lips look joe said grant and hard as he tried to keep it out there was pleading in his voice this thing i have for you to do is important important to generations yet to come important to the human race a milestone in our destiny and why should i asked joe do something for someone who isnt even born yet why should i look beyond the years of my own life when i die i die and all the shouting and the glory all the banners and the bugles will be nothing to me i will not knew whether i lived a great life or a very poor one the race said grant joe laughed a shout of laughter race preservation race advancement thats what youre getting at why should you be concerned with that or i the laughter lines smoothed out around his mouth and he shook a finger in mock admonishment race preservation is a myth a myth that you all have lived bya sordid thing that has arisen out of your social structure the race ends every day when a man dies the race ends for himso far as hes concerned there is no longer any race you just dont care said grant that declared joe is what ive been telling you he squinted at the pack upon the ground and a flicker of a smile wove about his lips perhaps be suggested if it interested me grant opened up the pack brought out the portfolio almost reluctantly he pulled out the thin sheaf of papers glanced at the title unfinished philosophical he handed it across sat watching as joe read swiftly and even as be watched he felt the sickening wrench of terrible failure closing on his brain back in the webster house he had thought of a mind that knew no groove of logic a mind unhampered by four thousand years of mouldy human thought that he had told himself might do the trick and here it was but it still was not enough there was something lackingsomething he bad never thought of something the men in geneva had never thought of either something a part of the human makeup that everyone up to this moment had taken for granted social pressure was the thing that had held the human race together through all millenniaheld the human race together as a unit just as hunger pressure had held the ants enslaved to a social pattern the need of one human being for the approval of his fellow humans the need for a certain cult of fellowshipa psychological almost physiological need for approval of ones thought and action a force that kept men from going off at unsocial tangents a force that made for social security and human solidarity for the working together of the human family men died for that approval sacrificed for that approval lived lives they loathed for that approval for without it a man was on his own an outcast an animal that had been driven from the pack it had led to terrible things of courseto mob psychology to racial persecution to mass atrocities in the name of patriotism or religion but likewise it had been the sizing that held the race together the thing that from the very start had made human society possible and joe didnt have it joe didnt give a damn he didnt care what anyone thought of him he didnt care whether anyone approved or not grant felt the sun hot upon his back heard the whisper of the wind that walked in the trees above him and in some thicket a bird struck up a song was this the trend of mutancy this sloughing off of the basic instinct that made man a member of the race had this man in front of him reading the legacy of juwain found within himself through his mutancy a life so full that he could dispense with the necessity for the approval of his fellows had he finally after all these years reached that stage of civilization where a man stood independent disdaining all the artificiality of society joe looked up very interesting he said why didnt he go ahead and finish it he died said grant joe clucked his tongue inside his cheek he was wrong in one place he flipped the pages jabbed with a finger right here thats where the error cropped up thats what bogged him down grant stammered but but there shouldnt be an error he died thats all he died before he finished it joe folded the manuscript neatly tucked it in his pocket just as well he said he probably would have botched it then you can finish it you can there was grant knew no use of going on he read the answer in joes eyes you really think said joe and his words were terse and measured that id turn this over to you squalling humans grant shrugged in defeat i suppose not i suppose i should have known a man like you i said joe can use this thing myself he rose slowly idly swung his foot ploughing a furrow through the ant hill toppling the smoking chimneys burying the toiling carts with a cry grant leaped to his feet blind anger gripping him blind anger driving the hand that snatched out his gun hold it said joe grants arm halted with the gun still pointing towards the ground take it easy little man said joe i know youd like to kill me but i cant let you do it for i have plans you see and after all you wouldnt be killing me for the reason that you think what difference would it make why i killed you rasped grant youd be dead wouldnt you you wouldnt be loose with juwains philosophy but joe told him almost gently thats not why you would kill me youd do it because youre sore at me for mussing up the ant hill that might have been the reason first said grant but not now dont try it said joe before you ever pressed the trigger youd be meat yourself grant hesitated if you think im bluffing joe taunted him go ahead and call me for a long moment the two stood face to face the gun still pointing at the ground why cant you throw in with us asked grant we need a man like you you were the one that showed old tom webster how to build a space drive the work youve done with ants joe was stepping forward swiftly and grant heaved up the gun he saw the fist coming at him a hamlike powerful fist that fairly whistled with its vicious speed a fist that was faster than his finger on the trigger something wet and hot was rasping across grants face and he lifted a hand and tried to brush it off but it went on licking across his face he opened his eyes and nathaniel did a jig in front of them youre all right said nathaniel i was so afraid nathaniel croaked grant what are you doing herw i ran away nathaniel told him i want to go with you grant shook his head you cant go with me i have far to go i have a job to do he got to his hands and knees and felt along the ground when his hand touched cold metal he picked it up and slid it in the holster i let him get away he said and i cant let him go i gave him something that belonged to all mankind and i cant let him use it i can track nathaniel told him i track squirrels like everything you have more important things to do than tracking grant told the dog you see i found out something today got a glimpse of a certain trenda trend that all mankind may follow not today nor tomorrow nor even a thousand years from now maybe never but its a thing we cant overlook joe may be just a little farther along the path than the rest of us and we may be following faster than we think we may all end up like joe and if that is what is happening if that is where it all will end you dogs have a job ahead of you nathaniel stared up at him worried wrinkles on his face i dont understand he pleaded you use words i cant make out look nathaniel men may not always be the way they are today they may change and if they do you have to carry on you have to take the dream and keep it going youll have to pretend that you are men us dogs nathaniel pledged will do it it wont come for thousands and thousands of years said grant you will have time to get ready but you must know you must pass the word along you must not forget i know said nathaniel us dogs will tell the pups and the pups will tell their pups thats the idea said grant he stooped and scratched nathaniels ear and the dog tail wagging to a stop stood and watched him climb the hill notes on the fourth tale of all the tales this is the one which has occasioned the most anguish on the part of those who would seek some explanation and significance in the legend that it must be entirely myth and nothing else even tige will admit but if it is myth what does it mean if this tale is myth are not all the others myth as well jupiter where the action takes place is supposed to be one of the other worlds which may be found by crossing space the scientific impossibility of the existence of such worlds has been noted elsewhere and if we are to accept bounces theory that the other worlds dealt with in the legend are none other than our own multiple worlds it seems reasonable to suppose that such a world as the one described would have been located by this date that there are certain of the cobbly worlds which are closed is common knowledge but the reason for their closure is well known and none of them is closed because of conditions such as those described in this fourth tale some scholars believe that the fourth tale is an interloper that it has no business in the legend that it is something which was picked up and inserted bodily it is hard to accept this conclusion since the tale does tie in with the legend furnishing one of the principal story pivots upon which the legend turns the character of towser in this tale has been cited on many occasions as inconsistent with the essential dignity of our race yet while towser may be distasteful to certain squeamish readers he serves well as a foil for the human in the story it is towser not the human who is first ready to accept the situation which develops towser not the human who is the first to understand and towsers mind once it is freed from human domination is shown to be at least the equal of the humans towser fleabitten as he may be is a character one need not be ashamed of short as it is this fourth tale probably is the most rewarding of the eight it is one that recommends itself for thoughtful careful reading desertion four men two by two had gone into the howling maelstrom that was jupiter and had not returned they had walked into the keening galeor rather they had loped bellies low against the ground wet sides gleaming in the rain for they did not go in the shape of men now the fifth man stood before the desk of kent fowler head of dome no jovian survey commission under fowlers desk old towser scratched a flea then settled down to sleep again harold allen fowler saw with a sudden pang was youngtoo young he had the easy confidence of youth the face of one who never had known fear and that was strange for men in the domes of jupiter did know fearfear and humility it was hard for man to reconcile his puny self with the mighty forces of the monstrous planet you understand said fowler that you need not do this you understand that you need not go it was formula of course the other four had been told the same thing but they had gone this fifth one fowler knew would go as well but suddenly he felt a dull hope stir within him that allen wouldnt go when do i start asked allen there had been a time when fowler might have taken quiet pride in that answer but not now he frowned briefly within the hour he said allen stood waiting quietly four other men have gone out and have not returned said fowler you know that of course we want you to return we dont want you going off on any heroic rescue expedition the main thing the only thing is that you come back that you prove man can live in a jovian form go to the first survey stake no farther then come back dont take any chances dont investigate anything just come back allen nodded i understand all that miss stanley will operate the converter fowler went on you need have no fear on that particular score the other men were converted without mishap they left the converter in apparently perfect condition you will be in thoroughly competent hands miss stanley is the best qualified conversion operator in the solar system she has had experience on most of the other planets that is why shes here allen grinned at the woman and fowler saw something flicker across miss stanleys facesomething that might have been pity or rageor just plain fear but it was gone again and she was smiling back at the youth who stood before the desk smiling in that prim schoolteacherish way she had of smiling almost as if she hated herself for doing it i shall be looking forward said allen to my conversion and the way he said it he made it all a joke a vast ironic joke but it was no joke it was serious business deadly serious upon these tests fowler knew depended the fate of men on jupiter if the tests succeeded the resources of the giant planet would be thrown open man would take over jupiter as he already had taken over the other smaller planets and if they failedif they failed man would continue to be chained and hampered by the terrific pressure the greater force of gravity the weird chemistry of the planet he would continue to be shut within the domes unable to set actual foot upon the planet unable to see it with direct unaided vision forced to rely upon the awkward tractors and the televisor forced to work with clumsy tools and mechanisms or through the medium of robots that themselves were clumsy for man unprotected and in his natural form would be blotted out by jupiters terrific pressure of fifteen thousand pounds per square inch pressure that made terrestrial sea bottoms seem a vacuum by comparison even the strongest metal earthmen could devise couldnt exist under pressure such as that under the pressure and the alkaline rains that forever swept the planet it grew brittle and flaky crumbling like clay or it ran away in little streams and puddles of ammonia salts only by stepping up the toughness and strength of that metal by increasing its electronic tension could it be made to withstand the weight of thousands of miles of swirling choking gases that made up the atmosphere and even when that was done everything had to be coated with tough quartz to keep away the rainthe liquid ammonia that fell as bitter rain fowler sat listening to the engines in the subfloor of the domeengines that ran on endlessly the dome never quiet of them they had to run and keep on running for if they stopped the power flowing into the metal walls of the dome would stop the electronic tension would ease up and that would be the end of everything towser roused himself under fowlers desk and scratched another flea his leg thumping hard against the floor is there anything else asked allen fowler shook his head perhaps theres something you want to do he said perhaps you he had meant to say write a letter and he was glad he caught himself quick enough so he didnt say it allen looked at his watch ill be there on time he said he swung around and headed for the door fowler knew miss stanley was watching him and he didnt want to turn and meet her eyes he fumbled with a sheaf of papers on the desk before him how long are you going to keep this up asked miss stanley and she bit off each word with a vicious snap he swung around in his chair and faced her then her lips were drawn into a straight thin line her hair seemed skinned back from her forehead tighter than ever giving her face that queer almost startling deathmask quality he tried to make his voice cool and level as long as theres any need of it he said as long as theres any hope youre going to keep on sentencing them to death she said youre going to keep marching them out face to face with jupiter youre going to shin here safe and comfortable andsend them out to die there is no room for sentimentality miss stanley fowler said trying to keep the note of anger from his voice you know as well as i do why were doing this you realize that man in his own form simply cannot cope with jupiter the only answer is to turn men into the sort of things that can cope with it weve done it on the other planets if a few men die but we finally succeed the price is small through the ages men have thrown away their lives on foolish things for foolish reasons why should we hesitate then at a little death in a thing as great as this miss stanley sat stiff and straight hands folded in her lap the lights shining on her greying hair and fowler watching her tried to imagine what she might feel what she might be thinking he wasnt exactly afraid of her but he didnt feel quite comfortable when she was around those sharp blue eyes saw too much her hands looked far too competent she should be somebodys aunt sitting in a rocking chair with her knitting needles but she wasnt she was the topnotch conversion unit operator in the solar system and she didnt like the way he was doing things there is something wrong mr fowler she declared precisely agreed fowler thats why im sending young allen out alone he may find out what it is and if he doesnt ill send someone else she rose slowly from her chair started towards the door then stopped before his desk some day she said you will be a great man you never let a chance go by this is your chance you knew it was when this dome was picked for the tests if you put it through youll go up a notch or two no matter how many men may die youll go up a notch or two miss stanley he said and his voice was curt young allen is going out soon please be sure that your machine my machine she told him icily is not to blame it operates along the coordinates the biologists set up he sat hunched at his desk listening to her footsteps go down the corridor what she said was true of course the biologists had set up the coordinates but the biologists could be wrong just a hairbreadth of difference one iota of digression and the converter would be sending out something that wasnt the thing they meant to send a mutant that might crack up go haywire come unstuck under some condition or stress of circumstance wholly unsuspected for man didnt know much about what was going on outside only what his instruments told him was going on and the samplings of those happenings furnished by those instruments and mechanisms had been no more than samplings for jupiter was unbelievably large and the domes were very few even the work of the biologists in getting the data on the lopers apparently the highest form of jovian life had involved more than three years of intensive study and after that two years of checking to make sure work that could have been done on earth in a week or two but work that in this case couldnt be done on earth at all for one couldnt take a jovian life form to earth the pressure here on jupiter couldnt be duplicated outside of jupiter and at earth pressure and temperature the lopers would simply have disappeared in a puff of gas yet it was work that had to be done if man ever hoped to go about jupiter in the life form of the lopers for before the converter could change a man to another life form every detailed physical characteristic of that life form must be knownsurely and positivelywith no chance of mistake allen did not come back the tractors combing the nearby terrain found no trace of him unless the skulking thing reported by one of the drivers had been the missing earthman in loper form the biologists sneered their most accomplished academic sneers when fowler suggested the coordinates might be wrong carefully they pointed out the coordinates worked when a man was put into the converter and the switch was thrown the man became a loper he left the machine and moved away out of sight into the soupy atmosphere some quirk fowler had suggested some tiny deviation from the thing a loper should be some minor defect if there were the biologists said it would take years to find it and fowler knew that they were right so there were five men now instead of four and harold allen had walked out into jupiter for nothing at all it was as if hed never gone so far as knowledge was concerned fowler reached across his desk and picked up the personnel file a thin sheaf of paper neatly clipped together it was a thing he dreaded but a thing be had to do somehow the reason for these strange disappearances must be found and there was no other way than to send out more men he sat for a moment listening to the howling of the wind above the dome the everlasting thundering gale that swept across the planet in boiling twisting wrath was there some threat out there he asked himself some danger they did not know about something that lay in wait and gobbled up the lopers making no distinction between lopers that were bonafide and lopers that were men to the gobblers of course it would make no difference or had there been a basic fault in selecting the lopers as the type of life best fitted for existence on the surface of the planet the evident intelligence of the lopers he knew had been one factor in that determination for if the thing man became did not have capacity for intelligence man could not for long retain his own intelligence in such a guise had the biologists let that one factor weigh too heavily using it to offset some other factor that might be unsatisfactory even disastrous it didnt seem likely stiffnecked as they might be the biologists knew their business or was the whole thing impossible doomed from the very start conversion to other life forms had worked on other planets but that did not necessarily mean it would work on jupiter perhaps mans intelligence could not function correctly through the sensory apparatus provided by jovian life perhaps the lopers were so alien there was no common ground for human knowledge and the jovian conception of existence to meet and work together or the fault might lie with man be inherent with the race some mental aberration which coupled with what they found outside wouldnt let them come back although it might not be an aberration not in the human sense perhaps just one ordinary human mental trait accepted as commonplace on earth would be so violently at odds with jovian existence that it would blast human sanity claws rattled and clicked down the corridor listening to them fowler smiled wanly it was towser coming back from the kitchen where he had gone to see his friend the cook towser came into the room carrying a bone he wagged his tail at fowler and flopped down beside the desk bone between his paws for a long moment his rheumy old eyes regarded his master and fowler reached down a hand to ruffle a ragged ear you still like me towser fowler asked and towser thumped his tail youre the only one said fowler he straightened and swung back to the desk his hand reached out and picked up the file bennett bennett had a girl waiting for him back on earth andrews andrews was planning on going back to mars tech just as soon as he earned enough to see him through a year olson olson was nearing pension age all the time telling the boys how he was going to settle down and grow roses carefully fowler laid the file back on the desk sentencing men to death miss stanley had said that her pale lips scarcely moving in her parchment face marching men out to die while he fowler sat here safe and comfortable they were saying it all through the dome no doubt especially since allen had failed to return they wouldnt say it to his face of course even the man or men he called before this desk and told they were the next to go wouldnt say it to him but be would see it in their eyes he picked up the file again bennett andrews olson there were others but there was no use in going on kent fowler knew that he couldnt do it couldnt face them couldnt send more men out to die he leaned forward and flipped up the toggle on the intercommunicator yes mr fowler miss stanley please he waited for miss stanley listening to towser chewing halfheartedly on the bone towsers teeth were getting bad miss stanley said miss stanleys voice just wanted to tell you miss stanley to get ready for two more arent you afraid askedmiss stanley that youll run out of them sending out one at a time theyd last longer give you twice the satisfaction one of them said fowler will be a dog a dog yes towser he heard the quick cold rage that iced her voice your own dog hes been with you all these years thats the point said fowler towser would be unhappy if i left him behind it was not the jupiter he had known through the televisor he had expected it to be different but not like this he had expected a hell of ammonia rain and stinking fumes and the deafening thundering tumult of the storm he had expected swirling clouds and fog and the snarling flicker of monstrous thunderbolts he had not expected the lashing downpour would be reduced to drifting purple mist that moved like fleeing shadows over a red and purple sward he had not even guessed the snaking bolts of lightning would be flares of pure ecstasy across a painted sky waiting for towser fowler flexed the muscles of his body amazed at the smooth sleek strength he found not a bad body he decided and grimaced at remembering bow he had pitied the lopers when he glimpsed them through the television screen for it had been hard to imagine a living organism based upon ammonia and hydrogen rather than upon water and oxygen hard to believe that such a form of life could know the same quick thrill of life that humankind could know hard to conceive of life out in the soupy maelstrom that was jupiter not knowing of course that through jovian eyes it was no soupy maelstrom at all the wind brushed against him with what seemed gentle fingers and be remembered with a start that by earth standards the wind was a roaring gale a twohundredmilean hour howler laden with deadly gases pleasant scents seeped into his body and yet scarcely scents for it was not the sense of smell as he remembered it it was as if his whole being was soaking up the sensation of lavenderand yet not lavender it was something he knew for which he had no word undoubtedly the first of many enigmas in terminology for the words he knew the thought symbols that served him as an earthman would not serve him as a jovian the lock in the side of the dome opened and towser came tumbling outat least he thought it must be towser he started to call to the dog his mind shaping the words he meant to say but he couldnt say them there was no way to say them he had nothing to say them with for a moment his mind swirled in muddy terror a blind fear that eddied in little puffs of panic through his brain how did jovians talk howsuddenly he was aware of towser intensely aware of the bumbling eager friendliness of the shaggy animal that had followed him from earth to many planets as if the thing that was towser had reached out and for a moment sat within his brain and out of the bubbling welcome that he sensed came words hiya pal not words really better than words thought symbols in his brain communicated thought symbols that had shades of meaning words could never have hiya towser he said i feel good said towser like i was a pup lately ive been feeling pretty punk legs stiffening up on me and teeth wearing down to almost nothing hard to mumble a bone with teeth like that besides the fleas give me hell used to be i never paid much attention to them a couple of fleas more or less never meant much in my early days but but fowlers thoughts tumbled awkwardly youre talking to me sure thing said towser i always talked to you but you couldnt hear me i tried to say things to you but i couldnt make the grade i understood you sometimes fowler said not very well said towser you knew when i wanted food and when i wanted a drink and when i wanted out but thats about all you ever managed im sorry fowler said forget it towser told him ill race you to the cliff for the first time fowler saw the cliff apparently many miles away but with a strange crystalline beauty that sparkled in the shadow of the manycoloured clouds fowler hesitated its a long way ah come on said towser and even as he said it he started for the cut fowler followed testing his legs testing the strength in that new body of his a bit doubtful at first amazed a moment later then running with a sheer joyousness that was one with the red and purple sward with the drifting smoke of the rain across the land as he ran the consciousness of music came to him a music that beat into his body that surged throughout his being that lifted him on wings of silver speed music like bells might make from some steeple on a sunny springtime bill as the cliff drew nearer the music deepened and filled the universe with a spray of magic sound and he knew the music came from the tumbling waterfall that feathered down the face of the shining cliff only he knew it was no waterfall but an ammoniafall and the cliff was white because it was oxygen solidified he skidded to a stop beside towser where the waterfall broke into a glittering rainbow of many hundred colours literally many hundred for here he saw was no shading of one primary to another as human beings saw but a clearcut selectivity that broke the prism down to its last ultimate classification the music said towser yes what about it the music said towser is vibrations vibrations of water falling but towser you dont know about vibrations yes i do contended towser it just popped into my head fowler gulped mentally just popped and suddenly within his own head he held a formulaa formula for a process that would make metal to withstand pressure of jupiter he stared astounded at the waterfall and swiftly his mind took the many colours and placed them in their exact sequence in the spectrum just like that just out of blue sky out of nothing for he knew nothing either of metals or of colours towser he cried towser somethings happening to us yeah i know said towser its our brains said fowler were using them all of them down to the last hidden corner using them to figure out things we should have known all the time maybe the brains of earth things naturally are slow and foggy maybe we are the morons of the universe maybe we are fixed so we have to do things the hard way and in the new sharp clarity of thought that seemed to grip him he knew that it would not only be the matter of colours in a waterfall or metals that would resist the pressure of jupiter he sensed other things things not yet quite clear a vague whispering that hinted of greater things of mysteries beyond the pale of human thought beyond even the pale of human imagination mysteries fact logic built on reasoning things that any brain should know if it used all its reasoning power were still mostly earth he said were just beginning to learn a few of the things we are to knowa few of the things that were kept from us as human beings perhaps because we were human beings because our human bodies were poor bodies poorly equipped for thinking poorly equipped in certain senses that one has to have to know perhaps even lacking in certain senses that are necessary to true knowledge he stared back at the dome a tiny black thing dwarfed by the distance back there were men who couldnt see the beauty that was jupiter men who thought that swirling clouds and lashing rain obscured the planets face unseeing human eyes poor eyes eyes that could not see the beauty in the clouds that could not see through the storm bodies that could not feel the thrill of trilling music stemming from the rush of broken water men who walked alone in terrible loneliness talking with their tongue like boy scouts wigwagging out their messages unable to reach out and touch one anothers mind as he could reach out and touch towsers mind shut off forever from that personal intimate contact with other living things he fowler had expected terror inspired by alien things out here on the surface had expected to cower before the threat of unknown things had steeled himself against disgust of a situation that was not of earth but instead he had found something greater than man had ever known a swifter surer body a sense of exhilaration a deeper sense of life a sharper mind a world of beauty that even the dreamers of the earth had not yet imagined lets get going towser urged where do you want to go anywhere said towser just start going and see where we end up i have a feeling well a feeling yes i know said fowler for he had the feeling too the feeling of high destiny a certain sense of greatness a knowledge that somewhere off beyond the horizons lay adventure and things greater than adventure those other five had felt it too had felt the urge to go and see the compelling sense that here lay a life of fullness and of knowledge that he knew was why they had not returned i wont go back said towser we cant let them down said fowler fowler took a step or two back towards the dome then stopped back to the dome back to that aching poisonladen body he had left it hadnt seemed aching before but now he knew it was back to the fuzzy brain back to muddled thinking back to the flapping mouths that formed signals others understood back to eyes that now would be worse than no sight at all back to squalor back to crawling back to ignorance perhaps some day he said muttering to himself we got a lot to do and a lot to see said towser we got a lot to learn well find things yes they could find things civilizations perhaps civilizations that would make the civilization of man seem puny by comparison beauty and more important an understanding of that beauty and a comradeship no one had ever known beforethat no man no dog had ever known before and life the quickness of life after what seemed a drugged existence i cant go back said towser nor i said fowler they would turn me back into a dog said towser and me said fowler back into a man notes on the fifth tale bit by bit as the legend unfolds the reader gets a more accurate picture of the human race by degrees one gains the conviction that here is a race which can be little more than pure fantasy it is not the kind of race which could rise from humble beginnings to the eminence of culture with which it is gifted in these tales its equipment is too poor so far its lack of stability has become apparent its preoccupation with a mechanical civilization rather than with a culture based on some of the sounder more worthwhile concepts of life indicates a lack of basic character and now in this tale we learn of the limited communications which it possessed a situation which certainly is not conducive to advancement mans inability to understand and appreciate the thought and the viewpoint of another man would be a stumbling block which no amount of mechanical ability could overcome that man himself realized this is quite apparent in his anxiety to obtain the juwain philosophy but it will be noted that he did not wish it for the understanding that it might give him but for the power and glory and the knowledge that it might make possible the philosophy was seen by man as something which would advance him a hundred thousand years in the space of two short generations throughout these tales it becomes clear that man was running a race if not with himself then with some imagined follower who pressed close upon his heels breathing on his back man was engaged in a mad scramble for power and knowledge but nowhere is there any hint of what he meant to do with it once he had attained it he has according to the legend come from the caves a million years before and yet only a little over a hundred years before the time of this tale has he been able to eliminate killing as a basic part of his way of life here then is the true measure of his savagery after a million years he has rid himself of killing and he regards it as a great accomplishment to most readers it will be easy after reading this tale to accept rovers theory that man is set up deliberately as the antithesis of everything the dogs stand for a sort of mythical strawman a sociological fable this is underlined by the recurring evidence of mans aimlessness his constant running hither and yon his grasping at a way of life which continually eludes him possibly because he never knows exactly what he wants v paradise the dome was a squatted alien shape that did not belong beneath the purple mist of jupiter a huddled frightened structure that seemed to cower against the massive planet the creature that had been kent fowler stood spraddling on its thickset legs an alien thing he thought thats how far ive left the human race for its not alien at all not alien to me it is the place i lived in dreamed in planned in it is the place i leftafraid and it is the place i come back todriven and afraid driven by the memory of the people who were like me before i became the thing i am before i knew the aliveness and the fitness and the pleasure that is possible if one is not a human being towser stirred beside him and fowler sensed the bumbling friendliness of the onetime dog the expressed friendliness and comradeship and love that had existed all the time perhaps but was never known so long as they were man and dog the dogs thoughts seeped into his brain you cant do it pal said towser fowlers answer was almost a wail but i have to towser thats what i went out for to find what jupiter really is like and now i can tell them now i can bring them word you should have done it long ago said a voice deep inside of him a faint faroff human voice that struggled up through his jovian self but you were a coward and you put it offand put it off you ran away because you were afraid to go back afraid to be turned into a man again ill be lonesome said towser and yet he did not say it at least there were no wordsrather a feeling of loneliness a heartwrench cry at parting as if for the moment fowler had moved over and shared towsers mind fowler stood silent revulsion growing in him revulsion at the thought of being turned back into a maninto the inadequacy that was the human body and the human mind id come with you towser told him but i couldnt stand it i might die before i could get back i was nearly done for you remember i was old and full of fleas my teeth were worn right down to nubbins and my digestion was all shot and i had terrible dreams used to chase rabbits when i was a pup but towards the last it was the rabbits that were chasing me you stay here said fowler ill be coming back if can make them understand he thought if only i can if i can explain he lifted his massive head and stared at the lift of hills which swelled to mountain peaks shrouded in the rose and purple mist a lightning bolt snaked across the sky and the clouds and mist were lighted with a fire of ecstasy he shambled forwards slowly reluctantly a whiff of scent came down the breeze and his body drank it inlike a cat rolling in catnip and yet it wasnt scentalthough that was the closest he could come to it the nearest word he had in years to come the human race would develop a new terminology how could one he wondered explain the mist that drifted on the land and the scent that was pure delight other things theyd understand he knew that one never had to eat that one never slept that one was done with the whole range of depressive neurosis of which man was victim those things they would understand because they were things that could be told in simple terms things which could be explained in existent language but what about the other thingsthe factors that called for a new vocabulary the emotions that man had never known the abilities that man had never dreamed of the clarity of mind and the understandingthe ability to use ones brain down to the ultimate cell the things one knew and could do instinctively that man could never do because his body did not carry the senses with which they could be done ill write it down be told himself ill take my time and write it down but the written word he realized was a sorry tool a televisor port bulged out of the crystalline hide of the dome and he shambled towards it rivulets of condensed mist ran down across it and he reared up to stare straight into the port not that he could see anything but the men inside would see him the men who always watched staring out at the brutality of jupiter the roaring gales and ammonia rains the drifting clouds of deadly methane scudding past for that was the way that men saw jupiter he lifted a forepaw and wrote swiftly in the wetness on the portprinting backwards they had to know who it was so there would be no mistake they had to know what coordinates to use otherwise they might convert him back into the wrong body use the wrong matrix and he would come out somebody elseyoung allen maybe or smith or pelletier and that might well be fatal the ammonia ran down and blurred the printing wiped it out he wrote the name again they would understand that name they would know that one of the men who had been converted into a loper had come back to report he dropped to the ground and whirled around staring at the door which led into the converter unit the door moved slowly swinging outwards goodbye towser said fowler softly a warning cry rose in his brain its not too late you arent in there yet you still can change your mind you still can turn and run he plodded on determined gritting mental teeth he felt the metal floor underneath his pads sensed the closing of the door behind him he caught one last fragmentary thought from towser and then there was only darkness the conversion chamber lay just ahead and he moved up the sloping ramp to reach it a man and a dog went out he thought and now the man comes back the press conference had gone well there had been satisfactory things to report yes tyler webster told the newsmen the trouble on venus had been all smoothed out just a matter of the parties involved sitting down and talking the life experiments out in the cold laboratories of pluto were progressing satisfactorily the expedition for centauri would leave as scheduled despite reports it was all balled up the trade commission soon would issue new monetary schedules on various interplanetary products ironing out a few inequalities nothing sensational nothing to make headlines nothing to lead off the newscast and jon culver tells me said webster to remind you gentlemen that today is the one hundred and twentyfifth anniversary of the last murder committed in the solar system one hundred and twentyfive years without a death by premeditated violence he leaned back in the chair and grinned at them masking the thing he dreaded the question that he knew would come but they were not ready to ask it yetthere was a custom to be observeda very pleasant custom burly stephen andrews press chief for interplanetary news clearing his throat as if about to make an important announcement asked with what amounted to mock gravity and hows the boy a smile broke across websters face im going home for the weekend he said i bought my son a toy he reached out lifted the little tube from off the desk an oldfashioned toy he said guaranteed oldfashioned a company just started putting them out you put it up to your eye and turn it and you see pretty pictures coloured glass falling into place theres a name for it kaleidoscope said one of the newsmen quickly ive read about them in an old history on the manners and customs of the early twentieth century have you tried it mr chairman asked andrews no said webster to tell the truth i havent i just got it this afternoon and ive been too busy whered you get it mr chairman asked a voice i got to get one of those for my own kid at the shop just around the corner the toy shop you know they just came in today now webster knew was the time for them to go a little bit of pleasant friendly banter and theyd get up and leave but they werent leavingand he knew they werent he knew it by the sudden inrush and the papers that rattled quickly to cover up the hush then stephen andrews was asking the question that webster had dreaded for a moment webster was grateful that andrews should be the one to ask it andrews had been friendly generally speaking and interplanetary press dealt in objective news with none of the sly slanting of words employed by interpretative writers mr chairman said andrews we understand a man who was converted on jupiter has come back to earth we would like to ask you if the report is true it is true said webster stiffly they waited and webster waited unmoving in his chair would you wish to comment asked andrews finally no said webster webster glanced around the room ticking off the faces tensed faces sensing some of the truth beneath his flat refusal to discuss the matter amused faces masking brains that even now were thinking how they might twist the few words he had spoken angry faces that would write outraged interpretative pieces about the peoples right to know i am sorry gentlemen said webster andrews rose heavily from the chair thank you mr chairman he said webster sat in his chair and watched them go felt the coldness and emptiness of the room when they were gone theyll crucify me he thought theyll nail me to the barn door and i havent got a comeback not a single one he rose from the chair and walked across the room stood staring out of the window at the garden in the sunlight of afternoon yet you simply couldnt tell them paradise heaven for the asking and the end of humanity the end of all the ideals and all the dreams of mankind the end of the race itself the green light on his desk flashed and chirped and he strode back across the room what is it he asked the tiny screen flashed and a face was there the dogs just reported sir that joe the mutant went to your residence and jenkins let him in joe youre sure thats what the dogs said and the dogs are never wrong no said webster slowly no they never are the face faded from the screen and webster sat down heavily he reached with numbed fingers for the contro panel on his desk twirled the combination without looking the house loomed on the screen the house in north america that crouched on the windy hilltop a structure that had stood for almost a thousand years a place where a long line of websters had lived and dreamed and died far in the blue above the house a crow was flying and webster heard or imagined that he heard the windblown cow of the soaring bird everything was all rightor seemed to be the house drowsed in the morning light and the statue still stood upon the sweep of lawnthe statue of that longgone ancestor who had vanished on the starpath allen webster who had been the first to leave the solar system heading for centaurieven as the expedition now on mars would head out in a day or two there was no stir about the house no sign of any moving thing websters hand moved out and flipped a toggle the screen went dead jenkins can handle things he thought probably better than a man could handle them after all hes got almost a thousand years of wisdom packed in that metal hide of his hell be calling in before long to let me know what its all about his hand reached out set up another combination he waited for long seconds before the face came on the screen what is it tyler asked the face just got a report that joe jon culver nodded i just got it too im checking up what do you make of it the face of the world security chief wrinkled quizzically softening up maybe weve been pushing joe and the other mutants pretty hard the dogs have done a topnotch job but there has been no sign of it protested webster nothing in the records to indicate any trend that way look said culver they havent drawn a breath for more than a hundred years we havent known about got everything theyve done down on tape in black and white every move theyve made weve blocked at first they figured it was just tough luck but now they know it isnt maybe theyve up and decided they are licked i dont think so said webster solemnly whenever those babies figure theyre licked you better start looking for a place thats soft to light ill keep on top of it culver told him ill keep you posted the plate faded and was a square of glass webster stared at it moodily the mutants werent lickednot by a long shot he knew that and so did culver and yetwhy had joe gone to jenkins why hadnt he contacted the government here in geneva face saving maybe dealing through a robot after all joe had known jenkins for a long long time unaccountably webster felt a surge of pride pride that if such were the case joe had gone to jenkins for jenkins despite his metal hide was a webster too pride thought webster accomplishment and mistake but always counting for something each of them down the years jerome who had lost the world the juwain philosophy and thomas who had given the world the spacedrive principle that now had been perfected and thomas son allen who had tried for the stars and failed and bruce who had first conceived the twin civilization of man and dog now finally himselftyler webster chairman of the world committee sitting at the desk he clasped his hands in front of him stared at the evening light pouring through the window waiting he confessed waiting for the snicker of the signal that would tell him jenkins was calling to report on joe if only if only an understanding could be reached if only mutants and men could work together if they could forget this half hidden war of stalemate they could go far the three of them togetherman and dog and mutants webster shook his head it was too much to expect the difference was too great the breach too wide suspicion on the part of men and a tolerant amusement on the part of the mutants would keep the two apart for the mutants were a different race an offshoot that had jumped too far ahead men who had become true individuals with no need of society no need of human approval utterly lacking in the herd instinct that had held the race together immune to social pressures and because of the mutants the little group of mutated dogs so far had been of little practical use to their older brother man for the dogs had watched for more than a hundred years had been the police force that kept the human mutants under observation webster slid back his chair opened a desk drawer took out a sheaf of papers one eye on the televisor plate he snapped over the toggle that called his secretary yes mr webster im going to call on mr fowler said webster if a call comes through the secretarys voice shook just a little if one does sir ill contact you right away thanks said webster he snapped the toggle back theyve heard of it already he thought everyone in the whole building is standing around with their tongues hanging out waiting for the news kent fowler lounged in a chair in the garden outside his room watching the little black terrier dig frantically after an imagined rabbit you know rover said fowler you arent fooling me the dog stopped digging looked over his shoulder with grinning teeth barked excitedly then went back to digging youll slip up one of these days fowler told him and say a word or two and ill have you dead to rights rover went on digging foxy little devil thought fowler smarter than a whip webster sicked him on me and hes played the part all right hes dug for rabbits and hes been disrespectful to the shrubs and hes scratched for fleasthe perfect picture of a perfect dog but im on to him im on to all of them a foot crunched in the grass and fowler looked up good evening said tyler webster ive been wondering when youd come said fowler shortly sit down and give it to mestraight you dont believe me do you webster eased himself into the second chair laid the sheaf of papers in his lap i can understand how you feel he said i doubt if you can snapped fowler i came here bringing news that i thought was important a report that had cost me more than you can imagine he hunched forward in his chair i wonder if you can realize that every hour ive spent as a human being has been mental torture im sorry said webster but we had to be sure we had to check your reports and make certain tests webster nodded like rover over there his name isnt rover said webster gently if youve been calling him that youve hurt his feelings all the dogs have human names this ones elmer elmer had stopped his digging was trotting towards them he sat down beside websters chair scrubbed at his dirtfilled whiskers with a claysmeared paw what bout it elmer asked webster hes human all right said the dog but not all human not a mutant you know but something else something alien thats to be expected said fowler i was a loper for five years webster nodded youd retain part of the personality thats understandable and the dog would spot it theyre sensitive to things like that psychic almost thats why we put them on the mutants they can sniff one out no matter where he is you mean that you believe me webster rustled the papers in his lap smoothed them out with a careful hand im afraid i do why afraid because webster told him youre the greatest threat mankinds ever faced threat man dont you understand im offering you offering you yes i know said webster the word is paradise and youre afraid of that terrified said webster just try to envision what it would mean if we told the people and the people all believed everyone would want to go to jupiter and become a loper the very fact that the lopers apparently have life spans running into thousands of years would be reason enough if there were no others we would be faced by a systemwide demand that everyone immediately be sent to jupiter no one would want to remain human in the end there would be no humansall the humans would be lopers had you thought of that fowler licked his lips with a nervous tongue certainly that is what i had expected the human race would disappear said webster speaking evenly it would be wiped out it would junk all the progress it has made over thousands of years it would disappear just when it is on the verge of its greatest advancement but you dont know protested fowler you cant know youve never been a loper i have he tapped his chest i know what it is like webster shook his head im not arguing on that score im ready to concede that it may be better to be a loper than a human what i cant concede is that we would be justified in wiping out the human racethat we should trade what the human race has done and will do for what the lopers might do the human race is going places maybe not so pleasantly nor so clearheadedly nor as brilliantly as your lopers but in the long run i have a feeling that it will go much farther we have a racial heritage and a racial destiny that we cant throw away fowler leaned forward in his chair look he said ive played this fair i came straight to you and the world committee i could have told the press and radio and forced your hand but i didnt do it what youre getting at suggested webster is that the world committee doesnt have the right to decide this thing themselves youre suggesting that the people have their say about it fowler nodded tightlipped frankly said webster i dont trust the people youd get mob reaction selfish response not a one of them would think about the race but only of themselves are you telling me asked fowler that im right but you cant do a thing about it not exactly well have to work out something maybe jupiter could be made a sort of old folks home after a man had lived out a useful life fowler made a tearing sound of disgust deep inside his throat a reward he snapped turning an old horse out to pasture paradise by special dispensation that way webster pointed out wed save the human race and still have jupiter fowler came to his feet in a swift lithe motion im sick of it he shouted i brought you a thing you wanted to know a thing you spent billions of dollars and so far as you knew hundreds of lives to find out you set up reconversion stations all over jupiter and you sent out men by dozens and they never came back and you thought that they were dead and still you sent out others and none of them came backbecause they didnt want to come back because they couldnt come back because they couldnt stomach being men again then i came back and what does it amount to a lot of highflown talk a lot of quibbling questioning me and doubting me then finally saying i am all right but that i made a mistake in coming back at all he let his arms fall to his side and his shoulders drooped im free i suppose he said i dont need to stay here webster nodded slowly certainly you are free you were free all the time i only asked that you stay until i could check i could go back to jupiter in the light of the situation said webster that might be a good idea im surprised you didnt suggest it said fowler bitterly it would be an out for you you could file away the report and forget about it and go on running the solar system like a childs game played on a parlour floor your family has blundered its way through centuries and the people let you come back for more one of your ancestors lost the world the juwain philosophy and another blocked the effort of the humans to cooperate with the mutants webster spoke sharply leave me and my family out of this fowler it is a thing thats bigger but fowler was shouting drowning out his words and im not going to let you bungle this the world has lost enough because of you websters now the worlds going to get a break im going to tell the people about jupiter ill tell the press and radio ill yell it from the housetops ill his voice broke and his shoulders shook websters voice was cold with sudden rage ill fight you fowler ill go on the beam against you i cant let you do a thing like this fowler bad swung around was striding towards the garden gate webster frozen in his chair felt the paw clawing at his leg shall i get him boss asked elmer shall i go and get him webster shook his head let him go he said he has as much right as i have to do the thing he wishes a chill wind came across the garden wall and rustled the cape about websters shoulders words beat in his brainwords that had been spoken here in this garden scant seconds ago but words that came from centuries away one of your ancestors lost the juwain philosophy one of your ancestors webster clenched his fists until the nails dug into his palms a jinx thought webster thats what we are a jinx upon humanity the juwain philosophy and the mutants but the mutants had had the juwain philosophy for centuries now and they had never used it joe had stolen it from grant and grant had spent his life trying to get it back but he never had maybe thought webster trying to console himself it really didnt amount to much if it had the mutants would have used it or maybejust maybethe mutants had been bluffing maybe they didnt know any more about it than the humans did a metallic voice coughed softly and webster looked up a small grey robot stood just outside the doorway the call sir said the robot the call youve been expecting jenkins face came into the platean old face obsolete and ugly not the smooth lifelike face boasted by the latest model robots im sorry to disturb you sir he said but it is most unusual joe came up and asked to use our visor to put in a call to you wont tell me what he wants sir says its just a friendly call to an oldtime neighbour put him on said webster he went at it most unusual sir persisted jenkins he came up and sat around and chewed the fat for an hour or more before he asked to use it id say if youd pardon me that its most peculiar i know said webster joe is peculiar in a lot of ways jenkins face faded from the screen and another face came inthat of joe the mutant it was a strong face with a wrinkled leathery skin and bluegrey eyes that twinkled hair that was just turning salt and pepper at the temples jenkins doesnt trust me tyler said joe and webster felt his hackles rising at the laughter that lurked behind the words for that matter he told him bluntly neither do i joe clucked with his tongue why tyler weve never given you a single minutes trouble not a single one of us youve watched us and youve worried and fretted about us but weve never hurt you youve had so many of the dogs spying on us that we stumble over them everywhere we turn and youve kept files on us and studied us and talked us up and down until you must be sick to death of it we know you said webster grimly we know more about you than you know about yourselves we know how many there are of you and we know each of you personally want to know what any one of you were doing at any given moment in the last hundred years or so ask us and well tell you butter wouldnt have melted in joes mouth and all the time he said we were thinking kindly of you figuring out how sometime we might want to help you why didnt you do it then snapped webster we were ready to work with you at first even after you stole the juwain philosophy from grant stole it asked joe surely tyler you must have that wrong we only took it so we could work it out it was all botched up you know you probably figured it out the day after you had your hands on it webster told him flatly what were you waiting for any time you had offered that to us wed known that you were with us and wed have worked with you wed have caled off the dogs wed have accepted you funny thing said joe we never seemed to care about being accepted and the old laughter was back again the laughter of a man who was sufficient to himself who saw the whole fabric of the human community of effort as a vast ironic joke a man who walked alone and liked it a man who saw the human race as something that was funny and probably just a little dangerousbut funnier than ever because it was dangerous a man who felt no need of the brotherhood of man who rejected that brotherhood as a thing as utterly pro vincial and pathetic as the twentieth century booster clubs ok said webster sharply if thats the way you want it id hoped that maybe you had a deal to offersome chance of conciliation we dont like things as they arewed rather they were different but the move is up to you now tyler protested joe no use in flying off the handle i was thinking maybe youd ought to know about the juwain philosophy youve sort of forgotten about it now but there was a time when the system was all stirred up about it all right said webster go ahead and tell me the tone of his voice said he knew joe wouldnt basically said joe you humans are a lonely lot of folks you never have known your fellowman you cant know him because you havent the common touch of understanding that makes it possible to know him you have friendships sure but those friendships are based on pure emotions never on real understanding you get along together sure but you get along by tolerance rather than by understanding you work out your problems by agreement but that agreement is simply a matter of the strongerminded among you beating down the opposition of the weaker ones whats that got to do with it why everything joe told him with the juwain philosophy youd actually understand telepathy asked webster not exactly said joe we mutants have telepathy but this is something different the juwain philosophy provides an ability to sense the viewpoint of another it wont necessarily make you agree with that viewpoint but it does make you recognize it you not only know what the other fellow is talking about but how he feels about it with juwains philosophy you have to accept the validity of another mans ideas and knowledge not just the words he says but the thought back of the words semantics said webster if you insist on the term joe told him what it really means is that you understand not only the intrinsic meaning but the implied meaning of what someone else is saying almost telepathy but not quite a whole lot better some ways and joe how do you go about it how do you the laughter was back again you think about it a while tyler find out how bad you want it then maybe we can talk horse trading said webster joe nodded boobytrapped too i suppose said webster couple of them said joe you find them and well talk about that too what are you fellows going to want plenty joe told him but maybe itll be worth it the screen went dead and webster sat staring at it with unseeing eyes boobytrapped of course it was clear up to the hilt webster screwed his eyes shut and felt the blood pounding in his brain what was it that had been claimed for the juwain philosophy in that fargone day when it had been lost that it would have put mankind a hundred thousand years ahead in two short generations something like that maybe stretching it a bitbut not too much a little justified exaggeration that was all men understanding one another accepting one anothers ideas at face value each man seeing behind the words seeing the thing as someone else would see it and accepting that concept as if it were his own making it in fact part of his own knowledge that could be brought to bear upon the subject at band no misunderstanding no prejudice no bias no janglingbut a clear complete grasp of all the conflicting angles of any human problem applicable to anything to any type of human endeavour to sociology psychology to engineering to all the various facets of a complex civilization no more bungling no more quarrelling but honest and sincere appraisal of the facts and the ideas at hand a hundred thousand years in two generations perhaps not too far off at that but boobytrapped or was it did the mutants really mean to part with it for any kind of prize just another bait dangled in front of mankinds eyes while around the corner the mutants rolled with laughter the mutants hadnt used it of course they hadnt for they had no real need of it they already had telepathy and that would serve the purpose as far as the mutants were concerned individualists would have little use for a device which would make them understand one another for they would not care whether they understood one another the mutants got along together apparently tolerating whatever contact was necessary to safeguard their interests but that was all theyd work together to save their skins but they found no pleasure in it an honest offer a bait a lure to hold a mans attention in one quarter while a dirty deal was being pulled off in another a mere ironic joke or an offer that had a stinger in it webster shook his head there was no telling no way to gauge a mutants motives or his reason soft glowing light had crept into the walls and ceiling of the office with the departing of the day the automatic hidden light growing stronger a the darkness fell webster glanced at the window saw that it was an oblong of blackness dotted by the few advertising signs that flared and flickered on the citys skyline he reached out thumbed over a tumbler spoke to the secretary in the outer office im sorry i kept you so long i forgot the time thats all right sir said the secretary theres a visitor to see you mr fowler fowler yes the gentleman from jupiter i know said webster wearily ask him to come in he had almost forgotten fowler and the threat the man had made he stared absentmindedly at his desk saw the kaleidoscope lying where hed left it funny toy he thought quaint idea a simple thing for the simple minds of long ago but the kid will get a boot out of it he reached out a hand and grasped it lifted it to his eyes the transmitted light wove a pattern of crazy colour a geometric nightmare he twirled the tube a bit and the pattern changed and yet againhis brain wrenched with a sudden sickness and the colour burned itself into his mind in a single flare of soultwisting torture the tube dropped and clattered on the desk webster reached out with both hands and clutched at the desk edge and through his brain went the thought of horror what a toy for a kid the sickness faded and he sat stockstill brain clear again breath coming regularly funny he thought funny that it should do a thing like that or could it have been something else and not the kaleidoscope at all a seizure of some sort heart acting up a bit too young for that and hed been checked just recently the door clicked and webster looked up fowler came across the room with measured step slowly until he stood across from the desk yes fowler i left in anger fowler said and i didnt want it that way you might have understood but again you might not have it was just that i was upset you see i came from jupiter feeling that finally all the years id spend there in the domes bad been justified that all the anguish i had felt when i saw the men go out somehow had paid off i was bringing news you understand news that the world awaited to me it was the most wonderful thing that could have happened and i thought youd see it too i thought the people would see it it was as if i had been bringing them word that paradise was just around the corner for that is what it is webster that is what it is he put his hands flat upon the desk and leaned forward whispering you see how it is dont you webster you understand a bit websters hands were shaking and he laid them in his lap clenched them together until the fingers hurt yes he whispered back yes i think i know for he did know knew more than the words had told him knew the anguish and the pleading and bitter disappointment that lay behind the words knew them almost as if hed said the words himselfalmost as if he were fowler fowlers voice broke in alarm whats the matter webster whats the trouble with you webster tried to speak and the words were dust his throat tightened until there was a knot of pain above his adams apple he tried again and the words were low and forced tell me fowler you learned a lot of things out there things that men dont know or know imperfectly like high grade telepathy maybe or or yes said fowler a lot of things but i didnt bring them back with me when i became a man again that was all i was just a man thats all none of it came back most of it just hazy memories and a well you might call it yearning you mean that you havent one of the abilities you had when you were a loper not a single one you couldnt by chance be able to make me understand a thing you wanted me to know make me feel the way you feel not a chance said fowler webster reached out a hand pushed the kaleidoscope gently with his finger it rolled forwards then came to rest again what did you come back for asked webster to square myself with you said fowler to let you know i wasnt really sore to try to make you understand that i had a side too just a difference of opinion thats all i thought maybe we might shake on it i see and youre still determined to go out and tell the people fowler nodded i have to webster you must surely know that its its well almost a religion with me its something i believe in i have to tell the rest of them that theres a better world and a better life i have to lead them to it a messiah said webster fowler straightened thats one thing i was afraid of scoffing isnt i wasnt scoffing webster told him almost gently he picked up the kaleidoscope polishing its tube with the palm of his hand considering not yet he thought not yet have to think it out do i want him to understand me as well as i understand him look fowler he said lay off a day or two wait a bit just a day or two then let us talk again ive waited long enough already but i want you to think this over a million years ago man first came into beingjust an animal since that time he had inched his way up a cultural ladder bit by painful bit he has developed a way of life a philosophy a way of doing things his progress has been geometrical today he does much more than he did yesterday tomorrow hell do even more than he did today for the first time in human history man is really beginning to hit the ball hes just got a good start the first stride you might say hes going a lot farther in a lot less time than hes come already maybe it isnt as pleasant as jupiter maybe not the same at all maybe humankind is drab compared with the life forms of jupiter but its mans life its the thing hes fought for its the thing hes made himself its a destiny he has shaped i hate to think fowler that just when were going good well swap our destiny for one we dont know about for one we cant be sure about ill wait said fowler just a day or two but im warning you you cant put me off you cant change my mind thats all i ask said webster he rose and held out his hand shake on it he asked but even as he shook fowlers hand webster knew it wasnt any good juwain philosophy or not mankind was heading for a showdown a showdown that coud be even worse because of the juwain philosophy for the mutants wouldnt miss a bet if this was to be their joke if this was their way of getting rid of the human race they wouldnt overlook a thing by tomorrow morning every man woman and child somehow or other would have managed to look through a kaleidoscope or something else lord only knew how many other ways there were he watched until fowler had closed the door behind him then walked to the window and stared out flashing on the skyline of the city was a new advcrtising signone that had not been there before a crazy sign that made crazy coloured patterns in the night flashing on and off as if one were turning a kaleidoscope webster stared at it tightlipped he should have expected it he thought of joe with a flare of murderous fury surging through his brain for that call had been a cackling chortle behind a covering hand a smartaleck gesture designed to let man know what it was all about to let him know after he was behind the eightball and couldnt do a thing about it we should have killed them off thought webster and was surprised at the calm coldness of the thought we should have stamped them out like we would a dangerous disease but man had forsaken violence as a world and individual policy not for one hundred and twentyfive years had one group been arrayed against another group in violence when joe had called the juwain philosophy had lain on the desk i had only to reach out my hand and touch it webster thought he stiffened with the realization of it i had only to reach out my hand and touch it andi did just that something more than telepathy something more than guessing joe knew he would pick up the kaleidoscopemust have known it foresightan ability to roll back the future just an hour or so perhaps but that would be enough joeand the other mutants of coursehad known about fowler their probing telepathic minds could have told them all that they wished to know but this was something else something different he stood at the window staring at the sign thousands of people he knew were seeing it seeing it and feeling that sudden sick impact in their mind webster frowned wondering about the shifting pattern of the lights some physiological impact upon a certain centre of the human brain perhaps a portion of the brain that had not been used beforea portion of the brain that in due course of human development might naturally have come into its proper function a function now that was being forced the juwain philosophy at last something for which men had sought for centuries now flnally come to pass given man at a time when hed have been better off without it fowler had written in his report i cannot give a factual account because there are no words for the facts that i want to tell he still didnt have the words of course but he had something else that was even betteran audience that could understand the sincerity and the greatness which lay beneath the words be did have an audience with a newfound sense which would enable them to grasp some of the mighty scope of the thing fowler had to tell joe had planned it that way had waited for this moment had used the juwain philosophy as a weapon against the human race for with the juwain philosophy man would go to jupiter faced by all the logic in the world he still would go to jupiter for better or for worse he would go to jupiter the only chance there had ever been of winning against fowler had been fowlers inability to describe what he saw to tell what he felt to reach the people with a clear exposition of the message that he brought with mere human words that message would have been vague and fuzzy and while the people at first might have believed they would have been shaky in their belief would have listened to other argument but now that chance was gone for the words would be no longer vague and fuzzy the people would know as clearly and as vibrantly as fowler knew himself what jupiter was like the people would go to jupiter would enter upon a life other than the human life and the solar system the entire solar system with the exception of jupiter would lie open for the new race of mutants to take over to develop any kind of culture that they might wisha culture that would scarcely follow the civilization of the parent race webster swung away from the window strode back to the desk he stooped and pulled out a drawer reached inside his hand came out clutching something that he had never dreamed of usinga relic a museum piece he had tossed there years before with a handkerchief he polished the metal of the gun tested its mechanism with trembling fingers fowler was the key with fowler dead with fowler dead and the jupiter stations dismantled and abandoned the mutants would be licked man would have the juwain philosophy and would retain his destiny the centauri expedition would blast off for the stars the life experiments would continue on pluto man would march along the course that his culture plotted faster than ever before faster than anyone could dream two great strides the renunciation of violence as a human policythe understanding that came with the juwain philosophy the two great things that would speed man along the road to wherever he was going the renunciation of the violence and the webster stared at the gun clutched in his hand and heard the roar of winds tumbling through his head two great stridesand he was about to toss away the first for one hundred and twentyfive years no man had killed anotherfor more than a thousand years killing had been obsolete as a factor in the determination of human affairs a thousand years of peace and one death might undo the work one shot in the night might collapse the structure might hurl man back to the old bestial thinking webster killedwhy cant i after all there are some men who should be killed webster did right but he shouldnt have stopped with only one i dont see why theyre hanging him hed ought to get a medal we ought to start on the mutants first if it hadnt been for them that was the way theyd talk that thought webster is the wind thats roaring in my brain the flashing of the crazy coloured sign made a ghostly flicker along the walls and floor fowler is seeing that thought webster he is looking at it and even if he isnt i still have the kaleidoscope hell be coming in and well sit down and talk well sit down and talk he tossed the gun back into the drawer walked towards the door notes on the sixth tale if there has been any doubt concerning the origin of the other tales in the legend there can be no doubt in this here in the sixth tale we have unmistakably the hallmarks of doggish story telling it has the deeper emotional value the close attention to ethical matters which are stressed in all other doggish myths and yet strangely enough it is in this particular tale that tige finds his weightiest evidence of the actuality of the human race here he points out we have evidence that the dogs told these selfsame tales beforethe blazing fire when they sat and talked of man buried in geneva or gone to jupiter here he says we are given an account of the dogs first probing into the cobbly worlds their first step towards the development of an animal brotherhood here too he thinks we have evidence that man was another contemporary race which went part way down the path of culture with the dogs whether or not the disaster which is portrayed in this tale is the one which actually overwhelmed man tige says we cannot be sure he admits that through the centuries the tale as we know it today has been embellished and embroidered but it does provide he contends good and substantial evidence that some disaster was visited upon the human race rover who does not admit to the factual evidence seen by tige believes that the storyteller in this tale brings to a logical conclusion a culture such as man developed without at least broad purpose without certain implanted stability no culture can survive and this is the lesson rover believes the tale is meant to spell man in this story is treated with a certain tenderness which is not accorded him in any of the other tales he is at once a lonely and pitiful creature and yet somehow glorious it is entirely typical of him that in the end he should make a grand gesture that he should purchase godhood by selfimmolation yet the worship which is accorded him by ebenezer has certain disturbing overtones which have become the source of particularly bitter dispute among the legends students bounce in his book the myth of man asks this question if man had taken a different path might he not in time to come have been as great as dog it is a question perhaps that many readers of the legend have stopped to ask themselves vi hobbies the rabbit ducked around a bush and the little black dog zipped after him then dug in his heels and skidded in the pathway stood a wolf the rabbits twitching bloody body hanging from his jaws ebenezer stood very still and panted red rag of a tongue lolling out a little faint and sick at the sight before him it had been such a nice rabbit feet pattered on the trail behind him and shadow whizzed around the bush slid to a stop alongside ebenezer the wolf flicked his glare from the dog to the pintsize robot then back to the dog again the yellow light of wildness slowly faded from his eyes you shouldnt have done that wolf said ebenezer softly the rabbit knew i wouldnt hurt him and it was all in fun but he ran straight into you and you snapped him up theres no use talking to him shadow hissed out of the corner of his mouth he doesnt know a word youre saying next thing you know hell be gulping you not with you around he wont said ebenezer and anyhow he knows me he remembers last winter he was one of the pack we fed the wolf paced forward slowly step by cautious step until less than two feet separated him from the little dog then very slowly very carefully he laid the rabbit on the ground nudged it forward with his nose shadow made a tiny sound that was almost a gasp hes giving it to you i know said ebenezer calmly i told you he remembered hes the one that had a frozen ear and jenkins fixed it up the dog advanced a step tail wagging nose outstretched the wolf stiffened momentarily then lowered his ugly head and sniffed for a second the two noses almost rubbed together then the wolf stepped back lets get out of here urged shadow you hightail it down the trail and ill bring up the rear if he tries anything he wont try anything snapped ebenezer hes a friend of ours its not his fault about the rabbit he doesnt understand its the way he lives to him a rabbit is just a piece of meat even he thought as it once was for us as it was for us before the first dog came to sit with a man before a cavemouth fire and for a long time after that even now a rabbit sometimes moving slowly almost apologetically the wolf reached forward gathered up the rabbit in his gaping jaws his tail movednot quite a wag but almost you see cried ebenezer and the wolf was gone his feet moved and there was a blur of grey fading through the trees a shadow drifting in the forest he took it back fumed shadow why the dirty but he gave it to me said ebenezer triumphantly only he was so hungry he couldnt make it stick he did something a wolf has never done before for a moment he was more than an animal indian giver snapped shadow ebenezer shook his head he was ashamed when he took it back you saw him wag his tail that was explaining to me explaining he was hungry and he needed it worse than i needed it the dog stared down the green aisles of the fairy forest smelled the scent of decaying leaves the heady perfume of hepatica and bloodrot and spidery windflower the quick sharp odour of the new leaf of the woods in early spring maybe some day he said yeah i know said shadow maybe some day the wolves will be civilized too and the rabbits and squirrels and all the other wild things the way you dogs go mooning around it isnt mooning ebenezer told him dreaming maybe men used to dream they used to sit around and think up things thats how we happened a man named webster thought us up he messed around with us he fixed up our throats so we would talk he rigged up contact lenses so that we could read he a lot of good it did men for all their dreaming said shadow peevishly and that thought ebenezer was the solemn truth not many men left now just the mutants squatting in their towers and doing no one knows what and the little colony of real men still living in geneva the others long ago had gone to jupiter had gone to jupiter and changed themselves into things that were not human slowly tail drooping ebenezer swung around clumped slowly up the path too bad about the rabbit he thought it had been such a nice rabbit it had run so well and it really wasnt scared he had chased it lots of times and it knew he wouldnt catch it but even at that ebenezer couldnt bring himself to blame the wolf to a wolf a rabbit wasnt just something that was fun to chase for the wolf had no herds for meat and milk no fields of grain for meal to make dog biscuits what i ought to do grumbled the remorseless shadow treading at his heels is tell jenkins that you ran out you know that you should be listening ebenezer did not answer kept on trudging up the trail for what shadow said was true instead of rabbitchasing he should have been sitting up at webster house listening listening for the things that came to onesounds and scents and awareness of something that was near like listening on one side of a wall to the things that were happening on the other only they were faint and sometimes far away and hard to catch even harder most times to understand its the animal in me thought ebenezer the old fleascratching bonechewing gopherdigging dog that will not let me be that sends me sneaking out to chase a rabbit when i should be listening out prowling the forest when i should be reading the old books from the shelves that line the study wall too fast he told himself we came up too fast had to come up too fast it took man thousands of years to turn his grunts into the rudiments of speech thousands of years to discover fire and thousands more of years to invent the bow and arrow thousands of years to learn to till the soil and harvest food thousands of years to forsake the cave for a house he built himself but in a little more than a thousand years from the day we learned to talk we were on our ownour own that is except for jenkins the forest thinned out into gnarled scattered oaks that straggled up the hill like hobbling old men who had wandered off the path the house stood on the hilltop a huddled structure that had taken root and crouched close against the earth so old that it was the colour of the things around it of grass and flowers and trees of sky and wind and weather a house built by men who loved it and the surrounding acres even as the dogs now loved them built and lived in and died in by a legendary family that had left a meteoric trail across centuries of time men who lent their shadows to the stories that were told around the blazing fireplace of stormy nights when the wind sucked along the eaves stories of bruce webster and the first dog nathaniel of a man named grant who had given nathaniel a word to pass along of anotherman who had tried to reach the stars and of the old man who had sat waiting for him in the wheelchair on the lawn and other stories of the ogre mutants the dogs had watched for years and now the men had gone and the family was a name and the dogs carried on as grant had told nathaniel that fargone day they must as if you were men as if the dog were man those were the words that had been handed down for ten full centuriesand at last the time had come the dogs had come home when the men had gone come from the far corners of the earth back to the place where the first dog had spoken the first word where the first dog had read the first line of printback to webster house where a man long ago had dreamed of a dual civilization of man and dog going down the ages hand in paw weve done the best we could said ebenezer almost as if he were speaking to someone we still are doing it from the other side of the hill came the tinkle of a cow bell a burst of frantic barking the pups were bringing in the cows for the evening milking the dust of centuries lay within the vault a grey powdery dust that was not an alien thing but a part of the place itself the part that had died in the passing of the years jon webster smelled the acrid scent of the dust cutting through the mustiness of the room heard the silence humming like a song within his head one dim radium bulb glowed above the panel with its switch and wheel and half a dozen dials fearful of disturbing the sleeping silence webster moved forward quietly half awed by the weight of time that seemed to press down from the ceiling he reached out a finger and touched the open switch as if he had expected it might not be there as if he must feel the pressure of it against his fingertip to know that it was there and it was there it and the wheel and dials with the single light above them and that was all there was nothing else in all that small bare vault there was nothing else exactly as the old map had said that it would be jon webster shook his head thinking i might have known that it would have been the map was right the map remembered we were the ones that had forgottenforgotten or never known or never cared and he knew that more than likely it was the last that would be right never cared although it was probable that very few had ever known about this vault had never known because it was best that only few should know that it never had been used was no factor in its secrecy there might have been a day he stared at the panel wondering slowly his hand reached out again and then he jerked it back better not he told himself better not for the map had given no clue to the purpose of the vault to the mechanics of the switch defence the map had said and that was all defence of course there would have been defence back in that day of a thousand years ago a defence that never had been needed but a defence that had to be there a defence against the emergency of uncertainty for the brotherhood of peoples even then was a shaky thing that a single word or act might have thrown out of kilter even after ten centuries of peace the memory of war would have been a living thing an everpresent possibility in the mind of the world committee something to be circumvented something to be ready for webster stood stiff and straight listening to the pulse of history beating in the room history that had run its course and ended history that had come to a dead enda stream that suddenly had flowed into the backwater of a few hundred futile human lives and now was a stagnant pool unrelieved by the eddying of human struggle and achievement he reached out a hand put it flat against the masonry felt the slimy cold the rough crawl of dust beneath his palm the foundation of empire he thought the subcellar of empire the nethermost stone of the towering structure that soared in proud strength on the surface far abovea great building that in olden times had hummed with the business of a solar system an empire not in the sense of conquest but an empire of orderly human relations based on mutual respect and tolerant understanding a seat of human government lent an easy confidence by the psychological fact of an adequate and foolproof defence for it would have been both adequate and foolproof it would have had to be the men of that day took no chances overlooked no bets they had come up through the hard school and they knew their way around slowly webster swung about stared at the trail his feet had left across the dust silently stepping carefully following the trail hed made be left the vault closed the massive door behind him and spun the lock that held its secret fast climbing the tunnelled stairs he thought now i can write my history my notes are almost complete and i know how it should go it will be brilliant and exhaustive and it might be interesting if anyone should read it but he knew that no one would no one would take the time or care for a long moment webster stood on the broad marble steps before his house looking down the street a pretty street he told himself the prettiest street in all geneva with its boulevard of trees its carefully tended flower beds the walks that glistened with the scrub and polish of ever working robots no one moved along the street and it wasnt strange the robots had finished their work early in the day and there were few people from some high treetop a bird sang and the song was one with the sun and flowers a gladsome song that strained at the bursting throat a song that tripped and skipped with boundless joy a neat street drowsing in the sun and a great proud city that had lost its purpose a street that should be filled with laughing children and strolling lovers and old men resting in the sun and a city the last city on earth the only city on earth that should be filled with noise and business a bird sang and a man stood on the steps and looked and the tulips nodded blissfully in the tiny fragrant breeze that wafted down the street webster turned to the door fumbled it open walked across the threshold the room was hushed and solemn cathedrallike with its stained glass windows and soft carpeting old wood glowed with the patina of age and silver and brass winked briefly in the light that fell from the slender windows over the fireplace hung a massive canvas done in subdued colouringa house upon a hill a house that had grown roots and clung against the land with a jealous grip smoke came from the chimney a windwhipped tenuous smoke that smudged across a stormgrey sky webster walked across the room and there was no sound of walking the rugs he thought the rugs protect the quietness of the place randall wanted to do this one over too but i wouldnt let him touch it and im glad i did it a man must keep something that is old something he can cling to something that is a heritage and a legacy and promise he reached his desk thumbed a tumbler and the light came on above it slowly he let himself into a chair reached out for the portfolio of notes he flipped the cover open and stared at the title page a study of the functional development of the city of geneva a brave title dignified and erudite and a lot of work twenty years of work twenty years of digging among old dusty records twenty years of reading and comparing of evaluating the weight and words of those who had gone before sifting and rejecting and working out the facts tracing the trend not only of the city but of men no hero worship no legends but facts and facts are hard to come by something rustled no footstep but a rustle a sense that someone was near webster twisted in his chair a robot stood just outside the circle of the desk light beg pardon sir the robot said but i was supposed to tell you miss sara is waiting in the seashore webster started slightly miss sara eh its been a long time since shes been here yes sir said the robot it seemed almost like old times sir when she walked in the door thank you oscar for telling me said webster ill go right out you will bring some drinks she brought her own drinks sir said oscar something that mr ballentree fixed up ballentree exclaimed webster i hope it isnt poison ive been observing her oscar told him and shes been drinking it and shes still all right webster rose from his chair crossed the room and went down the hall he pushed open the door and the sound of the surf came to him he blinked in the light that shone on the hot sand beach stretching like a straight line white to either horizon before him the ocean was a sunwashed blue tipped with the white of foaming waves sand gritted underneath his feet as he walked forward eyes adjusting themselves to the blaze of sunlight sara he saw was sitting in one of the bright canvas chairs underneath the palm trees and beside the chair was a pastel very ladylike jug the air had a tang of salt and the wind off the water was cool in the sunwarm air the woman heard him and stood up and waited for him with her hands outstretched he hurried forward clasped the outstretched hands and looked at her not a minute older he said as pretty as the day i saw you first she smiled at him eyes very bright and you jon a little grey around the temples a little handsomer that is all he laughed im almost sixty sara middle age is creeping up i brought something said sara one of ballentrees latest masterpieces it will cut your age in half he grunted wonder ballentree hasnt killed off half geneva the drinks that he cooks up this one is really good it was it went down smooth and it had a strange half metallic half ecstatic taste webster pulled another chair close to saras sat down and looked at her you have such a nice place here said sara randall did it didnt he webster nodded he had more fun than a circus i had to beat him off with a club and those robots of his theyre crazier than he is but he does wonderful things he did a martian room for quentin and its simply unworldly i know said webster was set on a deepspace one for here said it would be just the place to sit and think got sore at me when i wouldnt let him do it he rubbed the back of his left hand with his right thumb staring off at the blue haze above the ocean sara leaned forward pulled his thumb away you still have the warts she said he grinned yes could have had them taken off but never got around to it too busy i guess part of me by now she released the thumb and he went back to rubbing the warts absentmindedly youve been busy she said havent seen you around much how is the book coming ready to write said webster outlining it by chapters now checked on the last thing today have to make sure you know place way down under the old solar administration building some sort of a defence setup control room you push a lever and and what i dont know said webster something effective i suppose should try to find out but cant find the heart to do it been digging around in too much dust these last twenty years to face any more you sound discouraged jon tired you shouldnt get tired theres no reason for it you should get around have another drink he shook his head no sara thanks not in the mood i guess im afraid saraafraid afraid this room said webster illusion mirrors that give an illusion of distance fans that blow the air through a salt spray pumps that stir up the waves a synthetic sun and if i dont like the sun all i have to do is snap a switch and i have a moon illusion said sara thats it said webster that is all we have no real work no real job nothing that were working for no place were going ive worked for twenty years and ill write a book and not a soul will read it all theyd have to do would be spend the time to read it but they wont take the time they wont care all theyd have to do would be come and ask me for a copyand if they didnt want to do that id be so glad someone was going to read it that id take it to them but no one will it will go on the shelves with all the other books that have been written and what do i get out of it wait ill tell you twenty years of work twenty years of fooling myself twenty years of sanity i know said sara softly i know jon the last three paintings he looked up quickly but sara she shook her head no jon no one wanted them theyre out of style naturalistic stuff is passй impressionalism now daubs we are too rich said webster we have too much everything was left for useverything and nothing when mankind went out to jupiter the few that were left behind inherited the earth and it was too big for them they couldnt handle it they couldnt manage it they thought they owned it but they were the ones that were owned owned and dominated and awed by the things that had gone before she reached out a hand and touched his arm poor jon she said we cant flinch away from it be said some day some of us must face the truth must start over againfrom scratch i yes what is it sara i came here to say goodbye goodbye im going to take the sleep he came to his feet swiftly horrified no sara she laughed and the laugh was strained why dont you come with me jon a few hundred years maybe it will all be different when we awake just because no one wants your canvases just because because of what you said just a while ago illusion jon i knew it felt it but i couldnt think it out but the sleep is illusion too i know but you dont know its illusion you think its real you have no inhibitions and you have no fears except the fears that are planned deliberately its natural jonmore natural than life i went up to the temple and it was all explained to me and when you awake youre adjusted adjusted to whatever life is like in whatever era you awake almost as if you belonged even from the first and it might be better who knows it might be better it wont be jon told her grimly until or unless someone does something about it and a people that run to the sleep to hide are not going to bestir themselves she shrank back in the chair and suddenly he felt ashamed im sorry sara i didnt mean you nor any one person just the lot of us the palms whispered harshly fronds rasping little pools of water left by the surging tide sparkled in the sun i wont try to dissuade you webster said youve thought it out you know what it is you want it hadnt always been like that with the human race he thought there would have been a day a thousand years ago when a man would have argued about a thing like this but juwainism had ended all the petty quarrels juwainism had ended a lot of things ive always thought sara told him softly if we could have stayed together he made a gesture of impatience its just another thing weve lost another thing that the human race let loose come to think it over we lost a lot of things family ties and business work and purpose he turned to face her squarely if you want to come back sara she shook her head it wouldnt work jon its been too many years he nodded there was no use denying it she rose and held out her hand if you ever decide to take the sleep find out my date ill have them reserve a place right next to me i dont think i ever shall he told her all right then goodbye jon wait a second sara you havent said a word about our son i used to see him often but she laughed brightly toms almost a grown man now jon and its the strangest thing he i havent seen him for so long webster said again no wonder hes scarcely in the city its his hobby something he inherited from you i guess pioneering in a way i dont know what else youd call it you mean some new research something unusual unusual yes but not research just goes out in the woods and lives by himself he and a few of his friends a bag of salt a bow and arrows yes its queer sara admitted but he has a lot of fun claims hes learning something and he does look healthy like a wolf strong and lean and a look about his eyes she swung around and moved away ill see you to the door said webster she shook her head no id rather that you wouldnt youre forgetting the jug you keep it jon i wont need it where im going webster put on the plastic thinking cap snapped the button of the writer on his desk chapter twentysix he thought and the writer clicked and chuckled and wrote chapter xxvi for a moment webster held his mind clear assembling his data arranging his outline then he began again the writer clicked and gurgled bummed into steady work the machines ran on tended by the robots as they had been before producing all the things they had produced before and the robots worked as they knew it was their right to work their right and duty doing the things they had been made to do the machines went on and the robots went on producing wealth as if there were men to use it as if there were millions of men instead of a bare five thousand and the five thousand who had stayed behind or who had been left behind suddenly found themselves the masters of a world that had been geared to the millions found themselves possessed of the wealth and services that only months before had been the wealth and services that had been due the millions there was no government but there was no need of government for all the crimes and abuses that government had held in check were as effectively held in check by the sudden wealth the five thousand had inherited no man will steal when he can pick up what he wantswithout the bother of thievery no man will contest with his neighbour over real estate when the entire world is real estate for the simple taking property rights almost overnight became a phrase that had no meaning in a world where there was more than enough for all crimes of violence long before had been virtually eliminated from human society and with the economic pressure eased to a point where property rights ceased to be a point of friction there was no need of government no need in fact of many of the encumbrances of custom and convenience which man had carried forward from the beginnings of commerce there was no need of currency for exchange had no meaning in a world where to get a thing one need but ask for it or take it relieved of economic pressure the social pressures lessened too a man no longer found it necessary to conform to the standards and the acts of custom which had played so large a part in the postjovian world as an indication of commercial character religion which had been losing ground for centuries entirely disappeared the family unit held together by tradition and by the economic necessity of a provider and protector fell apart men and women lived together as they wished parted when they wished for there was no economic reason no social reason why they shouldnt webster cleared his mind and the machine purred softly at him he put up his hands took off the cap reread the last paragraph of the outline there he thought there is the root of it if the families had stayed together if sara and i stayed together he rubbed the warts on the back of his hand wondering wonder if tom goes by my name or hers usually they take their mothers name i know i did at first until my mother asked me to change it said it would please my father and she didnt mind said he was proud of the name he bore and i was his only child and she had others if only we had stayed together then thered be something worth living for if wed stayed together sara wouldnt be taking the sleep wouldnt be lying in a tank of fluid in suspended animation with the dream cap on her head wonder what kind of dream she chosewhat kind of synthetic life she picked out to live i wanted to ask her but i didnt dare its not the kind of thing after all that one can ask he reached out and picked up the cap again put it on his head marshalled his thoughts anew the writer clicked into sudden life man was bewildered but not for long man tried but not for long for the five thousand could not carry on the work of the millions who had gone to jupiter to enter upon a better life in alien bodies the five thousand did not have the skill nor the dreams nor the incentive and there were the psychological factors the psychological factor of tradition which bore like a weight upon the minds of the men who had been left behind the psychological factor of juwainism which forced men to be honest with themselves and others which forced men to perceive at last the hopelessness of the things they sought to do juwainism left no room for false courage and false foolhardy courage that didnt know what it was going up against was the one thing the five thousand needed most what they did suffered by comparison with what had been done before and at last they came to know that the human dream of millions was too vast a thing for five thousand to attempt life was good why worry there was food and clothes and shelter human companionship and luxury and entertainmentthere was everything that one could ever wish man gave up trying man enjoyed himself human achievement became a zero factor and human life a senseless paradise webster took off the cap again reached out and clicked off the writer if someone would only read it once i get it done he thought if someone would read and understand if someone could realize where human life is going i could tell them of course i could go out and buttonhole them one by one and hold them fast until i told them what i thought and they would understand for juwainism would make them understand but they wouldnt pay attention theyd tuck it all away in the backs of their brains somewhere for future reference and theyd never have the time or take the trouble to drag it out again theyd go on doing the foolish things theyre doing following the footless hobbies they have taken up in lieu of work randall with his crew of zany robots going around begging to be allowed to redesign his neighbours homes ballentree spending hours on end figuring out new alcoholic mixtures yes and jon webster wasting twenty years digging into the history of a single city a door creaked faintly and webster swung around the robot catfooted into the room yes what is it oscar the robot halted a dim figure in the halflight of the duskfilled room its time for dinner sir i came to see whatever you can think up said webster and oscar you can lay the fire the fire is laid sir oscar stalked across the room bent above the fireplace flame flickered in his hand and the kindling caught webster slouched in his chair staring at the flames crawling up the wood heard the first faint hiss and crackle of the wood the suction mumble at the fireplace throat its pretty sir said oscar you like it too indeed i do ancestral memories said webster soberly remembrance of the forge that made you you think so sir asked oscar no oscar i was joking anachronisms thats what you and i are not many people have fires these days no need for them but theres something about them something that is clean and comforting he stared at the canvas above the mantelpiece lighted now by the flare of burning wood oscar saw his stare too bad about miss sara sir webster shook his head no oscar it was something that she wanted like turning off one life and starting on another she will lie up there in the temple asleep for years and she will live another life and this one oscar will be a happy life for she would have it planned that way his mind went back to other days in this very room she painted that picture oscar he said spent a long time at it being very careful to catch the thing she wanted to express she used to laugh at me and tell me i was in the painting too i dont see you sir said oscar no im not and yet perhaps i am or part of me part of what and where i came from that house in the painting oscar is the webster house in north america and i am a webster but a long ways from the housea long ways from the men who built that house north americas not so far sir no webster told him not so far in distance but far in other ways he felt the warmth of the fire steal across the room and touch him far too farand in the wrong direction the robot moved softly feet padding on the rug leaving the room she worked a long time being very careful to catch the thing she wanted to express and what was that thing he had never asked her and she had never told him he had always thought he remembered that it probably had been the way the smoke streamed wind whipped across the sky the way the house crouched against the ground blending in with the trees and grass huddled against the storm that walked above the land but it may have been something else some symbolism something that made the house synonymous with the kind of men who built it he got up and walked closer stood before the fire with head tilted back the brush strokes were there and the painting looked less a painting than when viewed from the proper distance a thing of technique now the basic strokes and shadings the brushes had achieved to create illusion security security by the way the house stood foursquare and solid tenacity by the way it was a part of the land itself sternness stubbornness and a certain bleakness of the spirit she had sat for days on end with the visor beamed on the house sketching carefully painting slowly often sitting and watching and doing nothing at all there had been dogs she said and robots but she had not put them in because all she wanted was the house one of the few houses left standing in the open country through centuries of neglect the others had fallen in had given the land back to the wilderness but there were dogs and robots in this one one big robot she had said and a lot of little ones webster bad paid no attentionhe had been too busy he swung around went back to the desk again queer thing once you came to think of it robots and dogs living together a webster once had messed around with dogs trying to put them on the road to a culture of their own trying to develop a dual civilization of man and dog bits of remembrance came to himtiny fragments half recalled of the legends that had come down the years about the webster house there had been a robot named jenkins who had served the family from the very first there had been an old man sitting in a wheel chair on the front lawn staring at the stars and waiting for a son who never came and a curse had hung above the house the curse of having lost to the world the philosophy of juwain the visor was in one corner of the room an almost forgotten piece of furniture something that was scarcely used there was no need to use it all the world was here in the city of geneva webster rose moved towards it stopped and thought the dial settings were listed in the log book but where was the log book more than likely somewhere in his desk he went back to the desk started going through the drawers excited now he pawed furiously like a terrier digging for a bone jenkins the ancient robot scrubbed his metallic chin with metallic fingers it was a thing he did when be was deep in thought a meaningless irritating gesture he had picked up from long association with the human race his eyes went back to the little black dog sitting on the floor beside him so the wolf was friendly said jenkins offered you the rabbit ebenezer jigged excitedly upon his bottom he was one of them we fed last winter the pack that came up to the house and we tried to tame them would you know the wolf again ebenezer nodded i got his scent he said id remember him shadow shuffled his feet against the floor look jenkins aint you going to smack him one he should have been listening and he ran away he had no business chasing rabbits jenkins spoke sternly youre the one that should get the smacking shadow for your attitude you are assigned to ebenezer you should be part of him you arent an individual youre just ebenezers hands if he had hands hed have no need of you you arent his mentor nor his conscience just his hands remember that shadow shuffled his feet rebelliously ill run away he said join the wild robots i suppose said jenkins shadow nodded theyd be glad to have me theyre doing things they need all the help that they can get theyd bust you up for scrap jenkins told him sourly you have no training no abilities that would make you one of them he turned to ebenezer we have other robots ebenezer shook his head shadow is all right i can handle him we know one another he keeps me from getting lazy keeps me on my toes thats fine said jenkins you two run along and if you ever happen to be out chasing rabbits ebenezer and run into this wolf again try to cultivate him the rays of the westering sun were streaming through the windows touching the ageold room with the warmth of a late spring evening jenkins sat quietly in the chair listening to the sounds that came from outsidethe tinkle of cowbells the yapping of the puppies the ringing thud of an axe splitting fireplace logs poor little fellow thought jenkins sneaking out to chase a rabbit when he should have been listening too fartoo fast have to watch that have to keep them from breaking down come fall and well knock off work for a week or two and have some coon hunts do them a world of good although thered come a day when thered be no coon hunts no rabbit chasingthe day when the dogs finally had tamed everything when all the wild things would be thinking talking working beings a wild dream and a far onebut thought jenkins no wilder and no farther than some of the dreams of man maybe even better than the dreams of man for they held none of the ruthlessness that the human race had planned aimed at none of the mechanistic brutality the human race had spawned a new civilization a new culture a new way of thought mystic perhaps and visionary but so had man been visionary probing into mysteries that man had brushed by as unworthy of his time as mere superstition that could have no scientific basis things that go bump in the night things that prowl around a house and the dogs get up and growl and there are no tracks in the snow dogs howling when someone dies the dogs knew the dogs had known long before they had been given tongues to talk contact lenses to read they had not come along the road as far as menthey were not cynical and skeptic they believed the things they heard and sensed they did not invent superstition as a form of wishful thinking as a shield against the things unseen jenkins turned back to the desk again picked up the pen bent above the notebook in front of him the pen screeched as he pushed it along ebenezer reports friendliness in wolf recommend council detach ebenezer from listening and assign him to contact the wolf wolves mused jenkins would be good friends to have theyd make splendid scouts better than the dogs tougher faster sneaky they could watch the wild robots across the river and relieve the dogs could keep an eye on the mutant castles jenkins shook his head couldnt trust anyone these days the robots seemed to be all right were friendly dropped in at times helped out now and then real neighbourly in fact but you never knew and they were building machines the mutants never bothered anyone were scarcely seen in fact but they had to be watched too never knew what devilment they might be up to remember what theyd done to man that dirty trick with juwainism handing it over at a time when it would doom the race men they were gods to us and now theyre gone left us on our own a few in geneva of course but they cant be bothered have no interest in us he sat in the twilight thinking of the whiskies he had carried of the errands he had run of the days when websters had lived and died within these walls and nowfather confessor to the dogs cute little devils and bright and smartand trying hard a bell buzzed softly and jenkins jerked upright in his seat it buzzed again and a green light winked on the televisor jenkins came to his feet stood unbelieving staring at the winking light someone calling someone calling after almost a thousand years he staggered forward dropped into the chair reached out with fumbling fingers to the toggle tripped it over the wall before him melted away and he sat facing a man across a desk behind the man the flames of a fireplace lighted up a room with high stainedglass windows youre jenkins said the man and there was something in his face that jerked a cry from jenkins you you im jon webster said the man jenkins pressed his hands flat against the top of the televisor sat straight and stiff afraid of the unrobotlike emotions that welled within his metal being i would have known you anywhere said jenkins you have the look of them i should recognize one of you i worked for you long enough carried drinks and and yes i know said webster your name has come down with us we remembered you you are in geneva jon and then jenkins remembered i meant sir no need of it said webster id rather have it jon and yes im in geneva but id like to see you i wonder if i might you mean come out here webster nodded but the place is overrun with dogs sir webster grinned the talking dogs he asked yes said jenkins and theyll be glad to see you they know all about the family they sit around at night and talk themselves to sleep with stories from the old days and and what is it jenkins ill be glad to see you too it has been so lonesome god had come ebenezer shivered at the thought crouching in the dark if jenkins knew i was here he thought hed whale my hide for fair jenkins said we were to leave him alone for a while at least ebenezer crept forward on fursoft pads sniffed at the study door and the door was openopen by the barest crack he crouched on his belly listening and there was not a thing to hear just a scent an unfamiliar tangy scent that made the hair crawl along his back in swift almost unbearable ecstasy he glanced quickly over his shoulder but there was no movement jenkins was out in the diningroom telling the dogs how they must behave and shadow was off somewhere tending to some robot business softly carefully ebenezer pushed at the door with his nose and the door swung wider another push and it was half open the man sat in front of the fireplace in the easychair long legs crossed hands clasped across his stomach ebenezer crouched tighter against the floor a low involuntary whimper in his throat at the sound jon webster jerked erect whos there he asked ebenezer froze against the floor felt the pumping of his heart jerking at his body whos there webster asked once more and then he saw the dog his voice was softer when he spoke again come in feller come on in ebenezer did not stir webster snapped his fingers at him i wont hurt you come on in where are all the others ebenezer tried to rise tried to crawl along the floor but his bones were rubber and his blood was water and the man was striding towards him coming in long strides across the floor he saw the man bending over him felt strong hands beneath his body knew that he was being lifted up and the scent that he had smelled at the open doorthe overpowering godscentwas strong within his nostrils the hands held him tight against the strange fabric the man wore instead of fur and a voice crooned at himnot words but comforting so you came to see me said jon webster you sneaked away and you came to see me ebenezer nodded weakly you arent angry are you you arent going to tell jenkins webster shook his head no i wont tell jenkins he sat down and ebenezer sat in his lap staring at his facea strong lined face with the lines deepened by the flare of the flames within the fireplace websters hand came up and stroked ebenezers head and ebenezer whimpered with doggish happiness its like coming home said webster and he wasnt talking to the dog its like youve been away for a long long time and then you come home again and its so long you dont recognize the place dont know the furniture dont recognize the floor plan but you know by the feel of it that its an old familiar place and you are glad you came i like it here said ebenezer and he meant websters lap but the man misunderstood of course you do he said its your home as well as mine more your home in fact for you stayed here and took care of it while i forgot about it he patted ebenezers head and pulled ebenezers ears whats your name he asked ebenezer and what do you do ebenezer i listen you listen sure thats my job i listen for the cobblies and you hear the cobblies sometimes im not very good at it i think about chasing rabbits and i dont pay attention what do cobblies sound like different things sometimes they walk and other times they just go bump and once in a while they talk although oftener they think look here ebenezer i dont seem to place these cobblies they arent any place said ebenezer not on this earth at least i dont understand like there was a big house said ebenezer a big house with lots of rooms and doors between the rooms and if youre in one room you can hear whoevers in the other rooms but you cant get to them sure you can said webster all you have to do is go through the door but you cant open the door said ebenezer you dont even know about the door you think this one room youre in is the only room in all the house even if you did know about the door you couldnt open it youre talking about dimensions ebenezer wrinkled his forehead in worried thought i dont know that word you said dimensions what i told you was the way jenkins told it to us he said it wasnt really a house and it wasnt really rooms and the things we heard probably werent like us webster nodded to himself that was the way one would have to do have to take it easy take it slow dont confuse them with big names let them get the idea first and then bring in the more exact and scientific terminology and more than likely it would be a manufactured terminology already there was a coined word cobbliesthe things behind the wall the things that one hears and cannot identifythe dwellers in the next room cobblies the cobblies will get you if you dont watch out that would be the human way cant understand a thing cant see it cant test it cant analyse it ok it isnt there it doesnt exist its a ghost a goblin a cobbly the cobblies will get you its simpler that way more comfortable scared sure but you forget it in the light and it doesnt plague you haunt you think hard enough and you wish it away make it a ghost or goblin and you can laugh at itin the daylight a hot wet tongue rasped across websters chin and ebenezer wriggled with delight i like you said ebenezer jenkins never held me this way no ones ever held me this way jenkins is busy said webster he sure is agreed ebenezer he writes things down in a book things that us dogs hear when we are listening and things that we should do youve heard about the websters asked the man sure we know all about them youre a webster we didnt think there were any more of them yes there is said webster theres been one here all the time jenkins is a webster he never told us that he wouldnt the fire had died down and the room had darkened the sputtering flames chased feeble flickers across the walls and floor and something else faint rustlings faint whisperings as if the very walls were talking an old house with long memories and a lot of living tucked within its structure two thousand years of living built to last and it had lasted built to be a home and it still was a homea solid place that put its arms around one and held one close and warm claimed one for its own footsteps walked across his brainfootsteps from the long ago footsteps that had been silenced to the final echo centuries before the walking of the websters of the ones that went before me the ones that jenkins waited on from their day of birth to the hour of death history here is history history stirring in the drapes and creeping on the floor sitting in the corners watching from the wall living history that a man can feel in the bones of him and against his shoulder bladesthe impact of the long dead eyes that come back from the night another webster eh doesnt look like much worthless the breeds played out not like we were in our day just about the last of them jon webster stirred no not the last of them he said i have a son well it doesnt make much difference he says he has a son but he cant amount to much webster started from the chair ebenezer slipping from his lap thats not true cried webster my son and then sat down again his son out in the woods with bow and arrows playing a game having fun a hobby sara had said before she climbed the hill to take a hundred years of dreams a hobby not a business not a way of life not necessity a hobby an artificial thing a thing that had no beginning and no end a thing a man could drop at any minute and no one would ever notice like cooking up recipes for different kinds of drinks like painting pictures no one wanted like going around with a crew of crazy robots begging people to let you redecorate their homes like writing history no one cares about like playing indian or caveman or pioneer with bow and arrows like thinking up centurieslong dreams for men and women who are tired of life and yearn for fantasy the man sat in the chair staring at the nothingness that spread before his eyes the dread and awful nothingness that became tomorrow and tomorrow absentmindedly his hands came together and the right thumb stroked the back of the left hand ebenezer crept forward through the fireflared darkness put his front paws on the mans knee and looked into hisface hurt your hand he asked hurt your hand youre rubbing it webster laughed shortly no just warts he showed them to the dog gee warts said ebenezer you dont want them do you no webster hesitated no i guess i dont never got around to having them taken off ebenezer dropped his nose and nuzzled the back of websters hand there you are he announced triumphantly there im what look at the warts invited ebenezer a log fell in the fire and webster lifted his hand looked at it in the flare of light the warts were gone the skin was smooth and clean jenkins stood in the darkness and listened to the silence the soft sleeping silence that left the house to shadows to the halfforgotten footsteps the phrase spoken long ago the tongues that murmured in the walls and rustled in the drapes by a single thought the night could have been as day a simple adjustment in his lenses would have done the trick but the ancient robot left his sight unchanged for this was the way he liked it this was the hour of meditation the treasured time when the present sloughed away and the past came back and lived the others slept but jenkins did not sleep for robots never sleep two thousand years of consciousness twenty centuries of full time unbroken by a single moment of unawareness a long time thought jenkins a long time even for a robot for even before man had gone to jupiter most of the older robots had been deactivated had been sent to their death in favour of the newer models the newer models that looked more like men that were smoother and more sightly with better speech and quicker responses within their metal brains but jenkins had stayed on because he was an old and faithful servant because webster house would not have been home without him they loved me said jenkins to himself and the three words held deep comfortcomfort in a world where there was little comfort a world where a servant had become a leader and longed to be a servant once again he stood at the window and stared out across the patio to the nightdark clumps of oaks that staggered down the hill darkness no light anywhere there had been a time when there had been lights windows that shone like friendly beams in the vast land that lay across the river but man had gone and there were no lights the robots needed no lights for they could see in darkness even as jenkins could have seen had he but chosen to do so and the castles of the mutants were as dark by night as they were fearsome by day now man had come again one man had come but he probably wouldnt stay hed sleep for a few nights in the great master bedroom on the second floor then go back to geneva hed walk the old forgotten acres and stare across the river and rummage through the books that lined the study wall then he would up and leave jenkins swung around ought to see how he is he thought ought to find if he needs anything maybe take him up a drink although im afraid the whisky is all spoiled a thousand years is a long time for a bottle of good whisky he moved across the room and a warm peace came upon him the close and intimate peacefulness of the old days when he had trotted happy as a terrier on his many errands he hummed a snatch of tune in minor key as he headed for the stairwayґ hed just look in and if jon webster were asleep hed leave but if he wasnt hed say are you comfortable sir is there anything you wish a hot toddy perhaps and he took two stairs at the time for he was doing for a webster once again jon webster lay propped in bed with the pillows piled behind him the bed was hard and uncomfortable and the room was close and stuffynot like his own bedroom back in geneva where one lay on the grassy bank of a murmuring stream and stared at the artificial stars that glittered in an artificial sky and smelled the artificial scent of artificial lilacs that would go on blooming longer than a man would live no murmur of a hidden waterfall no flickering of captive firefliesbut a bed and room that were functional webster spread his hands flat on his blanket covered thighs and flexed his fingers thinking ebenezer had merely touched the warts and the warts were gone and it had been no happenstanceit had been intentional it had been no miracle but a conscious power for miracles sometimes fail to happen and ebenezer had been sure a power perhaps that had been gathered from the room beyond a power that had been stolen from the cobblies ebenezer listened to a layingon of hands a power of healing that involved no drugs no surgery but just a certain knowledge a very special knowledge in the old dark ages certain men had claimed the power to make warts disappear had bought them for a penny or had traded them for something or had performed other mumbojumboand in due time sometimes the warts would disappear had these queer men listened to the cobblies too the door creaked just a little and webster straightened suddenly a voice came out of the darkness are you comfortable sir is there anything you wish jenkins asked webster yes sir said jenkins the dark form padded softly through the door yes theres something i want said webster i want to talk to you he stared at the dark metallic figure that stood beside the bed about the dogs said webster they try so hard said jenkins and its hard for them for they have no one you see not a single soul they have you jenkins shook his head but im not enough you see im just well just a sort of mentor it is men they want the need of men is ingrown in them for thousands of years it has been man and dog man and dog hunting together man and dog watching the herds together man and dog fighting their enemies together the dog watching while the man slept and the man dividing the last bit of food going hungry himself so that his dog might eat webster nodded yes i suppose that is the way it is they talk about men every night said jenkins before they go to bed they sit around together and one of the old ones tells one of the stories that have been handed down and they sit and wonder sit and hope but where are they going what are they trying to do have they got a plan i can detect one said jenkins just a faint glimmer of what may happen they are psychic you see always have been they have no mechanical sense which is understandable for they have no hands where man would follow metal the dogs will follow ghosts ghosts the things you men call ghosts but they arent ghosts im sure of that theyre something in the next room some other form of life on another plane you mean there may be many planes of life coexisting simultaneously upon earth jenkins nodded im beginning to believe so sir i have a notebook full of things the dogs have heard and seen and now after all these many years they begin to make a pattern he hurried on i may be mistaken sir you understand i have no training i was just a servant in the old days sir i tried to pick up things after after jupiter but it was hard for me another robot helped me make the first little robots for the dogs and now the little ones produce their own kind in the workshop when there are need of more but the dogsthey just sit and listen oh no sir they do many other things they try to make friends with the animals and they watch the wild robots and the mutants these wild robots there are many of them jenkins nodded many sir scattered all over the world in little camps the ones that were left behind sir the ones man had no further use for when he went to jupiter they have banded together and they work work what at i dont know sir building machines mostly mechanical you know i wonder what theyll do with all the machines they have what they plan to use them for so do i said webster and he stared into the darkness and wonderedwondered how man cooped up in geneva should have lost touch with the world how man should not have known about what the dogs were doing about the little camps of busy robots about the castles of the feared and hated mutants we lost touch webster thought we locked the world outside we created ourselves a little niche and we huddled in itin the last city in the world and we didnt know what was happening outside the citywe could have known we should have known but we didnt care its time he thought that we took a hand again we were lost and awed and at first we tried but finally we just threw in the hand for the first time the few that were left realized the greatness of the race saw for the first time the mighty works the hand of man had reared and they tried to keep it going and they couldnt do it and they rationalizedas man rationalizes almost everything fooling himself that there really are no ghosts calling things that go bumping in the night the first suave sleek word of explanation that comes into his mind we couldnt keep it going and so we rationalized we took refuge in a screen of words and juwainism helped us do it we came close to ancestor worship we sought to glorify the race of man we couldnt carry on the work of man and so we tried to glorify it attempted to enthrone the men who had as we attempt to glorify and enthrone all good things that die we became a race of historians and we dug with grubby fingers in the ruins of the race clutching each irrelevant little fact to our breast as if it were a priceless gem and that was the first phase the hobby that bore us up when we knew ourselves for what we really werethe dregs in the tilted cup of humanity but we got over it oh sure we got over it in about one generation man is an adaptable creaturehe can survive anything so we couldnt build great spaceships so we couldnt reach the stars so we couldnt puzzle out the secret of life so what we were the inheritors we had been left the legacy we were better off than any race had ever been or could hope to be again and so we rationalized once more and we forgot about the glory of the race for while it was a shining thing it was a toilsome and humiliating concept jenkins said webster soberly weve wasted ten whole centuries not wasted sir said jenkins just resting perhaps but now maybe you can come out again come back to us you want us the dogs need you jenkins told him and the robots too for both of them were never anything other than the servants of man they are lost without you the dogs are building a civilization but it is building slowly perhaps a better civilization than we built ourselves said webster perhaps a more successful one for ours was not successful jenkins a kinder one jenkins admitted but not too practical a civilization based on the brotherhood of animalson the psychic understanding and perhaps eventual communication and intercourse with interlocking worlds a civilization of the mind and of understanding but not too positive no actual goals limited mechanicsjust a groping after truth and the groping is in a direction that man passed by without a second glance and you think that man could help man could give leadership said jenkins the right kind of leadership that is hard to answer webster lay in the darkness rubbed his suddenly sweating hands along the blankets that covered his body tell me the truth he said and his words were grim man could give leadership you say but man also could take over once again could discard the things the dogs are doing as impractical could round the robots up and use their mechanical ability in the old old pattern both the dogs and robots would knuckle down to man of course said jenkins for they were servants once but man is wiseman knows best thank you jenkins said webster thank you very much he stared into the darkness and the truth was written there his track still lay across the floor and the smell of dust was a sharpness in the air the radium bulb glowed above the panel and the switch and wheel and dials were waiting waiting against the day when there would be need of them webster stood in the doorway smelling the dampness of the stone through the dusty bitterness defence he thought staring at the switch defencea thing to keep one out a device to seal off a place against all the real or imagined weapons that a hypothetical enemy might bring to bear and undoubtedly the same defence that would keep an enemy out would keep the defended in not necessarily of course but he strode across the room and stood before the switch and his hand went out and grasped it moved it slowly and knew that it would work then his arm moved quickly and the switch shot home from far below came a low soft hissing as machines went into action the dial needles flickered and stood out from the pins webster touched the wheel with hesitant fingertips stirred it on its shaft and the needles flickered again and crawled across the glass with a swift sure hand webster spun the wheel and the needles slammed against the farthest pins he turned abruptly on his heel marched out of the vault closed the door behind him climbed the crumbling steps now if it only works he thought if it only works his feet quickened on the steps and the blood hammered in his head if it only works he remembered the hum of machines far below as he had slammed the switch that meant that the defence mechanismor at least part of itstill worked but even if it worked would it do the trick what if it kept the enemy out but failed to keep men in what if when he reached the street he saw that the sky had changed a grey metallic overcast had blotted out the sun and the city lay in twilight only half relieved by the automatic street lights a faint breeze wafted at his cheek the crinkly grey ash of the burned notes and the map that he had found still lay in the fireplace and webster strode across the room seized the poker stirred the ashes viciously until there was no hint of what they once had been gone he thought the last clue gone without the map without the knowledge of the city that it had taken him twenty years to ferret out no one would ever find that hidden room with the switch and wheel and dials beneath the single lamp no one would know exactly what had happened and even one guessed thered be no way to make sure and even if one were sure thered be nothing that could be done about it a thousand years before it would not have been that way for in that day man given the faintest hint would have puzzled out any given problem but man had changed he had lost the old knowledge and old skills his mind had become a flaccid thing he lived from one day to the next without any shining goal but he still kept the old vicesthe vices that had become virtues from his own viewpoint and raised him by his own bootstraps he kept the unwavering belief that his was the only kind the only life that matteredthe smug egoism that made him the selfappointed lord of all creation running feet went past the house on the street outside and webster swung away from the fireplace faced the blind panes of the high and narrow windows i got them stirred up he thought got them running now excited wondering what its all about for centuries they havent stirred outside the city but now that they cant get out they re foaming at the mouth to do it his smile widened maybe theyll be so stirred up theyll do something about it rats in a trap will do some funny thingsif they dont go crazy first and if they do get outwell its their right to do so if they do get out theyve earned their right to take over once again he crossed the room stood in the doorway for a moment staring at the painting that hung above the mantel awkwardly he raised his hand to it a fumbling salute a haggard goodbye then he let himself out into the street and climbed the hillthe route that sara had walked only days before the temple robots were kind and considerate softfooted and dignified they took him to the place where sara lay and showed him the next compartment that she had reserved for him you will want to choose a dream said the spokesman of the robots we can show you many samples we can blend them to your taste we can thank you said webster i do not want a dream the robot nodded understanding i see sir you only want to wait to pass away the time yes said webster i guess youd call it that for about how long how long yes how long do you want to wait oh i see said webster how about forever forever forever is the word i think said webster i might have said eternity but it doesnt make much difference there is no use of quibbling over two words that mean about the same yes sir said the robot no use of quibbling no of course there wasnt for he couldnt take the chance he could have said a thousand years but then he might have relented and gone down and flipped the switch and that was the one thing that must not happen the dogs had to have their chance had to be left unhampered to try for success where the human race had failed and so long as there was a human element they would not have that chance for man would take over would step in and spoil things would laugh at the cobblies that talked behind a wall would object to the taming and civilizing of the wild things of the earth a new patterna new way of thought and lifea new approach to the ageold social problem and it must not be tainted by the stale breath of mans thinking the dogs would sit around at night when the work was done and they would talk of man they would spin the old old story and tell the old old tales and man would be a god and it was better that way for a god can do no wrong notes on the seventh tale several years ago an ancient literary fragment came to light apparently at one time it had been an extensive body of writing and although only a small part of it was discovered the few tales that it contained were enough to indicate that it was a group of fables concerning the various members of the animal brotherhood the tales are archaic and the viewpoints and manner of their telling sound strange to us today a number of scholars who have studied the fragments agree with tige that they may very well be of nondoggish origin their title is aesop the title of this tale likewise is aesop and the tales title has come down intact with the tale itself from dim antiquity what ask the scholars is the significance of this tige quite naturally believes it is yet another link in his theory that the present legend is human in its origin most of the other students fail to agree but so far have advanced no explanation which would serve instead tige points too to this seventh tale as proof that if there is no historic evidence of mans existence it is because he was forgotten deliberately because his memory was wiped out to assure the continuance of the canine culture in its purest form in this tale the dogs have forgotten man in the few members of the human race existing among them they do not recognize man but call these queer creatures by the old family name of webster but the word webster has become a common instead of a proper noun the dogs think of men as websters while jenkins still thinks of them with the capital w whats men lupus asks and bruin when he tries to explain cant tell him jenkins says in the tale that the dogs must never know about man he outlines for us in the body of the story the steps that he has taken to wipe away the memory of man the old fireside tales are gone says jenkins and in this tige sees a deliberate conspiracy of forgetfulness perhaps not so altruistic as jenkins makes it sound to save doggish dignity the tales are gone says jenkins and must stay gone but apparently they werent gone somewhere in some far corner of the world they still were told and so today we have them with us yet but if the tales persisted man himself was gone or nearly so the wild robots still existed but even they if they ever were more than pure imagination are gone now too the mutants were gone and they are of a piece with man if man existed the mutants probably existed too the entire controversy surrounding the legend can be boiled down to onequestion did man exist if in reading these tales the reader finds himself confused he is in excellent company the experts and scholars themselves who have spent their lives in the study of the legend may have more data but are just as confused as you are vii aesop the grey shadow slid along the rocky ledge heading for the den mewing to itself in frustration and bitter disappointmentfor the words had failed the slanting sun of early afternoon picked out a face and head and body indistinct and murky like a haze of morning mist rising from a gully suddenly the ledge pinched off and the shadow stopped bewildered crouched against the rocky wallfor there was no den the ledge pinched off before it reached the den it whirled around like a snapping whip stared back across the valley and the river was all wrong it flowed closer to the bluffs than it had flowed before there was a swallows nest on the rocky wall and thered never been a swallows nest before the shadow stiffened and the tufted tentacles upon its ears came up and searched the air there was life the scent of it lay faint upon the air the feel of it vibrated across the empty notches of the marching hills the shadow stirred came out of its crouch flowed along the ledge there was no den and the river was different and there was a swallows nest plastered on the cliff the shadow quivered drooling mentally the words had been right they had not failed this was a different world a different worlddifferent in more ways than one a world so full of life that it hummed in the very air life perhaps that could not run so fast nor hide so well the wolf and bear met beneath the great oak tree and stopped to pass the time of day i hear said lupus theres been killing going on bruin grunted a funny kind of killing brother dead but not eaten symbolic killing said the wolf bruin shook his head you cant tell me theres such a thing as symbolic killing this new psychology the dogs are teaching us is going just a bit too far when theres killing going on its for either hate or hunger you wouldnt catch me killing something that i didnt eat he hurried to put matters straight not that im doing any killing brother you know that of course not said the wolf bruin closed his small eyes lazily opened them and blinked not you understand that i dont turn over a rock once in a while and lap up an ant or two i dont believe the dogs would consider that killing lupus told him gravely insects are a little different than animals and birds no one has ever told us we cant kill insect life thats where youre wrong said bruin the canons say so very distinctly you must not destroy life you must not take anothers life yes i guess they do the wolf admitted sanctimoniously i guess youre right at that brother but even the dogs arent too fussy about a thing like insects why you know theyre trying all the time to make a better flea powder and whats flea powder for i ask you why to kill fleas thats what its for and fleas are life fleas are living things bruin slapped viciously at a small green fly buzzing past his nose im going down to the feeding station said the wolf maybe you would like to join me i dont feel hungry said the bear and besides youre a bit too early aint time for feeding yet lupus ran his tongue around his muzzle sometimes i just drift in casuallike you know and the webster thats in charge gives me something extra want to watch out said bruin he isnt giving you something extra for nothing hes got something up his sleeve i dont trust them websters this ones all right the wolf declared he runs the feeding station and he doesnt have to any robot could do it but he went and asked for the job got tired of lolling around in them foxedup houses with nothing to do but play and he sits around and laughs and talks just like he was one of us that peter is a good joe the bear rumbled in his throat one of the dogs was telling me that jenkins claims webster aint their name at all says they arent websters says that they are men whats men asked lupus why i was just telling you its what jenkins says jenkins declared lupus is getting so old hes all twisted up too much to remember must be all of a thousand years seven thousand said the bear the dogs are figuring on having a big birthday party for him theyre fixing up a new body for him for a gift the old one hes got is wearing outin the repair shop every month or two the bear wagged his head sagely all in all lupus the dogs have done a lot for us setting up feeding stations and sending out medical robots and everything why only last year i had a raging toothache the wolf interrupted but those feeding stations might be better they claim that yeast is just the same as meat has the same food value and everything but it dont taste like meat how do you know asked bruin the wolfs stutter lasted one split second why why from what my granddad told me regular old hellion my granddad he had him some venison every now and then told me how red meat tasted but then they didnt have so many wardens as they have nowadays bruin closed his eyes opened them again i been wondering how fish taste he said theres a bunch of trout down in pine tree creek been watching them easy to reach down with my paw and scoop me out a couple he added hastily of course i never have of course not said the wolf one world and then another running like a chain one world treading on the heels of another world that plodded just ahead one worlds tomorrow another worlds today and yesterday is tomorrow and tomorrow is the past except there wasnt any past no past that was except the figment of remembrance that flitted like a nightwinged thing in the shadow of ones mind no past that one could reach no pictures painted on the wall of time no film that one could run backward and see what once had been joshua got up and shook himself sat down and scratched a flea ichabod sat stiffly at the table metal fingers tapping it checks the robot said theres nothing we can do about it the factors checkwe cant travel in the past no said joshua but said ichabod we know where the cobblies are yes said joshua we know where the cobblies are and maybe we can reach them now we know the road to take one road was open but another road was closed not closed of course for it had never been for there wasnt any past there never had been any there wasnt room for one where there should have been a past there was another world like two dogs walking in one anothers tracks one dog steps out and another dog steps in like along endless row of ballbearings running down a groove almost touching but not quite like the links of an endless chain running on a wheel with a billion billion sprockets were late said ichabod glancing at the clock we should be getting ready to go to jenkins party joshua shook himself again yes i suppose we should its a great day for jenkins ichabod think of it seven thousand years im all fixed up ichabod said proudly i shined myself this morning but you need a combing youve got all tangled up seven thousand years said joshua i wouldnt want to live that long seven thousand years and seven thousand worlds stepping in one anothers tracks although it would be more than that a world a day three hundred and sixtyfive times seven thousand or maybe a world a minute or maybe even one world every second a second was a thick thingthick enough to separate two worlds large enough to hold two worlds three hundred and sixtyfive times seven thousand times twentyfour times sixty times sixty a thick thing and a final thing for there was no past there was no going back no going back to find out about the things that jenkins talked aboutthe things that might be truth or twisted memory warped by seven thousand years no going back to check up on the cloudy legends that told about a house and a family of websters and a closed dome of nothingness that squatted in the mountains far across the sea ichabod advanced upon him with a comb and brush and joshua winced away ah shucks said ichabod i wont hurt you any last time said joshua you damn near skinned me alive go easy on those snags the wolf had come in hoping for a betweenmeals snack but it hadnt been forthcoming and he was too polite to ask so now he sat bushy tail tucked neatly around his feet watching peter work with the knife upon the slender wand fatso the squirrel dropped from the limb of an overhanging tree lit on peters shoulder what you got he asked a throwing stick said peter you can throw any stick you want to said the wolf you dont need a fancy one to throw you can pick up just any stick and throw it this is something new said peter something i thought up something that i made but i dont know what it is it hasnt got a name asked fatso not yet said peter ill have to think one up but persisted the wolf you can throw a stick you can throw any stick you want to not as far said peter not as hard peter twirled the wand between his fingers feeling the smooth roundness of it lifted it and sighted along it to make sure that it was straight i dont throw it with my arm said peter i throw it with another stick and a cord he reached out and picked up the thing that leaned against the tree trunk what i cant figure out said fatso is what you want to throw a stick for i dont know said peter it is kind of fun you websters said the wolf severely are funny animals sometimes i wonder if you have good sense you can hit any place you aim at said peter if your throwing stick is straight and your cord is good you cant just pick up any piece of wood you have to look and look show me said fatso like this said peter lifting up the shaft of hickory its tough you see springy bend it and it snaps back into shape again i tied the two ends together with a cord and i put the throwing stick like this one end against the string and then pull back you said you could hit anything you wanted to said the wolf go ahead and show us what shall i hit asked peter you pick it out fatso pointed excitedly that robin sitting in the tree swiftly peter lifted his hands the cord came back and the shaft to which the cord was tied bent into an arc the throwing stick whistled in the air the robin toppled from the branch in a shower of flying feathers he hit the ground with a soft dull thud and lay there on his backtiny helpless clenched claws pointing at the treetops blood ran out of his beak to stain the leaf beneath his head fatso stiffened on peters shoulders and the wolf was on his feet and there was a quietness the quietness of unstirring leaf of floating clouds against the blue of noon horror slurred fatsos words you killed him hes dead you killed him peter protested numb with dread i didnt know i never tried to hit anything alive before i just threw the stick at marks but you killed him and you should never kill i know said peter i know you never should but you told me to hit him you showed him to me you i never meant for you to kill him fatso screamed i just thought youd touch him up scare him he was so fat and sassy i told you the stick went hard the webster stood rooted to the ground far and hard he thought far and hardand fast take it easy pal said the wolfs soft voice we know you didnt mean to its just among us three well never say a word fatso leaped from peters shoulder screamed at them from the branch above i will he shrieked im going to tell jenkins the wolf snarled at him with a sudden redeyed rage you dirty little squealer you lousy tattletale i will so yelled fatso you just wait and see im going to tell jenkins he flickered up the tree and ran along a branch leaped to another tree the wolf moved swiftly wait said peter sharply he cant go in the trees all the way the wolf said swiftly hell have to come down to the ground to get across the meadow you dont need to worry no said peter no more killings one killing is enough he will tell you know peter nodded yes im sure he will i could stop him telling someone would see you and tell on you said peter no lupus i wont let you do it then you better take it on the lam said lupus i know a place where you could hide theyd never find you not in a thousand years i couldnt get away with it said peter there are eyes watching in the woods too many eyes theyd tell where i had gone the day is gone when anyone can hide i guess youre right the wolf said slowly yes i guess youre right he wheeled around and stared at the fallen robin what you say we get rid of the evidence he asked the evidence why sure the wolf paced forward swiftly lowered his head there was a crunching sound lupus licked his chops and sat down wrapped his tail around his feet you and i could get along he said yes sir i have the feeling we could get along were so very much alike a telltale feather fluttered on his nose the body was a lulu a sledge hammer couldnt dent it and it would never rust and it had more gadgets than you could shake a stick at it was jenkins birthday gift the line of engraving on the chest said so very neatly to jenkins prom the dogs but ill never wear it jenkins told himself its too fancy for me too fancy for a robot thats as old as i am id feel out of place in a gaudy thing like that he rocked slowly back and forth in the rocking chair listening to the whimper of the wind in the eaves they meant well and i wouldnt hurt them for the world ill have to wear it once in a while just for the looks of things just to please the dogs wouldnt be right for me not to wear it when they went to so much trouble to get it made for me but not for every dayjust for my very best maybe to the webster picnic would want to look my very best when i go to the picnic its a great affair a time when all the websters in the world all the websters left alive get together and they want me with them ah yes they always want me with them for i am a webster robot yes sir always was and always will be he let his head sink and mumbled words that whispered in the room words that he and the room remembered words from long ago a rocker squeaked and the sound was one with the timestained room one with the wind along the eaves and the mumble of the chimneys throat fire thought jenkins its been a long time since weve had a fire men used to like a fire they used to like to sit in front of it and look into it and build pictures in the flames and dream but the dreams of men said jenkins talking to himself the dreams of men are gone theyve gone to jupiter and theyre buried at geneva and they sprout again very feebly in the websters of today the past he said the past is too much with me and the past has made me useless i have too much to rememberso much to remember that it becomes more important than the things there are to do im living in the past and that is no way to live for joshua says there is no past and joshua should know of all the dogs hes the one to know for he tried hard enough to find a past to travel in to travel back in time and check up on the things i told him he thinks my mind is failing and that i spin old robot tales halftruth halffantasy touched up for the telling he wouldnt admit it for the world but thats what the rascal thinks he doesnt think i know it but i do he cant fool me said jenkins chuckling to himself none of them can fool me i know them from the ground upi know what makes them tick i helped bruce webster with the first of them i heard the first word that any of them said and if theyve forgotten i haventnot a look or word or gesture maybe its only natural that they should forget they have done great things i have let them do them with little interference and that was for the best that was the way jon webster told me it should be on that night of long ago that was why jon webster did whatever he had to do to close off the city of geneva for it was jon webster it had to be it could be no one else he thought he was sealing off the human race to leave the earth clear for the dogs but he forgot one thing oh yes said jenkins he forgot one thing he forgot his own son and the little band of bow and arrow faddists who had gone out that morning to play at being cavemenand cavewomen too and what they played thought jenkins became a bitter fact a fact for almost a thousand years a fact until we found them and brought them home again back to the webster house back to where the whole thing started jenkins folded his hands in his lap and bent his head and rocked slowly to and fro the rocker creaked and the wind raced in the eaves and a window rattled the fireplace talked with its sooty throat talked of other days and other folks of other winds that blew from out the west the past thought jenkins it is a footless thing a foolish thing when there is so much to do so many problems that the dogs have yet to meet overpopulation for example thats the thing weve thought about and talked about too long too many rabbits because no wolf or fox may kill them too many deer because the mountain lions and the wolves must eat no venison too many skunks too many mice too many wildcats too many squirrels too many porcupines too many bear forbid the one great check of killing and you have too many lives control disease and succour injury with quickmoving robot medical technicians and another check is gone man took care of that said jenkins yes men took care of that men killed anything that stood within their path other men as well as animals man never thought of one great animal society never dreamed of skunk and coon and bear going down the road of life together planning with one another helping one anothersetting aside all natural differences but the dogs had and the dogs had done it like a brother rabbit story thought jenkins like the childhood fantasy of a long gone age like the story in the good book about the lion and the lamb lying down together like a walt disney cartoon except that the cartoon never had rung true for it was based on the philosophy of mankind the door creaked open and feet were on the floor jenkins shifted in his chair hello joshua he said hello ichabod wont you please come in i was just sitting here and thinking we were passing by said joshua and we saw a light i was thinking about the lights said jenkins nodding soberly i was thinking about the night five thousand years ago jon webster had come out from geneva the first man to come here for many hundred years and he was upstairs in bed and all the dogs were sleeping and i stood there by the window looking out across the river and there were no lights no lights at all just one great sweep of darkness and i stood there remembering the day when there had been lights and wondering if there ever would be lights again there are lights now said joshua speaking very softly there are lights all over the world tonight even in the caves and dens yes i know said jenkins its even better than it was before ichabod clumped across the floor to the shining robot body standing in the corner reached out one hand and stroked the metal hide almost tenderly it was very nice of the dogs said jenkins to give me the body but they shouldnt have with a little patching here and there the old ones good enough it was because we love you joshua told him it was the smallest thing the dogs could do we have tried to do other things for you but youd never let them do them we wish that you would let us build you a new house brand new with all the latest things jenkins shook his head it wouldnt be any use because i couldnt live there you see this place is home it has always been my home keep it patched up like my body and ill be happy in it but youre all alone no im not said jenkins the house is simply crowded crowded asked joshua people that i used to know said jenkins gosh said ichabod what a body i wish i could try it on ichabod yelled joshua you come back here keep your hands off that body let the youngster go said jenkins if he comes over here some time when im not busy no said joshua a branch scraped against the cave and tapped with tiny fingers along the windowpane a shingle rattled and the wind marched across the roof with tripping dancing feet im glad you stopped by said jenkins i want to talk to you he rocked back and forth and one of the rockers creaked i wont last forever jenkins said seven thousand years is longer than i had a right to expect to hang together with the new body said joshua youll be good for three times seven thousand more jenkins shook his head its not the body im thinking of its the brain its mechanical you see it was made well made to last a long time but not to last forever sometime something will go wrong and the brain will quit the rocker creaked in the silent room that will be death said jenkins that will be the end of me and thats all right thats the way it should be for im no longer any use once there was a time when i was needed we will always need you joshua said softly we couldnt get along without you but jenkins went on as if he had not heard him i want to tell you about the websters i want to talk about them i want you to understand i will try to understand said joshua you dogs call them websters and thats all right said jenkins it doesnt matter what you call them just so you know what they are sometimes said joshua you call them men and sometimes you call them websters i dont understand they were men said jenkins and they ruled the earth there was one family of them that went by the name of webster and they were the ones who did this great thing for you what great thing jenkins hitched the chair around and held it steady i am forgetful he mumbled i forget so easily and i get mixed up you were talking about a great thing the websters did for us eh said jenkins oh so i was so i was you must watch them you must caare for them and watch them especially you must watch them he rocked slowly to and fro and thoughts ran in his brain thoughts spaced off by the squeaking of the rocker you almost did it then he told himself you almost spoiled the dream but i remembered in time yes jon webster i caught myself in time i kept faith jon webster i did not tell joshua that the dogs once were pets of men that men raised them to the place they hold today for they must never know they must hold up their heads they must carry on their work the old fireside tales are gone and they must stay gone forever although id like to tell them lord knows id like to tell them warn them against the thing they must guard against tell them how we rooted out the old ideas from the cavemen we brought back from europe how we untaught them the many things they knew how we left their minds blank of weapons how we taught them love and peace and how we must watch against the day when theyll pick up those trends againthe old human way of thought but you said persisted joshua jenkins waved his hand it was nothing joshua just an old robots mumbling at times my brain gets fuzzy and i say things that i dont mean i think so much about the past and you say there isnt any past ichabod squatted on his haunches on the floor and looked up at jenkins there sure aint none he said we checked her forty ways from sunday and all the factors check they all add up there isnt any past there isnt any room said joshua you travel back along the line of time and you dont find the past but another world another bracket of consciousness the earth would be the same you see or almost the same same trees same rivers same hills but it wouldnt be the world we know because it has lived a different life it has developed differently the second back of us is not the second back of us at all but another second a totally separate sector of time we live in the same second all the time we move along within the bracket of that second that tiny bit of time that has been allotted to our particular world the way we keep time was to blame said ichabod it was the thing that kept us from thinking of it in the way it really was for we thought all the time that we were passing through time when we really werent when we never have weve just been moving along with time we said theres another second gone theres another minute and another hour and another day when as a matter of fact the second or the minute or the hour was never gone it was the same one all the time it had just moved along and we had moved with it jenkins nodded i see like driftwood on the river chips moving with the river and the scene changes along the river bank but the water is the same thats roughly it said joshua except that time is a rigid stream and the different worlds are more firmly fixed in place than the driftwood on the river and the cobblies live in those other worlds joshua nodded im sure they must and now said jenkins i suppose you are figuring out a way to travel to those other worlds joshua scratched softly at a flea sure he is said ichabod we need the space but the cobblies the cobblies might not be on all the worlds said joshua there might be some empty worlds if we can find them we need those empty worlds if we dont find space we are up against it population pressure will bring on a wave of killing and a wave of killing will set us back to where we started out theres already killing jenkins told him quietly joshua wrinkled his brow and laid back his ears funny killing dead but not eaten no blood as if they just fell over it has our medical technicians half crazy nothing wrong no reason that they should have died but they did said ichabod joshua hunched himself closer lowered his voice im afraid jenkins im afraid that theres nothing to be afraid of but there is angus told me angus is afraid that one of the cobblies that one of the cobblies got through a gust of wind sucked at the fireplace throat and gamboled in the eaves another gust hooted in some near dark corner and fear came out and marched across the roof marched with thumping deadened footsteps up and down the shingles jenkins shivered and held himself tight and rigid against another shiver his voice grated when he spoke no one has seen a cobbly you might not see a cobbly no said jenkins no you might not see one and that is what man had said before you did not see a ghost and you did not see a hauntbut you sensed that one was there for the water tap kept dripping when you had shut it tight and there were fingers scratching at the pane and the dogs would howl at something in the night and thered be no tracks in the snow and there were fingers scratching on the pane joshua came to his feet and stiffened a statue of a dog one paw lifted lips curled back in the beinning of a snarl ichabod crouched toes dug into the floorlistening waiting the scratching came again open the door jenkins said to ichabod there is something out there wanting to get in ichabod moved through the hushed silence of the room the door creaked beneath his hand as he opened it the squirrel came bounding in a grey streak that leaped for jenkins and landed in his lap why fatso jenkins said joshua sat down again and his lips uncurled slid down to hide his fangs ichabod wore a silly metal grin i saw him do it screamed fatso i saw him kill the robin he did it with a throwing stick and the feathers flew and there was blood upon the leaf quiet said jenkins gently take your time and tell me you are too excited you saw someone kill a robin fatso sucked in a breath and his teeth were chattering it was peter be said peter peter the webster you said he threw a stick he threw it with another stick he had the two ends tied together with a cord and he pulled on the cord and the stick bent i know said jenkins i know you know you know all about it yes said jenkins i know all about it it was a bow and arrow and there was something in the way he said it that held the other three to silence making the room seem big and empty and the tapping of the branch against the pane a sound from far away a hollow ticking voice that kept on complaining without the hope of aid a bow and arrow joshua finally asked what is a bow and arrow and what was it thought jenkins what is a bow and arrow it is the beginning of the end it is the winding path that grows to the roaring road of war it is a plaything and a weapon and a triumph in human engineering it is the first faint stirring of an atom bomb it is a symbol of a way of life and its a line in a nursery rhyme who killed cock robin i said the sparrow with my bow and arrow i killed cock robin and it was a thing forgotten and a thing relearned it is the thing that ive been afraid of he straightened in his chair came slowly to his feet ichabod he said i will need your help sure said ichabod anything you like the body said jenkins i want to wear my new body youll have to unseat my brain case ichabod nodded i know how to do it jenkins joshuas voice had a sudden edge of fear what is it jenkins what are you going to do im going to the mutants jenkins said speaking very slowly after all these years im going to ask their help the shadow slithered down the hill skirting the places where the moonlight flooded through forest openings he glimmered in the moonlightand he must not be seen he must not spoil the hunting of the others that came after there would be others not in a flood of course but carefully controlled a few at a time and well spread out so that the life of this wondrous world would not take alarm once it did take alarm the end would be in sight the shadow crouched in the darkness low against the ground and tested the night with twitching highstrung nerves he separated out the impulses that he knew cataloguing them in his knifesharp brain filing them neatly away as a check against his knowledge and some he knew and some were mystery and others he would guess at but there was one that held a hint of horror he pressed himself close against the ground and held his ugly head out straight and flat and closed his perceptions against the throbbing of the night concentrating on the thing that was coming up the hill there were two of them and the two were different a snarl rose in his mind and bubbled in his throat and his tenuous body tensed into something that was half slavering expectancy and half cringing outland terror he rose from the ground still crouched and flowed down the hill angling to cut the path of the two who were coming up jenkins was young again young and strong and swift swift of brain and body swift to stride along the windswept moondrenched hills swift to hear the talking of the leaves and the sleepy chirp of birdsand more than that yes much more than that he admitted to himself the body was a lulu a sledge hammer couldnt dent it and it would never rust but that wasnt all never figured a bodys make this much difference to me never knew how ramshackle and worn out the old one really was a poor job from the first although it was the best that could be done in the days when it was made machinery sure is wonderful the tricks they can make it do it was the robots of course the wild robots the dogs had fixed it up with them to make the body not very often the dogs had much truck with the robots got along all right and all of thatbut they got along because they let one another be because they didnt interfere because neither one was nosey there was a rabbit stirring in his denand jenkins knew it a raccoon was out on a midnight prowl and jenkins knew that tooknew the cunning sleek curiosity that went on within the brain behind the little eyes that stared at him from the dump of hazel brush and off to the left curled up beneath a tree a bear was sleeping and dreaming as he slepta gluttons dream of wild honey and fish scooped out of a creek with ants licked from the underside of an upturned rock as relish for the feast and it was startlingbut natural as natural as lifting ones feet to walk as natural as normal hearing was but it wasnt hearing and it wasnt seeing nor yet imagining for jenkins knew with a cool sure certainty about the rabbit in the den and the coon in the hazel brush and the bear who dreamed in his sleep beneath the tree and this he thought is the kind of bodies the wild robots havefor certainly if they could make one for me theyd make them for themselves they have come a long ways too in seven thousand years even as the dogs have travelled far since the exodus of humans but we paid no attention to them for that was the way it had to be the robots went their way and the dogs went theirs and they did not question what one another did had no curiosity about what one another did while the robots were building spaceships and shooting for the stars while they built bodies while they worked with mathematics and mechanics the dogs had worked with animals had forged a brotherhood of the things that had been wild and hunted in the days of manhad listened to the cobblies and tried to probe the depths of time to find there was no time and certainly if the dogs and robots have gone as far as this the mutants had gone farther still and they will listen to me jenkins said they will have to listen for im bringing them a problem that falls right into their laps because the mutants are mendespite their ways they are the sons of man they can bear no rancour now for the name of man is a dust that is blowing with the wind the sound of leaves on a summer day and nothing more besides i havent bothered them for seven thousand yearsnot that i ever bothered them joe was a friend of mine or as close to a friend as a mutant ever had hed talk with me when he wouldnt talk with men they will listen to me they will tell me what to do and they will not laugh because its not a laughing matter its just a bow and arrow but its not a laughing matter it might have been at one time but history takes the laugh out of many things if the arrow is a joke so is the atom bomb so is the sweep of diseaseladen dust that wiped out whole cities so is the screaming rocket that arcs and falls ten thousand miles away and kills a million people although now there are no million people a few hundred more or less living in the houses that the dogs built for them because then the dogs still knew what human beings were still knew the connection that existed between them and looked on men as gods looked on men as gods and told the old tales before the fire of a winter evening and built against the day when man might return and pat their heads and say well done thou good and faithful servant and that wasnt right said jenkins striding down the hill that wasnt right at all for men did not deserve that worship did not deserve the godhood lord knows i loved them well enough myself still love them for that matterbut not because they are men but because of the memory of a few of the many men it wasnt right that the dogs should build for man for they were doing better than man had ever done so i wiped the memory out and a long slow work it was over the long years i took away the legends and misted the memory and now they call men websters and think thats what they are i wondered if i had done right i felt like a traitor and i spent bitter nights when the world was asleep and dark and i sat in the rocking chair and listened to the wind moaning in the eaves for it was a thing i might not have the right to do it was a thing the websters might not have liked for that was the hold they had on me that they still have on me that over the stretch of many thousand years i might do a thing and worry that they might not like it but now i know im right the bow and arrow is the proof of that once i thought that man might have got started on the wrong road that somewhere in the dim dark savagery that was his cradle and his toddling place he might have got off on the wrong foot might have taken the wrong turning but i see that i was wrong theres one road and one road alone that man may travelthe bow and arrow road i tried hard enough lord knows i really tried when we rounded up the stragglers and brought them home to webster house i took away their weapons not only from their hands but from their minds i reedited the literature that could be reedited and i burned the rest i taught them to read again and sing again and think again and the books had no trace of war or weapons no trace of hate or history for history is hateno battles or heroics no trumpets but it was wasted time jenkins said to himself i know now that it was wasted time for a man will invent a bow and arrow no matter what you do he had come down the long hill and crossed the creek that tumbled towards the river and now he was climbing again climbing against the dark hard uplift of the cliffcrowned hill there were tiny rustlings and his new body told his mind that it was mice mice scurrying in the tunnels they had fashioned in the grass and for a moment he caught the little happiness that went with the running playful mice the little unformed uncoagulated thoughts of happy mice a weasel crouched for a moment on the bole of a fallen tree and his mind was evil evil with the thought of mice evil with remembrance of the old days when weasels made a meal of mice blood hunger and fear fear of what the dogs might do if he killed a mouse fear of the hundred eyes that watched against the killing that once had stalked the world but a man had killed a weasel dare not kill and a man had killed without intent perhaps without maliciousness but he had killed and the canons said one must not take a life in the years gone by others had killed and they had been punished and the man must be punished too but punishment was not enough punishment alone would not find the answer the answer must deal not with one man alone but with all men with the entire race for what one of them had done the rest were apt to do not only apt to do but bound to dofor they were men and men had killed before and would kill again the mutant castle reared black against the sky so black that it shimmered in the moonlight no light came from it and that was not strange at all for no light had come from it ever nor so far as anyone could know had the door ever opened into the outside world the mutants had built the castles all over the world and had gone into them and that had been the end the mutants had meddled in the affairs of men had fought a sort of chuckling war with men and when the men were gone the mutants had gone too jenkins came to the foot of the broad stone steps that led up to the door and halted head thrown back he stared at the building that reared its height above him i suppose joe is dead he told himself joe was longlived but he was not immortal he would not live forever and it will seem strange to meet another mutant and know it isnt joe he started the climb going very slowly every nerve alert waiting for the first sign of chuckling humour that would descend upon him but nothing happened he climbed the steps and stood before the door and looked for something to let the mutants know that he had arrived but there was no bell no buzzer no knocker the door was plain with a simple latch and that was all hesitantly he lifted his fist and knocked and knocked again then waited there was no answer the door was mute and motionless he knocked again louder this time still there was no answer slowly cautiously he put out a hand and seized the latch pressed down with his thumb the latch gave and the door swung open and jenkins stepped inside youre cracked in the brain said lupus id make them come and find me id give them a run they would remember id make it tough for them peter shook his head maybe thats the way youd do it lupus and maybe it would be right for you but it would be wrong for me websters never run away how do you know the wolf asked pitilessly youre just talking through your hair no webster had to run away before and if no webster had to run away before how do you know they never oh shut up said peter they travelled in silence up the rocky path breasting the hill theres something trailing us said lupus youre just imagining said peter what would be trailing us i dont know but do you smell anything well no did you hear anything or see anything no i didnt but then nothings following us peter declared positively nothing ever trails anything any more the moonlight filtered through the treetops making the forest a mottled black and silver from the river valley came the muffled sound of ducks in midnight argument a soft breeze came blowing up the hillside carrying with it a touch of river fog peters bowstring caught in a piece of brush and he stopped to untangle it he dropped some of the arrows he was carrying and stooped to pick them up you better figure out some other way to carry them things lupus growled at him youre all the time getting tangled up and dropping them and ive been thinking about it peter told him quietly maybe a bag of some sort to hang around my shoulder they went on up the hill what are you going to do when you get to webster house asked lupus im going to see jenkins peter said im going to tell him what ive done fatsos already told him but maybe he told him wrong maybe he didnt tell it right fatso was excited lamebrained too said lupus they crossed a patch of moonlight and plunged on up the darkling path im getting nervous lupus said im going to go back this is a crazy thing youre doing ive come part way with you but go back then said peter bitterly im not nervous im he whirled around hair rising on his scalp for there was something wrongsomething in the air he breathed something in his mindan eerie disturbing sense of danger and much more than danger a loathsome feeling that clawed at his shoulder blades and crawled along his back with a million prickly feet lupus he cried lupus a bush stirred violently down the trail and peter was running pounding down the trail he ducked around a brush and skidded to a halt his bow came up and with one motion be picked an arrow from his left hand nocked it to the cord lupus was stretched upon the ground half in shade and half in moonlight his lip was drawn back to show his fangs one paw still faintly clawed above him crouched a shape a shapeand nothing else a shape that spat and snarled a stream of angry sound that screamed in peters brain a tree branch moved in the wind and the moon showed through and peter saw the outline of the facea faint outline like the half erased chalk lines upon a dusty board a skulllike face with mewling mouth and slitted eyes and ears that were tufted with tentacles the bow cord hummed and the arrow splashed into the facesplashed into it and passed through and fell upon the ground and the face was there still snarling another arrow nocked against the cord and back far back almost to the ear an arrow driven by the snapping strength of wellseasoned straightgrained hickoryby the hate and fear and loathing of the man who pulled the cord the arrow spat against the chalky outlines of the face slowed and shivered then fell free another arrow and back with the cord farther yet this time farther for more power to kill the thing that would not die when an arrow struck it a thing that only slowed an arrow and made it shiver and then let it pass on through back and backand back and then it happened the bow string broke for an instant peter stood there with the useless weapon dangling in one hand the useless arrow hanging from the other stood and stared across the little space that separated him from the shadow horror that crouched across the wolfs grey body and he knew no fear no fear even though the weapon was no more but only flaming anger that shook him and a voice that hammered in his brain with one screaming word killkillkill he threw away the bow and stepped forward hands hooked at his side hooked into puny claws the shadow backed awaybacked away in a sudden pool of fear that lapped against its brainfear and horror at the flaming hatred that beat at it from the thing that walked towards it hatred that seized and twisted it fear and horror it had known beforefear and horror and disquieting resignationbut this was something new this was a whiplash of torture that seared across its nerves that burned across its brain this was hatred the shadow whimpered to itselfwhimpered and mewed and backed away and sought with frantic fingers of thought within its muddled brain for the symbols of escape the room was emptyempty and old and hollow a room that caught up the sound of the creaking door and flung it into muffled distances then hurled it back again a room heavy with the dust of forgetfulness filled with the brooding silence of aimless centuries jenkins stood with the door pull in his hand stood and flung all the sharp alertness of the new machinery that was his body into the corners and the darkened alcoves there was nothing nothing but the silence and the dust and darkness nor anything to indicate that for many years there had been anything but silence dust and darkness no faintest tremor of a residuary thought no footprints on the floor no fingermarks scrawled across the table an old song an incredibly old songa song that had been old when he had first been forged crept out of some forgotten corner of his brain and he was surprised that it still was there surprised that he had ever known itand knowing it dismayed at the swirl of centuries that it conjured up dismayed at the remembrance of the neat white houses that had stood upon a million hills dismayed at the thought of men who had loved their acres and walked them with the calm and quiet assurance of their ownership annie doesnt live here any more silly said jenkins to himself silly that some absurdity of an allbutvanished race should rise to haunt me now silly annie doesnt live here any more who killed cockrobin i said the sparrow he closed the door behind him and walked across the room dustcovered furniture stood waiting for the man who had not returned dustcovered tools and gadgets lay on the table tops dust covered the titles of the rows of books that filled the massive bookcase they are gone said jenkins talking to himself and no one knew the hour or the reason of their going nor even where they went they slipped off in the night and told no one they were leaving and sometimes no doubt they think back and chucklechuckle at the thought of our thinking that they still are here chuckle at the watch we keep against their coming out there were other doors and jenkins strode to one with his hand upon the latch he told himself the futility of opening it the futility of searching any further if this one room was old and empty so would be all the other rooms his thumb came down and the door came open and there was a blast of heat but there was no room there was deserta gold and yellow desert stretching to a horizon that was dim and burnished in the heat of a great blue sun a green and purple thing that might have been a lizard but wasnt skittered like a flash across the sand its tiny feet making the sound of eerie whistling jenkins slammed the door shut stood numbed in mind and body a desert a desert and a thing that skittered not another room not a hall nor yet a porchbut a desert and the sun was blueblue and blazing hot slowly cautiously he opened the door again at first a crack and then a little wider the desert still was there jenkins slammed the door and leaned with his back against it as if he needed the strength of his metal body to hold out the desert to hold out the implication of the door and desert they were smart he told himself smart and fast on their mental feet too fast and too smart for ordinary men we never knew just how smart they were but now i know they were smarter than we thought this room is just an anteroom to many other worlds a key that reaches across unguessable space to other planets that swing around unknown suns a way to leave this earth without ever leaving ita way to cross the void by stepping through a door there were other doors and jenkins stared at them stared and shook his head slowly he walked across the room to the entrance door quietly unwilling to break the hush of the dustfilled room he lifted the latch and let himself out and the familiar world was there the world of moon and stars of river fog drifting up between the hills of treetops talking to one another across the notches of the hills the mice still ran along their grassy burrows with happy mouse thoughts that were scarcely thoughts an owl sat brooding in the tree and his thoughts were murder so close thought jenkins so close to the surface still the old bloodhunger the old bonehate but were giving them a better start than man hadalthough probably it would have made no difference what kind of a start mankind might have had and here it is again the old bloodlust of man the craving to be different and to be stronger to impose his will by things of his devisingthings that make his arm stronger than any other arm or paw to make his teeth sink deeper than any natural fang to reach and hurt across distances that are beyond his own arms reach i thought i could get help that is why i came here and there is no help no help at all for the mutants were the only ones who might have helped and they have gone away its up to you jenkins told himself walking down the stairs mankinds up to you youve got to stop them somehow youve got to change them somehow you cant let them mess up the thing the dogs are doing you cant let them turn the world again into a bow and arrow world he walked through the leafy darkness of the hollow and knew the scent of mouldy leaves from the autumns harvest beneath the new green of growing things and that was something he told himself hed never known before his old body had no sense of smell smell and better vision and a sense of knowing of knowing what a thing was thinking to read the thoughts of raccoons to guess the thoughts of mice to know the murder in the brains of owls and weasels and something morea faint and windblown hatred an alien scream of terror it flicked across his brain and stopped him in his tracks then sent him running plunging up the hillside not as a man might run in darkness but as a robot runs seeing in the dark and with the strength of metal that has no gasping lungs or panting breath hatredand there could be one hatred only that could be like that the sense grew deeper and sharper as he went up the path in leaping strides and his mind moaned with the fear that sat upon itthe fear of what hed find he plunged around a clump of bushes and skidded to a halt the man was walking forward with his hands clenched at his side and on the grass lay the broken bow the wolfs grey body lay half in the moonlight half in shadow and backing away from it was a shadowy thing that was halflight halfshadow almost seen but never surely like a phantom creature that moves within ones dream peter cried jenkins but the words were soundless in his mouth for he sensed the frenzy in the brain of the halfseen creature a frenzy of cowering terror that cut through the hatred of the man who walked forward towards the drooling spitting blob of shadow cowering terror and frantic necessitya necessity of finding of remembering the man was almost on it walking straight and uprighta man with puny body and ridiculous fistsand courage courage thought jenkins courage to take on hell itself courage to go down into the pit and rip up the quaking flagstones and shout a lurid obscene jest at the keeper of the damned then the creature had ithad the thing it had been groping for knew the thing to do jenkins sensed the flood of relief that flashed across its being heard the thing part word part symbol part thought that it performed like a piece of mumbojumbo like a spoken charm like an incantation but not entirely that a mental exercise a thought that took command of the bodythat must be nearer to the truth for it worked the creature vanished vanished and was gonegone out of the world there was no sign of it no single vibration of its being as if it had never been and the thing it had said the thing that it had thought it went like this like this jenkins jerked himself up short it was printed on his brain and he knew it knew the word and thought and the right inflectionbut he must not use it he must forget about it be must keep it hidden for it had worked on the cobbly and it would work on him he knew that it would work the man had swung around and now he stood limp hands dangling at his side staring at jenkins his lips moved in the white blur of his face you you i am jenkins jenkins told him this is my new body there was something here said peter it was a cobbly said jenkins joshua told me one had gotten through it killed lupus said peter jenkins nodded yes it killed lupus and it killed many others it was the thing that has been killing and i killed it said peter i killed it or drove it away or something you frightened it away said jenkins you were stronger than it was it was afraid of you you frightened it back to the world it came from i could have killed it peter boasted but the cord broke next time said jenkins quietly you must make stronger cords i will show you how its done and a steel tip for your arrow for my what for your arrow the throwing stick is an arrow the stick and cord you throw it with is called a bow all together its called a bow and arrow peters shoulders sagged it was done before then i was not the first jenkins shook his head no you were not the first jenkins walked across the grass and lay his hand upon peters shoulder come home with me peter peter shook his head no ill sit here with lupus until the morning comes and then ill call in his friends and we will bury him he lifted his head to look into jenkins face lupus was a friend of mine a great friend jenkins i know he must have been said jenkins but ill be seeing you oh yes said peter im coming to the picnic the webster picnic its in a week or so so it is said jenkins speaking very slowly thinking as he spoke so it is and i will see you then he turned around and walked slowly up the hill peter sat down beside the dead wolf waiting for the dawn once or twice he lifted his hand to brush at his cheeks they sat in a semicircle facing jenkins and listened to him closely now you must pay attention jenkins said that is most important you must pay attention and you must think real hard and you must hang very tightly to the things you haveto the lunch baskets and the bows and arrows and the other things one of the girls giggled is this a new game jenkins yes said jenkins sort of i guess that is what it isa new game and an exciting one a most exciting one someone said jenkins always thinks up a new game for the webster picnic and now said jenkins you must pay attention you must look at me and try to figure out the thing im thinking its a guessing game shrieked the giggling girl i love guessing games jenkins made his mouth into a smile youre right be said thats exactly what it isa guessing game and now if you will pay attention and look at me i want to try out these bows and arrows said one of the men after this is over we can try them out cant we jenkins yes said jenkins patiently after this is over you can try them out he closed his eyes and made his brain reach out for each of them ticking them off individually sensing the thrilled expectancy of the minds that yearned towards his felt the little probing fingers of thought that were dabbing at his brain harder jenkins thought harder harder a quiver went across his mind and he brushed it away not hypnotismnor yet telepathy but the best that he could do a drawing together a huddling together of mindsand it was all a game slowly carefully he brought out the hidden symbolthe words the thought and the inflection easily he slid them into his brain one by one like one would speak to a child trying to teach it the exact tone the way to hold its lips the way to move its tongue he let them lay there for a moment felt the other minds touching them felt the fingers dabbing at them and then he thought them aloudthought them as the cobbly had thought them and nothing happened absolutely nothing no click within his brain no feeling of falling no vertigo no sensation at all so he had failed so it was over so the game was done he opened his eyes and the hillside was the same the sun still shone and the sky was robins egg he sat stiffly silently and felt them looking at him everything was the same as it had been before except there was a daisy where the clump of oswego tea had bloomed redly before there was a pasture rose beside him and there had been none when he had closed his eyes is that all theres to it asked the giggly girl plainly disappointed that is all said jenkins now we can try out the bows and arrows asked one of the youths yes said jenkins but be careful dont point them at one another they are dangerous peter will show you how well unpack the lunch said one of the women did you bring a basket jenkins yes said jenkins esther has it she held it when we played the game thats nice said the woman you surprise us every year with the things you bring and youll be surprised this year jenkins told himself youll be surprised at packages of seeds all very neatly labelled for well need seeds he thought to himself seeds to plant new gardens and to start new fieldsto raise food once again and well need bows and arrows to bring in some meat and spears and hooks for fish now other little things that were different began to show themselves the way a tree leaned at the edge of the meadow and a new kink in the river far below jenkins sat quietly in the sun listening to the shouts of the men and boys trying out the bows and arrows hearing the chatter of the women as they spread the cloth and unpacked the lunches ill have to tell them soon he told himself ill have to warn them to go easy on the foodnot to gobble it up all at one sitting for we will need that food to tide us over the first day or two until we can find roots to dig and fish to catch and fruit to pick yes pretty soon ill have to call them in and break the news to them tell them theyre on their own tell them why tell them to go ahead and do anything they want to for this is a brandnew world warn them about the cobblies although thats the least important man has a way with hima very vicious way a way of dealing with anything that stands in his path jenkins sighed lord help the cobblies he said notes on the eighth tale there is some suspicion that the eighth and final tale may be a fraud that it has no place in the ancient legend that it is a more recent story made up by some storyteller hungering for public acclamation structurally it is an acceptable story but the phraseology of it does not measure up to the narrative skill that goes into the others another thing is that it is too patently a story it is too clever in its assembly of material works the several angles from the other tales too patly together and yet while no trace of historic basis can be found in any of the other tales which are indisputably legendary there is historic basis for this tale it is a matter of record that one of the closed worlds is closed because it is a world of ants it is now an ant worldhas been an ant world for uncounted generations there is no evidence that the ant world is the original world on which the dogs arose but neither is there evidence that it is not the fact that research has not uncovered any world which can lay claim to being the original world would seem to indicate that the ant world might in fact be the world that was called the earth if that is so all hope of finding further evidence of the legends origin may be gone forever for only on the first world could there be artifacts which might prove beyond contention the origin of the legend only there could one hope to find the answer to the basic question of mans existence or his nonexistence if the ant world is the earth then the closed city of geneva and the house on webster hill are lost to us forever viii the simple way archie the little renegade raccoon crouched on the hillside trying to catch one of the tiny scurrying things running in the grass rufus archies robot tried to talk to archie but the raccoon was too busy and he did not answer homer did a thing no dog had ever done before he crossed the river and trotted into the wild robots camp and he was scared for there was no telling what the wild robots might do to him when they turned around and saw him but he was worried worse than he was scared so he trotted on deep in a secret nest ants dreamed and planned for a world they could not understand and pushed into that world hoping for the best aiming at a thing no dog or robot or man could understand in geneva jon webster rounded out his tenthousandth year of suspended animation and slept on not stirring in the street outside a wandering breeze rustled the leaves along the boulevard but no one heard and no one saw jenkins strode across the hill and did not look to either left or right for there were things he did not wish to see there was a tree that stood where another tree had stood in another world there was the lay of ground that had been imprinted on his brain with a billion footsteps across ten thousand years and if one listened closely one might have heard laughter echoing down the ages the sardonic laughter of a man named joe archie caught one of the scurrying things and held it clutched within his tightshut paw carefully he lifted the paw and opened it and the thing was there running madly trying to escape archie said rufus you arent listening to me the scurrying thing dived into archies fur streaked swiftly up his forearm might have been a flea said archie he sat up and scratched his belly new kind of flea he said although i hope it wasnt just the ordinary kind are bad enough you arent listening said rufus im busy said archie the grass is full of them things got to find out what they are im leaving you archie youre what leaving you said rufus im going to the building youre crazy fumed archie you cant do a thing like that to me youve been tetched ever since you fell into that ant hill ive had the call said rufus i just got to go ive been good to you the raccoon pleaded ive never overworked you youve been like a pal of mine instead of like a robot ive always treated you just like an animal rufus shook his head stubbornly you cant make me stay he said i couldnt stay no matter what you did i got the call and i got to go it isnt like i could get another robot archie argued they drew my number and i ran away im a deserter and you know i am you know i cant get another robot with the wardens watching for me rufus just stood there i need you archie told him you got to stay and help me rustle grub i cant go near none of the feeding places or the wardens will nab me and drag me up to webster hill you got to help me dig a den winters coming on and i will need a den it wont have heat or light but i got to have one and youve got to rufus had turned around and was walking down the hill heading for the river trail down the river trail travelling towards the dark smudge above the far horizon archie sat hunched against the wind that ruffled through his fur tucked his tail around his feet the wind had a chill about it a chill it had not held an hour or so before and it was not the chill of weather but the chill of other things his bright beady eyes searched the hillside and there was no sign of rufus no food no den no robot hunted by the wardens eaten up by fleas and the building a smudge against the farther hills across the river valley a hundred years ago so the records said the building had been no bigger than the webster house but it had grown since a place that never was completed first it had covered an acre and then a square mile now finally a township and still it grew sprawling out and towering up a smudge above the hills and a cloudy terror for the little superstitious forest folks who watched it a word to frighten kit and whelp and cub into sudden quiet for there was evil there the evil of the unknown an evil sensed and attributed rather than seen or heard or smelled a sensed evil especially in the dark of night when the lights were out and the wind keened in the dens mouth and the other animals were sleeping while one lay awake and listened to the pulsing otherness that sang between the worlds archie blinked in the autumn sunlight scratched furtively at his side maybe someday he told himself someone will find a way to handle fleas something to rub on ones fur so they will stay away or a way to reason with them to reach them and talk things over with them maybe set up a reservation for them a place where they could stay and be fed and not bother animals or something of the sort as it was there wasnt much that could be done you scratched yourself you bad your robot pick them off although the robot usually got more fur than fleas you rolled in the sand or dust you went for a swim and drowned some of them well you really didnt drown them you just washed them off and if some of them drowned that was their own tough luck you had your robot pick them off but now there was no robot no robot to pick off fleas no robot to help him hunt for food but archie remembered there was a black haw tree down in the river bottom and last nights frost would have touched the fruit he smacked his lips thinking of the haws and there was a cornfield just over the ridge if one was fast enough and bided his time and was sneaky about it it was no trouble at all to get an ear of corn and if worse came to worse there always would be roots and wild acorns and that patch of wild grapes over on the sand bar let rufus go said archie mumbling to himself let the dogs keep their feeding stations let the wardens go on watching he would live his own life he would eat fruit and grub for roots and raid the cornfields even as his remote ancestors had eaten fruits and grubbed for roots and raided fields he would live as the other raccoons had lived before the dogs had come along with their ideas about the brotherhood of beasts like animals had lived before they could talk with words before they could read the printed books that the dogs provided before they had robots that served in lieu of hands before there was warmth and light for dens yes and before there was a lottery that told you if you stayed on earth or went to another world the dogs archie remembered had been quite persuasive about it very reasonable and suave some animals they said had to go to the other worlds or there would be too many animals on earth earth wasnt big enough they said to hold everyone and a lottery they pointed out was the fair way to decide which of them would go to the other worlds and after all they said the other worlds would be almost like the earth for they were just extensions of the earth just other worlds following in the track of earth not quite like it perhaps but very close just a minor difference here and there maybe no tree where there was a tree on earth maybe an oak tree where earth had a walnut tree maybe a spring of fresh cold water where there was no such spring on earth maybe homer had told him growing very enthusiastic maybe the world he would be assigned to would be a better world than earth archie hunched against the hillside felt the warmish sun of autumn cutting through the cold chill of autumns wind he thought about the black haws they would be soft and mushy and there would be some of them lying on the ground he would eat those that were on the ground then hed climb the tree and pick some more and then hed climb down again and finish off the ones he bad shaken loose with his climbing of the tree hed eat them and take them in his paws and smear them on his face he might even roll in them out of the corner of one eye he saw the scurrying things running in the grass like ants he thought only they werent ants at least not like any ants hed ever seen before fleas maybe a new kind of flea his paw darted out and snatched one up he felt it running in his palm he opened the paw and saw it running there and closed the paw again he raised his paw to his ear and listened the thing hed caught was ticking the wild robot camp was not at all the way homer had imagined it would be there were no buildings just launching ramps and three spaceships and half a dozen robots working on one of the ships although come to think of it homer told himself one should have known there would be no buildings in a robot camp for the robots would have no use of shelter and that was all a building was homer was scared but he tried hard not to show it he curled his tail over his back and carried his head high and his ears well forward and trotted towards the little group of robots never hesitating when he reached them he sat down and lolled out his tongue and waited for one of them to speak but when none of them did he screwed up his courage and spoke to them himself my name is homer he said and i represent the dogs if you have a head robot i would like to talk to him the robots kept on working for a minute but finally one of them turned around and came over and squatted down beside homer so that his head was level with the dogs head all the other robots kept on working as if nothing had happened i am a robot called andrew said the robot squatting next to homer and i am not what you would call the head robot for we have no such thing among us but i can speak with you i came to you about the building homer told him i take it said the robot called andrew that you are speaking of the structure to the northeast of us the one you can see from here if you just turn around thats the one said homer i came to ask why you are building it but we arent building it said andrew we have seen robots working on it yes there are robots working there but we are not building it you are helping someone else andrew shook his head some of us get a call a call to go and work there the rest of us do not try to stop them for we are all free agents but who is building it asked homer the ants said andrew homers jaw dropped slack ants you mean the insects the little things that live in ant hills precisely said andrew he made the fingers of one hand run across the sand like a harried ant but they couldnt build a placelike that protested homer they are stupid not any more said andrew homer sat stock still frozen to the sand felt chilly feet of terror run along his nerves not any more said andrew talking to himself not stupid any more you see once upon a time there was a man named joe a man whats that asked homer the robot made a clucking noise as if gently chiding homer men were animals he said animals that went on two legs they looked very much like us except they were flesh and we are metal you must mean the websters said homer we know about things like that but we call them websters the robot nodded slowly yes the websters could be men there was a family of them by that name lived just across the river theres a place called webster house said homer it stands on websters hill thats the place said andrew we keep it up said homer its a shrine to us but we dont understand just why it is the word that has been passed down to us we must keep webster house the websters andrew told him were the ones that taught you dogs to speak homer stiffened no one taught us to speak we taught ourselves we developed in the course of many years and we taught the other animals andrew the robot sat hunched in the sun nodding his bead as if be might be thinking to himself ten thousand years he said no i guess its nearer twelve around eleven maybe homer waited and as he waited he sensed the weight of years that pressed against the hills the years of river and of sun of sand and wind and sky and the years of andrew you are old be said you can remember that far back yes said andrew although i am one of the last of the manmade robots i was made just a few years before they went to jupiter homer sat silently tumult stirring in his brain man a new word an animal that went on two legs an animal that made the robots that taught the dogs to talk and as if he might be reading homers mind andrew spoke to him you should not have stayed away from us he said we should have worked together we worked together once we both would have gained if we had worked together we were afraid of you said homer i am still afraid of you yes said andrew yes i suppose you would be i suppose jenkins kept you afraid of us for jenkins was a smart one he knew that you must start fresh he knew that you must not carry the memory of man as a dead weight on your necks homer sat silently and we the robot said are nothing more than the memory of man we do the things he did although more scientifically for since we are machines we must be scientific more patiently than man because we have forever and he had a few short years andrew drew two lines in the sand crossed them with two other lines he made an x in the open square in the upper left hand corner you think im crazy he said you think im talking through my hat homer wriggled his haunches deeper into the sand i dont know what to think he said all these years andrew drew an o with his finger in the centre square of the crosshatch he had drawn in the sand i know he said all these years you have lived with a dream the idea that the dogs were the prime movers and the facts are hard to understand hard to reconcile maybe it would be just as well if you forgot what i said facts are painful things at times a robot has to work with them for they are the only things he has to work with we cant dream you know facts are all we have we passed fact long ago homer told him not that we dont use it for there are times we do but we work in other ways intuition and cobblying and listening you arent mechanical said andrew for you two and two are not always four but for us it must be four and sometimes i wonder if tradition doesnt blind us i wonder sometimes if two and two may not be something more or less than four they squatted in silence watching the river a flood of molten silver tumbling down a coloured land andrew made an x in the upper right hand corner of the crosshatch an o in the centre upper space and x in the centre lower space with the flat of his hand he rubbed the sand smooth i never win he said im too smart for myself you were telling me about the ants said homer about them not being stupid any more oh yes said andrew i was telling you about a man named joe jenkins strode across the hill and did not look to either left or right for there were things he did not wish to see things that struck too deeply into memory there was a tree that stood where another tree had stood in another world there was the lay of ground that had been imprinted on his brain with a billion footsteps across ten thousand years the weak winter sun of afternoon flickered in the sky flickered like a candle guttering in the wind and when it steadied and there was no flicker it was moonlight and not sunlight at all jenkins checked his stride and swung around and the house was there lowset against the ground sprawled across the hill like a sleepy young thing that clung close to mother earth jenkins took a hesitant step and as he moved his metal body glowed and sparkled in the moonlight that had been sunlight a short heartbeat ago from the river valley came the sound of a night bird crying and a raccoon was whimpering in a cornfield just below the ridge jenkins took another step and prayed the house would stay although he knew it couldnt because it wasnt there for this was an empty hilltop that had never known a house this was another world in which no house existed the house remained dark and silent no smoke from the chimneys no light from the windows but with remembered lines that one could not mistake jenkins moved slowly carefully afraid the house would leave afraid that he would startle it and it would disappear but the house stayed put and there were other things the tree at the corner had been an elm and now it was an oak as it had been before and it was autumn moon instead of winter sun the breeze was blowing from the west and not out of the north something happened thought jenkins the thing that has been growing on me the thing i felt and could not understand an ability developing or a new sense finally reaching light or a power i never dreamed i had a power to walk between the worlds at will a power to go anywhere i choose by the shortest route that the twisting lines of force and happenstance can conjure up for me he walked less carefully and the house still stayed unfrightened solid and substantial he crossed the grassgrown patio and stood before the door hesitantly he put out a hand and laid it on the latch and the latch was there no phantom thing but substantial metal slowly he lifted it and the door swung in and he stepped across the threshold after five thousand years jenkins had come home back to webster house so there was a man named joe not a webster but a man for a webster was a man and the dogs had not been first homer lay before the fire a limp pile of fur and bone and muscle with his paws stretched out in front of him and his head resting on his paws through halfclosed eyes he saw the fire and shadow felt the heat of the blazing logs reach out and fluff his fur but inside his brain he saw the sand and the squatting robot and the hills with the years upon them andrew had squatted in the sand and talked with the autumn sun shining on his shoulders had talked of men and dogs and ants of a thing that had happened when nathaniel was alive and that was a time long gone for nathaniel was the first dog there had been a man named joe a mutantman a morethanman who had wondered about ants twelve thousand years ago wondered why they had progressed so far and then no farther why they had reached the dead end of destiny hunger perhaps joe had reasoned the everpressing need to garner food so that they might live hibernation perhaps the stagnation of the winter sleep the broken memory chain the starting over once again each year a genesis for ants so andrew said his bald pate gleaming in the sun joe had picked one hill had set himself up as a god to change the destiny of ants he had fed them so that they need not strive with hunger he had enclosed their hill in a dome of glassite and had heated it so they need not hibernate and the thing had worked the ants advanced they fashioned carts and they smelted ore this much one could know for the carts were on the surface and acrid smelting smoke came from the chimneys that thrust up from the hill what other things they did what other things they learned deep down in their tunnels there was no way of knowing joe was crazy andrew said crazy and yet maybe not so crazy either for one day he broke the dome of glassite and tore the hill asunder with his foot then turned and walked away not caring any more what happened to the ants but the ants had cared the hand that broke the dome the foot that ripped the hill had put the ants on the road to greatness it had made them fight fight to keep the things they had fight to keep the bottleneck of destiny from closing once again a kick in the pants said andrew a kick in the pants for ants a kick in the right direction twelve thousand years ago a broken trampled hill today a mighty building that grew with each passing year a building that had covered a township in one short century that would cover a hundred townships in the next a building that would push out and take the land land that belonged not to ants but animals a building and that was not quite right although it had been called the building from the very start for a building was a shelter a place to hide from storm and cold the ants would have no need of that for they had their tunnels and their hills why would an ant build a place that sprawled across a township in a hundred years and yet that kept on growing what possible use could an ant have for a place like that homer nuzzled his chin deep into his paws growled inside his throat there was no way of knowing for first you had to know how an ant would think you would have to know her ambition and her goal you would have to probe her knowledge twelve thousand years of knowledge twelve thousand years from a starting point that itself was unknowable but one had to know there must be a way to know for year after year the building would push out a mile across and then six miles and after that a hundred a hundred miles and then another hundred and after that the world retreat thought homer yes we could retreat we could migrate to those other worlds the worlds that follow us in the stream of time the worlds that tread on one anothers heels we could give the earth to ants and there still would be space for us but this is home this is where the dogs arose this is where we taught the animals to talk and think and act together this is the place where we created the brotherhood of beasts for it does not matter who came first the webster or the dog this place is home our home as well as websters borne our home as well as ants and we must stop the ants there must be a way to stop them a way to talk to them find out what they want a way to reason with them some basis for negotiation some agreement to be reached homer lay motionless on the hearth and listened to the whisperings that ran through the house the soft faroff padding of robots on their rounds of duties the muted talk of dogs in a room upstairs the crackling of the flames as they ate along the log a good life said homer muttering to himself a good life and we thought we were the ones who made it although andrew says it wasnt us andrew says we have not added one iota to the mechanical skill and mechanical logic that was our heritage and that we have lost a lot he spoke of chemistry and be tried to explain but i couldnt understand the study of elements he said and things like molecules and atoms and electronics although he said we did certain things without the benefit of electronics more wonderfully than man could have done with all his knowledge you might study electronics for a million years he said and not reach those other worlds not even know theyre there and we did it we did a thing a webster could not do because we think differently than a webster does no its man not webster and our robots our robots are no better than the ones that were left to us by man a minor modification here and there an obvious modification but no real improvement who ever would have dreamed there could be a better robot a better ear of corn yes or a better walnut tree or a wild rice that would grow a fuller head a better way to make the yeast that substitutes for meat but a better robot why a robot does everything we might wish that it could do why should it be better and yet the robots receive a call and go off to work on the building to build a thing that will push us off the earth we do not understand of course we cannot understand if we knew our robots better we might understand understanding we might fix it so that the robots would not receive the call or receiving it would pay it no attention and that of course would be the answer if the robots did not work there would be no building for the ants without the aid of robots could not go on with their building a flea ran along homers scalp and he twitched his ear although andrew might be wrong he told himself we have our legend of the rise of the brotherhood of beasts and the wild robots have their legend of the fall of man at this date who is there to tell which of the two is right but andrews story does tie in there were dogs and there were robots and when man fell they went their separate ways although we kept some of the robots to serve as hands for us some robots stayed with us but no dogs stayed with the robots a late autumn fly buzzed out of a corner bewildered in the firelight it buzzed around homers head and settled on his nose homer glared at it and it lifted its legs and insolently brushed its wings homer dabbed at it with a paw and it flew away a knock came at the door homer lifted his head and blinked at the knocking sound come in he finally said it was the robot hezekiah they caught archie hezekiah said archie archie the raccoon oh yes said homer he was the one that ran away they have him out here now said hezekiah do you want to see him send them in said homer hezekiah beckoned with his finger and archie ambled through the door his fur was matted with burs and his tail was dragging behind him stalked two robot wardens he tried to steal some corn one of the wardens said and we spotted him but he led us quite a chase homer sat up ponderously and stared at archie archie stared straight back they never would have caught me archie said if id still had rufus rufus was my robot and he would have warned me and where is rufus now he got the call today said archie and left me for the building tell me said homer did anything happen to rufus before he left anything unusual out of the ordinary nothing archie told him except that he fell into an ant hill he was a clumsy robot a regular stumble bum always tripping himself getting tangled up he wasnt coordinated just the way he should be he had a screw loose some place something black and tiny jumped off of archies nose raced along the floor archies paw went out in a lightning stroke and scooped it up you better move back a ways hezekiah warned homer hes simply dripping fleas its not a flea said archie puffing up in anger it is some thing else i caught it this afternoon it ticks and it looks like an ant but it isnt one the thing that ticked oozed between archies claws and tumbled to the floor it landed right side up and was off again archie made a stab at it but it zigzagged out of reach like a flash it reached hezekiah and streaked up his leg homer came to his feet in a sudden flash of knowledge quick he shouted get it catch it dont let it but the thing was gone slowly homer sat down again his voice was quiet now quiet and almost deadly wardens he said take hezekiah into custody dont leave his side dont let him get away report to me everything he does hezekiah backed away but i havent done a thing no said homer softly no you havent yet but you will youll get the call and youll try to desert us for the building and before we let you go well find out what it is that made you do it what it is and how it works homer turned around a doggish grin wrinkling up his face and now archie but there was no archie there was an open window and there was no archie homer stirred on his bed of hay unwilling to awake a growl gurgling in his throat getting old he thought too many years upon me like the years upon the hills there was a time when id be out of bed at the first sound of something at the door on my feet with hay sticking in my fur barking my head off to let the robots know the knock came again and homer staggered to his feet come in he yelled cut out the racket and come in the door opened and it was a robot but a bigger robot than homer had ever seen before a gleaming robot huge and massive with a polished body that shone like slow fire even in the dark and riding on the robots shoulder was archie the raccoon i am jenkins said the robot i came back tonight homer gulped and sat down very slowly jenkins he said there are stories legends from the long ago no more than a legend jenkins asked thats all said homer a legend of a robot that looked after us although andrew spoke of jenkins this afternoon as if he might have known him and there is a story of how the dogs gave you a body on your seven thousandth birthday and it was a marvellous body that his voice ran down for the body of the robot that stood before him with the raccoon perched on his shoulder that body could be none other than the birthday gift and webster house asked jenkins you still keep webster house we still keep webster house said homer we keep it as it is its a thing we have to do the websters there arent any websters jenkins nodded at that his bodys hairtrigger sense had told him there were no websters there were no webster vibrations there was no thought of websters in the minds of things hed touched and that was as it should be he came slowly across the room softfooted as a cat despite his mighty weight and homer felt him moving felt the friendliness and kindness of the metal creature the protectiveness of the ponderous strength within him jenkins squatted down beside him you are in trouble jenkins said homer stared at him the ants said jenkins archie told me said you were troubled by the ants i went to webster house to hide said archie i was scared you would hunt me down again and i thought that webster house hush archie jenkins told him you dont know a thing about it you told me that you didnt you just said the dogs were having trouble with the ants he looked at homer i suppose they are joes ants he said so you know about joe said homer so there was a man called joe jenkins chuckled yes a troublemaker but likeable at times he had the devil in him homer said theyre building they get the robots to work for them and they are putting up a building surely said jenkins even ants have the right to build but theyre building too fast theyll push us off the earth another thousand years or so and theyll cover the whole earth if they keep on building at the rate theyve been and you have no place to go thats what worries you yes we have a place to go many places all the other worlds the cobbly worlds jenkins nodded gravely i was in a cobbly world the first world after this i took some websters there five thousand years ago i just came back tonight and i know the way you feel no other world is home ive hungered for the earth for almost every one of those five thousand years i came back to webster house and i found archie there he told me about the ants and so i came up here i hope you do not mind we are glad you came said homer softly these ants said jenkins i suppose you want to stop them homer nodded his head there is a way said jenkins i know there is a way the websters had a way if i could just remember but its so long ago and its a simple way i know a very simple way his hand came up and scraped back and forth across his chin what are you doing that for archie asked eh rubbing your face that way what do you do it for jenkins dropped his hand just a habit archie a webster gesture a way they had of thinking i picked it up from them does it help you think well maybe maybe not it seemed to help the websters now what would a webster do in a case like this the websters could help us i know they could the websters in the cobbly world said homer jenkins shook his head there arent any websters there but you said you took some back i know but they arent there now ive been alone in the cobbly world for almost four thousand years then there arent websters anywhere the rest went to jupiter andrew told me that jenkins where is jupiter yes there are said jenkins there are some websters left i mean or there used to be a few left at geneva it wont be easy homer said not even for a webster those ants are smart archie told you about the flea he found it wasnt any flea said archie yes he told me jenkins said said it got on to hezekiah not onto homer told them into is the word it wasnt a flea it was a robot a tiny robot it drilled a hole in hezekiahs skull and got into his brain it sealed the hole behind it and what is hezekiah doing now nothing said homer but we are pretty sure what will do as soon as the ant robot gets the setup fixed hell get the call hell get the call to go and work on the building jenkins nodded taking over he said they cant do job like that themselves so they take control of things that can he lifted his hand again and scraped it across his chin i wonder if joe knew he mumbled when he played god to the ants i wonder if he knew but that was ridiculous joe never could have known even a mutation like joe could not have looked twelve thousand years ahead so long ago thought jenkins so many things have happened bruce webster was just starting to experiment with dogs had no more than dreamed his dream of talking thinking dogs that would go down the path of destiny paw in hand with man not knowing then that man within a few short centuries would scatter to the four winds of eternity and leave the earth to robot and to dog not knowing then that even the name of man would be forgotten in the dust of years that the race would come to be known by the name of a single family and yet thought jenkins if it was to be any family the websters were the ones i can remember them as it it were yesterday those were the days when i thought of myself as a webster too lord knows i tried to be i did the best i could i stood by the webster dogs when the race of men had gone and finally i took the last bothersome survivors of that madcap race into another world to clear the way for dogs so that the dogs could fashion the earth in the way they planned and now even those last bothersome survivors have gone some place somewhere i wish that i could know escaped into some fantasy of the human mind and the men on jupiter are not even men but something else and geneva is shut off blocked off from the world although it cant be farther away or blocked more tightly than the world from which i came if only i could learn how it was i travelled from the exile cobbly world back to webster house then maybe perhaps somehow or other i could reach geneva a new power he told himself a new ability a thing that grew upon me without my knowing that it grew a thing that every man and every robotand perhaps every dog could have if he but knew the way although it may be my body that made it possible this body that the dogs gave me on my seven thousandth birthday a body that has more than any body of flesh and blood has ever quite attained a body that can know what a bear is thinking or a fox is dreaming that can feel the happy little mouse thoughts running in the grass wish fulfilment that might be it the answer to the strange illogical yearnings for things that seldom are and often cannot be but all of which are possible if one knows the way if one can grow or develop or graft onto oneself the new ability that directs the mind and body to the fulfilment of the wish i walked the hill each day he remembered walked there because i could not stay away because the longing was so strong steeling myself against looking too closely for there were differences i did not wish to see i walked there a million times and it took that many times before the power within me was strong enough to take me back for i was trapped the word the thought the concept that took me into the cobbly world was a one way ticket and while it took me there it could not take me back but there was another way a way i did not know that even now i do not know you said there was a way urged homer a way yes a way to stop the ants jenkins nodded i am going to find out im going to geneva jon webster awoke and this is strange he thought for i said eternity i was to sleep forever and forever has no end all else was mist and the greyness of sleep forgetfulness but this much stood out with mindsharp clarity eternity and this was not eternity a word ticked at his mind like feeble tapping on a door that was far away he lay and listened to the tapping and the word became two words words that spoke his name jon webster jon webster on and on on and on two words tapping at his brain jon webster jon webster yes said websters brain and the words stopped and did not come again silence and the thinning of the mists of forgetfulness and the trickling back of memory one thing at a time there was a city and the name of the city was geneva men lived in the city but men without a purpose the dogs lived outside the city in the whole world outside the city the dogs had purpose and a dream sara climbed the hill to take a century of dreams and i i thought jon webster climbed the hill and asked for eternity this is not eternity this is jenkins jon webster yes jenkins said jon webster and yet he did not say it not with lip and tongue and throat for he felt the fluid that pressed around his body inside its cylinder fluid that fed him and kept him from dehydrating fluid that sealed his lips and eyes and ears yes jenkins said webster speaking with his mind iremember you i remember you now you were with the family from the very first you helped us teach the dogs you stayed with them when the family was no more i am still with them said jenkins i sought eternity said webster i closed the city and sought eternity we often wondered jenkins told him why did you close the city the dogs said websters mind the dogs had to have their chance man would have spoiled their chance the dogs are doing well said jenkins but the city is open now no the city still is closed but you are here yes but im the only one who knows the way and there will be no others not for a long time anyway time said webster i had forgotten time how long is it jenkins since you closed the city ten thousand years or so and there are others yes but they are sleeping and the robots the robots still keep watch the robots still keep watch webster lay quietly and a peace came upon his mind the city still was closed and the last of men were sleeping the dogs were doing well and the robots stayed on watch you should not have wakened me he said you should have let me sleep there was a thing i had to know i knew it once but i have forgotten and it is very simple simple and yet terribly important webster chuckled in his brain what is it jenkins its about ants said jenkins ants used to trouble men what did you do about it why we poisoned them said webster jenkins gasped poisoned them yes said webster a very simple thing we used a base of syrup sweet to attract the ants and we put poison in it a poison that was deadly to ants but we did not put enough of it to kill them right away a slow poison you see so they would have time to carry it to the nest that way we killed many instead of just two or three silence hummed in websters head the silence of no thought no words jenkins he said jenkins are you yes jon webster i am here that is all you want that is all i want i can go to sleep again yes jon webster go to sleep again jenkins stood upon the hilltop and felt the first rough forerunning wind of winter whine across the land below him the slope that ran down to the river was etched in black and grey with the leafless skeletons of trees to the northeast rose the shadowshape the cloud of evil omen that was called the building a growing thing spawned in the mind of ants built for what purpose and to what end nothing but an ant could even closely guess but there was a way to deal with ants the human way the way jon webster had told him after ten thousand years of sleep a simple way and a fundamental way a brutal but efficient way you took some syrup sweet so the ants would like it and you put some poison in it slow poison so it wouldnt work too fast the simple way of poison jenkins said the very simple way except it called for chemistry and the dogs knew no chemistry except it called for killing and there was no killing not even fleas and the dogs were pestered plenty by the fleas not even ants and the ants threatened to dispossess the animals of the world they called their birthplace there had been no killing for five thousand years or more the idea of killing had been swept from the minds of things and it is better that way jenkins told himself better that one should lose a world than go back to killing he turned slowly and went down the hill homer would be disappointed he told himself terribly disappointed when he found the websters had no way of dealing with the ants the end
