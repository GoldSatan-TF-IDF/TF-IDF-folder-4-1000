from a letter by clark ashton smith will you not join me in atlantis where we will go down through streets of blue and yellow marble to the wharves of orichalch and choose us a galley with a golden eros for figurehead and sails of tyrian sendal with mariners that knew odysseus and beautiful amberbreasted slaves from the mountainvales of lemuria we will lift anchor for the unknown fortunate isles of the outer sea and sailing in the wake of an opal sunset will lose that ancient land in the glaucous twilight and see from our couch of ivory and satin the rising of unknown stars and perished planets perhaps we will not return but will follow the tropic summer from isle to halcyon isle across the amaranthine seas of myths and fable we will eat the lotos and the fruit of lands whereof odysseus never dreamt and drink the pallid wines of faery grown in a vale of perpetual moonlight i will find for you a necklace of rosytinted pearls and a necklace of yellow rubies and crown you with precious corals that have the semblance of sanguinecoloured blossoms we will roam in the marts of forgotten cities of jasper and carnelianbuilded ports beyond cathay and i will buy you a gown of peacock azure damascened with copper and gold and vermilion and a gown of black samite with runes of orange woven by fantastic sorcery without the touch of hands in a dim land of spells and philtres
