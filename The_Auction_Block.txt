the auction block by rex beach author of the silver horde the spoilers the iron trail etc illustrated the auction block chapter i peter knight flung himself into the decrepit armchair beside the centertable and growled isnt that just my luck and me a democrat for twenty years theres nothing in politics jimmy his son james smiled crookedly with a languid tolerance bespeaking amusement and contempt james prided himself upon his forbearance and it was rarely indeed that he betrayed more than a hint of the superiority which he felt toward his parent politics is all right provided youre a good picker he said with all the assurance of twentytwo but you fell off the wrong side of the fence and youre sore of course i am wouldnt anybody be sore these country towns always go in for the reform stuff every so often if youd listen to me and his father interrupted harshly now cut that out i dont want to go to new york and i wont peter knight tried to look forceful but the expression did not fit his weak complacent features he was a plump man with red cheeks rounded by habitual good humor his chin was short and beneath it were other chins distended and sagging as if from the weight of chuckles within when he had succeeded in fixing a look of determination upon his countenance the result was an artificial scowl and a palpably false pout wearing such a front he continued when i say no i mean it and the subject is closed i like vale i know everybody here and everybody knows me thats why its time to move said jim with another unpleasant curl of his lip as long as they didnt know you you got past but youll never hold another office indeed my records open to inspection i made the best sheriff in two years dont kid yourself pa your foot slipped when the trolley line went through what do you know about the trolley line angrily demanded mr knight well i know as much as the county knows and i know something about the big dam too you got into the mud pa but you didnt go deep enough to find the frogs fogarty got his didnt he mr knight breathed deep with indignation senator fogarty is my good friend i wont let you question his honor although you do presume to question mine of course hes your friend thats why hes fixed you for this new york job hes not like these reubs he remembers a good turn and blows back with another hes a real politician department of water supply gas and electricity sneered peter it sounds good but the salary is fifteen hundred a year a clerk at my age say dyou suppose tammany men live on their salaries jimmy inquired wake up this is your chance to horn into the real herd in new york politics is a vocation up here its a vacationeverybody tries it once like music lessons if youd been hooked up with tammany instead of the state machine youd have been taken care of i tell you i dont like cities its no place to raise kids at this james betrayed some irritation im of age and loreleis a grown woman if we dont get out of vale ill still be a brakeman on a sodafountain when im your age if youd worked hard youd have had an interest in the drug store now rats at this juncture mrs knight having finished the supper dishes and set her bread to rise entered the shoddy parlor jim turned to her shrugging his shoulders with an air of washing his hands of a disagreeable subject pas weakened again he explained he wont go me a clerk at my age mumbled peter ive been trying to tell him that hed get a halfnelson on tammany inside of a year he squeezed the sheriffs office till it squealed and if he can pinch a dollar out of this burg he can you shut up i dont like your way of saying things snarled mr knight his wife spoke for the first time with brief conclusiveness i wrote and thanked senator fogarty for his offer and told him youd accept you what peter was dumfounded yes mrs knight seemed oblivious of his wrath were going to make a change mrs knight was a large woman well advanced beyond that indefinite turningpoint of middle age in her unattractive face was none of the easy good nature so unmistakably stamped upon her husbands peter j was inherently optimistic his head was forever hidden in a roseate aura of hopefulness and expectation under easy living he had grayed and fattened his eyes were small and colorless his cheeks full and veined with tiny sprays of purple his hands soft and limber what had once been a measure of good looks was hidden now behind a flabby indefinite mediocrity which an unusual carefulness in dress could not disguise he was bighearted in little things in big things he was small he told an excellent story but never imagined one and his laugh was hearty though insincere men who knew him well laughed with him but did not indorse his notes his wife was of a totally different stamp showing evidence of unusual force her thin lips her cleancut nose betokened purpose a pair of alert unpleasant eyes spoke of a mental activity that was entirely lacking in her mate and she was generally recognized as the source of what little prominence he had attained yes were going to make a change she repeated im glad too for im tired of housework you dont have to do your own work theres lorelei to help you know i wouldnt let her do it afraid it would spoil her hands eh mr knight snorted disdainfully what are hands made for anyhow honest work never hurt mine jim stirred and smiled the retort upon his lips was only too obvious shes too pretty said the mother you dont realize it none of us do but shes beautiful where she gets her good looks from i dont know whats the difference it wont hurt her to wash dishes she wouldnt have to keep it up forever anyhow she can have any fellow in the county yes and shell marry sure if we stay here knights colorless eyes opened then what are you talking about going away to a strange place for it aint every girl that can have her pick mrs knight began slowly musingly you need some plain talk peter i dont often tell you just what i think but im going to now youre past fifty youve spent twenty years puttering around at politics with business as a side issue and what have you got to show for it nothing the reformers are in at last and youre out for good you had your chance and you missed it you were always expecting something big some fat office with big profits but it never came do you know why because you arent big thats why youre little peter you know it and so does the party the object of this address swelled pompously his cheeks deepened in hue and distended but while he was summoning words for a defense his wife ran on evenly the party used you just as long as you could deliver something but youre down and out now and theyve thrown you over fogarty offers to pay his debt and im not going to refuse his help i suppose you think you could have done better if youd been in my place peter grumbled he was angry yet the undeniable truth of his wifes words struck home thats the woman of it you kick because were poor and then want me to take a fifteenhundreddollar job bother the salary it will keep us going as long as necessary eh mr knight looked blank im thinking of lorelei shes going to give us our chance lorelei yes you wonder why ive never let her spoil her hands why ive scrimped to give her pretty clothes and taught her to take care of her figure and made her go out with young people well i knew what i was doing it was part of her schooling shes old enough now and she has everything that any girl ever had so far as looks go shes going to do for us what you never have been and never will be able to do peter knight shes going to make us rich but she cant do it in vale mas right declared james new yorks the place for pretty women the town is full of them if its full of pretty women what chance has she got queried peter she cant break into society on my fifteen hundred she wont need to she can go on the stage good lord what makes you think she can act do you remember that miss donald who stopped at myrtle lodge last summer shes an actress no mr knight was amazed she told me a good deal about the show business she said lorelei wouldnt have the least bit of trouble getting a position she gave me a note to a manager too and i sent him loreleis photograph he wrote right back that hed give her a place really yes hes looking for pretty girls with good figures his name is bergman jim broke in eagerly youve heard of bergmans revues pa we saw one last summer remember bergmans a big fellow that show why that was rotten it isnt a very decent life either dont worry about sis advised jim she can take care of herself and shell grab a millionaire sure with her looks other girls are doing it every day why not her mas got the right idea impassively mrs knight resumed her argument new york is where the money is and the women that go with money its the marketplace the stage advertises a pretty girl and gives her chances to meet rich men here in vale theres nobody with money and besides people know us the stevens girls have been nasty to lorelei all winter and shes never invited to the golfclub dances any more at this intelligence mr knight burst forth indignantly theyre putting on a lot of airs since the interurban went through but ben stevens forgets who helped him get the franchise i could tell a lot of things bergman writes continued mrs knight that lorelei wouldnt have to go on the road at all if she didnt care to the real pretty showgirls stay right in new york jim added another word shes the best asset weve got pa and if we all work together well land her in the money sure peter knight pinched his full red lips into a pucker and stared speculatively at his wife it was not often that she openly showed her hand to him it seems like an awful long chance he said not so long perhaps as you think his wife assured him anyhow its our only chance and were not popular in vale have you talked to her about it a little shell do anything we ask shes a good girl that way the three were still buried in discussion when lorelei appeared at the door im going over to mabels she paused a moment to say ill be back early mother in peter knights eyes as he gazed at his daughter there was something akin to shame but jim evinced only a hard calculating appraisal both men inwardly acknowledged that the mother had spoken less than half the truth for the girl was extravagantly bewitchingly attractive her face and form would have been noticeable anywhere and under any circumstances but now in contrast with the unmodified homeliness of her parents and brother her comeliness was almost startling the others seemed to harmonize with their drab surroundings with the dull unattractive house and its furnishings but lorelei was in violent opposition to everything about her she wore her beauty unconsciously too as a princess wears the purple of her rank neither in speech nor in look did she show a trace of her fathers fatuous commonplaceness and she gave no sign of her mothers coldly calculating disposition equally the girl differed from her brother for jim was anemic underdeveloped sallow his only mark of distinction being his bright and impudent eye while she was fullblooded healthy and clean splendidly distinctive from her crown of warm amber hair to her shapely slender feet it seemed that all the hopes all the aspirations all the longings of bygone generations of knights had flowered in her as muddy waters purify themselves in running so had the knight blood coming through unpleasant channels finally clarified and sweetened itself in this girl in the color of her eyes she resembled neither parent mrs knights were closeset and hard peters shallow indefinite weak loreleis were limpid and of a twilight blue her single paternal inheritance was a smile perhaps a trifle too ready and too meaningless yet it was a pleasant smile indicative of a disposition toward courtesy if not selfdepreciation but there all resemblance ceased lorelei knight was mysteriously different from her kin she might almost have sprung from a different strain and except as one of those throwbacks which sometimes occur in a mediocre family when an exotic offspring blooms like a delicate blossom in a bed of weeds she was inexplicable simple living had made her strong yet she remained exquisite behind a natural and a deep reserve she was vibrant with youth and spirits in the doorway she hesitated an instant favoring the group with her shadowy impersonal smile in her gaze there was a faint inquiry for it was plain that she had interrupted a serious discussion she came forward and rested a hand upon her fathers thinly haired bullethead peter reached up and took it in his own moist palm we were just talking about you he said yes the smile remained as the girls touch lingered your ma thinks id better accept that new york offer on your account on mine i dont understand peter stroked the hand in his clasp and his weak upturned face was wrinkled with apprehension she thinks you should see the world and make something of yourself that would be nice loreleis lips were still parted as she turned toward her mother in some bewilderment youd like the city wouldnt you mrs knight inquired why yes i suppose so were poor poorer than weve ever been jim will have to work and so will you ill do what i can of course but i dont know how to do anything im afraid i wont be much help at first well see to that now run along dearie when she had gone peter gave a grunt of conviction she is pretty he acknowledged pretty as a picture and you certainly dress her well shed ought to make a good actress jim echoed him enthusiastically pretty ill bet bernhardts got nothing on her for looks shell have a brownstone hut on fifth avenue and an airtight limousine one of these days see if she dont when do you plan to leave faltered the father mrs knight answered with some satisfaction rehearsals commence in may chapter ii mr cambell pope was a cynic he had cultivated a superb contempt for those beliefs which other people cherish he rejoiced in an open rebellion against convention and manifested this hostility in an exaggerated carelessness of dress and manner it was perhaps his habit of thought as much as anything else that had made him a dramatic critic but it was a knack for keen analysis and a natural caustic wit that had raised him to eminence in his field outwardly he was a sloven and a misanthrope inwardly he was simple and rather boyish but years of experience in a boxoffice then as advance man and publicity agent for a circus and finally as a metropolitan reviewer had destroyed his illusions and soured his taste for theatrical life his column was widely read his name was known as a prophet he was uncanny hence managers treated him with a gingerly courtesy not always quite sincere most men attain success through love of their work mr pope had become an eminent critic because of his hatred for the drama and all things dramatic nor was he any more enamoured of journalism being in truth by nature bucolic but after trying many occupations and failing in all of them he had returned to his desk after each excursion into other fields firstnight audiences knew him now and had come to look for his thin sharp features his shapeless wrinkled suit that resembled a sleepingbag his flannel shirt always tieless and frequently collarless were considered attributes of genius and finding new york to be amazingly gullible he took a certain delight in accentuating his eccentricities at especially prominent premieres he affected a sweater underneath his coat but that was his nearest approach to formal evening dress further concession to fashion he made none owing to the dearth of new productions this summer pope had undertaken a series of magazine articles descriptive of the reigning theatrical beauties and while he detested women in general and the painted favorites of broadway in particular he had forced himself to write the common laudatory stuff which the public demanded only once had he given free rein to his inclinations and written with a poisoned pen tonight however as he entered the stage door of bergmans circuit theater it was with a different intent regan the stagedoor tender better known since his vaudeville days as the judge answered his greeting with a lugubrious shake of a bald head im a sick man mr pope same old trouble mmm kidneys isnt it no rheumatism im a beehive swarmin with pains to be sure its hemphill the doorman at the columbus who has the floating kidney i paid for his operation hemphill operation ha the judge cackled in a voice hoarse from alcoholic excesses he bilked you mr pope hes the guy that put the kid in kidney theres nothing wrong with him he could do his old acrobatic turn if he wanted to i remember the act me an greenberg played the same bill with him twenty years ago the judge leaned forward and a strong odor of whisky enveloped the caller could you slip me four bits for some liniment the critic smiled theres a dollar regan try scotch for a change its better for you than these cheap blends and dont breathe toward a lamp or youll ignite the judge laughed wheezingly i do take a drop now and then a drop youd better take a tumble or bergman will let you out see here you know all the managers mr pope cant you find a job for a swell dame the judge inquired anxiously who is she lottie devine shes out with the peach blossom girls lottie devine why shes your wife isnt she sure and playing the wheel when she belongs in musical comedy she dances as good as she did when we worked together after she gets warmed up and she looks great in tights swellest legs in burlesque mr pope cant you place her shes a trifle old im afraid huh she wigs up a lot bettern some of the squabs in this troupe believe me shed fit any chorus why dont you ask bergman mr regan shook his hairless head hes dippy on types this shows full of em real blondes real brunettes bold and dashin ones tall and statelies blushers shrinkers laughers and sadlings he wont stand for makeup he wants em with the dew on theyve got to look natural for bergman thats some of em now he nodded toward a group of young freshcheeked girls who had entered the stage door and were hurrying down the hall there aint a hepnerized ensemble in the whole first act and they wear talcum powder instead of tights its dimples he wants not fats how them girls stand the draught i dont know it would kill an oldtimer ive come to interview one of bergmans types that new beauty miss knight is she here yet sure her and the backdrop too she carries the old woman for scenery mr regan took the callers card and shuffled away leaving pope to watch the stream of performers as they entered and made for their quarters there were many women in the number and all of them were pretty most of them were overdressed in the extremes of fashion a few quietly garbed ladies and gentlemen entered the lower dressingrooms reserved for the principals it was no novel sight to the reviewer whose theatrical apprenticeship had been thorough yet it never failed to awaken his deepest cynicism somewhere within him was a puritanical streak and he still cherished youthful memories he reflected now that it was he who had laid the foundation for the popularity of the girl he had come to interview for he had picked her out of the chorus of the preceding revue and commented so enthusiastically upon her beauty that this season had witnessed her advancement to a speaking part through popes column attention had been focused upon bergmans latest acquisition and once new york had paused to look carefully at this fresh young newcomer her fame had spread but he had never met the girl herself and he wondered idly what effect success had had upon her a total absence of scandal had argued against any previous theatrical experience meanwhile he exchanged greetings with the star a cleareyed man with the face of a scholar and the limbs of an athlete the latter had studied for the law he had the drollest legs in the business and his salary exceeded that of supreme court justice they were talking when mr regan returned to tell the interviewer that he would be received pope followed to the next floor and entered a brightly lighted overheated dressingroom where lorelei and her mother were waiting it was a glaring stuffy cubbyhole ventilated by means of the hall door and a tiny window opening from the lavatory at the rear along the sides ran mirrors beneath which was fixed a wide makeup shelf from the ceiling depended several unshaded incandescent globes which flooded the place with a desert heat and radiance an attempt had been made to give the room at least a semblance of coolness by hanging an attractively figured cretonne over the entrance and over the wardrobe hooks fixed in the rear wall but the result was hardly successful the same material had been utilized to cover the shelves which were littered with a bewildering assortment of makeup tins coldcream cans rouge and powder boxes whitening bottles wigblocks and the multifarious disordered accumulations of a dressingroom the walls were half hidden behind photographs impaled upon pins like entomological specimens photographs were thrust into the mirror frames they were propped against the heaps of tins and boxes or hidden beneath the confusion of toilet articles but the collection was not limited to this variety of specimen one section of the wall was devoted to telegraph and cable forms bearing messages of felicitation at the opening of the revue of a zoologist would have found the display uninteresting but a society reporter would have reveled in the names and especially in the sentimentsinscribed upon the yellow sheets some were addressed to lorelei knight others to lilas lynn her roommate pope found lorelei completely dressed in expectation of his arrival she wore the white and silver firstact costume of the fairy princess both she and her mother were plainly nonplussed at the appearance of their caller but mrs knight recovered quickly from the shock and said agreeably lorelei was frightened to death at your message yesterday she was almost afraid to let you interview her after what you wrote about adoree demorest pope shrugged your daughter is altogether different to the star of the palace garden mrs knight demorest trades openly upon her notoriety and i dont like bad women new york never would have taken her up if she hadnt been advertised as the wickedest woman in europe for she can neither act sing nor dance however shes become the rage so i had to include her in my series of articles now miss knight has made a legitimate success as far as she has gone he turned to the girl herself who was smiling at him as she had smiled since his entrance he did not wonder at the prominence her beauty had brought her for even at this close range her makeup could not disguise her loveliness the lily had been painted to be sure but the sacrilege was not too noticeable and he knew that the cheeks beneath their rouge were faintly colored that the lashes under the heavy beading were long and dark and sweeping as for her other features no paint could conceal their perfection her forehead was linelessly serene her brows were straight and too welldefined to need the pencil as for her eyes too much had been written about them already they had proven the despair of many men or so rumor had it he saw that they had depths and shadows and glints of color that he could not readily define her nose pronounced perfect by experts on noses seemed faultless indeed her mouth was no tiny cupids bow but generous enough for character of course the lips were glaringly red now but the expression was none the less sweet and friendly theres nothing legitimate about musical shows she told him in reply to his last remark and i cant act or sing or dance as well as miss demorest you dont need to just let the public rest its eyes on you and it will be satisfied anyhow it should be of course everybody flatters you has success turned your head mrs knight answered for her daughter lorelei has too much sense for that she succeeded easily but she isnt spoiled then in response to a question by pope lorelei told him something of her experience were upstate people you know mr bergman was looking for types and i seemed to suit so i got an engagement at once the newspapers began to mention me and when he produced this show he had the part of the fairy princess written in for me its really very easy and i dont do much except wear the gowns and speak a few lines youre one of the principals her mother said chidingly i suppose youre ambitious pope put in again the mother answered indeed she is and shes bound to succeed of course she hasnt had any experience to speak of but theres more than one manager thats got his eye on her the listener inwardly cringed she could be starred easy and she will be too in another season then you must be studying hard miss knight lorelei shook her head not even voice culture no nor dancing nor acting no she has so little time youve no idea how popular she is twittered mrs knight pope fancied the girl herself flushed under his inquiring eye at any rate her gaze wavered and she seemed vexed by her mothers explanation he too resented mrs knights share in the conversation he did not like the elder womans face nor her voice nor her manner she impressed him as another theatrical type with which he was familiar the stage mama he found himself marveling at the dissimilarity of the two women of course a famous beauty does meet a lot of people he said tell me what you think of our nourishing little city and our new york men but lorelei raised a slender hand not for worlds besides youre making fun of me now i was afraid to see you and id feel terribly if you printed anything i really told you good interviewers never do that they come and talk about nothing then go away and put the most brilliant things into your mouth you are considered a very dangerous person mr pope youre thinking of my story about that demorest woman again he laughed is she really as bad as you described her i dont know never having met the lady i wouldnt humiliate myself by a personal interview so i built a story on the broadway gossip inasmuch as she goes in for notoriety i gave her some of the best i had in stock her photographer did the rest the door curtains parted and lilas lynn a slim blackeyed young woman entered she greeted pope cordially as she removed her hat and handed it to the woman who acted as dresser for the two occupants of the room im late as usual she said but dont leave on my account she disappeared into the lavatory and emerged a moment later in a combingjacket seating herself before her own mirrors she dove into a cosmetic can and vigorously applied a priming coat to her features while the dresser drew her hair back and secured it tightly with a wigband loreleis got her nerve to talk to you after the panning you gave demorest she continued arent you ashamed of yourself to strike a defenseless star pope nodded i am and im ashamed of my entire sex when i hear of them flocking to the palace garden just to see a woman who has nothing to distinguish her but a reputation for vileness did you see the crown jewels the kings cabachon rubies lorelei asked only from the front i dare say theyre as counterfeit as she is miss lynn turned revealing a countenance as shiny as that of an eskimo belle with her warpaint only half applied and her hair secured closely to her small head she did not in the least resemble the dashing countess of the program oh theyre real enough i got that straight campbell pope scoffed isnt it true about the king of seldovia didnt she wreck his throne eagerly queried mrs knight i never met the king and i havent examined his throne but you know kings can do no wrong and thrones are easily mended but mrs knight was insistent her eyes glittered her sharp nose was thrust forward inquisitively they say she draws two thousand a week and wont go to supper with a man for less than five hundred dollars she says if fellows want to be seen in public with her theyll have to pay for it and shes right of course shes terribly bad but you must admit shes done mighty well for herself well have a chance to see her tonight announced lilas mr hammon is giving a big supper to some of his friends and were going lorelei and i demorest is down for her danse de nuit they say its the limit hammon the steel man queried the critic curiously sure theres only one hammon but nix on the newspaper story this is a private affair never let us speak ill of a poor pittsburgh millionaire laughed pope scandal must never darken the soot of that village he turned as slosson the pressagent of the show entered with a bundle of photographs here are the new pictures of lorelei for your story old man mr slosson said bergman will appreciate the boost for one of his girls help yourself to those you want if you need any more stuff ill supply it blushing country lass just out of the alfalfa belt first appearance on any stage instantaneous hit and a record for pulchritude in an aggregation where the homeliest member is a helen of troy every appearance a riot stagedoor johns standing on their heads members of our best families dying to lead her to the altar under fiveyear contract with bergman and refuses to marry until the times up delancey page the artist wants to paint her and says shes the perfect american type at last say bergman can certainly pick em cant he ill frame it for a special cop at the back door detailed to hold off the matrimony squad of society youths if you can use it dont go to the trouble pope hastily deprecated i know the story now im going to leave and let miss lynn dress dont go on my account urged lilas this room is like a subway station and ive got so i could change in bryant park at noon and never shock a policeman you wont say anything mean about us will you mrs knight implored in this business a girls reputation is all she has i promise pope held out his hand to lorelei and as she took it her lips parted in her everready smile nice girl that the critic remarked as he and slosson descended the stairs which one lorelei lilas or the female gorilla how did she come to choose that for a mother muttered pope one of natures inscrutable mysteries but wait have you seen brother jim no whos he his mothers son need we say more hes a great help to the family for he keeps em from getting too proud over lorelei he sells introductions to his sister campbell popes exclamation was lost in a babble of voices as a bevy of swimming girls descended from the enchanted regions above and scurried out upon the stage through the double curtain the orchestra could be faintly heard a voice was crying places some soul kissers with this troupe eh remarked slosson when the scampering figures had disappeared yes bergman has made a fortune out of this kind of show hes a friend to the tired business man speaking of the weary wall street workers there will be a dozen of our ribbonwinners at that hammon supper tonight twelve bergman beauties twelve count em any time you want to pull off a classy party for some of your bachelor friends let me know and ill supply the dames at one hundred dollars a head and guarantee their manners theyre all trained to terrapin and know how to pick the proper forks one hundred last season a girl was lucky to get fifty dollars as a banquet favor but the cost of living rises nightly no wonder hammons against the income tax yes and thats exclusive of the regulation favors theres a good story in this party if you could get the mens names popes thin lip curled and he shook his head i write theatrical stuff he said shortly because i have to not because i like to i try to keep it reasonably clean slosson was instantly apologetic oh i dont mean theres anything wrong about this affair hammon is entertaining a crowd of other steel men and a stag supper is either dull or devilish so he has invited a goodlooking partner for each male guest it ll be thoroughly refined and its being done every night i know it is tell me is lorelei knight a regular er frequenter of these affairs sure its part of the graft i see she has to piece out her salary like the other girls why her whole family is around her neck mother brother and father old man knight was run over by a taxicab last summer it didnt hurt the machine but hes got a broken back or something too bad it wasnt brother jimmy you must meet him by the way i never heard of loreleis doing anything really bad for the moment campbell pope made no reply meanwhile a great wave of singing flooded the regions at the back of the theater as the curtain rose and the chorus broke into sudden sound when he did speak it was with unusual bitterness its the rottenest business in the world slosson two years ago she was a country girl now shes a broadway belle how long will she last dyou think shes too beautiful to last long agreed the pressagent soberly especially now that the wolves are on her trail but her danger isnt so much from the people she meets with as the people she eats with that family of hers would drive any girl to the limit they intend to cash in on her the mother says so and they will too she can have her choice of the wealthy rounders dont get me wrong slosson hastened to qualify shes square understand of course object matrimony its the old story and her mother will see to the ring and the orange blossoms but whats the difference after all slosson it ll be hell for her and a sale to the highest bidder either way queer little gink the pressagent reflected as he returned to the front of the house i wish he wore stiff collars id like to take him home for dinner as pope passed out through the stage door the judge called hoarsely after him youll keep your eye skinned for a job for lottie wont you remember the swellest legs in burlesque chapter iii in his summary of loreleis present life slosson had not been far wrong many changes had come to the knights during the past two years changes of habit of thought and of outlook the entire family had found it necessary to alter their system of living but it was in the girl that the changes showed most when mrs knight had forecast an immediate success for her daughter she had spoken with the wisdom of a cassandra bergman had taken one look at lorelei upon their first meeting then his glance had quickened she had proved to have at least an average singingvoice her figure needed no comment her inexperience had been the strongest argument in her favor since bergmans shows were famous for their new faces the result was that he signed her promptly and mother and daughter had walked out of his office quite unconscious of having accomplished the unusual at first the city had seemed strange and bewildering and lorelei had suffered pangs at the memory of vale for at her age the roots of association strike deep but in a short time the novelty of her new life proved an anodyne and deadened acute regrets while the vague hazard of it all kept her at an agreeable pitch of excitement moreover she took naturally to the work finding it more like play and being quite free from girlish timidity she felt no stagefright even upon her first appearance her recognition had followed quickly it was impossible to hide such perfection of loveliness as hers and the publicity pleased her in due course rival managers began to make offers which mrs knight rising nobly to the first test of her business ability used as levers to raise her daughters salary and to pry out of bergman a fiveyear contract the role of the fairy princess was a result thus it was that without conscious effort without even a proof of merit beyond her appearance lorelei had arrived at the point where further advancement depended upon study and hard work but since these formed no part of the family program she remained idle while mrs knight and jim arranged so many demands upon her time that she had no leisure for serious endeavors even had she desired it proficiency in stagecraft of any sort comes only at the expense of peonage and this girl was being groomed solely for matrimony the principals who topped the bergman bill were artists men and women who had climbed through years of patient effort toward their subordinates they maintained an aloofness that is peculiar to the show business they moved in a world apart from the chorus the two classes impinged briefly eight times a week but outside the theater they never saw each other even labaudie the dolllike danseuse looked down upon lorelei and lilas almost as she looked down upon the members of her ballet out of all the big company there were perhaps a halfdozen chorus men and women who had eyes definitely fixed upon a stage career the rest like lorelei and lilas regarded the work simply as an easy means of livelihood the theatrical profession is peculiar to itself it is a world with customs habits and ambitions differing from those of any other sphere that division of stage life to which lorelei knight belonged that army of men and women from shows like bergmans constitutes a still more distinctive community a community moreover that is characteristic of new york alone its code is of its own making its habits of life are as individual as its figures of speech although at first all this bewildered the country girl at length she had come to adopt the new ways as a matter of course from the association she had learned much she had learned how to reap the fruits of popularity how to take without giving how to profit without sacrifice and under her mothers influence she was not allowed to forget what she had learned with the support of the family entirely upon her shoulders she had been driven to many shifts in order to stretch her salary to livable proportions peter was a total burden and jim either refused or was unable to contribute toward the common fund while the mother devoted her time almost solely to managing loreleis affairs presents were showered upon the girl and these mrs knight converted into cash conspicuous stage characters are always welcome at the prominent cafes hence lorelei never had to pay for food or drink when alone and when escorted she received a commission on the money spent she was well paid for posing advertisements of toilet articles face creams dentifrices and the like especially if accompanied by testimonials yielded something in the commercial exploitation of her daughter mrs knight developed something like genius she arranged for paid interviews and special beauty articles in the sunday supplements she saw to it that loreleis features became identified with certain makes of biscuits petticoats chewinggums chocolates cameras shortvamp shoes and bathtubs but of all the socalled grafts open to handsome girls in her business the quickest and best returns came from prodigal entertainers like jarvis hammon as lorelei and her companion left their taxicabs and entered proctors hotel shortly before midnight they were met by a head waiter and shown into an ornate ivoryandgold elevator which lifted them noiselessly to an upper floor they made their exit into a deepcarpeted hall at the end of which two splendid creatures in the panoply of german fieldmarshals stood guard over one of the smaller banquetrooms hammon himself greeted the girls when they had surrendered their wraps and after his introduction to lorelei engaged lilas in earnest conversation lorelei watched him curiously she saw a powerfully built grayhaired man whose vigor age had not impaired in face he was perhaps fifty years old in body he was much less he was the typical forceful new york man of affairs carefully groomed perhaps a little inclined to stoutness by this time millionaires had lost their novelty for the girl she had met some who were more distinguished in appearance than this man but never one who seemed possessed of more nervous energy and virility jarvis hammon had a bold incisive manner that was compelling and stamped him as a big man in more ways than one playfully he pinched lilass cheek then turned with a smile to say youll pardon us for whispering wont you miss knight you see lilas got up this little party and ive been waiting to consult her about some of the details of course she was late as usual however he ran an admiring eye over the two girls the time wasnt wasted i see my how lovely you both look taking an arm of each he swept them toward a receptionroom from which issued noisy laughter awfully good of you to come miss knight i hope youll find my friends agreeable and enjoy yourself perhaps twenty men in evening dress and as many elaborately gowned young women were gossiping and smoking as the last comers appeared some one raised a vigorous complaint at the hosts tardiness but hammon laughed a rejoinder then gave a signal whereupon foldingdoors at the end of the room were thrown back from within an orchestra struck up a popular ragtime air and those nearest the banquethall moved toward it a girl whom lorelei recognized as a fellowmember of the revue danced up to her escort with arms extended and the two turkeytrotted into the larger room hammon was introducing two of his friends one a languid middleaged man who was curled up in a deep chair with a cigarette between his fingers the other a largefeatured person with a rumbling voice the men had been arguing earnestly oblivious of the confusion around them but now the former dropped his cigarette uncoiled his long form and rising bowed courteously his appearance as he faced lorelei was prepossessing and she breathed a thanksgiving as she took his arm hammon clapped the other gentleman upon the shoulder crying the rail market will take care of itself until tomorrow hannibal what is more to the point i saw your supper partner flirting with handsome dan avery better find her quick lorelei recognized the deepvoiced man as hannibal c wharton one of the dominant figures in the steel syndicate she knew him instantly from his newspaper pictures the man beside her however was a stranger and she raised her eyes to his with some curiosity he was studying her with manifest admiration despite the fact that his lean features were cast in a sardonic mold it is a pleasure to meet a celebrity like you miss knight he murmured all new york is at your feet i understand im deeply indebted to hammon blessings on such a host oh dont be hasty you may dislike me furiously before the evening is over he does things in a magnificent way doesnt he im sure this is going to be a splendid party as they entered the banquethall she gave a little cry of pleasure for it was evident that hammon noted as he was for a lavish expenditure had outdone himself this time the whole room had been transformed into a bower of roses great climbing bushes heavy with blooms masses of cool green ivy hid the walls from floor to ceiling and were supported upon cunningly wrought trellises through which hidden lights glowed softly in certain nooks gleamed marble statuettes so placed as to heighten the effect of space and to carry out the idea of a roman garden the table a horseshoe of silver and white of glittering plate and sparkling cutglass faced a rustic stage which occupied one end of the room occupying the inner arc of the halfcircle was a wide but shallow stone fountain upon the surface of which floated largeleaved egyptian pondlilies fatbellied goldfish with filmy fins and tails like iridescent wedding trains propelled themselves indolently about two dimpled cupids strained at a marble cornucopia out of which trickled a stream of water its whisper drowned now by the noisy admiration of the guests but the surprising feature of the decorating scheme was not apparent at first glance through the bewildering riot of greenery had been woven an almost invisible netting and the space behind formed a prison for birds and butterflies where they had come from or at what expense they had been procured it was impossible to conceive but disturbed by the commotion the feathered creatures twittered and fluttered against the netting in a panic which drew attention to them even if it did not wholly convey the illusion of a woodland scene as for the butterflies no artificial light could deceive them and they clung with closed wings to leaves and branches only now and then displaying their full glory in a sleepy protest there were scores hundreds of them and the diners passed in review of the spectacle like country visitors before the glass tanks of the aquarium a strident shriek sounded as a gorgeously caparisoned peacock preened himself others were discovered here and there brillianthued specimens voicing shrill indignation how beautiful gasped lorelei when she had taken in the whole scene but the poor little things are frightened she looked up to find her companion staring in hammons direction with an expression of peculiar derisive amusement hammon was the center of an admiring group congratulations were being hurled at him from every quarter at his side was lilas lynn very dark very striking very expensively gowned and elaborately bejeweled the room was dinning with the strains of an invisible orchestra and the vocal uproar topping the confusion came shrieks from the excitable peacocks the wild birds twittered and beat themselves affrightedly against the netting becoming conscious of loreleis gaze her escort looked down showing his teeth in a grin that was not of pleasure you like it he asked its beautiful but the extravagance is almost criminal dont tell me how many starving newsboys or how many poor families the cost of this supper would support for a year i hate poor people i like to see em starve if you fed them this year theyd starve next so whats the difference nevertheless jarvis has surprised me he paused and his eyes as he stared again at the steel magnate were mocking youll admit it was a dazzling idea coming from a rollingmill boss now for the ortolans and the hummingbird tongues no doubt theres a pearl in every winecup prepare to have your palate tickled with a feather when your appetite flags thats what the romans did isnt it ah you are a student as well as an artist miss knight i thought you were going to be pleasant but youre not are you lorelei was smiling fixedly no quite the opposite thank god im a dyspeptic then why did you come here why did those birds come why did you come oh we the birds and i are merely decorations something to add to the rich mans gaiety but im afraid you dont intend to have a good time mr they had found their places at the table and loreleis escort was seating her i didnt catch your name when we were introduced nor i said he taking his place beside her it sounded like rice curry or some other damnable dish but its really merkle john t merkle ah youre a banker arent you pretty reckless confessing your rank as it were im a bachelor also an invalid and an insomniac you couldnt bring me any more trouble than i have you are unpleasant im famous for it being the only bachelor present i claim the privilege of free speech again he looked toward hammon and this time he frowned from indications ill soon have company however indeed is there talk of a divorce there she inclined her head in the hosts direction merkle retorted acidly my dear child dont try to act the ingenue youre in the same show as miss lynn and you must know whats going on this sort of thing cant continue indefinitely for mrs hammon is very much alive to say nothing of her daughters i dare say theyll hear about this supper which wont improve conditions at home now we both had to come to this oriental orgy and since neither of us enjoys it lets be natural at least i havent slept lately and im not patient enough to be polite its a bargain ill try to be as disagreeable as you are said lorelei and mr merkle signified his prompt acquiescence he lit a huge monogrammed cigarette pushed aside his hors doeuvres and reluctantly turned down his array of wineglasses one by one cant eat cant drink cant sleep he grumbled stewed prunes and rice for my portion waiter bring me a bottle of vichy and when its gone bring me another the diners had arranged themselves by now the supper had begun owing to the nature of the affair there was a complete absence of the stiffness usual at formal banquets and since the women were present in quite the same capacity as the performers who were hired to appear later on the stage they did not allow the moments to drag a bohemian spirit prevailed the ardor of the men lashed on by laughter coquetry and smiles rose quickly wine flowed and a general intimacy began introductions were no longer necessary the talk flew back and forth along the rim of the rosestrewn semicircle chapter iv lorelei turned from the man on her left who had regaled her with an endless story the point of which had sent the teller into hiccoughs of laughter and said to john merkle im glad im with you tonight i dont like drinking men can a girl in your position afford preferences he inquired tartly thus far the banker had fully lived up to his sour reputation all women are extravagant i have preferences even if i cant afford them if you were a tippler instead of a plain grouch i could tell you precisely how youd act and what youd talk about as the evening goes on first youd be gallant and attentive then youd forget me and talk business with mr wharton hes nearest you about that time id begin to learn the real names of these lords of finance after that youd become interested in my future thats always the worst period once id made you realize that you meant nothing in my life and that my future was provided for youd tell me stories about your family how your wife is an invalid how tom is at yale how susie is coming out in the autumn and how you really had no idea ladies were to be present tonight or youd never have risked coming finally youd confess that you were naturally impulsive generous and affectionate and merely lacked the encouragement of a kindred spirit like me to become a terrible cutup then youd insist upon dancing id die if i had to teach you the tango mr merkle grunted so would i she smiled sweetly you see were both unpleasant people merkle meditated in silence while she attacked her food with a healthy youthful appetite that awoke his envy i suppose you see a lot of this sort of thing he at length suggested theres something of the kind nearly every night is this your first experience umm no steel men are notoriously sporty when they get away from home but i dont go out often this party isnt as bad as some for the very reason that most of the men are from out of town and its a bit of a novelty to them but theres a crowd of regular newyorkers the younger menabouttown she paused significantly i accepted one invitation from them only one it was quite enough ive traveled some observed merkle but this city is getting to be the limit she nodded her amber head theres only one paris after all and thats new york dont laugh i read that we girls remember all the clever things we hear and use them do you see the young person in black and white with the rednosed man the one who looks as if he were smelling a rose well shes in our company and shes very popular at these parties because shes so witty as a matter of fact she memorizes the jokes in all the funny papers and springs them as her own her men friends say shes too original to be in the show business for a moment the girl at merkles right engaged his attention and lorelei turned again to the incoherent storyteller beside her who had made it plain by pawing at her that he was bursting once more with tidings of great merriment the meal grew noisier the orchestra interspersed sensuous melodies from the popular successes with the tantalizing ragtime airs that had set the city to singing silentfooted attendants deposited tissuecovered packages before the guests there was a flutter of excitement as the women began to examine their favors what is it merkle inquired leaning toward lorelei the new saddlebag purse see its very frenchy gold fittings and a coinpurse and cardcase inside see the monogram im going to keep this dont you keep all your gifts not the expensive ones lilas picked these out for mr hammon and theyre exquisite we share the same dressingroom you know merkle regarded her with a sudden new interest you and she dress together yes then i dare say youre close friends were close enough in that room but scarcely friends what did you get he unrolled the package at his plate a gold safety razor evidently a warning not to play with edged tools i wonder if miss lynn bought one for jarvis now why did you say that lorelei asked quickly and why did you ask in that peculiar tone if she and i were friends the man leaned closer saying in a voice that did not carry above the clamor i suppose you know shes making a fool of him i suppose you realize what it means when a woman of her stamp gets a man with money in her power you must know all there is to know from the outside it occurred to me that you might also know something about the inside of the affair do you im afraid not all ive heard is the common gossip theres a good deal here that doesnt show on the surface that woman is a menace to a great many people of whom i happen to be one you speak as if she were a dangerous character and as if she had deliberately entangled him lorelei said defendingly as a matter of fact she did nothing of the sort she avoided him as long as she could but he forced his attentions upon her hes a man who refuses defeat he persisted he persecuted her until she was forced to accept him men of his wealth can do anything you know sometimes i think but its none of my business what do you sometimes think that she hates him nonsense i know she did at first i dont wonder that she makes him pay now its according to her code and the code of this business i cant believe she dislikes him he may have won her finally but at first she refused his gifts refused even to meet him she had scruples no more than the rest of us i presume she gave her two weeks notice because he annoyed her but before the time was up bergman took a hand he sent for her one evening and when she went down there was mr hammon too when she came upstairs she was hysterical she cried and laughed and cursed it was terrible curious murmured the man staring at the object of their controversy what did she say oh nothing connected she called him every kind of a monster accused him of every crime from murder to murder the banker started he had made a long fight to beat her down and she was unstrung she seemed to have a queer physical aversion to him humph shes got nobly over that ive told you this because you seemed to think shes to blame when it is all mr hammons doing its a peculiar situation very youve interested me but the man himself is peculiar extraordinary you cant draw a proper line on his conduct without knowing the circumstances of his home life and in fact his whole mental makeup sometime ill tell you his story i think it would interest you in a way i dont blame him for seeking amusement and happiness where he can find it and yet im afraid of the result this supper means more than you can understand or than i can explain the city is full of samsons and most of them have their delilahs merkle agreed these men put hammon where he is i wonder if they will let him stay there it depends upon that girl yonder he turned to answer a question from hannibal wharton and lorelei gave her attention to the part of the entertainment which was beginning on the stage turn after turn appeared blackfaced comedians feature acts from vaudeville and from the reigning successes highpriced singers dancers monologists followed each other occasionally they were applauded but more frequently their efforts to amuse were lost in the selfmade merriment of the diners now and then an actor was bombarded with jests or openly guyed music and wine flowed as steadily as the crystal stream of the fountain faces became flushed glasses rang the women chattered the men raised loud voices the birds fluttered and the peacocks shrieked it all blended in a bloodstirring bacchanalian joviality only now and then the frolic threatened to become a carouse and the revel bordered upon a debauch of a sudden the clamor was silenced and indifference gave place to curiosity for the music had begun the introduction to one of adoree demorests songs her rubies are the finest in the world too strong for paris so she came to new york anything goes here if its bad enough came from various quarters lorelei had never seen this muchdiscussed actress whose wickedness had set the town agog and her first impression was vaguely disappointing miss demorests beauty was by no means remarkable although it was accentuated by the most bizarre creation of the french shops she was animated audacious gallic in accent and postures she was vividly alive with a magnetism that meant much more than beauty but she overexerted her voice and her song was nothing to excite applause at last she was off in a whirl of skirts a generous display of hosiery and a great bobbing of the aigrette pompon that towered above her like an indian headdress only a moment later she was on again this time in a daring costume of solid black against and through which her limbs flashed with startling effect as she performed her famous danse de nuit hmm nothing very extreme about that remarked merkle at length it would be beautiful if it were better done lorelei agreed she had been staring with all a womans intentness at this sister whose strength consisted of her frailty and now inquired how does she get away with it by the power of suggestion i dare say her public is looking for something devilish and discovers whatever it chooses to imagine in what she says and does hannibal wharton had changed his seat and regardless of the dancer began a conversation with merkle after a time lorelei heard him say it cost me five thousand dollars to pay for the damage those boys did they threatened to jail bob but of course i couldnt allow that i remember that was five years ago and bob hasnt changed a whit i think hes a menace to society wharton laughed but his reply was lost in the clamorous demand for an encore by mlle demorest so he gets his devilment from you eh merkle inquired it isnt devilment bobs all right hes running with a fast crowd and he has to keep up his end bah he hasnt been sober in a year youre a dyspeptic john you were born with a gray beard and youre not growing younger he wanted to come to this party but i didnt care to have him for obvious reasons so i told hammon to refuse him even if he asked he bet me a thousand dollars that hed come anyhow and ive been expecting him to overpower those doormen or creep up the fireescape the handclapping ceased as the dancer reappeared smiling and bowing i will dance again if you wish she announced in perfect english introducing my new partner mr she glanced into the wings inquiringly senor roberto it is his first public appearance in this country and we will endeavor to execute a variation of the argentine tango senor roberto is a poor boy he begs you to applaud him in order that he may secure an engagement and support his old father she stooped laughingly to confer with the orchestra leader who had broken cover at her announcement mr wharton was still talking thats my way of raising a son i taught bob to drink when i drank to smoke when i smoked and all that my father raised me that way the opening strain of a spanish dance floated out from the hidden musicians mlle demorest whirled into view in the arms of a young man in evening dress she was still laughing but her partner wore a grave face and his eyes were lowered he followed the intricate movements of the dance with some difficulty to lorelei he appeared disappointingly amateurish then a ripple of merriment growing into a guffaw advised her that something out of the ordinary was occurring the scoundrel hannibal wharton cried merkle observed dryly hes won your thousand i withdraw what i said about him it requires a gigantic intelligence to outwit you to lorelei he added this will be considered a great joke on broadway that is mr whartons son it is and the most dissipated lump of arrogance in new york bob the father shouted quit that foolishness and come down here but the junior wharton his eyes fixed upon the stage merely danced the harder when the exhibition ended he bowed hand in hand with miss demorest then leaped nimbly over the footlights and made his way toward jarvis hammon nodding to the men as he passed a moment later he sank into a chair near his father saying well dad what dyou think of my educated legs i learned that at night school wharton grumbled unintelligibly but it was plain that he was not entirely displeased at his sons prank you were superb said merkle warmly its the best thing i ever saw you do bob you could almost make a living for yourself at it the young man grinned showing rows of firm strong teeth lorelei who was watching him decided that he must have at least twice the usual number yet it was a good mouth a good big generous mouth thanks for those glorious words of praise thats more than were doing on the street nowadays miss demorest said wed execute the dance and we did we certainly killed senor thomas w tango and ill be shot at sunrise for stamping on adorees insteps i looked before i leaped but i couldnt decide where to put my feet whew got any grapejuice for a growing boy he helped himself to his fathers wineglass and drained it you can settle now dad one thousand iron men i owe it to demorest what do you mean debt of honor i heard she was due here with some kind of an electric thrill so i offered her my share of the sweepstakes to further disgrace herself by dancing with me shes an expensive doll she needs that thousand mortgage on the old family operahouse no shoes for little sister and mother selling papers to square the landlord he caught loreleis eye and stared boldly hello i believe in fairies too dad introduce me to the princess merkle volunteered this service and bob promptly hitched his chair closer lorelei saw that he was very drunk and marveled at his control during the recent exhibition tell me more about the particolor petticoat and dentol chewinggum miss knight your face is a household word in every streetcar he began she replied promptly quoting haphazard from the various advertisements in which she figured it never shrinks it holds its shape it must be seen to be appreciated is cool refreshing and prevents decay how did you meet that french dancer hannibal wharton queried sourly of his son i stormed the stage door bullied the doorman and waylaid her in the wings she thought i was you dad wharton is a grand old name he chuckled at his fathers exclamation shes a good fellow though and i dont blame the king of whatsitsname kings have to spend their money somewhere maybe i can induce her to invest some of the royal dough in stocks and bonds the prospect dizzies me the crowd in your office would give you a banquet if you sold something merkle told him wharton senior pressed for further information where did you learn those argentine wiggles hard times are to blame dad the old men on the exchange play golf all day and the young ones turkeytrot all night i stay up late in the hope that i may find a quarter that some suburbanite has dropped its dangerous to drive an automobile through a dark street these days ones liable to run down a starving banker or an indigent broker with a piece of lead pipe and a mask you find it so dont you miss knight i have no automobile said the girl strange show business on the blink too eh the elder men rose and sauntered away in the direction of their host whereupon bob winked theyve left us flat why because the wicked mlle demorest has finally made her appearance as a guest my dad is a splendid shockabsorber naughty naughty papa its probably well that you came with her fathers are so indiscreet young wharton signaled to a waiter who was passing with a winebottle in a napkin tarry he cried remove the shroud please and let me look at poor old roderer thanks how natural he tastes then to lorelei the governor is a womanhater but just the same im glad you drew merkle instead of him tonight or thered surely be a scandal in the wharton family no man is safe in range of your liquid orbs miss knight unless he has his marriage license sewed into his clothes mother keeps hers framed wouldnt she enjoy reading the list of hammons guests at this party among those present were mr hannibal c wharton the wellknown rollingmill man miss lorelei knight principal firstact fairy of the bergman revue and mlle adoree demorest the friend of a king a good time was had by all and the diners enjoyed themselves very nice he laughed loudly and the girl stirred shed be pleased to read also that you came late but highly intoxicated ah salvation nell bob took no offense if the hour was late shed know that my intoxication followed as a matter of course it always does just as the dew succeeds the sunset as the track follows the wheelbarrow as the cracker pursues the cheese i am a derivative of alcohol the one and infallible argument against temperance miss knight in me you behold the shining example of all that puts the reformer to rout and gladdens the heart of the cafekeeper you talk as if you were always drunk oh not always by day i am frequently sober but at such times i am fit company for neither man nor beast i am harsh and unsympathetic i scheme and i connive with nightfall however there comes a metamorphosis ah believe me when the clover club is strained and descends like the gentle dew of heaven when the bronx is mixed and the martini shimmers in the first rays of the electric light then i humanize and harmonize for me gin is a tonic rum a restorative vermuth a balm once i am stocked up with ales wines liquors and cigars i become attuned to the nobler sentiments of life i aspire i make friends with lonely derelicts whose digestions have foundered on seas of vichy and buttermilk and i show them the joys of alcoholism without cost we share each others pleasures and perplexities at my expense they are my brothers i am optimistic i laugh i play cards for money i turkeytrot i become a living palpitating influence for good spreading happiness and prosperity in my wake do you consider yourself in such a condition now queried lorelei who had been vaguely amused at this rubaiyat i am and since it is long past the closing hour of one and the tango parlors are dark suppose we blow this whos who in pittsburg and taxicab it out to a roadhouse where the bass fiddle is still inhabited and the second generation is trotting to the robert e lee lorelei shook her head with a smile dont you dance doesnt everybody dance then how did you break your leg i dont care to go strange mr wharton helped himself to a goblet of wine appearing to heap the liquor above the edge of the glass now if i were sober i could understand how you might prefer these pappy guys to me for nobody likes me then but im agreeably pickled im just like everybody youll be likely to meet at this time of night merkle wont take you anywhere for hes full of distilled water and has a directors meeting at ten i overflow with spirits and have a noontide engagement with an ostermoor why dont you ask miss demorest she came with you wharton sighed hopelessly something queer about that jane dyou know what made us so late she went to mass on the way down mass at that hour it was a special midnight service conducted for actors i sat in the taxi and waited it did me a lot of good some time later merkle returned to find bob still animatedly talking catching loreleis eye he signified a desire to speak with her but she found it difficult to escape from the intoxicated young man at her side at last however she succeeded and joined her supper companion at the farther edge of the fountain where the tireless cupids still poured water from the cornucopias merkle was watching his friends son with a frown you have just left the personification of everything i detest he volunteered you heard what his father said about raising himhow he taught bob to drink when he drank and follow in his footsteps well sometimes the theory works and a boy grows up with open eyes but more often it turns out as it has in this case bobs an alcoholic a common drunkard and hell end in an institution sure hed be there now if it wasnt for hannibals money hes run the gamut of extravagance hes done everything freakish that there is to do but that isnt what i want to say to you help me feed these foolish goldfish while i talk do you think anybody would understand if they overheard you i fancied you and i were the only sober ones left some of the girls are all right merkle eyed his companion closely dont you drink i darent even if i cared to darent youll notice that most of the pretty girls are sober right i have nothing but my looks wouldnt i be a fool to sacrifice them you seem to be sensible miss knight something tells me youre very much the right sort i know youre trying to get ahead and i can help you if youll help me help you get ahead he smiled hardly i need an agent and ill pay a good price to the right person how mysterious ill be plain that affair yonder he nodded toward jarvis hammon and lilas lynn strikes you as a well as a flirtation of the ordinary sort in one way it is in another way it is something very different for hes in earnest he thinks he is injuring no one but himself with this business and he is willing to pay the price but the fact is he is putting other people in peril me among the rest im not arguing for his wife nor the two misses hammon i dont go much on the ordinary kinds of morality and nobody outside of a mans family has the right to question his private life so long as it is private in its consequences but when his secret conduct affects his business affairs when it endangers vast interests in which others are concerned then his associates are entitled to take a hand do i make myself clear perfectly but you dont want me you want a detective my dear child we have them by the score we hire them by the year and they have told us all they can we need inside information the girls answer was made with her habitual selfpossession ive heard about such things ive heard about men prying into each others private affairs pretending to be friends when they were enemies and using scandal for business ends lilas lynn is my friend at least in a way and mr hammon is my host just as he is yours oh i know this isnt a conventional party and im not here as a conventional guest inside the little coinpurse he gave me is a hundreddollar bill but just the same i dont care to act as your spy merkles grave attention arrested loreleis burst of indignation will you believe me he asked when i tell you that jarvis hammon and hannibal wharton are the two best friends i have in the world there is such a thing as loyalty and friendship even in big business in fact high finance is founded on confidence and personal honor this is more than a business matter miss knight i can hardly believe that its true however i mean to serve hammon at the same time i must serve myself and those who trust me my honor is concerned in this as well as his and there is a rigid code in money matters if what i suspect is true hammons infatuation promises to do harm to innocent people i fear in fact im sure that he is being used ive learned things about miss lynn that you may not know what you have told me tonight adds to my anxiety and i must know more what for instance her real feeling for him her intentions her relations with a man named melcher maxey melcher the same you know his business no he is a gambler a political power a crafty unscrupulous fellow who represents big people by helping me you can serve many innocent persons and most of all perhaps hammon himself lorelei was silent for a moment this is very unusual she said at length i dont know whether to believe you or not suppose then you let the matter rest and keep your eyes open when you convince yourself who means best to jarvis miss lynn and melcher and their crowd or i and mine make your decision you may name your own price there wouldnt be any price she told him impatiently ill wait merkle bowed i can trust your discretion thank you for listening to me and thank you for being agreeable to an irascible old dyspeptic will you permit me to drive you home when youre ready im ready now but as lorelei made her way unobtrusively toward the cloakroom she encountered robert wharton who barred her path fairy princess you ran away he declared accusingly im leaving she saw that his intoxication had reached a more advanced stage his cheeks were flushed his eyes were wild and unsteady good news the night is young well watch it grow up thank you no im going home a common mistake others have tried and failed with extreme gravity he focused his gaze upon her saying home is the one place that our mayor cant close she extended her hand good night i dont understand speak english goodnight whartons countenance darkened unpleasantly and his voice was rough whered you learn that line its country stuff well leave when im ready now well have a trot the music was playing other couples were dancing and he seized her in his arms whirling her away in and out among the chairs he piloted a dizzy course while she yielded reluctantly conscious meanwhile that adoree demorest was watching them with interest for an interval wharton said nothing then with a change of tone he murmured in her ear dyou think id let you spoil the whole night cant you see im crazy about you lorelei endeavored to free herself from his embrace but he clutched her the tighter and laughed insolently nothing like a good turkey to get acquainted is there were going to dance till were old folks she continued to struggle they were out of step and out of time but he held her away from himself easily bending a hot glance upon her upturned face she saw that he was panting and doubly drunk with her nearness dont fight ive got you she was smiling faintly out of habit but mistaking her expression he drew her close once more then buried his face in her neck and kissed her just at the turn of her bare shoulder then she tore herself away and his triumphant laugh was cut short as she slapped him resoundingly her stinging fingers leaving their imprint on his cheek her eyes were flaming and her lips were white with fury though she continued to smile here what dyou mean by that he cried she silenced him sharply hush remember you broke in here id like to see you in that fountain there was a swish of garments a musical laugh and adoree demorest was between them im madly jealous senor roberto she exclaimed come you must dance once more with me well finish this what she swayed toward him in sympathy with the music snapping her fingers and humming the words of the song she walloped me like a sailor the young man stammered incoherently she wants to see me in the fountain then jump in like a gentleman laughed the danseuse but dance with me first she entwined her arms about him and forced him into motion as she danced away she signaled over her shoulder to lorelei who made haste to seek the cloakroom when she emerged john merkle was waiting in the hall a shout of laughter echoed from the banquethall and she started thats nothing merkle told her bob wharton is in the fountain he says hes a goldfish chapter v one of the minor readjustments forced upon the knight family by the nature of loreleis work was that of mealhours peter from long custom of early rising in the country insisted upon his breakfast at seven and in spite of his inaction demanded dinner at noon and supper at six jim being erratic in habit exacted his meals at any hour that suited his appetite while mrs knight now that she had a housemaid ate with first one then another but no matter how chaotic the general household schedule lorelei was always assured of ten hours sleep a dainty breakfast upon rising and a substantial meal before theatertime her mother saw to it that this program was religiously adhered to at whatever hour of the night lorelei might come in no sound was ever allowed to disturb her until she arose irrespective also of her careless disregard of social appointments she was never permitted to miss one with the hairdresser the manicure the masseuse or the dozen and one other beauty specialists who form as important an adjunct to the stagewomans career as to that of the woman of fashion all this was a vital part of that plan to which the mother had devoted herself she attended the girls health and good looks with a devout singleness of purpose that would have been admirable in a better cause no racehorse on the eve of a derby was groomed more carefully than this budding woman in preparing her for masculine conquest the entire family took a hand her prospects her actions her triumphs were the main topic of conversation all other interests were subordinated to the matrimonial quest upon which she had embarked the men she met were investigated discussed speculated upon until their every characteristic was worn threadbare the domestic arrangements that resulted were of necessity unhappy for the housework was allowed to take care of itself the male members shifted as best they could and the home was forever in slovenly confusion nevertheless the existing condition of affairs met the approval of all and the three conspirators lived in a constant state of eager expectation over loreleis fortunes mother and daughter were loitering over a midday breakfast and lorelei according to custom was recounting the incidents of the previous evening its too bad you quarreled with mr wharton mrs knight commented when she heard the full story of hammons party hell dislike you now the girl shrugged daintily he was drunk and fresh i cant bear a man in such a condition but hes terribly rich and hes an only son hell inherit everything is he nicelooking umm yes you shouldnt antagonize a man like him my dear hes single at least and naturally hes impulsive like all those young millionaires they have so many girls to

too mrs wharton is a great club woman and the head of a thousand charities thats no sign shes charitable you cant tell she might take you right into the family bob is an alcoholic hes no good so mr merkle said jim who was immersed in the morning paper spoke from his chair near the window why dont you go after merkle himself sis easy picking these bankers jim also had come home in the still hours of the night before and had but lately made his breakfast on a cup of coffee three cigarettes and the racing sheet of the morning telegraph he wore his pajama jacket over a silk undershirt and was now

wait and see james returned to his paper shell never marry him she hates him jim laughed and his sister broke out irritably why be so mysterious anybody would think youd robbed a bank jim looked up

let me why maxey has been after me a dozen times about you but i knew you wouldnt stand for it blackmail eh jim was highly disgusted whats the difference how you pronounce it it spells kale and it

napkin with an exclamation whats wrong now demanded jim sore again because i offer to make a few pennies for you all right play for bob wharton id like to meet him though he can do me a lot of good how well he dropped eightyfour hundred in heblings sixth avenue joint the other night maxey owns a place on fortysixth street where the sky is the limit his sister was staring at him curiously she had voiced misgivings concerning his activities of late but jim had never satisfied her inquiries now she asked what is your share the young man laughed a little uncomfortably forty per cent thats usual if hes going to gamble somewhere i might as well be in on it lorelei turned to her mother but mrs knight seemed puzzled at this turn of the conversation the girls next words however left no doubt as to her feelings youre a fine specimen arent you her lip curled mother and son started at the bitterness of the tone youre in a fine business too blackmailing with tony the barbers crowd and capping for a jinny who said anything about a jinny ugh what a mess youve made of things two years ago we were decent and now loreleis voice broke her eyes filmed over with tears id give anything in the world if we were all back in vale it took only two years of the city to spoil us never mind the dramatics jim growled whats your kick youre on broadway aint you yes with a sixroom flat on amsterdam avenue pa is a cripple youre a crook and im the mother broke in sharply jim is no crook youve no right to talk like this after all weve done for you sure why did we come to new york anyhow echoed the young man what brought us here aint you having the time of your young life parties presents joyrides every day gee i wish i made the coin you do i hate it ha better try vale again youd end in a straightjacket if you did you think you could go back but you couldnt nobody can after theyve had a taste of the city its all wrong the whole thing is rotten sometimes i hate myself lorelei choked mrs knight spoke reprovingly dont be silly dear you know we did it all for you peter didnt want to leave home and jim had a good job but we gave up everything to let you have a chance yes and weve all worked for you every minute since do you think i like this stuffy flat after that other house with the yard and the trees and the sunshine peter lies in his room here day in and day out and never has a moments comfort or pleasure i dont know a soul i havent a friend or a neighbor but were not complaining mrs knight put added feeling into her words we dont want you to live the way weve had to live we want you to be rich and to have things after all weve done after all poor peter has suffered dont cried the girl falteringly i think of him every hour he isnt the sort that complains i consider it very thoughtless of you to behave as you do and make it harder for us mrs knight sniffed and wiped her eyes whereupon lorelei went to her and hid her face upon her mothers shoulder i dont want to be unkind she murmured but sometimes im sick with disgust and then again im frightened where are we heading whats going to become of us of me that man last night there was something in his face something in the way he held me just as if i were his for the taking it isnt the first time ive seen it either all the men i meet are beasts that whole party was sordid and mean old men drinking with girls and pawing them over mr merkle was the only nice one there the mother was dismayed to feel her daughter shiver good lord you people make me sick cried jim rising and making for his room anybodyd think youd been insulted when he had gone mrs knight asked accusingly lorelei are you in love no why youve said some queer things lately youve worried me i hope youll never be tempted to do anything so to be foolish just look at the girls who have made silly matches they all go back to work you cant be too careful with the men you meet for youre so beautiful that theyll promise you anything or pretend to be everything they arent i dont intend to let you make a mess of things by marrying some chorusman when the right person comes along youll accept him then youll never have to worry again but you must be careful do you think id be happy with a man like mr wharton why not youd at least be rich and if rich people cant be happy who can if you accepted some poor boy hed probably turn out to be a drunkard and a loafer just like wharton is now she sighed id like to see you settled we could take peter to a specialist and maybe he could be cured the doctor says there is a chance but it would take a world of money ill get the money how somehow if youd let me economize on clothes and if jim would help a little we could save enough jim has all he can do to take care of himself im sure i dont know how he manages and youve got to keep up appearances no peter will have to wait till youre married only i did hope when you told me about robert wharton that he might be the one we could go abroad and get the help of those german surgeons ive always wanted to travel when lorelei reached the theater that evening she found lilas lynn entertaining a caller who had been more than once in her thoughts during the day jims reference to max melcher had recalled mr merkles earnest words of the previous night and although her brother had implied that melcher was engineering the affair between lilas and the steel man lorelei could not bring herself to take the statement seriously it was too absurd she could not imagine how such a thing could be managed by a third person or how he could profit by it her stage experience had acquainted her with several intrigues in which the mens names were nearly as prominent as hammons but in no case had anything more serious than gossip eventuated a number of such attachments had resulted in happy marriages although at the price of an occasional divorce she remembered now that she thought of it that merkle had mentioned the probability of that very thing in this instance she began to doubt the bankers unselfishness and to question his motives arguing as she had done at first that even if hammon were really in danger it was no business of hers this lesson of noninterference in the affairs of others she had learned during her recent life spent in an atmosphere not so much immoral as unmoral for two years she had moved in a world where matters the mere mention of which would not have been tolerated in vale were openly discussed these topics were treated frankly moreover and with a wise cynicism which in loreleis case had proven protective gratuitous advice however was seldom welcomed and a policy of hands off prevailed miss lynns visitor was a welltailored man who gave a first impression of extreme physical neatness he was immaculate in attire his skin was fine his color fresh a pair of small imperturbable eyes were set in a smiling face beneath a prematurely gray head max melcher was a figure on broadway he had the entree to all the stagedoors he frequented the popular cafes where he surrounded himself with men always affable usually at leisure invariably obliging he had many friends at loreleis entrance he smiled and nodded without rising then continued his earnest conversation with miss lynn none of their words were audible to the last comer until melcher rose to leave then lilas halted him with a nervous laugh saying remember if it doesnt go its a joke and i run to cover it will go he told her quietly as he strolled out what are you two planning inquired lorelei nothing max drops in regularly he used to be sweet on me lilas completed her makeup then fidgeted nervously gee she presently exclaimed im tired of this business were fools to stay in it think of atlantic city on a night like this or the mountains this heat has completely unstrung me she rummaged through the confusion on her table then inquired of the dresser croft where are my white gloves they havent come back from the cleaners mrs croft answered not back then you didnt send them when i told you youre getting altogether too shiftless croft when i tell you to do a thing i want it done i sent all six pairs you did nothing of the sort oh miss lynn i hope i drop dead if dont talk back to me you always have an excuse havent you lilass voice was strident her face was dark with sudden anger ive a notion to box your ears lorelei broke in reprovingly lilas croft is old enough to be your mother yes and shes old enough to have some sense but she hasnt got it i hope i drop dead if i hope you do snapped the indignant girl i told you to attend to them now ive nothing but soiled ones the dresser began to weep silently she was a small timid old woman upon whose manifest need of employment lorelei had taken pity some time before her forgetfulness had long been a trial to both her employers thats right turn on the floodgates mocked lilas you stop that sniveling or ill give you something to cry for im nervous enough tonight without having you in hysterics remember if it ever happens again youll go and youll take something with you to think about seizing the cleanest pair of gloves at hand she flung out of the room in a fine fury you wont let her fire me i need work i do quavered mrs croft now now dont mind her temper but you really ought to see to her gloves when i hope i drop dead this minute if i didnt send em out the very day she told me croft youre fibbing you know lilas is excitable excitable croft wiped her eyes with a corner of her apron is that what you call it how ever you can bear her i dont see and you a nice girl she wont do you no good miss knight oh pshaw she was nervous i should think she would be ill be glad if her millionaire takes her out of the business like she thinks he will poor man hes laying up trouble for himself that he is shell land him in the divorce court with her fleshlight photographs lorelei swung around from her mirror what do you mean oh i heard her and that jew i beg pardon miss knight you aint a jew are you what about the flashlights theres so many hebrew girls in the profession not that i dont like em you understand go on well i heard enough to know that shes up to some deviltry her and that maxey melcher theyve got a photographer and witnesses your brother is one of em jim what its true its a bad crowd mister jims in with and theres something big in the air millions it is and her saying shell box my ears the hussy ive heard em talking before tonight tell me everything croft quickly i have only you better warn your brother the assistant stagemanager thrust his head through the curtains shouting your cue miss knight what the devil with a gasp lorelei leaped to her feet and fled from the room mrs croft shook her head mournfully snuffled a few times then scowled at the disarray lilas had left behind she breathed a feeble malediction upon the cause of it seized a hatpin and holding it like a dagger thrust it viciously into first one then another of the gowns hanging on their hooks i wish you was in em the little old woman exclaimed she replaced the pin then surreptitiously removed some expensive cologne from a large bottle transferring the perfume to a smaller bottle which she took from her pocket dabbed her nose with lilass powderpuff and began laying out her enemys next change of costume lorelei had left a handful of silver carelessly exposed and discovering this mrs croft counted it the pile was sufficiently large to reassure her so she abstracted two quarters then in an excess of caution returned one coin and took a dime in its place chapter vi lorelei did not secure another word alone with the dresser until the middle of the second act by which time mrs croft was her own colorless workworn self once more i dont know no more than i told you she informed lorelei mr melcher has been coming here for a long time and he always talks about mr hammon ive heard enough to know that him and her is after his money millions of it mister jim can tell you everything for hes talked about it too when you were on the stage lilas mentioned him tonight when her and him was talking over the fleshlight photographs she said oh gawd mrs croft broke off her narrative suddenly and falling to her knees in a prayerful attitude began nervously arranging the long row of footgear under miss lynns table the next instant the owner herself burst into the room panting from a swift run up the stairs quick croft dont be all thumbs now she tossed a sealed letter upon her table rapidly unhooked her dress and stepped out of it then into a flamecolored velvet gown which the old woman held for her she set a tremendous plumed hat upon her head impaled it deftly patted her hair into more becoming shape and then seated herself extending her feet for a change of slippers she took the moment to open and read her note lorelei looked up from her sewing at a little cry of rage from lilas miss lynn had torn the message into bits and flung it from her her eyes were blazing damn him she cried furiously rising so abruptly as almost to upset mrs croft the idiot what is it i must telephone quick halfway to the door she halted at loreleis warning wait you havent time damn repeated the elder girl i must or lorelei dear will you do me a favor run down to the door and telephone for me i wont be off again till the curtain and that will be too late lorelei rose obediently thats a dear call tony the barbers place i ive forgotten the number anyhow you can find it and ask for max tell him its off he cant come who cant come max no just say lilas sends word that its off he cant come hell understand run quick or you wont catch him and hell kill me if i let him go ill call him later tonight theres my cue now just ask for max and dont use his last name thanks ill do as much for you lilas was off with a rush and lorelei hastened after her speculating vaguely as to the cause of all this anxiety the telephone at the back of the circuit theater was located inside the stagedoor and occupied one end of the shelf which separated mr regans hole in the wall from the entrancehall it was no place in which to conduct a private conversation since any one coming or going could hear but stage telephones are not installed for the convenience of performers as lorelei hurried down the passageway a man in evening dress turned and she recognized robert wharton you are sent from heaven he cried at sight of her i enter out of the night and unburden my heart to this arguseyed watchman and lo you come flying in answer to my wish quick service judge in appreciation of your telepathy i present you with some lumbago cure he tossed a banknote to regan who snatched it eagerly on the fly lorelei forestalled further words please i must telephone i go on in a minute fairy princess last night i was a goldfish tonight i am an enchanted lover wait im in a hurry she thumbed the telephonebook swiftly in search of her number but young wharton was not to be silenced tell him its all off he commanded you cant go i wont let you promise he laid a hand upon the telephone and eyed her gravely dont thwart me im a dangerous man you cant use our little phone unless dont be silly im telephoning for some one else thats exactly what we cant permit the some one else is hereim it no no he closed one eye and wagged his head grasping the instrument more firmly promise to tell him it is a him isnt it aha my intelligence is sublime promise i slapped you last night i promise to do it again lorelei told him sharply something whispered that you did and all day long i have been angry but tonight now that im in my natural condition i pass the insult i offer you my hand and my other cheek in case you want to try a left hook but i come with another purpose outside is a chariot with ninety horses french rating champing at the throttle we are going away from here youre drunk again mr wharton he glanced at the clock over regans head and shook his head in negation its only tentwenty in two hours from now give me that phone promise to tell him its all off she smiled all right ill use those very words wharton hesitated i trust you im going to tell him he cant come she said holding out her hand once the instrument was hers she oscillated the hook with nervous finger staring doubtfully at the cause of her delay wharton as on the evening before carried his intoxication with an air he was steady on his feet immaculate in dress punctilious in demeanor only his roving reckless eye betrayed his unnatural exhilaration the judge had enjoyed the scene he chuckled he clicked his loose false teeth like castanets bob turned at the sound and regarded him with benignant interest his attention riveted upon the old mans dental infirmity youre quite a comedian regan wheezed click em again said bob pleasantly wonderful age has its compensations play home sweet home when you get em tuned up or perhaps they are for sale lorelei secured her number and was surprised to recognize her brothers voice she made herself known to jims equal amazement and then inquired is max there sure hes outside in the automobile call him please what do you want of him howd you know i was here never mind call him quickly during the wait wharton ejaculated ha jim max mens names mr regan kindly grind your teeth for me no will you grind them for a dollar jealousy business thanks at last melchers voice came over the wire and lorelei recited her message there was a moment of silence then she explained how she came to be talking instead of lilas he thanked her and she heard him muttering as he hung up she turned to find her annoyer nodding with satisfaction splendid i thank you my father thanks you my family thanks you now where would you like to dine how can a person get rid of you she inquired stiffly im sure i dont know it isnt being done but ill try to think wear your prettiest gown wont you for i intend to enrage all the other fellows this is an invitation eh the first of a nightly series life is opening out for you in a wonderful manner miss knight dont refuse my legs have petrified and a gang of safemovers couldnt budge me she turned with a shrug of mingled annoyance and amusement and he called after her the judges teeth will entertain me till you come ill be waiting miss lynn as she dressed after the performance was still in an evil temper but she thanked her roommate for aiding her then as if some explanation were due she added that note was from jarvis you puzzle me lilas lorelei told her slowly i dont think you care for him at all lilas laughed why do you think that i adore him but we had an engagement and he broke it men are all selfish the bigger they are the more selfish they become they never do anything you dont make them he cant sacrifice his business for you sacrifice its women who sacrifice themselves dyou suppose any of those men we met last night would sacrifice himself for anything or anybody not much they are the strong and the mighty they got rich through robbery and theyre in the habit of taking whatever they want they made their money out of the blood and suffering of thousands of poor people so why poor people dont buy steel no but they make it i knew mr wharton and the rest of them years ago for i was born and raised in a furnace town my father worked in a bessemer plant until he was killed what i saw there made me an anarchist through the open window overlooking the alley came a sound of singing two voices raised in doubtful harmony one loud and strong the other rasping hoarse and uncertain of all the girls that i adore theres none so sweet as saaahallee ouch whos that queried lilas bob wharton and the judge whartons waiting to take me to supper drunk as usual of course think of a fool like that with millions behind him millions that his father wrung out of sweating suffering foreigners like my father hes squandering bloodmoney thats what it is bloodmoney you are bitter tonight is mr hammon living on bloodmoney too yes he is is that why youre planning to blackmail it out of him lilas paused in her dressing and turned slowly brows lifted her dark eyes met the blue ones unwaveringly blackmail what are you talking about mrs croft went pale and retired swiftly but noiselessly into the lavatory closing the door behind her what did max tell you over the phone asked lilas sharply nothing then where did you get that from jim jims pretty bad i imagine but he keeps his badness to himself no ive overheard you and max talking nonsense weve never mentioned such a thing the idea is absurd i get mad at jarvis hes enough to madden anybody perhaps im jealous but blackmail why youre out of your head the girls had nearly finished dressing when a commotion sounded in the hall outside and mrs croft after investigation reported that robert wharton had been forcibly expelled from a dressingroom he could be heard gently apologizing and explaining that he was in quest of a fairy princess whereupon lorelei hastily locked her door thats the worst of these swells observed lilas as she left they pay high and go anywhere they please bergman caters to them lorelei delayed her toilet purposely and finally dismissed croft then she wrote a note to john merkle in care of his bank by this time the cavernous regions at the rear of the theater were nearly deserted she listened but hearing wharton still in conversation with the watchman she locked her door once more and sat down to wait as she fingered the note a doubt formed in her mind a doubt as to the advisability under any circumstances of leaving written evidence in anothers hands finally she destroyed the missive determining to make use of the telephone on the following day as to just what to do after that she was undecided when quiet had finally descended she opened her door cautiously and peered out robert wharton sat on the top step of the stairway near at hand but his head rested against the wall and he slept beside him were his high hat his gloves and his stick as lorelei with skirts carefully gathered tiptoed past him she saw suspended upon his gleaming white shirtbosom what at first glance resembled a foreign decoration of some sort but proved to be mr regans false teeth they were suspended by a ribbon that had once done duty in the costume of a coryphee they rose and fell to the young mans gentle breathing lorelei carried out her intention of telephoning on the following day and about the close of the show that night merkles card was brought up to her dressingroom a moment later robert whartons followed together with a tremendous box of longstemmed roses she went down a trifle apprehensively for by this time the current tales of bobs drunken freaks had given her cause to think somewhat seriously and she feared an unpleasant encounter more than once she had witnessed quarrels in the alleyway behind the circuit where pestiferous youths of whartons caliber were frequent visitors but mr merkle relieved her mind by saying i sent bob away on a pretext although he swore you had an engagement with him im glad you did i left him asleep outside my dressingroom last night and i almost hoped hed caught pneumonia beside the curb a heavy touringcar was purring and into this merkle helped his companion im not up on the etiquette of this sort of thing he explained but i presume the proper procedure is supper where shall it be sherrys lorelei laughed you are inexperienced the johns never eat on fifth avenue the lights are too dim but why supper you cant eat a welsh rarebit would be the death of me lobsters are poison he confessed but ive read that chorusgirls are carnivorous animals and seek their prey at midnight most of them would prefer bread and milk anyhow i would but im not hungry so lets ride we can talk better and youre not the sort of man to be seen in public with one of bergmans showgirls the banker acquiesced with alacrity to his driver he said take the long island road as the machine glided into noiseless motion lorelei noted a limousine waiting near by and saw a dim figure within the domelight had been turned off and she could detect only a white shirtfront the blurred outline of a face and the glowing point of a cigar you can follow that mans example if you wish said she and hide until were away from the bright lights merkle answered shortly your reputation may suffer not mine he leaned forward and inquired of the chauffeur whos car is that mr hammons sir hes going our way so his man said i thought so well have company why do you choose the long island road asked lorelei its pleasant responded merkle i ride nearly every night and i like the country you see i cant sleep unless im in motion i get most of my rest in a car theres something about the movement that soothes me how funny peculiar perhaps but scarcely humorous id be dead or insane without an automobile you see im nothing but a rack of bones strung together with quivering nerves always been so and im getting worse i keep four french cars in my garage all specially built as to springsuspension and upholstery and i spend nearly every night in one or the other of them its seldom i do less than a hundred miles between midnight and morning sometimes when im bad i do twice that so long as im moving fast i manage to snatch a miserable sort of repose but the instant we go slow i wake up its the sensation of flight the music of a swiftrunning motor the wind blowing in my face that lulls me but its getting harder all the time i used to sleep at twenty miles an hour now i cant relax under thirty forty is fine sixty means dreamless peace it does indeed if one happens to have a blowout laughed the girl i have trouble keeping chauffeurs the darkness breaks their nerve and they play out in two or three months ive known them to crack under the strain in a week and yet all the time i want to go faster faster some night when a bolt breaks or my drivers eye and hand fail to coordinate it will all end i suppose in a twinkling and ill get a good rest at last meanwhile i thank heaven and mr vanderbilt for the motor parkway the car had threaded the aftertheater congestion of traffic with a swiftness that testified to the practised hand on the wheel and was now darting through unfrequented sidestreets where the asphalt lay in the shadows like dark pools up the approach to the queensborough bridge it swept and took the long incline like a soaring bird overhead the massive towers pierced the night sky the steelribbed skeletontunnel rushed past the riders far beneath the river itself lay like a sheet of metal glittering here and there with the yellow lights of ships blackwells island slipped under them an inky bottomless pit of despair out of which points of fire gleamed upward like faint steadyburning sparks of hope in the hearts of miserable men the breath of the overheated city changed as by magic and the thinfaced sufferer at loreleis side drank it in eagerly even in the dim flash of the passing illuminations she noted how tired and worn he was and a sudden pity smote her wont you pretend im not here and drive just as you always do i wont mind she said my dear its late youll need to get home no no really his eagerness was genuine wont your people worry her answer was a short mirthless laugh that made him glance at her curiously they know im perfectly safe its the other way round a man of your standing takes chances by being alone with a woman of mine which reminds me of miss lynn and mr hammon youve decided to accept my offer no i cant be a hired spy you said over the phone that you had learned something i have i believe there is an effort on foot to get some of mr hammons money dishonestly i have a reason for wishing to prevent it i knew i wasnt mistaken in you smiled merkle oh dont attribute my actions to any high moral motives im getting a little rusty on right and wrong personally i have no sympathy with mr hammon and i dont imagine he acquired all of his tremendous fortune in a perfectly honorable way besides hes a married man it isnt alone jarvis or his family or their money that is concerned merkle said gravely great financial institutions sometimes rest on foundations as slight as one mans personality one mans reputation for moral integrity a breath of suspicion of any sort at the wrong time may bring on a crash involving innocent people hammon at this moment carries a tremendous topheavy burden of responsibilities his death would be no more disastrous than a scandal that would tend to destroy public confidence in him as a man doesnt he know that himself perhaps but his infatuation overtook him at an age when a man is a fool young men are always objects of suspicion in the financial world for their emotions are unruly but when old men fall in love they are superbly heedless of consequences i promised to tell you something about jarvis and i will since you spoke of his married life to begin with his father and his fathers father were steelworkers they came from cornwall before he was born and jarvis grew up in the glare of the pennsylvania furnaces from the time he could walk he never knew anything never heard anything except steel he inherited all the driving strength of his father and developed such a remarkable business ability that he became a rollingmill superintendent almost before he was of age they say he never did less than two mens work and often more but he could make others work too and there lay the secret of his success he was indefatigable he was a machine he never rested nor played nor relaxed as other men do he just worked and his mill held the tonnage record for years when the corporation was formed he played a big part in the deal and got a big slice of the profits he had been successful noted at one turn of the wheel he became enormously wealthy the story of alladin is nothing to the story of the men who took part in that combination hammon went into other things than steel and he prospered he never failed at anything now here comes the part of the story that interests me most of all and will interest you if you can understand the workings of a mans mind jarvis had no vices and but one hobby at least his vices were neutral for he had never taken time to acquire the positive kind his hobby was napoleon bonaparte he read everything there was to read about napoleon he studied his life and patterned his own on similar lines his collection of napoleona is the finest in this country he is an authority on french history of that period in fact hes as nearly hipped on the subject as a man of his powers can be considered hipped on anything do i bore you miss knight no go on im tremendously interested well naturally hammon began to consider himself another napoleon and his accomplishments were in a way quite as wonderful his strategy was quite as brilliant and his victories quite as complete he even confided to me once that his idol surpassed him in only one respect namely the power to relax a pardonable conceit under the circumstances jarvis had never taken time for relaxation and he was beginning to wear out and so he deliberately set about learning to play the emperor of france so history tells us took his greatest pleasure in the company of women therefore hammon sought women just as he had sought and gained financial conquest he doesnt know the taste of defeat so the result was foreordained but surely he thought something of his family protested lorelei didnt he consider them i fancy he wasnt well acquainted with his family im sure he never enjoyed any home life as we understand it he lived with a rich old woman who bore his name but scarcely knew him his daughters were grown women whom he saw on rare occasions and whose extravagant whims he gratified without question but there was little real intimacy little sympathy remember jarvis had been a boy but he had never been young and this was his first taste of youth but he was not napoleon as youve noticed hes quite mad on the lynn woman hes no longer himself he has been drugged by her charms and now hes paying the price i wanted you to know the story before we went any further now tell me what you have learned chapter vii by the time lorelei had completed her recital of those occurrences that had excited her suspicions the car was rolling out the roads leading toward the long island plains and with headlights ablaze was defying all speed laws other vehicles on their way home to the fashionable estates of wheatley hills hempstead and the south shore were overhauled and left behind the big machine had begun its long nightsong and it flashed over the rises or dipped into the swales with the gliding ease of movement characteristic of an aeroplane it went with almost the silence of a phantom only the sustained murmur of the motor the whisper of the whirling tires as they parted from the road surface the rush of the night wind pouring past came to the ears of the passengers these softly rhythmic sounds combined with the swaying of the deep cushions were decidedly restful and had there been nothing to challenge her sight lorelei felt that she too might have been soothed as merkle was but she was fascinated hypnotized by the gleaming tunnel of light into which she was being hurled the blazing panorama of fence forest and hedge that took dim shape out of the blackness grew rushed at her then leaped away into oblivion dazzled her too much for relaxation merkle however had drawn the conversationshield rearward and in its shelter leaned back with eyes closed he seemed asleep but after a time he spoke abruptly melcher is a shrewd man he wouldnt tackle a blackmailing job of this size without protection otherwise i could put him out of the way very quickly i dare say miss lynn herself doesnt know who is behind him why dont you warn mr hammon at once merkle rolled his head loosely you dont know the man his selfreliance is so monumental his scorn of opposition is so deep that he would laugh at the idea of a plot against him then too hes mad about the woman and hed probably tell her everything i said after all we have only our suspicions to go upon merkle dozed again half buried in the cushions they had passed jamaica the country lay dark and silent on every side save for a dimlit window here and there the car was eating the miles in a flight as swift and undeviating as that of an arrow but it was not until it had swept into the motor parkway that the girl fully understood what her host termed fast driving then it was that the chauffeur let the machine out over the deserted plains it tore cometlike a meteor preceded by a streamer of light it swung to the banked curves with no slackening of momentum it devoured the tangents hungrily the night wind roared past drowning all other sounds crouched immovably in his seat the driver scanned the causeway that leaped into view and vanished beneath the wheels like a tremendous ribbon whirling upon spools merkle lay back inertly lolling and swaying to the sidethrust of the cushions but lorelei found her fists clenched and her muscles hard with the nervous strain finally she pushed the shield forward and leaning over the front seat stared at the tiny dashlight the finger of the speedometer oscillated gently over the figure sixty and she dropped back with a gasp they had been running thus for a long time merkle roused to say is this too fast for you miss knight she laughed nervously nno im sorry i woke you after a moment he startled her by inquiring why dont you marry bob wharton she tore her eyes from the reeling shadows in front and peered at him what makes you think i like him well enough i dont but hes the sort youre looking for isnt he she nodded i cant expect to marry a decent man ive learned that much there was a pause and then it would be a great pity he said youre not complimentary perhaps im not so bad as i appear i didnt mean that it would be too bad on your account i like you maybe its your beauty that has gone to my head no man could remain quite sane in your company he turned his tired bright eyes upon her and lorelei stirred uncomfortably youre quite different to what i first thought you oh no im exactly what you thought ive seen mr wharton only twice hes crazy about you he acts wholly upon impulse of course it ought to be easy merkle inquired the time of his chauffeur then directed him to turn homeward along the north shore i shant be selfish and keep you out any longer miss knight he said if you dont mind ill doze on the way in and try to figure out the next move in this hammon affair the return trip was another hurtling rush through the night in a silence broken only by merkles demand for more speed whenever the machine slackened its labor the miles wheeled past the sound lay to the right they were sweeping over a rolling north shore road when suddenly out of the blackness ahead blazed two blinding headlights with startling abruptness they appeared over the crest of a rise merkles driver swung to the right but the road was narrow a trolley track was under construction and along the edge of the amasite was strewn a row of steel rails guarded by occasional red lanterns the strange car held to its course there was a blast of horns a dazzling instant of intense illumination then a crash as the inside mudguards met merkles car seemed to leap into the air there was a report of an exploding tire lorelei felt a sickening sense of insecurity and found herself hanging bruised and breathless across the back of the drivingseat the automobile was bucking and bumping as if the pavement had been turned into a corduroy road then it came to a pause half in the ditch merkle was jammed into an awkward coil on the floor of the tonneau but raised himself swearing softly the other car held to its course and whizzed onward leaving in its wake a drunken shout of mockery and defiance the catastrophe had taken but an instant the three were alone and their machine disabled almost in a breath merkle inquired anxiously if lorelei were hurt the chauffeur ran after the offending car yelling anathemas into the night he returned slowly mopping his face which had been cut by fragments from the shattered windshield joyriders he muttered they wouldnt give way and threw me into those rails narrow shave that i wonder we werent all killed merkle eyed the cars crumpled mudguard and runningboard then directed his driver to ascertain the extent of the damage the motor was still throbbing but a brief examination disclosed a broken steeringknuckle and a bent axle in addition to an injured wheel im terribly sorry miss knight but ill have to send for another car apologized merkle is this splendid machine ruined he shrugged thats the curse of these roads somebody is always driving recklessly lorelei smiled at memory of the miles they had covered so swiftly but she saw that he was serious and in a sour temper one risks his life on the whim of some drunken idiot the moment he enters a motorcar now for a telephone a terse question to his man served to fix their location were not far from the chateau merkle interpreted the answer that place is always open so if you dont mind the walk well go ahead it will take an hour to get one of my other machines but meanwhile we can have a bite to eat at her cheerful acceptance his tone changed youre all right some women would be hysterical after such a shakeup i swear i think i feel it more than you if you were a man id like to have you for a chum together they set out through the starlight leaving the chauffeur with instructions to secure help from the nearest garage and as they followed the dim road merkle continued to apologize until lorelei silenced him both were beginning to suffer from the reaction of their fright it was very late there was little sign of habitation for the road led through a wooded country before long however they came in sight of lights which merkle hailed with relief the chateau was a quasiroadhouse of some architectural dignity widely advertised as being under the same management as one of the smart broadway cafes and supplying the same food and drink at twice the broadway price its service was unsurpassed by any city restaurant and being within an hours run by motor it received a liberal patronage tips were large at the chateau its hospitality was famous among those who could afford the extravagance of midnight entertainment and yet it was a quiet place no echo of what occurred within its walls ever reached the outside world seafood waffles privacy and discretion were its recognized specialties and people came for miles mainly in pairs to enjoy them as the pedestrians neared the avenue of maples leading up to the house they espied in the road ahead of them first the dull red glow of a taillight then a dusty license plate theres luck merkle ejaculated ill rent this car in the gloom several figures were standing facing in the direction of the chateau and when merkle spoke they wheeled as if startled no you cant hire this machine what do you think this is a cabstand answered a gruff voice jim cried lorelei and ran forward her breathless amazement at the meeting was no greater than her brothers sis what the devil are you doing here he managed to say one of the men who had been kneeling over a case of some sort dimly outlined in the radiance of a sidelight rose and placed his burden in the tonneau im ready he announced young knight showed some nervousness and apprehension emotions which his companions judging by their alert watchfulness fully shared jim seized his sister by the arm and led her aside how the deuce did you get here and who is this guy he jerked his head toward merkle lorelei introduced her companion and made known the cause of their present plight humph grunted jim what dyou suppose mall say to this you out all night with a man what are you doing who are those people she retorted never mind but say i dont like the looks of this affair for a second time merkle appealed to jim if you cant take your sister home ill have to telephone for another car jims tone was disagreeable as he replied you two dont look as if youd been wrecked wheres your driver merkles fist clenched he muttered something at which jim laughed harshly now dont get sore said the latter im not going to make trouble only i want to know where youve been a bareheaded man came running across the lawn and flung himself into the waiting automobile one of jims companions called his name sharply will you take me home his sister implored cant do it ill see you later and you too merkle his last words delivered as he swung himself upon the runningboard of the car sounded like a threat a moment later and the machine had disappeared into the night hmm your brother has a suspicious mind merkle said i hope he wont make you any trouble he cant make trouble for me loreleis emphasis on the last word made her meaning clear her companion shrugged then theres no harm done i assure you they turned in upon the driveway walking silently then as they neared the chateau they became aware of an unusual commotion in progress there men were running from stable to garage others were scouring the grounds from the open door came a voice pitched high in anger the speaker was evidently beside himself with wrath he was shouting orders to scurrying attendants and abusing the manager who hovered near him in a frantic but futile effort at pacification the enraged person proved to be jarvis hammon he was hatless purplefaced shaken with combative fury at first the two newcomers thought he was dangerously drunk but as they mounted to the tiled terrace which served as an outdoor eatingplace they saw their mistake recognizing merkle hammons manner changed instantly john he cried by god youre just in time whats happened blackmail or worse i hardly know myself these ruffians put up something on me theyre all in it even the manager the latter a sleek frenchman with ferocious mustaches and frightened eyes wrung his hands in supplication msieu ammon he bleated you ruin me such accusation is terrible but wait calmness the man will be caught caught hell roared the steel magnate you know who he is give him to me how did he get in here if you didnt know him how did he get his camera fixed without your knowledge ill have your scalp for this ill close this place and the city place too a uniformed doorman appeared with a smoking lantern in his hand and hammon wheeled upon him well did you find him we cant find nobody there was a car outside the grounds but its gone now merkle interposed will you tell me what has happened it is terrible incredible msieu wailed the manager same old story john i came out here for a quiet supper with a lady ive been coming here regularly they got us into a private room then took a flashlight and there you are i made a rush for the waiter as soon as i realized what had occurred but hed skipped everybodys skipped photographer and all nobody knows anything blamedest bunch of idiots i ever saw he ground his teeth lorelei who had remained in the background turned suddenly sick at memory of that mysterious party at the gate she understood now the significance of the man with the box and of the fleeing figure that had come through the darkness the terrified manager continued his heartbroken lament and hammon seemed about to destroy him when merkle drew the latter aside speaking in an undertone hammon listened briefly then broke out nonsense id stake my life on her why shes prostrated its either pure blackmail or its my wifes work shes had detectives on me for some time merkle murmured something more oh come now i know what im talking about and i wont stand for that cried hammon merkle shrugged his next words were audible and they were both sharp and incisive the harms done they got away clean now weve got to kill the story and kill it quick in case they intend it for the papers my god newspapers at this time groaned the other it couldnt be worse right we must move fast is your car here yes get it well go in with you i had an accident to mine youll see for yourself that youre wrong about the other hammon jerked his head meaningly toward the house then strode away to order his motor merkle favored his young companion with a wintry smile it seems were too late lorelei nodded silently dont tell him who spoke to us out there not yet at least i cant see him go to jail jail there wont be any jail to this there never is jarvis will have to settle for the sake of the rest of us hammons limousine rolled in under the portecochere and a moment later the owner appeared with lilas lorelei stared at her friend in genuine surprise for it was obvious that lilas was deeply agitated her face was swollen with weeping she verged upon hysteria no sooner were the four in the car and under way than she broke down sobbing wretchedly its all my fault i might have known he was up to something but i didnt think hed dare she managed to say he who merkle asked her max melcher this is his doing what makes you think so he as much as told me if i hadnt been a fool id have guessed but he oh i could kill myself she burst into strangling sobs and hysteric laughter why did you let him come to the dressingroom lorelei inquired hes been doing it for years ive always known him we were engaged hammon verified this thats right they were engaged when i met her she didnt know the sort of ruffian he is till i proved it shes afraid of him and he knows it i tried to break with him but he wouldnt let me and ive had to be nice to him hed have me murdered if i rot merkle exclaimed testily rot eh jarvis answered hes done as much more than once but hes so powerful that nobody can get him hes the king of his ward he keeps a gang of gunmen on the east side and hes the worst thug in the city lilas substantiated this giving further details as to melchers reputation and then broke down again weeping with such miserable abandon that lorelei for the first time began to doubt her own previous convictions it seemed incredible that such emotion could be counterfeit and lilass plausible explanations did indeed make it appear that melcher was the resentful victim of an infatuation lorelei cast a troubled glance at merkle and found that he too gave signs of uncertainty hammon soothed his charmer in his clumsy elephantine way showing that despite merkles recent insinuations he still trusted her this is the only woman who ever cared for me john he explained after some hesitation and were going to stick together we have no secrets your little fifth avenue establishment rather complicates matters doesnt it what are you going to do about that merkle inquired this thing tonight is likely to settle the matter for me you know the kind of home life ive led for twenty years and you know i wouldnt regret any change when a man goes ahead and his wife stands still the right and wrong of what either chooses to do is hard to settle at any rate it has ceased to concern me i want a few years of happiness and companionship before i die im selfish ill pay the price they rode on in silence chapter viii when lorelei awoke on the following afternoon her first inquiry was for jim but he had not come home and her mother knew nothing of his whereabouts lorelei ate her breakfast in silence then in reply to a question accounted for the lateness of her arrival by saying that she had dined with mr merkle at the name mrs knight pricked up her ears vulturelike she undertook to pick out of her daughter all that had occurred down to the most insignificant detail lorelei had always made a confidant of her mother in such cases even to the repetition of whole conversations but this time the latters inquisitiveness grated on her and she answered the questions put to her grudgingly just why she felt resentful she scarcely knew certainly she had no interest in mr merkle nor suffered the least embarrassment over their exploit rather on this afternoon she beheld with unusual clarity her present general life and that of her family feeling more keenly than usual the utter sordidness of their whole scheme of existence unwelcome thoughts of this sort had come of late and would not be banished once she had made a pet of a magpie but the birds habits had forced her to dispose of it she remembered the way it forever pried into things how nothing was safe from that sharp beak and inquisitive eye its waking hours had been busied in a tireless furtive search for forbidden objects now she could not help likening her mother to the bird although the thought shocked her there was the same sly angle of countenance a similar furtiveness of purpose the very expression of mrs knights keen hard eyes was like nothing so much as that of the magpies displeased at her own irritation lorelei made the excuse of a shopping trip to escape from the house at the nearest newsstand she bought the afternoon papers and was relieved to find no mention of the incidents of the night before it appeared that hammon and merkle had succeeded in their attempt to suppress the story if indeed there had ever been any intention of making it public looking back upon last nights homeward ride she was wholly at a loss in view of jims words and of what she had gathered at the theater she had felt sure of lilass complete knowledge of the blackmail plot but hammons unwavering faith in the girl and lilass own story of her relations with max melcher had awakened a doubt if lilas had told the whole truth and if she really cared for hammon the affair despite its clandestine nature would bear a more favorable construction and lorelei could not entirely withhold her sympathy from the offending pair of the two hammon was the more blameworthy but his domestic unhappiness in a measure canceled his guilt so at least said the code under which lorelei lived what concerned her far more than the moral complexion of the liaison was her brothers connection with the unlawful scheme of extortion jim she saw had gone wrong with a vengeance and the consequences to him troubled her for in spite of all that he might be or do she cherished a sisterly affection for him family ties were very real and very strong to her strong enough to keep her loyal to her kin even after the demoralizing change in her whole mode of life the firmest in fact the only bond that she had ever known was that of blood obedience faithfulness and affection had been born in her and she never thought to question their sacredness idling down fifth avenue she found herself in front of a fashionable department store a knot of curious people were gaping at a unique automobile which stood in the line of vehicles along the curb and she paused to look the equipage was snowwhite in color its upholstery was of soft white leather the chauffeur and a stiffbacked footman were in bloodred with white facings on their livery upon their left sleeves was worked the gold monogram a d in their caps both men wore cockades that resembled shavingbrushes a tiny mop of a lapdog imprisoned within the closed body of the car was barking frenziedly at the throng he was an animated bundle of cotton with shoebutton eyes sewed into one end as for the car itself lorelei decided it to be a combination of every absurd tradition of the coachbuilders art across the doors in gold letters an inch high was the name adoree demorest as she entered the store lorelei reflected with some disgust that no visiting rajah no barbaric potentate no one in fact except a selfadvertised musicalcomedy queen would so flagrantly defy good taste as to ride in such a vehicle she was engaged in her final purchase when a dazzling creature in red and white descended upon her with exclamations of surprise and delight it was mademoiselle demorest herself and her greeting was so effusive that the stream of shoppers halted in the aisle mademoiselle demorest wore a gown of a style that proved her taste in dress as individual as her choice of motorcars a warlike headdecoration of aigrette feathers burst into spray above her right ear the wrists of her white gloves bore her monogram worked in goldthread to match those that ornamented the livery of her servants a heavy string of whitecoral beads the size of cherries was looped about her neck and she carried the mate to the excitable poodle that defied the curiosityseekers outside all in all she was a figure to awaken interest in the nightly performance at the palace garden and to cause men customers to forget their change miss knight im so glad to see you again she burbled how sweet you look the poodle pawed frantically and yelped a shrill appreciation of the meeting i hoped wed meet again but where have you been i hush francois shake hands with the lady theres a dear francois squirmed violently and snapped at a small boy whose mother had pushed forward to stare at the notorious beauty lorelei laughed how well he minds he hates children they excite him the woman with the child turned to a companion exclaiming audibly those are the kings rubies see aint they nice and white a fat matron beside lorelei elbowed her way forward in one hand she carried a pair of embroidered silk stockings with the other she raised a lorgnette after a measured scrutiny her lips tightened her nose lifted she blew loudly like a porpoise and gathering her skirts closely waddled away as if fleeing from contagion she continued to clutch the hosiery until a floorwalker in answer to the clerks frantic signal intercepted her another crowd promptly gathered to listen to her indignant denial of guilt have you finished your shopping adoree inquired then do come and help me match some rose du barry ive no more eye for color than francois pink is just another shade of blue to me gee hes alive all right piped the small boy whose eyes were glued upon the poodle ma what does a live dog cost lorelei felt herself flushing uncomfortably under the stares of the onlookers and glad to escape she moved away beside the undisturbed cause of all the furore miss demorest seemed genuinely delighted at this encounter she clung to her companion chattering vivaciously then when the rose du barry had been matched she suggested tea well run right over to the waldorf my car is outside but lorelei declined explaining lamely that she did not care for public places really really people point out one and i get enough of that the dancers expression and tone changed abruptly i supposed you were like all the others well im not when im away from the theater i try to forget it i hate the business the reply which came with sincere feeling widened loreleis eyes with uncontrollable surprise here too said adoree demorest quietly but im not allowed to forget it our first meeting made me think you were out with banners i was hired on that occasion to be naughty what do you say to some real tea at my house just you and i loreleis heart sank at thought of that gaudy machine outside but there was an honest appeal in the speakers eyes and moreover the memory of her own obligation rose to prevent her from appearing ungrateful id be delighted she falsified and gurgling with appreciation miss demorest hurried her toward the nearest exit in the street however adoree paused and her next words showed that she was not wanting in womanly intuition i shant inflict you with a ride in that circuswagon its all right for me but youre one of the decent kind if you have a reputation it wont do to parade it in a showcase well take a taxi loreleis relief must have been obvious for adoree sped swiftly to the corner then was back again without the dog if theres anything more conspicuous than a blonde with a white poodle she explained its two blondes with two poodles then she flung herself into the cab and slammed the door you must think im very rude her guest ventured nothing of the sort i know just how you feel miss demorests smile was a trifle strained only im awfully lonesome and ill take care that nobody sees us now i know ive been nasty lorelei felt her embarrassment growing for this woman differed entirely from what she had expected underneath the dancers extravagant theatricalism she appeared natural and unaffected adoree changed the current of the conversation by saying i hope those bloodhounds get to fighting dont you like them hate em id use em to scrub the windshield if i had my way why arent they yours oh i suppose so as much as that rubbertired igloo is mine theyre my props like the two british peers on the box gee id like to stick chewinggum in the sidewhiskers of the tall one the one with the cramps in his elbows his names riley and he gets nine dollars a week for looking like that a mans board bill isnt particular how its made nowadays how funny lorelei was eying the speaker with undisguised curiosity youre not a frenchwoman agnes smith is the name decent by descent but an actress by advertising whats your game umm my nose is straight i dont limp so im an actress by force of feature married hardly want to be got to be both girls laughed unaffectedly i like you said the dancer do you mind if i get out of this castiron corset and into a kimono when we get home have you a spare one dozens but theyre not very clean thats lovely and lets make the tea weak oh i cant drink anything strong im an awful counterfeit im beginning to think so i wonder if im dreaming the girls had much in common they chattered continuously through the short ride and when they alighted from the taxicab they disputed over the right to pay for it when the guest was ushered into adorees apartment she received another surprise for the place was neither elaborate nor showy it consisted merely of two large comfortable rooms overlooking a sidestreet lined with monotonous brownstone boardinghouses which for the most part were inhabited by doctors dressmakers and semiprofessional people a battered teakettle was set to boil over an absurd alcoholstove that required expert assistance to maintain its equilibrium adoree flung out of her finery and donned a japanese robe offering another to lorelei a plate of limber crackers was unearthed from somewhere also the disreputable remains of a box of marshmallows and these latter madamoiselle demorest toasted on a hatpin youre the most extraordinary person her guest at length remarked arent you going to show me your jewels or anything like that you probably have better jewels of your own carelessly replied adoree then she voiced a very tame and womanly oath as a marshmallow dripped into the flames pickles i spoiled that one but the cabachon rubies are real sure so is the square toe who brings em and takes em away so is the bond that covers em lordy but they are pretty then the king didnt give them to you my dear i never saw a king outside of a pinochle deck if i lost one of those rubies the maiden lane shylock who owns them would tear enough curled hair out of his beard to fill a mattress you never really believed that king stuff did you why yes i had no idea it worked so well again miss demorest smiled crookedly no wonder you didnt want to go to the waldorf with me i wonder you consented to come here your advance work is great i knew the public swallowed it but i supposed the profession knew press stuff when they saw it i sang and danced for ten years in this country and never got better time than the schutzen parks and airdomes seven shows a day and a change of act each week i was agnes smith then somehow i got the price of a ticket to england and i figured the musichalls would rave over a good kid imitation but bless you i starved i was closed the first place i played got the hook i ate nabiscos till i got another date then i pulled the airdome stuff that had scored in little rock and michigan city and it got by somehow my mother was a canuck so i knew some french and eventually i reached the continent there i met the old nick you may think the devil is a tall dark man with the ace of spades on his chin and a figuresix tail thats what he looks like on the hamcans but in reality hes a little fat bald man with a tenor voice and he eats cloves his name is aubrey lane and he cant stand hot weather never heard of him eh well neither had anybody else until i met him he was in paris selling patent garters at the time he saw me work at a cabaret and told me i was good but not good enough id known that for years so he didnt hurt my feelings he confessed that he was tired of working and intended to have me make a lot of money for him but warned me that he had expensive tastes and id have to pay well for the privilege he was right i did but here i am in electric lights on broadway while he is exercising a wheeled chair at atlantic city hes your manager he is that very little thing he told me i could sing until my back ached and never get anywhere because i lacked brains then he offered to make me a star if id allow him to hitch his chariot to me on a share of the gross there was one trifling sacrifice i had to make in the nature of my personal reputation so he told me he said id have to be the best or else the worst actress in the world in order to land big and support him in the luxury he craved i couldnt hope to be the best so he made me the worst he began by tying a can to the agnes smith and handed me adoree demorest instead then he went to work he really did work too although it nearly killed him and hes never done anything since i forgot to mention that i signed a contract with him which lawyers tell me is the finest example of airtight time weather and water proof construction that has been seen since the declaration of independence it fits closer than a rubber shirt always retains its shape lasts longer than old age and no metal can touch you the king fable is a joke on the other side but new york swallowed it clear up to the sinker and aubrey gaffed the palace garden management for a three years contract of course my advertised salary is phony just like the rubies and the wrecked throne and that gilded bandwagon with the poodles and the stuffed supers on the box aubrey owns them all except the rubies which he rents im billed as the most notorious woman in america and the shred of reputation i have left wouldnt make a necktie for a gnat whereas in reality i love marshmallows and tea much more than men but im a star at the head of my own company and playing to sidewalk prices do you think it was a good bargain lorelei had listened with breathless interest now she burst out impulsively you poor dear miss smith smiled but her eyes were tragic sometimes i cry when i think about it i cry a good deal said she i didnt realize until too late what it meant but you see i was tired of working tired of ambition and i wanted to come home thank god i have no people i save all the money i can and when i get enough im going to take agnes smith out of the mothballs dust her off tenderly and go to raising ducks ducks what do you mean what i say that has always been my ambition why not quit now whats the use im halfway through the swamp the mud is as deep behind as it is in front but im deathly afraid all the time that ill be found out id rather be notorious than ridiculous of course aubrey sees to that are you fond of him adoree turned up her nose hes a little pink rabbit i dont like any man and i never have theres only one id really care to meet his name is campbell pope the critic he is nice the beast did you read what he said about me ill never rest until i have a lock of his hair that ive plucked myself id love to have his whole scalp with say one ear attached hanging on my bureau where i could see it every morning when i wake up somehow i dont seem to mind the press stuff that aubrey puts out but pope actually believes what he wrote and other people will believe it too i i gosh im going to cry again lorelei nodded in perfect sympathy she did not laugh i havent any girl chum lets be friends said she adoree had been nibbling at marshmallows as she talked as she wiped her eyes now she left a smear of powdered sugar on her cheek id love to im simply bursting to confide in somebody but we couldnt go around together why i dont care what people think you cant afford to be reckless were each playing our own game and chasing the dollar in our own way the men you met would make life unbearable for you if they knew we were pals aubrey was right a girl must either be mighty good or mighty bad in this business or make people think she is which amounts to the same thing you have had easy going because youre known to be straight but if you ever get into the papers watch what will happen youll have to fight you wouldnt like that kind of fighting either and im not sure you could stand it as lorelei walked homeward that afternoon she felt an unaccustomed warmth in her breast and realized that she too had been very lonely in the city the certainty that she had made a friend gladdened her heart she looked forward with a thrill to the morrow when she could see adoree again during her absence jim had returned and departed but a note was waiting for her it had been brought by a messenger and read things look bad im afraid well be implicated too better see your brother quickly m chapter ix lorelei was not a little mystified by merkles cryptic message for she could imagine no possible way in which she or the writer himself could be connected discreditably with jarvis hammons affair she gained some light however when that evening she read the note to lilas why theyre going to blackmail merkle too lilas exclaimed well theyd be foolish to let him off wouldnt they two millionaires out with two showgirls hilarious foursome at the chateau automobile wreck foxy pinkertons and flashlight photographs nice story so they think hell pay to keep his name out of the papers exactly and he will for your sake i wont let him lilas was surprised why hes rich he wouldnt miss a few thousand you wouldnt allow mr hammon to be robbed would you oh wouldnt i if he didnt care enough for me to protect me from scandal id want to know it lilas you puzzle me confessed lorelei doubtfully you say things that make me think you dont care for him at all then again you seem to be crazy about him how do you feel how far would you go with him lilas laughed airily perhaps id go farther with him than for him he asked me to marry him if his wife gets a divorce and i agreed does that answer your question i suppose it does now that he has come to the point im not sorry things happened just as they did a woman must look out for herself no man will ever help her its worth some notoriety to become mrs jarvis hammon something in the speakers words rang false but just what that something was lorelei could not decide then youd like to see the story made public she queried naturally i dare say if i loved a man id want him at any price but i hope im not going to be dragged into this matter my dear new york has blackmailing newspapers just as it has blackmailing men they live off people like merkle youd be foolish to let him escape from this just to save a few dollars for the notoriety will injure you where it benefits me its not often that girls in our business know men like those two you have a family they can make merkle do the right thing by you i dont want him to do anything protested lorelei theres nothing to do you could make him marry you lorelei winced nonsense i dont care for him hes an old man theres no reason why he should he could be made to pay at least and youll be sorry if you dont get something out of him just wait and see what a difference the story makes with your other men friends during the ensuing performance lorelei pondered her friends disquieting prophecy yet she could see no reason for grave apprehension publicity of the kind threatened would of course be disagreeable but how it could seriously affect her was not apparent later in the evening robert wharton appeared as usual and so resentful was he at the deceptions previously practised upon him that lorelei with difficulty escaped a scene he declared positively that he was not to be discouraged that he proposed to have his attentions accepted at any cost even if it became necessary to use force he seemed sufficiently drunk to execute his threat and his invitation to supper was couched this time more in the terms of a command at last he borrowed a stool from the judge who by now was his willing vassal and planted himself in the hallway where he remained throughout the performance a gloomy watchful figure lorelei came down boldly dressed for the street and since she could not pass the besieger excused herself briefly descending the basement stairs she crossed under the stage made her way into the orchestrapit and managed to leave the theater by the front door she was waiting when jim came home and followed him into his room where they could talk without disturbing their father lorelei made her accusation boldly prepared for the usual burst of anger but jim listened patiently until she paused i knew you had to spill this so i let you rave said he but its too late somebody has been after hammon for a long time and hes been got yes and got good take a flash at the chorusgirls bible he tossed his sister a copy of a prominent theatrical paper i waited until it came out lorelei gasped for on the front page glared blacktyped headlines of the hammon scandal john merkles name was there too and linked with it her own jim she cried aghast they promised to kill the story humph charley murphy himself couldnt kill that what is this she ran her eye swiftly down the column sure melcher commenced suit against hammon this afternoon fifty thousand dollars for alienation of lilass affections joke eh he claims there was a commonlaw marriage and hell get the coin but mrs hammon the evidence is in her hands already dates places photographs everything shell win her suit too why it sounds like a a deliberate plot but i dont understand whos behind it what part did you have in it jim were you helping mr melcher in his blackmail scheme or another possibility came to her were you by any chance working for mrs hammon divining his sisters prejudice jim lied promptly and convincingly why mrs hammon of course i had a chance to turn a few dollars and i took it but why did they drag me in couldnt you keep me out of it this is dreadful as she ran her eye over the article she saw that it was quite in harmony with the general tone and policy of the paper which catered to the jaded throngs of the tenderloin truth had been cunningly distorted flippancy sensationalism and a salacious double meaning ran through it all whats dreadful about it inquired her brother that sort of advertising does a showgirl good youve got to make people talk about you sis and thisll bring a gang of highrollers your way youve been so blamed proper that nobodys interested in you any more for a moment lorelei scrutinized her brother in silence taken aback at his outrageous philosophy jim had changed greatly she mused not until very lately had she observed the full measure of the change in him he was no longer the country boy the playmate and confidant of her youth but a man sophisticated hard secretive he had been thoroughly manhattanized she perceived and he was as foreign to her as a stranger she shook her head hopelessly youre a strange brother she said i hardly know what to make of you has the city killed every decent instinct in you jim now dont begin on the old home stuff he replied testily i havent changed any more than you have why ma used to think youd play dead or jump through whenever she snapped her finger but youre getting toughbitted youre getting sanctimonious in your old age where you got it from i dont know not from ma surely nor from dad hes a cheater and always has been jim oh you know it im wondering how long youll stand pat what do you mean do you really intend to marry a bunch of coin thats the program isnt it ive been raised for that and nothing else well ma cant put it over so i guess its up to me just leave things to brother jim and dont worry over what happens nobody along broadway pays any attention to this rot he indicated the newspaper with a wave of his cigar after a moment he added would you accept merkle lorelei shivered oh no not mr merkle why not hes all right and he wont last long the idea is ugh he wouldnt ask me and i shant allow you to use this scandal to urge him the proposition sounds all right in the abstract marriage money comfort everything i want but when it comes right down to the point i always balk humph you ought to consider the rest of us a little bit pa could be cured mad be happy i could get on my feet

well whip over to a cafe for supper youll save me from him said lorelei with a wan smile and ill know that you are in good company for one evening at least dont lose any sleep over my habits he told her lightly and dont worry yourself about this newspaper story either melcher is in the right for hammon cut him out with lilas hes after merkle too so youll have to stand the gaff this time ill look up this chap wharton tomorrow and find out what sort of a farmers son he really is as jim and his mother breakfasted together on the following morning he broached the subject of his recent conversation with lorelei shes sore about the story he said we had a long talk last night i knew she would be and im not sure it was a good thing well drag something out of it if you do your part merkle will pay dont mention money nothing but marriage understand outraged motherhood ruined daughter blasted career thats yours ill be the brother whos in the position of a father to her i can threaten but you mustnt goldberg will close for us i dont see why we have to divide with a lawyer when its our affair and we can handle it ourselves his mother complained i tell you its got to go through the regular channels this was melchers idea and since im in on the hammon money max is entitled to his bit of this gee if shed only told us she was going out with merkle we might have framed something worth while i dont mind telling you this is a pretty weak case he wont stand publicity they never do averred mrs knight oh hes not like hammon he hasnt got a familyand lorelei wont back us up either weve got to bluff it through wouldnt he marry her not a chance in the first place she wouldnt have him bob wharton is the white hope she hates him too goodness knows what were going to do

her head shell skid for the ditch and we can kiss ourselves goodby shell be as easy to steer as a wild boar by the tail i guess youre sorry now that you didnt listen to me and let max handle her before she got wise i wouldnt feel safe with any of that crowd id be terribly afraid mrs knight shook her head dubiously say shes got you doing it too why they dont take a chance goldberg handles the legal end and his brother is in the legislature but thats not all melchers partner in his gamblinghouse is inspector snell you cant beat that i could have merkle killed for five hundred bucks and never stand a pinch id merely tip one of maxeys gunmen and some night old dyspepsia dick would wake up with a harp in his hand theyd get him coming out of his bank or going to his club or leaving the theater and nobody would dream who did it for there wouldnt be a motive its done every day ma even if they grabbed one of the boys melcher would spring him from the tombs alibi is maxeys middle name and he makes bondsmen how do you suppose politics are run in this town anyhow that isnt politics thats murder mrs knight was deeply shocked this is a terrible city jim sure but max is in politics for the protection it gives him in his other lines of business his gamblinghouse is as safe as a church theres big money in this bankerhunting too did you read about the two old guys at the king william hotel last month well max laid em against two squabs friends of tonys he got the girls into the hotel paid their bills and all that theyve cleaned up about twenty thousand so far of course lorelei wont stand for anything like that so weve got to marry her i suppose just the same im frightened and this isnt honest i wish she would listen to robert wharton james winked meaningly leave that to me shes going to proctors with me tonight maybe hell join us but meanwhile weve got merkle for some quick money if we work him right im off for goldys office now ill meet you at three when jim reappeared dressed for the street he gave a bit of parting advice better lay on the hysterics when she wakes up itll make it easier for me tonight lorelei found her mother visibly upset by the story in the mornings newspaper you told me you only went to supper with that man mrs knight cried tragically instead of that you two were off in the country together all night heres the whole thing she brandished the paper dramatically well i told you a fib but theres no harm done harm indeed youre ruined i never read anything more disgraceful i darent show it to peter it would kill him what ever possessed you after the way weve watched over you after the care weve taken of you its terrible please dont carry on so it was too bad of course but ill live through it the shock of this callous assertion seemed to rob mrs knight of speech she stared at her daughter in grief and amazement mr merkle is a gentleman lorelei defended hell regret this publicity as much as i the wretch ill teach him to spoil an innocent girls career and drag her name in the mud mrs knight glared balefully youll do nothing of the sort said her daughter sharply he ought to marry you why mother youre more insulting than that newspaper the career of a showgirl is something of a joke lorelei undertook to laugh but the attempt failed rather dismally indeed what will the other men say you had a character nobody could say a word against you until now do you think any decent man would marry a girl who did a thing like this of course i know youre a good girl but they dont and theyll believe absolutely the worst youve spoiled everything my dear im completely discouraged mrs knight began to weep in a weak heartbroken manner expecting lorelei to melt as usual but seeing something in her daughters expression that warned her not to carry her reproaches too far she broke out youre so hard so unreasonable dont you see im frantic with worry youre all we have and and the thought of an injury to your prospects nearly kills me you misunderstand everything i say i wish you were safely married and out of danger i think i could die happy then it means so much to all of us to have you settled right away peter is failing every day jim is going to the dogs and im sick over it all i wish i were married and out of the way you would all be fixed at least i dont much care about myself lorelei sighed in hopeless weariness of spirit for variations of this scene had been common of late and they always filled her with the blackest pessimism maybe mr merkle well leave him out of this declared lorelei hes too decent to have a person like me foisted upon him and theres no reason whatever why he should be held responsible for my notoriety she turned away from the diningroom with a shudder of distaste i dont want any breakfast i think ill get some air as soon as she was out in the street she turned southward involuntarily and set off toward the establishment of adoree demorest mrs knight dried her eyes and began to dress herself carefully preparatory to a journey into the wall street section of the city for the hour was drawing on toward three oclock meanwhile jim having transacted his business at goldbergs office sought a more familiar haunt on one of the sidestreets among the forties here just off broadway was a famous barbershop a spotless place with white interior and tiled walls six italians in stiff duck coats practised their arts at a row of wellequipped chairs a waspwaisted girl sat at the manicuretable next the front windows as jim entered she was holding the hand of a jaded person in a lightgray suit and murmuring over it with an occasional upward glance from a pair of bold dark eyes tony the barbers place was thoroughly antiseptic dirt was a stranger there germs found life within its portals a hazardous business what with the vitrified walls the glass shelves and enameled plumbing even the towels were handled with tongs the nickelplated steamer in which they were heated to an unbearable temperature seemed to puff its cheeks with a consciousness of painful and almost offensive cleanliness the men who worked here had hard black eyes but their hands were soft and white the rows of mugs that stood inside the glass cupboards were inscribed with the names of prominent actors managers and bookingagents of the rialto for this was a famous place in its way tony engaged in administering a shampoo nodded at jim and from force of habit murmured politely next then with a meaning glance he indicated a door at the rear of the shop in the third chair jim recognized max melcher although the face of the sportingman was swathed in steaming cloths jim passed on and into a rear room where he found three men seated at a feltcovered cardtable they were well dressed quiet persons one a bookmaker whom the racing laws had reduced from affluence to comparative penury another a tall pallid youth with bulging eyes the third occupant of the room was an exlightweight champion of the ring young sullivan by name his trim waist and powerful shoulders betokened his trade his jaw was firm and a cauliflower ear overhung his collar like a fungus jim drew up a chair and chatted idly until the bookmaker yawned rose and went out then jim and the others relaxed gee hes a sticker exclaimed the pugilist i thought hed broke his back max is getting his map greased the popeyed youth explained taking a pasteboard box from his pocket he removed a heroin tablet therefrom and crushed it the powder he held in the indentation between the base of his closed thumb and first finger known as the thimble then with a quick inhalation he drew the drug up his nostrils have an angel he inquired offering the box jim accepted but young sullivan declined whats the news the latter inquired ive seen goldy replied jim mother and i will call on merkle at three i finally got her to consent sullivan shook his head he might fall but i doubt it how does your sister feel thats the trouble shes square and we cant use her jim explained some doll admiringly commented armistead the third member of the group armistead had once been famed in vaudeville for dancing but the drug habit had destroyed his endurance and with it his career shes a perfect thirtysix all right she could rip a lot of coin loose if she tried at this moment mr melcher freshly perfumed and talcumed entered the room his white hair was arranged with scrupulous nicety his pink face as unwrinkled as his immaculate attire was beaming with good humor well boys im the paycar he smiled hammon came through eh sullivan inquired eagerly not exactly we compromised quick sales and small profits thats business how strong did he go queried armistead now whats the difference so long as you get yours photography is a paying business melcher laughed agreeably sure ill bet sarony is rich young sullivan carelessly accepted the roll of currency which melcher tossed him and the others did likewise i suppose thats curtain for us jim said regretfully it is the rest is lilass affair say will the old man fall again queried armistead hes going to marry her the three others stared at him in amazement right confirmed melcher shes got a strangle hold on him hmm maybe we havent lost the last car yet sullivan ventured jim seconded the thought shes got an ace buried somewhere theres a lot more in her head than hairpins i wish merkle would marry my sister not a chance melcher declared youll be lucky to shake him down for a few thousand how about wharton will she stand for him jim frowned and his voice was rough as he replied ill make her stand for him if its a marry hes a lush if you got him stewed he might go that far it has been done but of course its all up to the girl anyhow if he balks at the altar we might get him for something else im not sure ill need any help in this jim looked up coldly if he marries her that ends it if we have to frame him of course ill split how are you going to frame him with a square dame like lorelei asked armistead frame both of them melcher said shortly by the way hes a gambler too isnt he bring him in some night jim and ill turn for him myself save his cuffbuttons for me laughed young sullivan idly riffling the cards gee money comes easy to some folks dont you guys never expect to do any honest work chapter x jims appearance when he entered the dressingroom that night was a surprise he was clad in faultless evening attire why the barbaric splendor inquired lorelei dont you know im only your sister ive got these moe levys so i might as well wear em im tired of running a mothgarage he replied laying aside his stick gloves and hat with a care that betrayed his unfamiliarity with them what have you got to go with this scenery do you want me to dress too sure thing look your best and make me think im a regular john bergman dropped in to see me tonight she told him after they had gossiped for a moment he referred to that story in this mornings despatch yes i dont like the way he talked fresh hes always that but this time he was something more he thinks he owns the girls who work for him jim replied carelessly blow him and his job you can get on at the palace garden theres my contract he can discharge me you know but i cant quit thats one of the peculiarities of a theatrical contract well he insisted on taking me to supper a brother is a handy thing once in a while but for everyday use you need a steady with a kick in each mit i wish you would punch him who me and go joyriding with a squaretoe nix im too refined did you see tonights papers there wasnt much in them jim smiled wisely there would have been if things hadnt gone right im glad for your sake oh the harms done i suppose but theres one good thing about it bob wharton hasnt bothered me this evening jim with an expressionless face turned to speak to lilas lynn who had just come in when his sister came down after the last act he was waiting at the door and helped her into a cab despite her protestations that she would much prefer to walk what are you going to do with all the coin you save slip it to the shoemakers he laughed i dont go out often youd better spring me good as they seated themselves in the main room at proctors he appraised her with admiring eyes youre the candy sis theres class to that layout its part of the game to look well in public but id have enjoyed myself more if we had gone to billy the oystermans and dressed the part she surveyed the gaudy diningroom with its towering marble columns its tremendous crystal festoons showering a brilliant but becoming light upon the throngs below then nodded here and there to casual greetings proctors was a showplace built upon the site of a former resort the fame of which had been nationwide but the crowds that frequented it now were of a different type to those that had gathered in the old proctors nowadays the customers were largely visitors to the city in whom the spirit of bohemianism was entirely lacking the new resort was too splendid for the oldtime atmosphere magnificent panels done by a gifted artist were set into the walls and distant ceiling an elaborate marble stairway rose from the streetlevel to the hall itself but instead of extending an air of cheerful welcome it seemed to yawn hungrily for the occupants of the place rudely inviting them to descend when they had sufficiently admired the costly furnishings a superb orchestra was playing hordes of waiters hovered about the servingtables and sped noiselessly along the carpeted spaces between the diningtables but despite the lights and the music it was evident that the servitors outnumbered the guests nominally high wages were offset by the various deceptions open to an ingenious management prices were higher here than elsewhere the coatrooms were robbers dens infested by italian mafiosi tips were extravagant and amounted in effect to ransom and each mealcheck was headed by an illegible scrawl which masked an item termed service the figure opposite would have covered the cost of a repast at childss but new york dearly loves to be pillaged it cherishes a reputation for princely carelessness of expenditure it follows that freedom from extortion in places of entertainment argues a want of popularity than which nothing can be more distressing to contemplate nothing speeds the manhattan sleephater more swiftly to a change of scene than the knowledge that he is getting his moneys worth speaking of clothes jim continued staring past his sister to another table there seems to be a strikebreaker in the room pipe the gink with the nightshirt under his coat and the shoestring tie there must be a masquerade say hes bowing to you hush its campbell pope the critic mr pope had risen and was slouching toward them he took loreleis hand then shot a sharp glance at her escort as the girl introduced them accepting jims mumbled invitation he seated himself and instructed a waiter to bring his coffee jim continued to eye him with poorly concealed amusement until pope led him into conversation whereupon the youth began to take in the fact that his guests intelligence and appearance were entirely out of harmony wisely jim sheltered himself behind an assumption of pleasantry he was far from feeling he also watched the nearest entrance with some anxiety for the reviewers presence did not fit well with his plans as he finished ordering he heard pope say i was sorry the story got out miss knight but it was pretty well smothered in this evenings papers of course you were dragged in by the hair to afford a roman spectacle we all saw what it meant when it came to us what did it mean queried jim with brotherly interest blackmail the word was written all over it melchers connection with the affair was proof of that then the way it was handled nobody touched it except the despatch and of course it got its price i thought newspapers paid for copy innocently commented jim yes real newspapers but the gang had to publish the stuff somewhere it is reported that hammon paid fifty thousand dollars to prevent melcher from filing suit i dare say things will be quiet around tony the barbers now you press people certainly have got a lot up your sleeves jamess involuntary start of dismay did not pass unnoticed he did not relish the gleam in popes eyes and he hastily sought refuge in a goblet of water notwithstanding his distaste for the liquid we sometimes know as much as the police and we invariably tell more continued pope yes a business man can get a haircut in tonys without fear of family complications now i suppose armistead is smoking hop young sullivan is probably laying an alcoholic foundation for a wifebeating and the others are spending hammons money in the cafes jimmy knight paled for behind popes genial smile were both mockery and contempt a panic swept him lest this fellow should acquaint lorelei with the truth jim lost interest in his clams and thereafter avoided conversation with the wariness of a fox he was still glowing with resentment when robert wharton paused at the table and greeted its occupants cheerily in response to jims invitation bob drew up a fourth chair seated himself and began to beam upon lorelei noting the faint line of annoyance between her brows he laughed retreat is cut off he announced complacently escape is hopeless ive left orders to have the windows barred and the doors walled up eh whats the idea inquired pope wharton answered sadly my vanity has suffered the rudest jolt of its young career i mourn the death of a perfectly normal and healthy selfconceit age twentynine services at noon friends and relatives only oho youve heard the seductive song of the rhine maiden popes eyes were twinkling eh im tangled up like a basket of tickertape you see campbell i drink candor compells me to acknowledge that much in a moment of folly i was indiscreet and ever since i have been trying to apologize i have borne garlands of roses offers of devotion plaintive invitations to dine but the circuit is a trick theater and it has a thousand doors all i have to show for my efforts at reparation is a bad cold a worse temper and a set of false teeth which the doorman pledged with me for a loan of ten dollars i have mr regans dental frieze in my bureaudrawer but they only grin at me in derision in short im in dutch and there sits the adorable cause of my sorrows in spite of whartons reproachful tone the gaze he bent upon lorelei was goodhumored and she saw that he was in a mood different to any she had ever seen him in strange to say he was sober or nearly so and he was plainly determined to make her like him has he annoyed you miss knight asked pope dreadfully wharton explained further the first time we met i deserved to be slapped and i was you see i was ruder than usual but i have sobered up purposely to apologize i have repented and well here we are thanks to brother james thanks to jim lorelei raised her brows pope turned to young knight and said politely that is my foot you are stamping on ignoring jims mute appeal wharton ran on smilingly he promised to shackle you to a table until i could stammer out my halting apologies and now that ive done so in the presence of press and public wont you forgive me and help me to bury the hatchet in a welsh rarebit he was speaking directly to her with a genuine appeal in his handsome eyes now that she saw him in his right mind it was unexpectedly hard to resist him for he was very boyish and friendly quite unlike the person who had so grievously offended her when she and jim had first entered the restaurant they had received a polite but casual recognition from the head waiter whose duty it was to know all the stage favorites but there attentions had ceased with wharton as a member of the party however there came a change the head waiter himself hustled forward and catching loreleis eye signaled her with an appreciative droop of the lid her arrangement with proctors was of long standing and her percentage was fixed but this time she did not respond to the sign mr proctor himself paused momentarily at the table and rested a hand upon whartons shoulder while he voiced a few platitudes then in some inexplicable manner robert found himself not only ordering for himself but supplementing jims menu with rare and expensive viands as a great favor he was advised of a newly imported vintage wine which the proprietor had secured for his own use if mr wharton wished to try it the steward would appeal directly to mr proctor and secure the keys as a personal favor nothing like this wine had been seen in new york for years possibly in a lifetime it was an opportunity and mr proctor was eager to accommodate those who really knew wines a visiting prince had offered him a fabulous price for the remaining bottles but he had refused to partake of this vintage was almost like drinking up the sunshine darkness complete and eternal would follow when this precious shipment was exhausted of course mr wharton wished to sample such a vintage any vintage in fact since a thousand fires were consuming him and his nerves were on edge from the night before the first draught electrified him his spirits rose and he swept his companions along with his enthusiasm from surrounding tables people accosted him men paused in passing to exchange a word about stocks polo scandal newport tennis tuxedo none were in the least stiff or formal and all expressed in one way or another their admiration for lorelei women whom she knew were not of her world beamed and smiled at the young millionaire it was a new experience for the girl who felt herself as the supper progressed becoming conspicuous without the usual disagreeable accompaniments men no longer openly ogled her women did not nudge each other and whisper her presence in company with a member of the idolized rich was causing gossip but gossip of a flattering kind all this attention however had quite the contrary effect upon campbell pope much to jims relief he excused himself shortly whereupon the former after allowing wharton to pay the score suggested a dance breezily sweeping aside his sisters mild objection of course bob was delighted and soon the trio had set out upon a round of the dancingcafes at the first place they visited they had difficulty in gaining entrance for a crowd was held in check by the heavy plush cord stretched across the door to the restaurant proper but here again whartons name proved potent the barrier was lowered and the party managed to squeeze their way into a badly ventilated turkish room where a demented darky orchestra was drumming upon various instruments ranging in resonance from a piano to a collection of kitchen utensils tables had been crowded around the walls and into the balcony so closely that the occupants rubbed shoulders but the center of the lower floor was occupied by a roped corral in which a mass of dancers were revolving like a herd of milling cattle dusty tobaccosmoked oriental rugs banners and lanterns suspended from walls and balcony railings lent a semblance of color to the place little moorish alcoves were set into the walls in and out of which undersized waiters dodged like rabbits in a warren the attendants were irritable they perspired freely they bumped into people squeezed past or failing in that crawled over the seated guests after a breathless halfhour of this the three sought a resort farther uptown where they found the entire upper floors of a restaurant building given over to trotting during the previous winter the craze for dancing had swept new york like a plague and the various barbary coast figures had reached their highest popularity here too the rooms were thronged and the tables taken despite the lateness of the season but for a second time wharton demonstrated that to a man about town of his accomplishments no place is really closed however loud the protest against this latest fad it is doubtful if its effect is wholly harmful for it at least introduced vigorous exercise and rhythmic movement into the midnight life of the city women went home in the gray dawn with faces flushed from natural causes exquisite youths of nocturnal habits learned to perspire and to know the feeling of a wilted collar bob wharton had drunk heavily but up to this time he had shown little effect from his potations beyond a growing exhilaration now however the wine was taking toll and lorelei felt a certain pity for him waste is shocking it grieved her to see a man so blessed with opportunity flinging himself away so fatuously the hilarity which greeted him on every hand spoke of misspent nights and a reckless prodigality that betokened long habitude only his splendid constitution that abounding vitality which he had inherited from sturdy temperate forebears enabled him to keep up the pace but lorelei saw that he was already beginning to show its effect judging from tonights experience he was still in his sober moments a normal person but once he had imbibed beyond a certain point his past excesses uncovered themselves like grinning faces alcohol is a capricious master seldom setting the same task twice nor directing his slaves into similar pathways he delights moreover in reversing the edge of a persons disposition making goodnatured people pettish or morose while he sometimes improves those of naturally evil temper often under his sway the somber and the stoical become gay and impulsive while the joyful sink into despondency but with robert wharton liquor intensified a natural agreeableness until it cloyed his amenities were monstrously magnified he became convivial to the point of offensiveness in the course of this metamorphosis he was many things and through such a cycle he worked tonight while the girl looked on overcoming his niggardly instincts jimmy knight as the evening progressed assumed the burden of entertainment he too adopted a spendthrift gaiety and encouraged whartons libations although he drank little himself there came a time when bob could no longer dance when in fact he could barely walk and then it was that jim proposed leaving bob readily agreed having reached a condition of mellowness where he agreed enthusiastically to anything and lorelei was only too glad to depart she had witnessed the pitiful breakingdown of bobs faculties with a curious blending of concern and dismay but her protests had gone unheeded having had a glimpse of his real self earlier in the evening and being wise in the ways of intemperance she felt only pity for him now as the three made their way downstairs while jim went in search of their belongings bob propped himself against the wall and regarded her admiringly through eyes that were filmed and unfocusable fairy princess you are more adorable every minute he said thickly yes a thousand yesses and im your little friend eh no more slaps no more mysterious exits what that depends upon you im behaving finely he vaunted i usually act much worse than i have tonight but i like you i like you differently understand not like the other girls youre so beautiful makes me dizzy you forgive my little joke eh what joke meeting you the way i did tonight jims nice boy obliged to him i see then it was all planned he nodded vehemently and nearly lost his balance how much did you pay him lorelei queried with difficulty mr wharton waved his hand in a magnificent gesture whats money anyhow somebodys bound to get it fifty dollars he looked at her reproachfully thats an insult to jim hes a business man he is more than that oh yes and ill take care of him again this very night ill stake him he knows a place will you do me a favor she asked after a pause wharton assured her with abnormal emphasis that her lightest wish was law then go straight home from here she pleaded i say thats not fair bob looked ludicrously shocked i promised jim wouldnt have me break a sacred promise would you were expected a little game all arranged where we can bust it quick if you hear a loud noise thatll be melcher going broke melcher lorelei looked sharply at her brother who was approaching with her wraps and noted that he was perfectly sober a moment later she checked bob in the act of giving directions to the cabdriver wait where do you live mr wharton the charlevoix it was the most expensive bachelor apartment building in the city drive to the charlevoix she told the chauffeur hold on sis cried jim were going to take you home first no but jim saw in his sisters face something that brought a smothered oath to his lips drawing her out of hearing he muttered angrily mind your business ive got something on i know you have she met his eyes unflinchingly but you shant rob him jim thrust his thin face close to hers and she saw that it was distorted with rage if you dont want to go home stay here hes going with me well see she turned but he seized her roughly what are you going to do he demanded im going to tell him hes being taken to a crooked gamblinghouse and that youre working for max melcher he isnt too drunk to understand that her brother clenched his fist menacingly but she did not recoil and he thought better of his impulse are you grandstanding he queried brutally are you stuck on the boob or do you want your bit without reply she walked back to the cab redirected the driver to the charlevoix then seated herself beside wharton who was already sinking into a stupor jim slunk in behind her and they were whirled southward it was a silent ride for the besotted young millionaire slept and jim dared not trust himself to speak lorelei closed her eyes nauseated disillusioned miserable seeing more clearly than ever the depths into which she had unwittingly sunk and the infamy into which jim had descended nor was the change she reflected confined to them alone upon the other members of the family the city had stamped its mark just as plainly she recalled the ideals the indefinite but glorious dreams of advancement that she had cherished upon leaving vale and realized with a shock how steadily she had degenerated where was her girlhood where was that selfrespect that purity of impulse and thought that all men recognize as precious gradually bit by bit they had slipped away wisdom had come in their place knowledge was hers but faith had rotted time was when the sight of a drunken man filled her with terror now the one beside her scarcely awakened disgust bad women had seemed unreal phantoms of another world now she brushed shoulders with them daily and her own maidenhood was soiled by the contact she was a girl only in name in reality she was a woman of the streets or so she viewed herself in the bitterness of this hour at his hotel wharton roused himself and lorelei sent him reeling into the vestibule then she and jim turned homeward through the deserted streets chapter xi during the last act of the matinee on the day following lorelei was surprised to receive a call from john merkle the judge led him to her dressingroom then shuffled away leaving him alone with her and mrs croft i hope i havent broken any rules by dropping in during your office hours he began theatrical rules are made to be broken but i do think you are indiscreet dont you the banker had been using his eyes with an interest that betrayed his unfamiliarity with these surroundings i was on my way uptown and preferred not to telephone he looked meaningly at croft and lorelei interpreting his glance sent the dresser from the room on some errand well the game worked said merkle mrs hammon has left home and commenced suit for divorce if our friend miss lynn had set out to ruin jarvis socially and perhaps financially she couldnt have played her cards better is that what you came to tell me merkle hesitated no he admitted it isnt but im a bit embarrassed now that im here i suppose your mother told about seeing me my mother loreleis amazement was convincing and his keen eyes softened when did you see mother where yesterday at my office didnt you know that she and your brother had called lorelei shook her head she felt sick with dread of his next words it was very unpleasant i fear for all of us what did they want the girl was still smiling but her lips beneath the paint were dry they felt that i had er involved you in a great deal of notoriety from what they said i judged that you shared their feelings he paused awkwardly once more and she motioned him to continue we didnt get on very well especially your brother and i for he presumed to criticize my relations with you and er my motive in taking you to ride the other night i believe i was quite rude to him in fact i had the watchman eject him not daring to trust myself they asked for money lorelei averted her face for she could not bear to meet his frank eyes yes what i considered a great deal of money i understood they represented you they didnt insist however they offered me a choice choice of what well i inferred that marriage would undo the wrong i had ohh lorelei rose with a gasp bravely she stilled the tremor of her lips tell me the rest there isnt much more your mother was quite hysterical and noisy today a lawyer came to see me he offers to settle the whole matter but i prefer dealing directly with you do you think i knew anything about it she cried indignantly no i do not think so now yesterday i was too much surprised and too angry to know just what i did think its perfectly true however that i was to blame for the unfortunate outcome of the ride and i want to make amends for any injury werent you injured too by the publicity merkle showed his teeth in a mirthless smile thats neither here nor there please leave me and let me think this over i must do something quickly or ill smother im glad i came said he rising im glad i made sure so am i what you have told me has made a great difference in everything dont allow them to she hesitated and her voice broke i cant say it yyou must think im unspeakable he shook his head gravely no i merely think you are very unfortunate i think you need help more than any girl i ever knew i do i do but i am not the one to give it at least not the kind of help you need ill need help more than ever after tonight yes why because im going to leave home loreleis head was up and she spoke with a note of defiance then perhaps i can do something he seated himself again you will need money oh no i have my salary and the other revenues you know about i have kept my family for two years work wont hurt you but why force yourself to go on with those other things theyre not to your liking im sure my mother and father must live there isnt enough dont you see there just isnt enough for all of us unless i graft like the other girls merkle broke out impatiently make an end of it ill finance you she laughed a little harshly dont misunderstand me he went on almost eagerly dont think for an instant that id venture to expect anything in return i wont trouble you i wont even see you nobody will ever know i wouldnt miss the money and id really love to do it you tried to do me a favor theres no use arguing well dont be stubborn or hasty you could use say ten thousand dollars it would keep you going very nicely and really its only the price of a new auto why do you offer me so much she asked curiously because i like you oh i mean like not love because i think youre a good sort and will need money to remain good youre not an ordinary woman miss knight you cant live as ordinary women live now that youre famous new york wont let you youre very kind and generous after all that has occurred and after knowing my reason for being here my dear child you didnt choose your family and as for the other the women of my set marry for money just as you plan to do so do women everywhere for that matter and many of them make excellent wives yes far better than if they had married poor men few girls as beautiful as you in any walk of life are allowed to marry for love trust me a woman like you if she lives up to the obligations of wifehood deserves better than one who takes a man for love and then perhaps goes back on her bargain will you accept my offer no but i thank you think it over there is no hurry and remember i want to help with one of his infrequent wan smiles he extended his hand and lorelei grasped it warmly though her face was set and strained she was far too well balanced for hasty resolutions but her mind once made up was seldom changed it distressed her grievously to leave her people but at the thought of remaining longer with them every instinct rebelled her own kin urged by greed had not hesitated to cheapen and degrade her their last offense coupled with all that had gone before was more than could be borne yet she was less resentful than sad for it seemed to her that this was the beginning of the end first the father had been crippled then the moral fiber of the whole family had disintegrated until the mother had become a harpy the brother a scamp and she lorelei a shameless hunter of men now the home tie that last bond of respectability was to be broken her first impulse was to take up her abode with adoree demorest but a little thought showed the inadvisability of that in her doubt she appealed to lilas broaching the subject as the two girls were dressing after the performance an apartment echoed the latter why my building is full of them who wants one i do you lilas turned with her mouth full of hairpins and her hands halted in their nimble duties when lorelei had made known her decision the other girl nodded her approval i dont blame you a bit a girl needs liberty i have five rooms and a jap to take care of them theyre lovely i cant afford an expensive place well there are some threeroom flats in the rear and i have it gertie moore kept one but shes gone on the road its all furnished too some rahrah boy from columbia fixed it up for her but they had a row broke the engagement and she joined out with the kissing girls if it hasnt been sublet you can get it at your own terms the building is respectable too its as proper as the ritz im dining alone tonight come to dinner with me and well find out all about it lorelei would have preferred a different location not particularly desiring to be near lilas but there was no time in which to look about and the necessity that faced her made any assistance welcome without more discussions she agreed and the two girls rode uptown together the elegancia where lilas lived was a painfully new overelaborate building with a gothic front and a gotham rear half its windows pasted with rental signs six potted palms a turkish rug and a jaundiced jamaican elevatorboy gave an air of welcome to the ornate marble entrancehall lilas fitted a key to the first door on the right as they went in explaining im on the ground floor and find it very convenient this place is too grand for me lorelei objected oh offer your own price for gerties flat if you like it theyre crazy for tenants if you didnt want a furnished place you could get in rentfree they have to fill up these buildings to sell them ive lived for months without paying a cent and always in a new apartment as soon as my lease was up and the owner wanted to renew id move to another house that wasnt full its cheaper than hotels if you want to save money lorelei was surprised to find her friends quarters not only richly but lavishly furnished the floors were covered with rugs of the deepest hue and richest luster the furniture of the front room into which she was first ushered was of an inlaid foreign pattern of which she could not guess the name or period there was a playerpiano to match the furniture and a cabinet of rolls near by stood a specially made victrola with an extensive selection of records there were bronze lamps ravishing bits of bricabrac lace curtains of which she could judge the quality and heavy hangings sheathed now in their summer coverings the decorations of the room were harmonious and bespoke a reckless disregard of cost a fluffy japanese spaniel with protruding eyes and distorted visage capered deliriously at its mistresss feet but the objects that intrigued the visitor most strongly were several paintings they were of a kind she had seldom seen and in the afternoon light one stood out with particularly startling effect it was a dusky landscape there was a stream a meadow edge trees just growing black against a dying sunset a herd of cattle coming out of the west before this picture lorelei paused staring with wide eyes of wonder lilas flung her hat carelessly into a chair lit a cigarette from a tiffany humidor then turned with the spaniel in her arms and beholding her guest with rapt upturned face remarked with a laugh looks the real thing doesnt it oh its wonderful so clean and cool and quiet ive seen cattle in vale that looked just like those when i went barefoot in the grass some dutchman painted it his names in the corner hes dead now i believe it used to hang in some museum i forget where i like pictures of women best but she shrugged and left her sentence unfinished theres a dandy in my bedroom although it didnt cost half as much as that barnyard thing the frames a foot wide and covered with solid gold i had no idea you lived like this lorelei peered through a pair of french doors and into a perfectly appointed library with a massive mahogany table deep loungingchairs a writingdesk and a domecrowned readinglamp my study lilas laughed shortly thats where i improve my mind not the books are deadly now come hitchy koo must have dinner ready his name isnt hitchy koo but it sounds like it and hes the cutest little thing got the cutest little swing she moved down the hall humming the chorus of the senseless popular song from which she had quoted everywhere was the same evidence of good taste in decoration and luxury of equipment but a suspicion had entered loreleis mind and she avoided comment hitchy koo was cook butler and houseboy and in view of miss lynns disorderly habits it was evident that he had all he could do to keep the place presentable his mistress possessed that faculty of disarrangement so common in stagewomen wherever she went she left confusion behind she was careless to the point of destruction and charred marks upon the handsome sideboard and table showed where glowing cigarette stumps had suffered a negligent demise the spaniel was allowed to worry bits of food that left marks on the rug his owner ate without appetite and in a hypercritical mood that took no account of the wasteful attempts to please her quite regardless of the patient little jap she alternately found fault with him and discussed with her guest matters of so frank a nature that lorelei was often painfully embarrassed so you like my home do you she queried after a time ive never seen one so beautiful lilas nodded hitchy sleeps out and that leaves me the whole place jarvis furnished it even to the books and im studying to be a lady again she laughed mockingly i make a bluff at reading but so long as i talk about napoleon he never thinks to question me i know that french gink backward i wish i had a hobby something to interest me something to live for said lorelei lamely yes it gives you something to think about when youre alone it helps you to stand things for the first time lilas showed a trace of feeling in her voice she dropped her chin into her palm and leaning upon the table stared as if at a vision her dark eyes were somber her brows were lowered and drawn together the slipshod informality of the meal the constant faultfinding of the hostess made it something of a trial lorelei was not sorry when it was over and lilas took her to look at the vacant flat miss moores apartment offered a wide contrast to the one they had just quitted being very small and very modestly furnished but it was on the second floor convenient to both elevator and stairway it boasted a piano and the superintendent allowed his prospective tenant to name her own terms she descended with relief feeling that she had made not a bad bargain she stated as she sank into lilass big library chair i feel quite independent at last the rent is ridiculous and i can do my own cooking dont make a fool of yourself you can do as well as ive done you have the looks but im not engaged to a multimillionaire it seems queer when i think of it lilas mused jarvis is one of the richest men in new york and he made his money out of the steel business the business into which i was born have you ever been through a mill no its wonderful terrible i can smell the hot slag the scorching cinders the smoke to this day some nights i wake up screaming its so vivid i see the glare of the furnaces the belching flames the showers of sparks from the converters the streams of whitehot metal and they seem to pour over me i have the same dream always ive had it ever since the night after my father was killed you told me he was killed in a steelmill yes before my eyes i saw it lilas shuddered i was a little girl then but ive never forgotten we were poor dreadfully poor like all the jews oh yes didnt you know im a jew then lilas lynn stage name its really lily levinski we were polish i was dragged up along with the other workmens children in the soot and grime of the pennsylvania mills we never saw anything green nothing grew in our town i learned to play on a slagpile and my shoes when i had any were full of holes the scars are on my feet yet everything was grim and gray there and the children were puny bigeyed little things the mills were hideous by day but at night they became oh tremendous they changed the sky into a flaring canopy they roared with the clashing of rolls and the rumble of gears the men looked black and tiny like insects against the red glow from the streaming metal hell must be like those mills it couldnt be worse i used to watch the long rows of little cars each with an upright ingot of hot steel on its way to the soakingpit and i used to fancy they were unhappy spirits going from one torture to another when the furnaces opened and the flames belched out into the night they threw horrible black shadows you know like eddies of pitch or when the converters dumped they lit up the sky with an explosion of reds and yellows and whites that put out the stars it it was like nothing so much as hell lorelei had never heard her roommate speak with such feeling nor in such a strain but lilas seemed quite unconscious of her little burst of eloquence she was seated leaning forward now with hands locked between her knees her eyes were brilliant in the gathering dusk her memories seemed to affect her with a kind of horror yet to hold her fascinated and to demand expression i was an imaginative kid she continued its a trait of our people like well like their distrust of authority and their fear of law you see persecution made them cunning but underneath they are fierce and revengeful and lawless i inherited all these traits but that has nothing to do with the story father worked in the bessemer plant like any hunkie and the women used to bring the mens lunches to them mother wasnt strong and that duty fell to me i had my stand where i used to wait for the whistle to blow it was one of the biggest mills in pennsylvania and its tonnage was always heavy because the superintendent was a slavedriver he was one of those men who are born without soul or feeling and he had no interest in anything except rails and plates his plant held the record month after month but at last he lost the broom at the stack that was the pennant of victory a broom tied to the highest chimney i remember hearing father and the others talk about it and they seemed to feel the loss although goodness knows they had little reason for wanting to keep the broom since it meant only more sweat and labor for them while the glory all went to the superintendent but thats the way with men one day i took my bucket and joined the line of women and girls that filed in through the gates i was twelve then but stunted with smoke and thin from poverty ill never forget that day the sole of one of my shoes was worn through and cinders kept working in i took my stand just outside the bessemer plant it was a big shell of steel girders and corrugated iron and the side where we were was open away up above were the roaring crucibles where the metal was fluxed beneath ran the little flatcars waiting for the ingots to be poured father saw me and waved his hand he always waved at me then i saw the superintendent coming through a big squarefaced man whom everybody feared we kids used to think he was an ogre and ate little people he was raging and swearing and spurring the men on to more haste i heard later that he had sworn to win the broom back if he wrecked the plant wherever he went the hunkies danced he could put life into a dead mans limbs that man it was because of their great fear of him and his furious urging that something happened lilas had begun her recital slowly without apparent object but once into it she seemed unable to stop and now although her words came haltingly it was plain that she had worked herself into a sort of hysteria in which she gave little heed to her hearer it was characteristic of her that she could so excite herself by the power of visualization as to be completely transported something went wrong overhead the operator got rattled or somebody was late in his duties and fouled the machinery anyhow the converter dumped too soon men were working directly underneath father among the rest being so young i had no idea of what it all meant at the time but the memory stuck i saw him go down under a stream of liquid steel loreleis horrified exclamation went unnoticed lilass voice was shrill yes he was blotted out right there before my eyes in an instant in the time it takes to snap your finger he and the others were gone changed into smoke into absolute nothingness one moment he was whole alive flesh and bone the next he didnt exist tons of boiling metal ran over the spot nothing in the world was ever so horrible youve never seen liquid steel nor felt the awful breath of it have you there wasnt even a funeral twelve men twelve pinches of ashes were lost somewhere swallowed up in that mass nothing more there was no insurance and nobody took the blame another jew family a few more widowed and fatherless foreigners among that army meant nothing scarcely a month went by without accidents of some sort the shock finished mother for she was emotional and she had imagination too ive never forgotten that day nor the figure of that shouting swearing man who came through the bessemer mill crying for more speed more speed more speed so that a broom could be hoisted on a halyard and so that other men in other cities for one short month could point to him with envy i suppose i was too little to make any foolish vows of vengeance for i was only a ragged mite of a child among a horde of slaves but when i grew older i often dreamed of having that man in my power and making him suffer who would who could have imagined that id ever be living on money wrung from the labor of men like my father and be in a position to meet that man on an equal footing i never did not in my wildest moments and yet here i am steelmoney bought these books these rugs and paintings any one of those pictures represents the wages of a lifetime for a man like my father he was murdered so was my mother but things are queer anyhow here i am rich and the day of reckoning gets closer all the time she ended with an abruptness that evidenced her agitation rising she jerked a beaded chain that depended from the center lamp and the room was flooded with mellow light then she drew out the table drawer at her guests elbow and with shaking hands selected a small box from the confusion within lorelei recoiled at the sight of a revolver half hidden among the disorder goodness i hope it isnt loaded the latter exclaimed your story gives me the creeps and that thing seems to fit in its loaded all right i keep it for protection lilas explained carelessly then rang for the jap she opened the box which contained several compartments in one of which was a package of white powder in another a silver tablespoon when the obedient hitchy koo appeared she ordered a glass of water i dont know why i told you all this she half apologized to lorelei it has upset me as it always does how did you ever grow up and educate yourself i hardly know some neighbors took me in at first and i worked for them then i got a job in a drygoods store and finally in the corset department i filled out when i began to get something to eat and i developed a good figure finally i got to be a model i was quick to learn and when rich dames came in i watched them i became goodlooking too although not so pretty as i am now for i couldnt put the time or the money on it but i was pretty enough and i seemed to appeal strongly to men some girls do you know without understanding how or why first it was the buyer for our department he lost his head completely and although he was married and i didnt care for him i realized he could do me good i was seventeen then he taught me to dress and to take care of myself he had wonderful taste in such things it was his affair with me that finally cost him his place and his wife too for that matter when id got all he had i left him and came to new york the rest isnt a pretty story for i went the way most girls do who have that appeal i spoke about miss lynn made this declaration calmly as she busied herself with the glass her servant had fetched she dissolved a portion of the powder in the spoon then carefully transferred the liquid into the cap of a pearlandgold fountainpen inserting the open end of the receptacle into first one then the other nostril she inhaled the contents what are you doing asked lorelei curiously something to quiet my nerves i wonder why i told you all this she eyed her guest speculatively then shrugged well since were to be neighbors we must be friends and theres no harm done now that jarvis and i are engaged hes awfully particular about the company i keep but he likes you how different they act when theyre in earnest he even wants me to quit work now but i like the excitement its better than waiting she glanced at her wristwatch and drew herself together our time is up dear we must get back to the showshop chapter xii lorelei exploded her bomb at breakfast sunday morning and the effect was all she had dreaded fortunately jim had gone out so she had only to combat her mothers panicstricken objections and her fathers weak persuasions so keen however was the girls humiliation at merkles disclosure that mrs knight dared not go to the lengths she would otherwise have allowed herself and loreleis merciless accusations left little to be said in selfdefense of course the usual tears followed likewise repetitions of the timeworn plea that it had all been done for loreleis own good and had been prompted by unselfish love for her im beginning to doubt that lorelei said slowly i think you all look upon me as a piece of property to do with as you please perhaps im disloyal and ungrateful but i cant help it and i cant forgive you yet when i can ill come home again but its impossible for me to live here now feeling as i do i want to love you so im going to run away tragically through her tears mrs knight inquired what will become of us we cant live jim never does anything for us in peters watery stare was abject fright lorelei wouldnt let us suffer he ventured tremulously im sick i may die any time so the doctor says he was indeed a changed man that easy good humor that had been his most likable trait had been lost in habitual peevishness ill keep the house running as before his daughter assured them and ill manage to get along on whats left but you mustnt be quite so extravagant thats all i shant be and you wouldnt force me to do anything id regret im sure she choked down her pity at the sight of the invalids pasty face and flabby form then turned to the window her emotion prevented her from observing the relief that greeted her words the moment was painful loreleis eyes were dim and she hardly saw the dreary prospect of fireescapes of whitewashed brick of bare gaping back yards overhung with clotheslines like nerves exposed in the process of dissection yes things will go on just the same she repeated then clenched her hands and burst forth miserably oh i know how badly you need money i know what the doctor says and ill get it somehow it seems to me id pay any price just to see dad walking around again and to know that you were both provided for money money you both worship it and im getting so i cant think of anything else nothing else seems worth while two hours later a dray called for her trunks and took them across town the elegancia apartments looked down on her with chill disapproval as she entered the elevatorman stared at her with black hostile eyes until she had made herself known and even the superintendent in a less pretentious structure than the elegancia he would have been the janitor now that number six was rented did not extend even a perfunctory welcome as he delivered the keys on the contrary he made known the exclusive character of the house in such a pointed manner as to offend her lilas was out she learned which probably meant that she was still asleep lorelei ascended to her new home in low spirits now that she saw the place in strong daylight she was vaguely disappointed on the evening previous the superintendent had lighted it brilliantly but now it was gloomy and there was dust and disorder everywhere the previous occupant had undoubtedly been a temperamental housekeeper the tragic awakening of loves young dream showed in the hasty nature of her departure for the icebox was lamentably odorous of forgotten food the kitchenette needed scrubbing with hot water and lye the modest fittings of the whole place were in topsyturvy neglect when loreleis trunks were dumped inside the chaos appeared complete she was not accustomed to rely upon her own hands and at this moment she felt none of the pride that comes of independence instead of the glad spirit of freedom she had anticipated she was filled with dismaying doubts she sat down finally in the midst of a confusion that her first efforts had only doubled and stared about her with miserable eyes she was very lonely very friendless and very much discouraged then she noticed the telephone and sprang toward it adoree was at home her voice answered cheerily and her interruptions of amazement and delight caused loreleis message to spin itself out unduly without waiting for an invitation adoree cried let me come and help please well use both the poodles for mops and ill be there in ten minutes youre a perfect dear to say yes for i know you want to do it all yourself come now quickly im scared lorelei begged in tearful tones ill drive right up in my chariot of flame i was going out and its waiting while i kalsomine my face are you sure everything is good and dirty goody well make the prop footman work for once in his life no well do it ourselves goodby in a surprisingly short time the palace garden star came flying up the stairs scorning such delays as elevators she flung herself upon her friend with a hug and a smack crying hurrah madame sans gene has come to do the scrubbing yet she hardly seemed dressed for housecleaning a tremendous floppy hat crowned her flaxen head she was tightly incased like a chrysalis in its cocoon in a delicate creation of pink her gloves were long and tight and her highheeled boots were longer and tighter nevertheless she promptly proceeded with a reckless discard of her finery a process she had begun on her way upstairs like a country boy on his approach to a swimminghole she paused in the center of the one passably sized room and her piquant face was flushed with animation how perfectly corking she exclaimed how beautiful do you think so lorelei asked doubtfully its just dandy so cozy and secluded and shady why its a darling place not a sound is there gee what a place to sleep she sped from one to the other of the three rooms uttering shrieks of rapture even the bathroom which was much like any other although as cramped as a chinese ladys foot excited a burst of enthusiasm at last she ceased her inspection quite out of breath and declared im enchanted i tell you theres nothing like these inside apartments after all youre so safe from burglars but the rent my dear you stole this place and to think its all yours why im going to live and die here will you i mean live the dancer laughed no no if i did either theyd fire you out but ill come often and well have the dearest parties just we two without any men well let our hair down and cook and will you look at that gasstove i could eat it it was impossible to resist such infectious spirits lorelei began to see sunshine and before she knew it she was laughing in the best of humor with herself and her surroundings adoree clad now in a nameless formless garment which she had discovered in a closet her own modish belongings safely rolled up in a sheet had covered her head with a towel turban and incased her feet in an old pair of shoes thus equipped she fell upon the task of regeneration with fanatic zeal she became grimy a smear of soot disfigured her face her skirt dragged her shoetops flopped and the heels clattered but she was hilariously happy side by side the girls worked they forgot their luncheon then sent the sadfaced footman in search of a delicatessen store and ate ravenously with a newspaper for tablecloth by evening the place found itself for once in its life clean and orderly and the two occupants dressed and went out to a nearby hotel for dinner returning they put the final touches to their task when adoree left late that night she kissed her friend saying thank you for the loveliest sunday i ever had it was splendid and ill come again tomorrow the theatrical profession is full of women whose lives are flawless hence it had not been difficult for lorelei to build up a reputation that insured respect although her connection with a bergman show made the task more difficult than it would otherwise have been during the two years of her stage experience no scandal had attached to her name and she had therefore begun to feel secure in that period she had met many men of the usual types that are attracted by footlight favorites and they had pressed attentions upon her but so long as she had been recognized as the lady unobtainable they had not forced their unwelcome advances now however that a scurrilous newspaper story had associated her name with that of a wealthy man she began to note a change the hammonlynn affair was already notorious loreleis part in it led the stagebroken wiseacres to doubt her innocence and their altered attitude soon became apparent to her there was a difference also in the bearing of certain members of the company she heard conversations retailed at second hand by envious chorusmates in her hearing detached remarks were dropped that offended her bergmans advances had been only another disquieting symptom of what she had to expect an indication of the new color her reputation had assumed nobel bergmans success in the show business had long been a mystery among those who knew him for to offset an undeniable theatrical talent he possessed all the appetites the frailties and the passions of a rake it was perhaps most of all his keen personal appreciation of beauty that had made his companies the sensation of new york at any rate he had done amazingly well for himself and entertainments of a certain character had become known as bergman shows just as showgirls of a dashing type were known as bergman girls even when employed by rival managers in his office or during the organization and production of his spectacles he was a cold shrewd man of business once the venture had been launched he became an amorous hangeron a jackal prowling in search of a kill his commercial caution steered him wide of the moral women in his employ but the other kind and especially the innocent or the inexperienced had cause to know and to fear him in appearance he was slender and foppish he affected a pronounced waistline in his coats his eyes were large and dark and brilliant his mouth was sensual he never raised his voice he never appeared to see plain women such girls as accepted his attentions were sure of advancement but paid for it in other ways on monday evening mr slosson the pressagent thrust his head through the dressingroom door and inquired may i come in you are in i came to see lorelei say theres some society people out front who want to meet you and youre to join them after the show indeed who said so bergman declined with thanks promptly said lorelei oh wait you cant decline this its business bergman says you must come as a personal favor to him mrs thompsonbellaire is giving a boxparty and she told him to fetch you around for supper she owns a piece of this show and the theater belongs to the estate so youll just have to go mercy mrs thompsonbellaire the collegeboys giddy godmother lilas mocked i suppose shes out slumming with her kindergarten class slosson frowned at this levity will you go he inquired yes or no umm ill have to say yes it seems good ill phone bergman when the pressagent had gone lilas regarded her companion with open compassion gee but youre going to have a grand time that bunch thinks its smart to be seen with showpeople and of course theyll dance all night lorelei groaned and i did so want to go straight back to my new home when she joined her employer after the show she was in no very agreeable frame of mind mrs thompsonbellaire was a vermilionhaired widow with a chest like a blacksmith who had become famous for her jewels and her social eccentricities she and her party were established at one of the uptown trottoires when nobel bergman and lorelei arrived three examples of blushing boyhood devoted themselves to a languid blonde girl of thirtyfive and the hostess herself was dancing with another tender youth but she came forward panting so good of you to come dear she cried this is miss wyeth and these are my boys mr she spoke four meaningless names and four meaningless smiles responded four wetcombed heads were bowed she turned to her blonde companion saying she is pretty isnt she alice very alice agreed without removing her eyes from the youth at her left bergman invited lorelei to finish the dance then he inquired what do you think of her her hair fascinates me she looks as if she had just burst out of a thicket of henna leaves bergman laughed silently but why did she invite me i told her to you i knew youd refuse if i asked you so then im really your guest instead of hers well leave whenever you say throughout the rest of the dance lorelei was silent offended at bergmans deception and uncomfortable at her own situation but the hostess had ordered a supper of the unsatisfactory kind usual in such places little as she liked the prospect she could not leave at once the meal was interrupted regularly each time the music played for dancing was more than a fad in this set it was a serious business with which nothing was allowed to interfere the bulky widow was invariably the first upon her feet and miss wyeth followed closely yielding herself limply to the arms of first one then another of the youthful coterie she held her slashed gown high and in the more fanciful extravagances of the dance she displayed a slender limb to the knee she was imperturbable unenthusiastic utterly untiring the hostess because of her brawn made harder work of the exercise but years of strenuous reducing had hardened her muscles and she possessed the endurance of a bear once the meal had dragged itself to a conclusion there began the customary round of the dancingplaces this being the popular conception of a lark and lorelei allowed herself to be bundled in and out of the thompsonbellaire theatercar there was considerable drinking bergman who devoted himself assiduously to his employee showing more effect from it than the others he utterly refused to take her home as the night wore on he became more and more offensive he grew coarse in a sly tentative manner as if feeling his ground he changed the manner of his dancing also until lorelei could no longer tolerate him getting tired my dear he queried when she declined to join the whirling throng yes i want to go all right he leered at her and nodded still living on amsterdam avenue no ive moved to the elegancia so how does mother like it shes im living alone bergman started his eyes brightened ah then youve come to your senses finally i thought you would lets finish this dance anyhow i dont want to be seen dancing too much with you why you understand why mr bergman she eyed him coolly the lines of his sinister face loosened and sagging slightly from drink deepened for an instant let them talk i can do more for you than merkle can merkle her expression did not change now dont lets deceive each other he had never found it necessary to cultivate patience in his dealings with women and when she pretended ignorance of his meaning he flared out half in weariness half in anger oh play your game with strangers but dont put me off werent you caught with him at the chateau hasnt he fixed you up at the elegancia well then you neednt finish im going home now he laid a detaining hand upon her arm you never learned that speech in one of my shows he said and youre not going to say good night to me understand he grinned at her with disgusting confidence and she flung off his touch they had been speaking in low tones because of the two vacantfaced boys across the table now lorelei turned appealingly to them but they were not creatures upon whom any woman might rely nor could she avail herself of mrs thompsonbellaires assistance for the widows reputation was little better than bergmans and from her attitude it was plain that she had lent herself to his designs he was murmuring slyly youre a sensible girl you want to get ahead well i can put you at the top or or what she faced him defiantly or i can put you out of the business the returning dancers offered a welcome diversion lorelei dreaded an open clash with the manager knowing that the place the hour and the conditions were ill suited to a scene she had learned to smile and to consider swiftly to cross the thin ice of an embarrassing situation with light steps quickly she turned to mrs thompsonbellaire who was bowing effusively to a newcomer my word what is bob wharton doing here exclaimed the widow bob wharton where miss wyeths languor vanished electrically she wrenched her attention from the wirehaired fraternity man at her side lorelei felt a sense of great thanksgiving mrs thompsonbellaire beckoned and wharton came forward his eyes fixed gloomily upon lorelei you rascal so this is how you waste your evenings i am surprised but now that weve caught you wont you join us wharton glanced at the four pawns and hesitated its long past nine im afraid the boys will be late for school miss wyeth tittered the sophomore with the bristling pompadour uttered a bark of amusement meeting bobs questioning glance lorelei seconded the invitation with a nod and a quick look of appeal whereupon his demeanor changed and he drew a chair between her and nobel bergman forcing the latter to move his action was pointed almost rude but the girl felt a surge of gratitude sweep over her there was an interlude of idle chatter then the orchestra burst into full clamor once more much to the chagrin of her escort lorelei rose and danced away with the newcomer why the distress signal queried bob mr bergman has been drinking rum is poison he told her with mock indignation he must be a low person hes getting unpleasant shall i take him by the nose and run around the block you can do me a favor he was serious in an instant you were nice to me the other night im sorry to see you with this fellow he forced he deceived me into coming and hes taking advantage of conditions to be nasty bob missed a step then apologized his next words were facetious but his tone was ugly where do you want the remains sent will you wait and see that mine are safely sent home she leaned back and her troubled twilight eyes besought him ill wait never fear ive been looking everywhere for you i wanted to find you and i didnt want to ive been to every cafe in town how in the world did you fall in with the old bellcow and her calf when lorelei had explained he nodded his complete understanding shes just the sort to do a thing like that thompson the first martyr was a decent fellow i believe then she kidnapped bellaire a young wineagent tuberculosis got him and shes been known ever since as the widow t b i suppose youd call her the leading juvenile lorelei felt a great relief at the presence of this far from admirable young man for despite his vicious reputation he seemed clean and wholesome as compared with bergman she was sure moreover that he was trustworthy now that he knew and liked her and she remembered that of all the men she had met since that newspaper scandal had appeared he alone had betrayed no knowledge of it in word or deed on this occasion wharton justified her faith he ignored bergmans scowls he proceeded to monopolize the managers favorite with an arrogance that secretly delighted her he displayed the assurance of one reared to selfish exactions and his rival writhed under it but bergman was slow to admit defeat and when his unspoken threats failed to impress the girl he began to ply wharton with wine bob accepted the challenge blithely and a drinkingbout followed the widow t b and her party looked on with enjoyment dawn was near when the crowd separated and the hostess was driven away leaving lorelei at the door of a taxicab in company with her two admirers the girl bade them each good night but bergman ignored her words and stepping boldly in after her spoke to the driver bob had imbibed with a magnificent disregard of consequences and as a result he was unsteady on his feet his hat was tilted back from his brow his slender stick bent beneath the weight he put upon it naughty naughty nobel he chided come out of that cab you and i journey arm and arm into the purpling east drive on cried bergman forcing lorelei back into her seat as she half rose bob leaned through the open cab window murmuring thickly nobel you are drunk shocked nay grieved as i am at seeing you thus i shall take you home get out will you snapped the manager undertaking to slam the door but wharton was in a declamatory mood and went on swingingly the sky is faintly flushed with pink apollo in his chariot draws nigh the morningglory closes with the sun bergman and if a fairy princess is late she will be shut out and forced to sleep on the petals of a rose my dear nobel dont spoil her beauty sleep im tired of your insolence ill bergman never finished his sentence for in his rage he committed a grave blunder he struck wildly at the flushed face so close to his and the next instant was jerked bodily out of his seat lorelei uttered a cry of fright for the whole side of the cab seemed to go with her employer there was a brief scuffle a whirl of flying arms then bergmans voice rose in a strangely muffled howl followed by nasal curses with a bellow of anguish he suddenly ceased his struggles and lorelei saw that bob was holding him by the nose it happened to be a large unhandsome and fleshy member and securely grasping it bergmans conqueror held him at a painful and humiliating disadvantage bob was panting but he managed to say come we will run for the lady once around the block a muffled shriek of pain was the answer but the street was empty save for some grinning chauffeurs who offered no assistance be a good fellow i insist my dear nobel advance double quick charge the two men moved away haltingly then at a zigzag trot and finally at a slow run they disappeared around the corner bob wharton leading bergman bent double and screaming poisonous oaths drive on quickly lorelei implored but the chauffeur cranked his motor reluctantly craning his neck in an evident desire to see more of this interesting affray his companions were laughing loudly and slapping their thighs despite loreleis hysterically repeated orders he experienced difficulty in starting the machine finally he lifted the hood and fumbled inside a moment passed then another he cranked once more but as the motor was seized with a fit of shuddering the two whitefronted figures turned the upper corner and approached their relative positions were unchanged the block was a short one yet they seemed winded bergman was sobbing now like a woman and he was followed by three curious newsboys bob paused at the startingpoint and wheezed bravo you done noble nobel weve learned some new steps too eh all power of resistance had left the victim who seemed upon the verge of collapse i say weve learned some new steps havent we bergy he tweaked the distorted member in his grasp and bergmans head wagged loosely a late diner cruised uncertainly down the street and sensing the unusual paused rocking in his tracks whash trouble shome fightin goin on he inquired brightly oh please please lorelei cried tremulously dont canter for the kind lady wharton insisted come on he began to lift and lower his shoulders in imitation of a rider bergman capered awkwardly once more fine shouted the drunken spectator clapping his hands loosely thas bully now make im shinglefoot singlefoot certainly hes park gaited mr wharton bob loreleis agonized entreaty brought her admirer to the cab door but he fetched his prisoner in tow let him go or well all be arrested want see im shinglefoot eagerly importuned the stranger ill take off his bridle if you insist but its a grand nose ilove it never was there such a nose bergman with a desperate wrench regained his freedom and staggered away with his face in his hands it actually stretched said bob as he regretfully watched his victim i dare say ill never find another nose like it the appreciative bystander lurched forward and flung an arm over his shoulder then peering in at the girl exclaimed good wasnt it i had a horse once an i know youre aright m frien lets go get another one loreleis cab got under way at last but barely in time for a crowd was assembling she sank back weakly and her last glimpse showed wharton arminarm with the tipsy wayfarer not until she was safely inside her little apartment with the chain on the door did she surrender then she burst into a trembling choking fit of laughter but her estimate of wharton had risen and for the first time he seemed not entirely bad chapter xiii jimmy knight felt his sisters desertion quite as keenly as did his mother and father for his schemes though inchoate were ambitious and his heart was set upon them loreleis obstinacy was exasperating a womans unaccountable freakishness he confided his disappointment to max melcher its pretty tough complained jimmy i had merkle going but she crabbed it then just as that boob wharton was getting daffier over her every day she gets her back up and the whole thing is cold you mean its cold so far as youre concerned melcher judicially amended sure shes sore on me and the whole family then this is just the time to marry her off new york is a mighty lonesome place for a girl like her suppose i take a hand all right will you declare me in certainly melcher eyed his associate coldly theres no certainly about it youd throw your own mother if you got a chance but you cant throw me understand you try a cross and the coldmeat wagon for yours ill have you slabbed at the morgue jimmys reply left no doubt of the genuineness of his fears if not of his intentions strange stories were told in the tenderloin tales of treachery punished and ingratitude revenged jimmy knew several young men who appeared out of the east side at melchers signal they were inconspicuous fellows who bore fanciful dimenovel names dago red izzy the toad jew mike the worm and the rest and no rustlers stronghold of the oldtime western cattle country ever boasted more formidable outlaws than they new york is lawridden therefore corruption reigns vice is capitalized and in consequence there are men who live not only by roguery but by violence they hide in the crannies of the underworld politics is their protection at election times they do service for men high in authority betweenwhiles they thrive on the bickerings and feuds among the despoilers jim knew these gunmen well he had no wish to know them worse i cant promise anything definite when shes sore on me he declared oh yes you can shell marry to please your mother and father and shell fix them up the first thing get them to agree to split their share and ill take a hand if it doesnt go through theres no harm done i dont see how youre going to frame a marriage and yet she wont stand for anything else youll have to help of course and so will your mother ive a hunch that we can handle wharton all right through booze a man can be made to marry anybody if hes drunk enough hes about ready to ask her shes the one to fix she hates men though and that merkle story made her crazy sore eh she talked the dutch route thinks her good name is gone and regards every man as a hyena melcher pondered for several moments i think i know lorelei better than you do he stated deliberately and i believe we can pull this off provided wharton really wants to marry her anyhow hes so rich its worth the odds and shes just the sort to fall for it whats the idea if shes sore about that story in the despatch well pull another one and keep pulling them humph thatll queer wharton not if you get inside his shirt and make him believe theyre lies you and your mother will have to convince her that hes her only out i dont think much of that program jim protested nervously melcher smiled a girl like her can be driven anywhere if shes handled right between you and your mother and lilas you can do it perhaps but i doubt it mas got her afraid of men if we could scare her good if we could tip some john to rough it with her some night she might stampede to the altar thats easy but you cant put a stoporder on a thing like that theres no telling how far the guy might go oh shell take care of herself said jim carelessly shes as strong as a pony if youll take the chance ill stake a shillaber to do it ive got half a dozen highclass fellows working the hotels and lilas knows some of them jim shrugged disgustedly i suppose ill have to repent and be a good boy he snorted and let lorelei weep on my shoulder gee she makes me sick ill take care of my part and maybe we can put it through this is out of my line but they do it abroad so why not here the girls no more than human mr melcher seemed ingenuously pleading for reasonableness if we make good ill hang out a sign max melcher matrimonial agent meanwhile i want it understood with your mother that i share in what comes her way ill fix that promised jim he found it in fact no very difficult task to regain at least a part of his sisters lost esteem though the process took time he went about it with the lazy catlike patience of his kind behaved himself kept his mouth shut and assumed just enough of an injured air to be plausible he enlisted the aid of his mother and of lilas lynn and meanwhile made himself as agreeable as possible to robert wharton melcher was as good as his word and there shortly appeared in the despatch an unpleasant rehash of the former story it was published in connection with the hammon divorce proceedings news of which was exciting comment and it further smirched loreleis reputation wharton ignored it utterly but merkle was prompt in his indignation and sympathy this unshaken confidence in her afforded lorelei far more comfort than bobs unconcerned attitude which might be merely the result of his own lax standards upon the other men she knew the effect of the story was quickly noticeable and she was forced to be on guard at all times several whom she considered sincere admirers proved to be quite the opposite some whom she had counted as friends dropped her entirely others of a different sort undertook to press their acquaintance beyond prudent bounds jim was appropriately indignant but helpless and mrs knight unweariedly blamed everything upon her daughters desertion of the family circle predicting more evil to follow unless lorelei came home at once she also dwelt upon the fact that peter was steadily failing and was in immediate need of both medical and surgical attention the doctor had pronounced sentence prescribing a total change of living and a treatment by foreign specialists in some unaccountable way the story of nobel bergmans humiliation became public and afforded the basis for a newspaper article that brought him to loreleis dressingroom in a fine fury even after she had convinced him of her innocence his resentment was so bitter that she expected her dismissal at any time other press stories followed the girl suddenly found herself notorious scarcely a day passed without some disagreeable mention of her there was published a highly imaginative but circumstantial account of a weakminded youth whom she had driven to suicide utterly false of course but difficult to deal with a sunday special appeared one of those fantastic coloredsupplement nightmares in which she was pictured as a vampire with an angels face it was the hackneyed moth and flame story the page was luridly decorated with a swarm of entomological curiosities winged bipeds supposedly representing her fatuous admirers these fond victims of her enticements appeared to be badly singed and crippled adoree demorest as indignant as lorelei herself declared finally that her friend must be the object of a premeditated attack directed by some strong hand and once this suspicion had entered loreleis mind it took root in spite of its seeming extravagance her good sense argued that she was of too little consequence to warrant such an assault but her relatives seized the suggestion so avidly as to more than half convince her mrs knight attributed this injustice first to bergman then to merkle whom she hated bitterly since her unfortunate attempt at blackmail jim was inclined to agree with her money can do anything he stated gloomily and these big guys amuse themselves by hunting beautiful women its a game with them when one of em takes a fancy to a girl shes a goner it may not be merkle in this case but youre the handsomest woman in new york and ill bet some old spider is weaving his web for you when he has spoiled your good name and ruined your chances of marrying or of making an honest living hell creep out and show himself they frame innocent men for sing sing in this town so why cant they frame a girl for something else lorelei abhorred spiders the picture of some evilminded millionaire enmeshing her in a web of intrigue brought a sickening feeling of helplessness and apprehension of course she thought the idea utterly fantastic but jim and her mother appeared to believe it and her own notions of the citys wickedness were so vivid that anything seemed possible certainly some malign influence seemed to be deliberately at work against her and a thousand disagreeable incidents once she took time to reflect upon them bore out her suspicions she was half minded to run away but dared not mrs knight as always ended her sympathetic reassurances by saying if you were only married my dear that would end all our troubles the climax of these annoyances came one night after a party at which lorelei had been presented to an old friend of miss lynns lilas had introduced the man as one of her girlhood chums and lorelei had tried to be nice to him then in some way he arranged to take her home the memory of that ride was a horror lorelei as jim had said was strong and she fought the ruffians attack with the desperation of utter terror but her shame at the indignity was so keen that she refrained as long as possible from crying for help then hearing her screams the chauffeur stopped his car and made an investigation fortunately for her he was more of a man than most nighthawk drivers and he promptly summoned an officer miss lynns girlhood friend waited for no test of the law he beat a hasty retreat uttering threats that rang in loreleis ears and redoubled her previous fears her wrists and arms bore purple marks her dress was torn her limbs shook from the effects of her struggle and even when she had gained the security of her rooms she was unable to shake off her fright neither could she sleep for menacing forms crouched in the darkness most of the night she walked the floor in a panic she knew now that she was hunted the man had told her so she felt like a deer cowering in a brake with the hounds working close her cover seemed pitifully insecure thus far max melchers campaign had worked even better than he had expected and meanwhile he had employed jim in assiduously cultivating robert wharton and arranging as many meetings as possible between bob and lorelei a short experience had taught jim to avoid his victim in daylight for in bobs sober hours the two did not agree but once mellowed by intoxication wharton became imbued with a carnival spirit and welcomed jim as freely as he welcomed every one incidentally the latter managed to reap a considerable harvest from the association for bob was a habitual gambler and the courteous treatment he received at melchers place seemed to reconcile him to the loss of any amount of money when on the morning after her distressing adventure lorelei sent for her brother and demanded vengeance upon her assailant he decided that it was time to test the issue he pretended of course to be ferociously enraged but on learning over the telephone that the wretch had left the city he declared that there was nothing to be done except perhaps exact an explanation from lilas miss lynn however could offer no excuse she was heartbroken at the occurrence but she was too full of her own troubles to give way to her sympathy for others jarvis hammon it seemed had heard about the party and was furious with her you must expect to meet some muckers in this business she remarked philosophically and youve had so much notoriety my dear that the fellow probably wouldnt believe you were all right jim agreed i guess youll have to forget it sis just dont think about it ill bring wharton around tonight and we four will have supper eh lilass hesitation in accepting this invitation seemed genuine but she acquiesced finally saying with a short laugh all right maybe a little jealousy wont hurt my lord and master hes getting too bossy anyhow when the four set out that night robert wharton was in exceptional spirits and as always devoted himself to lorelei for him life was a joyous adventure he took things as they came and now that he knew the girl for what she was he did not allow himself the slightest liberty he was a fervent suitor to be sure yet he courted her with jests and concealed his ardor behind a playful raillery jim had ordered supper at a popular washington heights inn and thither the quartette were driven in an open car which he hired in the square beside the theater as the glassy expanse of upper broadway unrolled before them bob explained my chauffeur quit to invest his savings in real estate so i sold my machine if hed only listened to my advice and bought stocks with my money i might have made a good commission and afforded to keep a car but nobody deals with the brokers nowadays he sighed gloomily we live lonely lives we are objects of suspicion even the newsboys bite the pennies we give them jim scoffed i suppose you pittsburg plunderers dont know where your next meal is coming from mine is coming from you i hope otherwise ill be a public charge until bankinghours youve been gambling again lorelei accused bob nodded carelessly at their destination they found seats on a balcony overlooking the hudson and jim being in funds played host with a prodigality that mimicked wharton it was a charming place for a supper the wooded bluffs fell away abruptly and a cool breath from the river refreshed the diners the inn itself was just comfortably filled with merrymakers whom the heat had driven from the asphalt canons farther downtown in the distance the jersey lights winked like glittering brilliants sewed into the night other illuminations swam through the mysterious void separating the shores an orchestra played not too loudly and several couples were dancing it had been a stifling week people complained that they could not dine in comfort yet they tangoed and trotted bravely wherever there was music and an open floor contrary to her custom lilas lynn allowed herself free rein and for once drank more than was good for her rejoicing openly in the liberty she had snatched it is a peculiar experience to sit soberly through a meal and see ones companions become intoxicated lorelei had often done so carelessly enough but now her recent worries had not only depressed her but made her pensive and it was in no approving mood that she watched lilas and bob respond to the effect of the wine the whole procedure struck her like her present life as a whole as both inane and wicked and she longed desperately to lay hold of something really decent true and permanent jimmy knights admirable hospitality continued he devoted his entire attention to his guests he made conversation and he led it into the channels he desired it to follow then when the psychological moment had come he acted with the skill of a talleyrand no one but he knew precisely how bobs proposal was couched whence it originated or by what subtlety the victim had been induced to make it as a matter of fact it was no proposal and not even bob himself suspected how his words had been twisted he was just dimly aware of some turn in the conversation when he heard jim exclaim by jove sis bob asks you to marry him in prizering parlance jimmy had feinted his opponent into a lead then taken prompt advantage to counter lorelei awoke to her surroundings with a start sensing the sudden gravity that had fallen upon her three companions what lilas nodded and smiled at the bewildered lover thats the way to put it over bob before witnesses dont joke about such things cried lorelei sharply joke whos joking jim was indignant and glanced appealingly at bob you meant it didnt you sure no joking matter bob declared vaguely i was just saying that this is no life for a fellow to lead batting round the way i do then jim said i mean i said i needed a wife a beautiful wife i never saw a girl beautiful enough to suit me before and he said jims relief came as an explosion there thats english you spoke a mouthful that time bob for she certainly is a beauty bright but i didnt think you had the nerve to ask her if she says yes youll be the luckiest man in new york the whole towns crazy about her well make her say yes lilas added with drunken decision come dear say it she bent a flushed face toward lorelei and laid a loose hand upon her arm well whats your answer bob fixed heavy eyes upon his hearts desire and echoed yes what d you say more than once in his sober moments he had pondered such a query and now that it appeared to have taken shape without conscious effort he was not displeased with himself i say you dont know what youre doing lorelei responded curtly now bob like all men in his condition was quite certain that he was in perfect possession of his faculties and therefore he very naturally resented such an absurd assertion dont you blieve it he protested i know what im doing all right all right a man never speaks his mind until hes ginned lilas giggled righto im not half drunk yet jim urged the suitor on with a nervous laugh at the same time avoiding his sisters eyes shes stalling bob make her answer yes or no forcefully insisted the wooer determined now to show his complete sobriety no jim seized whartons hand and shook it lustily congratulations old man that means yes im her brother and i know why she told father that you were her ideal and pa said hed die happy if you two were married he meant it too hes a mighty sick man lorelei stirred uncomfortably and the faint color in her cheeks faded slowly well talk about it some other time tomorrow please dont tease the poor man any more he didnt know what he was saying and now for heavens sake talk about something else jim leaped to his feet with a grin and a chuckle then drew lilas from her chair saying the lovers are embarrassed and theyre dying to be alone lets leave em to talk it over shes a dear bob and i wish you both joy but dont kiss her here said lilas warningly then with a wave of her hand she turned toward the dancingroom with jim call us when youve fixed the date laughed the latter over his shoulder when he and lilas had danced the encore and returned to the table bob rose unsteadily glass in hand and nodded at them thanks noble comrades he proclaimed shes mine hurrah lilas kissed lorelei effusively jim seized bobs hand crying brother he waved to a waiter and ordered a magnum of champagne bring me a wreath of orange blossoms and a weddingcake too his jubilation attracted the attention of the other diners the occupants of a nearby table began to applaud whereupon bob beamed with delight lorelei was very white now but she was given no chance to speak nor was there anything for her to say torn as she was by conflicting emotions and uncertain of what feeling most strongly possessed her foremost in her thoughts was the realization that she had won the fight she had been reared and trained for that the climax of her worldly hopes had come but with this she also experienced a sickly loathing for herself during bobs protestations of love she had fought a brief but disastrous battle that moral perfidy which had been her teaching since childhood had influenced her decision no more perhaps than her terror at the plight in which her mysterious persecution had left her weighing on the same side with these considerations were also the needs of her family her own bitter distaste for her present life and her desire for peace and outward respectability even at the cost of secret degradation she had decided swiftly recklessly reasoning that this proffered marriage was merely a bargain by which she got more than she gave she had accepted without allowing her better self an opportunity to marshal its protests and having closed her eyes and leaped into the dark it now seemed easier to meet new consequences than to heed those higher feelings that were tardily struggling for expression she did pity wharton however for it seemed to her that he was the injured party when he was himself he was a very decent fellow and it was a contemptible trick thus to cheat him it would have been less ignoble to sell herself outright to a man she detested for the transaction would then have been one of dollars and cents purely a sacrifice prompted by necessity so she reasoned whereas to impose upon the weakness of one she rather liked was not only dishonest but vile but she was in a wanton mood tonight and of late a voice had been desperately urging her to grasp at what she could that she might as long as possible delay her descent into worse conditions she heard lilas inquiring when does the marriage come off right away bob who appeared somewhat dazed by the suddenness and the completeness of his good fortune smiled vacantly any time suits me he said im a happy man little joys are capering all over the place and old dr gloom has packed his grip jim startled them all by saying crisply lets make it tonight i know bob hes not the sort to wait fine never thought of that bob welcomed the suggestion with a delight that drowned loreleis frightened protest then as the idea grew in his mind he joyously appropriated it as his own a mere proposal of marriage and an acceptance were more or less hackneyed the event contained no elements of the spectacular but to follow it promptly with a midnight ceremony impressed him as a grandiose achievement and one calculated to shed luster upon his adventurous career thats my idea of romance thats the way i like to do things he declared well be married soons i pay this check fumbling through his pockets he remembered that his last dollar had gone across melchers gamingtable earlier in the evening and cried in dismay hold on nothing doing in the marriage line after all im bust isnt that a burglars luck and right on the altar steps too ill settle everything all the way through jim offered eagerly bob feebly demurred asserting that his temporary financial condition ruined the whole joke and that he never married without a pocket full of money but as jim insisted and seeing that miss lynn was becoming tearful at the thought of a disappointment he yielded grudgingly but i say where do they keep these weddings he inquired everythings closed now and theres nobody dancing at the city hall is there he appealed helplessly to jim jim rose to the occasion with the same promptitude he had displayed throughout leave it to jimmy the fixer he cried reassuringly marriages arent made in heaven any more thats old stuff theyre made in hoboken while the cab waits get your things on everybody while i telephone he allowed no loitering he waved the girls away sent the waiter scurrying with his bill helped robert secure hat and stick and then dove into a telephonebooth as a woodchuck enters its hole when he had disposed his three charges inside a taxicab he disappeared briefly to return with a basket of champagne upon his arm it is a wise general who provides himself in advance with ammunition it was not late as late hours are computed but the streets were empty of traffic hence the driver made good time and a waiting ferry at the foot of fortysecond street helped to shorten the journey the winebasket was lighter as the machine rushed up the cobbled incline to the crest of the weehawken bluffs bob and lilas were singing as it tore down the boulevard the smooth celerity with which this whole adventure ran its course argued a thorough preparation on jamess part but lorelei was in no condition to analyze on the contrary she was tossed in the vortex of warring impulses more than once she laid her hand upon the cab door feeling that she could not go on with this damnable travesty but necessity urged she was tired disgusted reckless her former arguments continued to prove potent even at the journeys end there was a suspicious lack of delay the vehicle stopped in a narrow business street now dark and dismal its occupants were hurried up a stairway and into a room filled with lawbooks where a sleepy justice of the peace was nodding in a cloud of cigar smoke there followed a noisy shuffling of chairs some mumbled questions and answers the crackle of papers a deal of unintelligible rigamarole then a mans heavy sealring was slipped upon loreleis finger and she knew herself to be mrs robert wharton it was all confused unimpressive unreal she was never able fully to recall the picture of that room or the events that occurred there they formed but a part of the kaleidoscopic jumble of the nights occurrences the wedding party was in the cab once more and it was under way lilas was singing maudlinly lying back in jims arms with her feet projecting through a window the groom was laughing foolishly and pawing at his bride the street lights reeled by in drunken procession now that his work was done jim flung aside his caution and popping the cork of a winebottle drank deeply in disregard of lilass attempts to share the contents he was fiercely elated he imbibed with the eager thirst of a dipsomaniac it was all so like a nightmare that lorelei began to doubt her own sanity once at rest in the dimlit tunnel of the ferryboat however she was brought sharply to herself by hearing her brother exclaim say he hasnt kissed her yet lilas shrieked and bob stiffened himself then slipped an arm around his bride as she shrank away he mumbled angrily here i wont stand for that and crushed her to him he tipped her head back then pressed his lips to hers and she yielded her whole body aquiver with repugnance but it was part of the price she told herself therefore she paid although she was like to faint with the effort she became conscious of a sudden savagery that swept over bob at her first surrender and in revulsion fought herself free from his embrace he followed her his eyes fierce his hot breath heavy with the fumes of wine his clutch hurt her by god he mumbled thickly you are beautiful beautiful and youre mine shes mine eh no foolishness about that is there he appealed to jim as they drew in toward the new york side the chauffeur inquired where to now why drive us jim hesitated there was a silence which lilas broke with a titter the bridegroom joined her in an awkward laugh never thought of that drive to the charlevoix lorelei said sharply no women allowed there its a stag place objected bob of course well take you home its all over now she told him faintly you cant get into no hotel without baggage explained the driver thats right no baggage no money deuce of a way to get married bob turned again to jim who solved the difficulty with a word why youre both going to loreleis place of course then you can make your plans tomorrow the brides halfstrangled protest was lost in a burst of enthusiasm from lilas surest thing you know she cried and well stop in my flat for a farewell bottle ive got a whole case well end the night with another party at jarviss expense hes crazy about marriages anyhow ha but you neednt tell him i was full understand she fell silent suddenly then burst into a loud laugh bah i should worry jim struggled with her as for a second time she endeavored to thrust her silken ankles through the taxi window the ferry drew into its slip the cab motor shivered the metallic rattle of windlass and chain proclaimed the return to manhattan up the deserted avenues the vehicle sped while inside the whitefaced bride cowered with fingers locked and heart sick with dread chapter xiv hitchy koo had gone home when lilas ushered her friends in and snapped on the lights the apartment save for the delirious spaniel was unoccupied she flung down her hat coat and gloves then with the help of jim prepared glasses and a cooler lorelei was restless the thought of more wine more ribaldry revolted her and yet she was grateful for this delay brief though it promised to be any interruption trivial or tragic would be welcome meanwhile her husbands eyes followed her hungrily strangely enough the fears that had driven her to this reckless marriage had dwindled steadily since the final words were spoken and now these apprehensions seemed in no wise so alarming as the consequences of her rash act she cringed at her own thoughts they set her to shivering she stole a glance at her husband and was not reassured for he continued to eye her with a look she did not like she was forced to pledge her own happiness in a glass then in a wild moment of desperation longed to deaden herself with liquor as the others had done jim and lilas were talking loudly when a key grated in the lock the door of the little apartment opened and clicked shut again another instant and jarvis hammon paused on the threshold glowering lilass wineglass shattered upon the floor jarvis you frightened me she cried evening mr hammon bob lurched to his feet upsetting his chair this is a sprise jim had risen likewise but hammon had eyes for no one except lilas ah youre home again finally where have you been he demanded in a voice heavy with anger his hostile tone his threatening attitude brought an uncomfortable silence upon the hearers now jarvis said the bridegroom placatingly steadying himself meanwhile with the aid of the table dont be a grouch everythings all right lilas remained motionless staring defiantly her face had slowly whitened and now its unpleasantness matched that of her elderly admirer hammon dropped his smoldering gaze to the halfempty glasses then raised it scowling at jim humph who is this lilas made her guest known mr knight mr hammon i believe you know miss knight so youre the one hammon showed his teeth in a sardonic smile im the one what inquired jim with a sickly attempt at pleasantry by god what does she see in you hammon measured the young man with contemptuous curiosity dont be an ass jarvis began lilas i she was interrupted roughly thats precisely what i dont intend to be and i dont intend that bob shall be one either he turned to young wharton what are you doing here my boy he asked just stopped in for a minute youll find all the bricabrac in its place now dont get funny im sorry to see you with these grafters hammon indicated jim and lorelei with a nod eh whats that bob stiffened and jim murmured an indignant protest you heard me theyre grafters and youd better cut loose from them wait a minute loreleis my wife s true jarvis wife hammon took a heavy step forward wife hell youre drunk bob praps but were mar so you landed him did you hammon glared at the brother and sister you got him drunk and married him eh and lilas helped you i suppose fine theyre crooks bob and theyve made a fool of you bob checked the speech on loreleis lips with an upraised hand then said slowly with a painful effort to sober himself youre mistaken jarvis shes an honest girl and a good one too good for me you mus pologize the elder man breathed an oath shes a blackmailer and so is this person oh dont look hurt my friend he froze jim with a glare merkle told me how you tried to work your sister off on him when you couldnt make that go you grabbed the next best man eh its true bob shes a stalking horse for her whole damned family bob centered his eyes laboriously upon the speaker then said distinctly weve been good friends jarvis youre a kind of an uncle to me but youre a liar youve lied bout my wife so ispose ive got to lick you with a backward kick he sent his overturned chair flying then made for hammon but jim seized him by the arm lorelei sprang in front of him mr whar bob she cried you mustnt for my sake the three scuffled for an instant until hammon said more quietly i couldnt fight with you bob youre like my own son but youve been sold out and and it looks as if id been sold out too now go home and sleep i didnt come here to quarrel with you i have a matter of my own to settle he laid a hand on bobs shoulder in an effort to pacify him but the young mans indignation flared into life with drunken persistence it was lorelei who at last prevailed upon her husband to leave peaceably and she was about to accompany him when lilas lynn checked her during this angry scene lilas had not risen nor spoken but had sat with her elbows upon the table her chin resting upon her interlocked fingers obviously enjoying it all her eyes were very black and very brilliant against her pallor and she was smiling derisively wait she interposed im not going to stay here with this oldfool hammon grew purple he ground his teeth you shall stay were going to have a talk and settle things once for all see hes going to settle me nonsense i mean hes liable to harm me lilass words were directed as an appeal to the others but her eyes mocked hammon jim dear you wont leave me alone jimmy not relishing in the least this attempt to goad the millionaire remained silent but no words from him were needed weve got to have an understanding right now stormed hammon so clear em out clear em out i say lilas rose swiftly with a complete change of manner she was smiling no longer her face was sinister very well she agreed tonight why not but i want lorelei to stay and hear yes no i dont want her i do lilass bad temper flared up promptly from the hot coals of a spiteful drunken stubbornness shell stay till you go or else ill put you out too i dont trust you she laughed disagreeably then have your way its you i want to talk with anyhow drunk as you are now bob will you say good night he waved the two men from the room and the outer door closed behind them lorelei had little desire to remain as the witness to a distressing scene but she seized upon the delay for even a sordid lovers quarrel was preferable to the caresses of a sodden bridegroom but daylight seemed a long way off she feared bob would not fall asleep during this brief respite now come with me if you please hammon turned in the direction of the library and lilas followed pausing to light a cigarette with a studied indifference that added fuel to his rage lorelei seated herself at the disordered diningtable and stared miserably at the wall well said hammon when he and lilas were alone is this how you live up to your promises how did you know i went out tonight she inquired in her turn i had you watched after what happened last night i was suspicious ive been waiting for hours while you were out with that grafter drinking carousing he bent toward her white with fury but she blew the smoke from her cigarette into his face and he checked himself staring at her strangely for the first time he forgot his own injured feelings and perceived the insolent defiance in her expression it took him aback for in all his aggressive violent life of conquest no one had ever defied him no one had ever insulted him nor deliberately set about rousing his ire but lilas he saw was doing so and with a purpose there was more in this womans bearing he decided than reckless defiance there was an intentional challenge and a threat therefore with an effort he governed himself recoiling in surprise she had seated herself upon the edge of the readingtable one foot swinging idly she watched him with a brooding insolent amusement are you just drunk he said uncertainly or have you completely lost your senses yes im drunk but i know what im doing i went out last night and you warned me i went out again tonight and oh yes i helped marry your friends son to a showgirl what are you going to do about it i why you mustnt talk like that youre not yourself lilas he ran his eyes over the luxurious little room he wiped his face with a shaky hand feeling that it was he who had lost his senses the wine is talking when i asked you to marry me i never dreamed you never dreamed id disobey you eh well i didnt intend to so early she laughed again now i suppose youll drop me what theres nothing else to do if this but i cant imagine what possessed you she eyed him silently with an expression he could not fathom then asked tell me do you really care for me jarvis hammon was a virile headstrong man his world had come suddenly inexplicably to an end his voice was hoarse as he answered do you think id have made a fool of myself if i hadnt do you think id have ruined myself have you ruined yourself she interrupted quickly not quite perhaps but what ive lost what ive sacrificed would have ruined most men my home is gone and my family as you know yes and a good many other things you dont know about financially im not done for thats too bad eh she motioned him to proceed youve cost me dear enough as money goes for youve gotten into my brain somehow i was never foolish over women until i met you but you made me lose my grip on things and indirectly i paid high i didnt care though i was glad i wanted you at any price i tried to change the world around to suit me and now youve spoiled it all that blackmail cost you something didnt it he agreed carelessly and your wifes divorce will cost a lot more wont it youve squandered quite a fortune on me too havent you he was too bewildered by her expression to do more than stare no woman could totally ruin you youre too rich for that but youre hit hard inside so i guess the price is high enough lilas nodded with satisfaction thank god im through and youll never paw me over again i dont understand what are you getting at ill tell you i never intended to marry you jarvis he started as if she had struck him thats what i said she reaffirmed and ill tell you why look at me close he did as she directed but saw nothing his mind being in chaos it had been her intention to call lorelei to witness this dramatic disclosure and thus enhance its effect but in the excitement of the moment she forgot look at me she repeated im lily levinski levinski a jew he exclaimed in naive surprise yes im joe levinskis girl dont you remember many times she had rehearsed this declaration picturing the consternation the dawning horror it would cause and deriving a fierce quivering pleasure from the anticipation but the real effect was disappointing hammon only blinked stupidly repeating a jew it was plain that the name meant nothing she slid down from her perch and approached him crying roughly dont you remember joe levinski hammon shook his head he worked for you in the bessemer plant of the old kingman mill dont you remember there were four thousand men he was killed when the converter dumped you were rushing the work do you remember now her words came swift and shrill hammon started a frown drew his brows together his mind groped back through the years and memory faintly stirred but she gave him no leisure to speak i was waiting outside with his dinnerbucket along with the other women i saw him go i saw you kill him lilas good god are you crazy he burst forth it was murder murder it was you did it you killed him she had dropped her cigarette and it burned a black scar into the rug at their feet hammon retreated a step the girl followed with blazing eyes and words that were hot with hate you spilled that melted steel on him and i saw it all when i grew up i prayed for a chance to get even for his sake and for the sake of the other hunkies you killed you killed my mother too jarvis hammon and made me a a you made me hustle my living in the streets and go through hell to get it be quiet he commanded roughly the things incredible absurd you the daughter of one of my workmen and a jew yes levinski lily levinski and you wanted to marry me she gibed but i fooled you i guess i must be out of my head i never knew the man there were thousands of them accidents were common but you say he gathered his whirling thoughts and strangely enough grew calm you say you prayed for a chance to get even so then youve been humbugging by god i dont believe it its true its true its true shrilled the girl so hysterically that her voice roused lorelei sitting vacanteyed in the room down the hall and brought her to her feet with ears suddenly strained lorelei could hear only a part of the words that followed but the tones of the two voices drew her from her retreat and toward the front of the apartment i went through the gutter i was a girl of the streets lilas was saying oh youre not the first at last i got on the stage and then you came i knew you i thought id die when you first touched me then i figured it all out and you were easy go on he said hoarsely you were a bigger fool than i dreamed but you were old and you didnt know women i knew men though old men especially you took my money you let me support you cried hammon in bitter accusation oh i did more than that i planned everything that has happened to you even that blackmail blackmail he shouted did you was that your he grew suddenly apoplectic his eyes distended and reddened with rage his dismay delighted her certainly she smiled half the money is in my bank at this minute besides all the rest youve given me oh ive got enough to live on without marrying you who do you think put your wife wise and gave her the evidence for her divorce eh think it over as she watched the effect of her words lilas felt that her satisfaction was now complete the mans slack jaw his staring bloodshot eyes convinced her that this moment was all that she had wished it to be youll settle with her for a million and then youll settle with me for this she indicated the elaborate apartment with a gesture you think this ends our affair dont you well it doesnt oh no you cant cast me off ill drag you through the gutter where you sent me and youll either marry me or the courts and the newspapers will get all your letters you cant buy them the letters im rich understand do you remember those letters you were very indiscreet and do you want me to quote them the less said the better perhaps your wife will read them and your daughters jarvis hammon roused himself at last surprise incredulity dismay gave place to fury and as in all primitive natures his wrath took shape as an impulse to destroy youll do that eh his tone his bearing were threatening he advanced as if to seize her in his great hands and only her quickness saved her dont touch me her voice ended in a little shriek as she evaded a second effort to grasp her and placed the table between them what do you mean but it seemed that she had done her work too well for his answer was like the growl of a hungry beast his eyes roved over the table for a weapon and reading his insane purpose she cried again dont do that i warn you the nearest object chanced to be a crystal globe in which was set a tiny french clock one of those library ornaments serving as timepiece and paperweight over this his hand closed he moved toward her put that down she cried he did not pause put it she wrenched at the table drawer and fumbled for something hammon uttered a bellow and leaped at her it was a tiny revolver small enough to fit into a mans vest pocket or a womans purse but its report echoed loudly the noise came like a cannonshot to the girl in the hall outside and brought a cry to her lips lorelei flung herself against the library door what she saw reassured her momentarily for although lilas was at bay against a bookcase hammon was rooted in his tracks a strange almost ludicrous expression of surprise was on his face he was staring down at his breast the revolver lay on the floor between him and lilas lorelei gasped an incoherent question but neither of the two who faced each other appeared to hear it or to notice her presence in the room i told you to keep off lilas chattered her eyes were fixed upon hammon but her outflung arms were pressed against the support at her back as if she felt herself growing weak you did it yourself i warned you the man merely remained motionless staring but there was something shocking in the paralysis that held him and fixed his face in that distorted mold of speechless amazement finally he stirred one hand crept inside his waistcoat then came away red he turned walked to a chair and half fell upon it then he saw loreleis face and her agonized question took shape out of the whirling chaos in his mind wheres bob he said faintly call him please youre hurt ill telephone for a doctor theres one in the house and and the police too lorelei voiced her first impulse then shrilly appealed to lilas to do something but lilas remained petrified in her attitude of retreat from the pallor that was whitening her cheeks now it might have been she who was in danger of death dont telephone said hammon huskily you must do just as i say understand this mustnt get out do you hear im not hurt im all right but fetch bob dont let him call a doctor either until i get home now hurry please lorelei rushed to the outside door restraining with difficulty a wild impulse to run screaming through the hall of the apartment building and so arouse the other tenants but the wounded mans instructions had been terse and forceful therefore she held herself in check fortunately the hallman was not at his post or without doubt he would have read tragedy in her demeanor with skirts gathered high and breath sobbing in her throat the girl fled up the stair to her own door where she clung ringing the bell frantically she could hear bobs her husbands voice inside raised in the best of humor evidently he was telephoning yes two hours ago i tell you with book bell and candle sure im happy couldnt be otherwise for im drunk and married i knew youd be glad what no glad because im married jims footsteps sounded his hand opened the door then his arm flew out to his sisters support as she staggered in sis what the devil he cried aghast at sight of her something dreadful bob continued his cheerful colloquy over the wire just got in from your nightly joyride eh lucky i caught you say here she is now well expect a marble clock with gilt cupids from you merkle want to say hello he lurched aside from the telephone as lorelei snatched the receiver from his hand mr merkle she cried hello yes is that you came merkles steady voice come quick quick whats wrong he demanded with a sharp change of tone has bob no no its mr hammon hes downstairs with lilas and hes hurt shot i im frightened she turned to find bob and jim staring at her come she gasped i think hes dying she led the way swiftly and they followed chapter xv merkle found his chauffeur just closing the garage door and three minutes later his car was sweeping westward through the park like the shadow of some flying bird the vagueness the brevity of the message that had come to him out of the night made it terribly alarming hammon of all men and at this time merkles mind leaped to the consequences of the catastrophe if catastrophe it proved he remembered the issues raised by the sudden death of another associate also a man of standing and the head of a great industrial combination and the avalanche of misfortune that it had started in that case death had been attributed to apoplexy but when the truth leaked out it had created a terrible scandal fortunately that mans business affairs had been well ordered and although his family had been ruined his institutions had managed to survive the blow but jarvis hammons financial interests were in no condition to withstand a shock for a long time many of them had been under fire he had committed his associates to a program of commercial expansion never too secure even under favorable conditions and one moreover which had provoked a tremendous assault from rival steel manufacturers now with hammon himself stricken at the crisis of the struggle there was no telling what results might follow but merkles apprehensions were by no means as purely selfish as his immediate train of thought might imply nor were they by any means confined to the probable cost in dollars and cents of his associates death hammon and he had been friends for many years they shared a mutual respect and affection and although merkle was eminently practical and unemotional he prayed now as best he could that this alarm might be false and that hammon might not be grievously injured meanwhile he wedged himself into the cushions of the reeling car and urged his driver to more speed as the machine drew up to the elegancia jimmy knight leaped to the runningboard and said hurriedly send your driver away merkle did as he was directed realizing his worst fears when he and jim stood alone on the walk he inquired weakly is he dead jim shook his head and merkle saw that he was deeply agitated no but hes got a bullet in his chest did she did that woman merkle laid a bony hand upon jims arm and his fingers clutched like claws i dont know he says he did it himself and she wont talk he declares its only a scratch and wont let us telephone for a doctor or for an ambulance hes afraid of the police and hes waiting for you merkle hurried toward the entrance but jim halted him and by the light from within it was plain that the latter was fairly palsied with fright for gods sake be careful ddont let the hallman suspect lorelei was with em when it happened and if its murder shell be in it understand she says she didnt see it but she was there together the men entered the building and at the first ring were admitted to apartment number one by lorelei herself she led them straight into the library perhaps a quarter of an hour had elapsed since the shooting but jarvis hammon still sat in the big chair he was breathing quietly bob wharton stood beside him john the ironmaster smiled pallidly as his friend came and knelt beside him you got here quickly are you badly hurt jarvis the damned thing is in here somewhere hammon took his hand away from his breast and merkle saw that the fingers were bloody can you get me out of here quietly john merkle rose to his full height his lips writhed back from his teeth harshly he inquired where is that woman shes back yonder in her room bob told him shes ill merkle turned but reading his intent hammon checked him crying in a strong voice none of that john i did it myself it was an accident i dont believe it hammons eyes met those of his accuser the two stared at each other steadily for a moment its true merkle took a step and stooped for the revolver which had lain unnoticed until this moment he held it in his hand this isnt your gun he said quietly no its hers we had a quarrel i she intended to use it on herself we fought for it and in the struggle i set it off the other occupants of the room had listened breathlessly now lorelei stirred and merkle read more than mere bewilderment in her face he opened his lips but the wounded man did not wait for him to speak you must believe me he said earnestly its the truth and i wont have lilas involved weve been a great deal to each other tonight i accused her wrongfully it was all my fault im to blame for everything there was a pause i ruined her you understand i wont allow any scandal now get me out of here as quietly and as quickly as you can im really not hurt much come come theres nobody home except orson and some of the kitchen help and orson is all right the women are gone you know hell get a doctor its a bad business of course but ive thought it all out and you must do exactly as i say the effort of this long speech told on the sufferer sweat beaded his face nevertheless his jaws remained firmly set his glance was purposeful his big hands were gripped tightly over the arms of his chair there was something superb something terrible about his unchanging grimness lorelei spoke timidly for the first time but the law mr merkle the police to hell with the law jim burst out nervously dyou want to go to court dyou want to be up for murder lilas would saddle it onto you to save herself murder echoed bob with a start jove jarvis hammon cried furiously dont be fools theres no murder about it i told you i shot myself accidentally im not going to die you cant you mustnt merkle gravely agreed is your car outside john merkle shook his head he was thinking swiftly i wouldnt dare risk that anyhow the driver is a new man get a cab jim offered in a panic the cabdriver would be sure to ill drive bob volunteered im drunk but ive done it before when i was drunker its an old trick of mine sort of a joke see give me some money a cabbyll do anything for money at this time o night merkle eyed the speaker in momentary doubt then handed him a roll of banknotes its a serious business bob but this is worse and weve no time to lose jarvis cant stay here theres somebody else to consider besides us and miss lynn im thinking about mrs hammon and the girls hammon groaned but we mustnt leave a trail understand now go quickly and do the best you can he followed bob to the door and let him out instead of returning to the library however merkle stepped swiftly down the hall then without knocking opened the door to lilas lynns bedroom and entered lilas was busied at her dressingtable an open travelingbag jammed with articles of wearingapparel stood on the bed at his entrance she uttered a frightened cry and a silver spoon slipped from her nerveless fingers merkle saw also a little open box with several compartments a glass of water the cap of a pearlandgold fountainpen but took scant notice of them being too deeply stirred and too much surprised at her appearance she was no longer the vital dashing girl he had known but a pallid cringing wreck of a woman she shrank back at sight of him babbling unintelligible words and cowering as if expecting a blow did you shoot him he asked grimly shivering choking speechless lilas stared at him her hair was disarranged it hung in wisps and strings over her neck and brow her eyes were dull and distended like those of a person just recovering from the effects of an anesthetic it was doubtful if she even recognized him a repetition of his question brought no reply seizing her roughly he shook her muttering savagely if i were sure by god id strangle you she remained limp her expressionless stare did not change merkle heard a stir behind him and found jimmy knights blanched face peering in at him even fright could not entirely rob the younger mans features of their sly inquisitiveness mr hammons calling you said jim then blinked at the wretchedly disheveled woman here merkle beckoned him with a jerk of his head this girl must get away from here shell ruin everything in her condition try to put her in some kind of shape while lorelei packs her bag we had better get her out of the country if we can jims quick eyes took in the articles on the dressingtable ha dope he exclaimed shes a coker shes filled herself up but say you dont really think she did it do you i dont know what to think its just as bad either way hammons wife and daughters must never know now quick see what you can do with her merkle returned to the library sent lorelei in to her brothers assistance then scanned his friends face anxiously but hammon had not moved the sweat still stood upon his lips and forehead his jaws were still set like stone no scandal john he exclaimed no scandal whatever happens on account of my girls youre worse hit than youll admit merkle said gently no no im all right im not even suffering his pallor belied his words but he went on with even better selfcontrol than merkles theres paper and ink yonder take these notes will you things are in bad shape on the street and you never can tell what may happen so wed better play safe merkle seated himself and took the wounded mans dictation as best he could but his hand shook badly from down the hall came hysterical meanings as lilas lynn struggled in a drugged and drunken breakdown the moments dragged interminably several months before bob wharton during one of his hilarious moments had conceived the brilliant notion of hiring a fourwheeler and driving a convivial party of friends from place to place the success of his exploit had been so gratifying that he had repeated the performance but he was in a far different mood now as he left the elegancia the shock of loreleis announcement the sight of his stricken friend had sobered him considerably yet he was not himself by any means at one moment he saw and reasoned clearly at the next his intoxication benumbed his senses and distorted his mental vision these periods alternated with some regularity as if the winefumes rose in waves but he centered his attention upon the task ahead of him and hastened his sluggish limbs one word murder stuck in his memory it kept repeating itself he remembered jimmy knights sentence directed at lorelei dyou want to go to court lorelei was his wife bob reflected dizzily quite clearly he remembered marrying her it was plainly as necessary therefore to shield her as to remove jarvis hammon and smother this accident or was it an accident after all perhaps lilas had shot the fellow if that were true then she ought to be arrested certainly but somebody had said shell saddle it onto lorelei to save herself after all it couldnt be murder for hadnt hammon said that he shot himself bob decided there could be no such need for haste now that the truth was known so he slackened his zigzag progress if nobody had been murdered why hire a cab at all then he began to run again remembering that hammon needed a doctor this was a fine wedding night indeed for once in his life he wished himself sober broadway that pulsating artery of new york life was still flowing a thin stream of traffic despite the lateness of the hour and bobs mind had become clearer by the time he reached it he signaled to the first horsedrawn vehicle that passed but it was occupied and the driver paid no heed to his call several taxicabs whirled past both north and south bound but he knew better than to hire them so he waited as patiently as he could while those billows of intoxication continued to ebb and flow through his brain robbing him of that careful judgment which he fought to retain at last the clopclopclop of a horses hoofs sounded close by and an unshaven man in an ancient high hat steered a fourwheeler to the curb barking keb keb bob lurched forward and laid a hand upon the drivers knee very man im lookin for the hiccup that followed was by no means intentional yes sir where to sir but bob shook his head vigorously and waved a comprehensive gesture toward the west got a party of my own back yonder everybody soused but me understand im the only sober one so im goin to drive em home see how much how much for what demanded the cabman for the cab one hour ill bring it back nothin doin ill take you where you want to go sorry mus have my little joke no matter what it costs next cabbyll do it nothing except bobs personal appearance prevented the driver from whipping up without more ado but a shiny tophat an immaculate expanse of shirtbosom and silken waistcoat especially when linked with a spendthrift air command respect from the cabdriving brotherhood the night was old and these jokers sometimes pay well the man reflected howd i know youd bring it back he inquired matter of honor with me ill be back in no time will ten dollars be right hop in mister ill drive you an your friends to philadelphy for ten dollars the cabby offered invitingly but bob was obdurate ill make it fifteen and you can lend me your coat and hat well exchange have to or no joke is it a go the offer was tempting but the driver cannily demanded whartons name and address before committing himself the card that bob handed him put an end to the parley he wheeled into the sidestreet and removed his long nickelbuttoned coat and his battered tile taking bobs broadcloth garment and wellblocked hat in return first one o these i ever had on he chuckled but its a bit cool for shirtsleeves aint it mind now if you get lost give the horse his head and hell find the stable but dont run im if you aint back in an hour ill know youve got a puncture ha in the mornin ill take these glad rags to charley voices hotel eh right the charlevoix but ill be back bob drove away with a parting flourish of his whip the elevator was in its place the hallman was dozing with heels propped upon the telephone switchboard when wharton entered the elegancia and rang the bell of lilas lynns apartment but a careless glimpse of the glittering buttons and the rusty hat sent the attendant back into his drowse once bob had gained admittance little time was wasted he and merkle helped hammon to his feet then each took an arm but the exertion told and jarvis hung between them like a drunken man a gray look of death upon his face watch out for the doorman jimmy knight cautioned for the twentieth time make him think youve got a souse arent you coming along asked bob but jim recoiled me no ill stay and help lilas make her getaway merkle nodded agreement dont let her get out of your sight either understand theres a ship sailing in the morning see that shes aboard jarvis hammon spoke i want you all to know that im entirely to blame and that i did this myself lilas is a good girl the words came laboriously but his heavy brows were drawn down his jaw was square i was clumsy i might have killed her but shes all right and ill be all right too when i get a doctor now put that pistol in my pocket john do as i say there now im ready the hallman of the elegancia was somewhat amused at sight of the three figures that emerged from miss lynns apartment and surmised that there had been a gay time within judging from the condition of the old man in the center theatrical people were a giddy lot anyhow since there was no likelihood of a tip from one so deeply in his cups the attendant did not trouble to lend a hand but raised his heels to the switchboard and dozed off again bob wharton mounted the box and drove eastward across broadway through the gloomy block to columbus avenue and on to central park west the clopclopclop of the horses feet echoing lonesomely in the empty street at sixtyseventh street he wheeled into the sunken causeway that links the east and west sides once in the shadows merkle leaned from the door crying softly faster faster bob whipped up the horse cantered the cab reeled and bounced over the cobblestones rocking the wounded man pitifully to john merkle the ride was terrible with a drunkard at the reins and in his own arms a perhaps fatally injured man who despite the tortures of that bumping carriage interspersed his groans with cries of hurry hurry but while merkle was appalled at the situation and its possible consequences he felt nevertheless that hammon had acted in quite the proper way in fact for a manly man there had been no alternative regardless of who had fired the shot it was quite like jarvis to do the generous even the heroic thing when least expected whatever hammon might have been he was in the last analysis all man and merkle admired his courage he was glad that hammon had thought of those three women who bore his name even if they bore him no love and he took courage from his friends plucky selfcontrol perhaps the wound was not serious after all hammons death would mean the ruin of many investors a general crash perhaps even a widespread panic and according to merkles standards these catastrophes bulked bigger than the unhappiness of women the fall of an honored name or death itself when he felt the grateful smoothness of fifth avenue beneath the wheels he leaned forth a second time and warned bob be careful of the watchman in the block the liquor in bob was dying he bent downward to inquire is he all right merkle nodded then withdrew his head the hammon residence has changed owners of late but many people recall its tragic associations and continue to point it out with interest it is a massive pile of gray stone standing just east of fifth avenue and its bronze doors open upon an exclusive wellkept sidestreet as the cab swung in sight of the house wharton seeing a grayclad figure near by drove past without pausing and turned south on madison avenue he made a complete circuit of the block meditating with sobering effect upon the risk he was running his heart was pounding violently when the street unrolled before him for a second time at the farther corner dimly discernible beneath the radiance of a streetlight he made out the watchman now at the end of his patrol the moment was propitious there could be no further delay bob reined in and leaped from his box merkle had the cab door open and was hoisting hammon from his seat have you got the key bob asked swiftly yes help me hes fainted i think they lifted the halfconscious man out then with him between them struggled up the steps but hammons feet dragged he hung very heavy in their arms merkle was not a strong man he was panting and his hands shook as he fumbled with the lock the key escaped him and tinkled upon the stone hurry here comes the watchman bob was gazing over his shoulder at the slowly approaching figure the watchman had his eyes fixed upon the oldfashioned vehicle and its dejected animal wondering no doubt what brought such an antiquated rig into this most exclusive neighborhood he was within a few numbers of the hammon house before merkle solved the mysteries of the lock and the heavy portals swung open in another instant the door had closed noiselessly and the three were shut off from the street by a barricade of iron grillwork and plate glass both bob and merkle were weak from the narrowness of their escape but the way was still barred by another door through which two elaborate hs worked into french lace panels showed pallidly a second but briefer delay and they stood in the gloom of the marble foyer hall then they shuffled across the floor to the great curving stairway both of hammons friends knew the house well and guided only by their sense of touch they labored upward with their burden the place was still tomblike only the faint measured ticking of a clock came to them hammon had assured them that there would be no one in the house except orson his man and some of the kitchen servants the others having followed their mistress to the country nevertheless the rescuers nerves were painfully taut and they tried to go as silently as burglars it was hard awkward work they collided with unseen objects their arms ached with the constant strain when they finally gained the library they were drenched with perspiration merkle switched on the lights they deposited the wounded man on a couch and bent over him hammon was not dead merkle felt his way into the darkened regions at the rear and returned with a glass of spirits under his and bobs ministrations the unconscious man opened his eyes you got me here didnt you he whispered as he took in his surroundings now go everything is all right were not going to leave you merkle said positively no echoed bob ill wake up orson while john telephones the doctor but hammon forbade bobs movement with a frown it was plain that despite his weakness his mind remained clear listen to me he ordered prop me up put me in that chair im choking they did as he directed thats better now you mustnt be seen here either of you we cant explain he checked merkle i know best go home its only two blocks ill telephone youll ring for orson quick hammon nodded rotten way to leave a man bob mumbled id rather stick it out and face the music go go youre wasting time hammons brow was wrinkled with pain and anger youve been good now hurry merkles thin face was marked with deep feeling yes he agreed theres nothing else for us to do but tell orson to phone me quick ill be back here in five minutes then he and bob stole out of the house as quietly as they had stolen in they got into the cab and drove away without exciting suspicion merkle alighted two blocks up the avenue and sped to his own house bob turned his jaded nag westward through the sunken road that led toward the elegancia and lorelei the owner of the equipage was waiting patiently and there still lacked something of the allotted hour when the exchanged garments had been transferred to their respective owners bob walked toward the elegancia with a feeling of extreme fatigue in his limbs for the effort to conquer his intoxication had left him weak he dimly realized also that he was still far from sober there was no answer when he rang at lilas lynns apartment the hallboy volunteered the information that the occupant had just gone out with a gentleman miss knight yes she was upstairs he supposed but when bob undertook to go up there was prompt objection the attendant would not hear to such a thing until he had first called miss knight even loreleis halting assurance that the gentleman was indeed her husband did not wholly satisfy and it was with a suspicious mien that the man finally gave way bob was surprised at his wifes apparent selfcontrol when she let him in except for the slim hand pressed to her bosom and the anxiety lurking in her deep blue eyes she might have just come from the theater those eyes he noted were very dark almost black under this emotional stress they questioned him mutely we got him home all right he told her when they stood facing each other in the tiny livingroom will he live oh yes he says hes not badly hurt and merkle agrees lord wed never left him alone if wed thought im glad when the telephone rang i thought it was the police there there he said comfortingly seeing her tremble i wont let anybody hurt you i was terribly drunk things are swimming yet but all the way across town i couldnt think of anything anybody except you and what it would mean to you if it got out it will get out im sure such things always do he eyed her gravely kindly with an expression she had never seen upon his face then well face it together he said after a moment her glance drooped a faint color tinged her cheeks i wouldnt dare face it alone i couldnt but youre tired sick he nodded you must lie down and sleep and get to be yourself again we cant tell what may happen now at any moment its the reaction i suppose im all in and you she shook her head i couldnt sleep if i tried i feel as if id never be able to sleep again i ill sit and watch and wait chapter xvi that afternoon mrs knight in a great flutter of excitement arrived with jim at the elegancia embracing her daughter in tremulous almost tearful delight she burst forth you dear you darling jim came home not an hour ago and told me everything i thought i should swoon told you everything lorelei flashed a glance at her brother who made a quick sign of reassurance yes peter is so happy hes better already and wants to meet robert you know neither of us have seen our new son thats what hes going to be too a real son like jim but i think you might have telephoned she checked her exuberance to inquire in a stage whisper that carried through the flat is the dear boy here sure wheres brother bob echoed jim he went home to change his clothes and to telegraph his people but how strange how terrible you look jim volunteered an explanation remember ma we were up all night and it was some wedding party pipe me i look like a wreck on the erie and to think that while lilas was out enjoying herself with you poor mr hammon was lying with a bullet in him i never had such a shock as when i read the extras youve seen them lorelei nodded indeed the room was strewn with newspapers they say it was accidental but pshaw mrs knight shrugged knowingly dont you think it was my dear think of his family troubles and financial worries thats the general talk jim agreed things were boiling when the market closed all of his stocks are away off well i dont blame him yes and hed quarreled with lilas too thats why she sailed for europe this morning mrs knights hard eyes glittered her sharp nose seemed to lengthen ill warrant she knows a lot more than shell tell id like to question her and i will when lorelei youre as white as a sheet are you ill no only everything came at once it was a long night jim sighed wearily deliver me from hysterical fluffs like lilas id rather load a cargo of boaconstrictors than start her for the briny what with loreleis good fortune and lilass catastrophe mrs knight was wellnigh delirious it was not often that she could roll two such delicious morsels under her tongue and she patently gloried in the opportunity for gossip she ended a period of chatter by saying it just goes to show that a girl must be careful if lilas had behaved herself shed have been married and rich like you oh i cant believe it has come true think of it yourself dearie i im nearly out of my head she dabbed at her moistening eyes becoming more and more excited as she dwelt upon the familys sudden rise to affluence she was still rejoicing garrulously when lorelei burst into one of her rare passions of weeping and buried her face in her hands child alive cried her astonished mother what ails you instantly jims suspicions caught fire say has bob welched he demanded harshly the amber head shook in negation isnt he nice to you quavered mrs knight yes but im sorry i did it he was drinking he didnt know what he was doing hush mrs knight cast a fearful glance over her shoulder it was all straight and aboveboard and he knew perfectly well what he was about jim would swear to it lorelei lifted a tragic tearstained face i ought to be hanged she said jim laughed with relief theres gratitude for you if i had your share of the wharton coin id let em hang me for a while there there mrs knight chided her daughter youre worn out and no wonder but everything is lovely im dying to meet roberts mother now that we have so much in common im sure ill like her although i cant see what pleasure she can get from giving away money why shes simply robbing bobs family when she throws her thousands to charity and i intend to tell her so too in a nice way the first chance i get of course youll quit the revue tonight thatll be a relief wont it has robert given you anything yet they say hes terribly generous i cant quit right away now that lilas has left but i dare say bob wont let me work very long indeed i should hope not mrs knights chin lifted if i were you id never go near bergmans theater again let him sue you jim eyed his sister admiringly youre a dandy crier sis he observed your nose doesnt swell and your eyes dont pop out you could sob your way right into the wharton family if you tried he lit a cigar sighed gratefully and dragonlike emitted twin columns of smoke from his nostrils hannibal wharton is worth twenty millions easy he went on complacently maybe forty we didnt do so badly for country yaps did we it feels mighty good to be in the kalepatch no more small change for yours truly but say it was a battle mrs knight ran down slowly like a clock this sudden and unexpected triumph had gone to her head she could talk only of dollars and cents in her fancy she juggled huge sums of money she drew extravagant pictures of a glittering future in which the whole family figured throughout this sordid chatter with its avaricious gloatings and endless repetitions lorelei sat listless her thoughts far from pleasant it had required this final touch to make her fully feel her wretchedly false position as mother and son were leaving jim managed to get a word in private with his sister dont weaken he cautioned her lynns gone and its all over weve got the whiphand on all of em hammon merkle bob lilaseverybody weve got em all understand weve landed big when she was alone lorelei gave a sigh of relief which changed to a sob as the sense of her helplessness surged over her again she was worn out and yet she could not rest she longed for the open air and yet she dreaded to show herself abroad fearing that some one would read her secret thoughts of the evening performance at the theater filled her with unfamiliar misgivings she wondered if she could appear in public without breaking down she knew well enough who had fired that shot would others fail to suspect the secrecy in which the whole affair was veiled seemed terribly artificial it was impossible that such a barefaced conspiracy to suppress the truth could long remain undiscovered and if hammon died what then he was reported to be very low suppose he became delirious and betrayed himself she would be involved and merkle and bob every clang of the elevator gate every footfall outside her door alarmed her as with most women her knowledge of the law was negligible her conception of its workings was grotesquely childlike yet after all the incidents of the shooting affected her less than the amazing change in her own fortunes she was a wife the word sounded shockingly unreal this was no longer her home her sanctuary another had equal share in it she no longer belonged to herself another possessed her and worst of all that other was practically a stranger she felt her cheeks burn she was suffocated by a sense of shame from which there was no escape in one night she had passed the turningpoint from girlhood to womanhood from womanhood to wifehood and there had been no love no faith no glamour even in the act she had deliberately sold herself she wearily wondered where the new road led surely not to happiness toward evening adoree demorest telephoned and with many anticipatory exclamations of pleasure invited lorelei to dine i cant answered lorelei faintly bother your engagements miss demorests disappointment was keen i cant even explain unless youll come here to dinner lorelei decided swiftly she dreaded to be alone with bob her constraint in his presence was painful and he also before going out had appeared very ill at ease he had not even made plans for the evening meal in view of all this she answered yes to dinner please please come what is the matter ill tell you later miss demorest yielded not without some regret i was going to cook the supper myself and im all done up like a sore foot but ill remove the bandages i suppose you know the potatoes are peeled and the salad will spoil unless i bring it then bring it and hurry lorelei was not quite sure that bob would consent to dine in the modest little home but under the circumstances idleness was maddening so she fell to work it seemed very odd when she thought of it for the bride of a millionaire to prepare a meal with her own hands but anything was preferable to dining out in her present frame of mind this was very different from what she had expected but everything was different once the marriage had become known to bobs people and he had thoroughly sobered down once she had withdrawn from the cast of the revue their real life would begin bob was pale and a bit unsteady when he arrived but lorelei saw that he suffered only from the effects of his previous debauch he was extremely selfconscious and uneasy in her presence though he kissed her with a brave show of confidence i galloped into the bank just as they slammed the doors he explained but my bookkeeping is rotten yes my accounts somehow never tally with theirs and they always explain very patiently its a patient bank that they use addingmachines beastly nuisance this constant figuring especially when you never hit the right answer but a man cant expect to compete with one of those mechanical contraptions are you trying to tell me that you have overdrawn exactly but i drew against the old gentleman as usual so on with the dance whats the er idea of the apron its nearly dinnertime bobs eyes opened with surprise why were going to delmonicos id rather do this if you dont mind she eyed him appealingly i dont feel equal to going out tonight im afraid dont you keep a maid he inquired where would i keep her in the icebox lorelei smiled faintly his glance brightened with admiration well you look stunning in that getup and id hate to see you change it do you mean to say you can cook not well but i can fry almost anything mother has a maid i couldnt afford two i love fried things he assured her with a twinkle and to think youre going to cook for me thats an experience for both of us lets have some fried roast beef and fried corn on the cob with fried salad and cheese dont tease she begged uncertainly i hardly know what im doing and i thought this would keep me busy until theatertime he extended a hand timidly and patted her arm saying with unexpected gentleness please dont worry i supposed wed dine in public but if you like this better so do i when we pull ourselves together and get settled a bit well make our plans for the future at present im still in a daze it was a terrible night for all of us when i think of it im sure it must have been a dream i saw merkle hes perfectly cold and matteroffact about it all he got back to hammons house ahead of the doctor and nobody suspects the truth but the street is in chaos and all of hammons companies are feeling the strain the shorts are running to cover and theres a report that it was suicide which makes things worse it couldnt have happened at a more inopportune time either dads on his way from pittsburg to help save merkles bank shouldnt you have been at business on such a day bob shrugged carelessly im only a joke broker the governor thinks a firmname looks well on my cards i hope he doesnt lose more than a million in this flurry it wont improve his disposition but wait till he learns ive married a girl who can fry things by the way bob paused i invited a friend to dine with us tonight lorelei was less dismayed than he had expected so have i she said i thought it might be pleasanter for you he explained a bit awkwardly inasmuch as were not very well acquainted i saw before i went out that you were er embarrassed and and he flushed boyishly scarcely conscious of the delicacy that had prompted his action anyhow hes gone home to put on a clean sweater you dont mean you asked campbell pope yes i met him and he looked hungry hes coming here at six for almost the first time in bobs society lorelei laughed out clearly and i asked adoree demorest she said bob grinned and then laughed with her fine he cried both members of this club really this ought to make the best finish fight seen in new york for many a day i dont care lorelei said stubbornly adoree is the most misjudged person in america and pope ought to know the truth as she flitted back and forth preparing dinner bob kept up a ceaseless chatter that did much to lessen their constraint she was conscious through it all of his admiration but it still seemed to be the admiration of a stranger not of a husband never for one moment had either of them felt the binding force of their new relationship never had they been farther apart than now adorees surprise at finding robert wharton in her friends apartment was intense and when she learned the truth she was for once in her life speechless she could only stare from one to the other wavering between consternation and delight finally she sat down limply i id have brought a present if id known she managed to say are you going to wish us luck bob inquired luck youve both got it shes the best girl in the world and youre adoree hesitated and continued to stare roundeyed i didnt think youd i didnt think shed i dont know what i thought or didnt think but jimminy married when lorelei led her into the bedroom to lay off her wraps the thunderstruck young woman had more nearly recovered herself why hes worth millions she exclaimed in a whisper billions i dont know how to talk to him or you for that matter shall i call you my lady or your honor or you knew how to talk to him that night of the supper and to think you married him after what hap im going to slap the very first millionaire i meet maybe hell propose to me she was suddenly dismayed why i cant afford to buy you a weddinggift youll expect a diamond sunburst or a set of seaotter i didnt dress for dinner either i suppose i should have worn the crown jools youre going to wear an apron and help me scorch the dinner lorelei laughed you cooking with a billionaire husband adoree gasped am i dreaming why dont you dine aboard his yacht or buy the plaza and have dinner served in the lobby you cooking why youre going to have automobiles to match your dresses and chateaux in france and servants and stables of poloponies and a long island estate and a huntinglodge and and thousands of gowns and a maid to put em on shell do it too when youre not looking miss demorest paused dazzled by the splendor of her own imaginings you cooking stop fidgeting and let me kiss you there as lorelei explained the reasons for tonights program adoree saw for the first time the weariness in her friends eyes the pallor of her cheeks the tremulous droop of her lower lip seizing lorelei by the shoulders she held her off as the target for a searching gaze tell me did they make you marry him she inquired fiercely it was plain to whom she referred no whew im glad to hear that you love him dont you the answer came readily enough and the blue eyes did not flinch but the smile was a trifle fixed and the cheeks remained colorless why of course hes very nice lorelei miss demorests fingers tightened her voice was tragic but she had no chance to say more for bob called just then from the livingroom hurry back girls theres something burning and i cant find the emergency brake when adoree finally came forth in one of loreleis aprons really a fetching garment more like a house dress than an apron bob told her whom they were expecting as the other guest she paused with a breadknife upraised that viper she cried campbell isnt a viper hes a cricket a dramatic cricket declared bob adoree began to undo the buttons at her back but bob seized her hands let go ill blow up if i see that creature she exclaimed in a kind of subdued shout argument proved vain until lorelei told her firmly you owe it to yourself dear and we wont let you go the dancer ceased her struggles her brows puckered perhaps i do owe it to myself as you say anyhow i havent taken a human life yet and this is my chance dont kill him just stay and spoil his dinner lorelei urged determination gleamed in miss demorests countenance ill do ithes spoiled many a dinner for me but give me room dont touch me im distilling poison like a cobra she seized the gleaming breadknife and brandished it when the crisis comes stand back seriously now lorelei has told me everything and i want campbell to acknowledge his mistake said bob the public has swallowed that royalty hoax but theres no use deceiving him despite her show of bravery adoree was panicstricken when the bell rang and bob went to the door to explain the change of plan and invite pope in the latter could be heard saying thats fine me for a homecooked dinner heres an unabridged cluster of orchids for mrs wharton too if id had time id have brought you a hanginglamp or a plush album decorated with seashells he entered the livingroom with a hand extended and a smile upon his lips then halted as if frozen by the time he had been introduced to adoree he had burst into a gentle perspiration certainly the personal appearance of the notorious dancer was sufficiently unexpected to shock him she might have been anything rather than a kings favorite she looked far more like a prim little housewife as she helped lorelei with her homely tasks and the incongruity affected pope painfully with involuntary suspicion he avoided her after his first stiff greeting but his eyes followed her furtively and he wandered slightly in his attention to bobs chatter as for miss demorest she took a grim delight in his discomfort and prepared to blast him with sarcasm to wither him with her contempt when the moment came meanwhile she listened as the two men talked turning up her nose when pope scored broadway with his usual bitterness he thinks thats smart she reflected but she too detested the great trite way and his words expressed her own distaste so aptly that she could think of no argument sufficiently biting to confound him she deliberately framed a stinging reference to his pose in the matter of dress though in frankness she had to admit that he wore his gray sweater vest with an air of genuine comfort and unconsciousness then she remembered barely in time that her own style in garments both on and off the stage was far more startling than his and decided that she would merely be laying herself open to a disastrous counterattack if she hurled her sarcasm in that direction therefore she sought another opening she had made up her mind to begin humbling his conceit by voicing her contemptuous regard for newspaper men in general when he once more forestalled her by giving crisp expression to the very sentiments she was rehearsing of course it was all affectation like his slovenly disregard of fashion and yet she was interested to hear him tell bob i dont like the business never have every time i get some money ahead i quit it and try something else writing isnt a mans exercise anyhow and journalism is just a form of bodysnatching the average reporter is a ghoul you dont do reporting said bob no i dont but thats all a dramatic review ought to be a news story why not have social critics to comment on society entertainments or financial critics to roast unhealthy commercial enterprises and advertise safe ones how long dyou think wall street would stand for that why dont the papers hire drygoods experts to prowl through the department stores publishing the cost prices of merchandise and warning the public against bargain sales thats what we do we ridicule and warn and criticize but we never build up the theatrical business is the only one that permits outside interference as if the public couldnt tell a good play from a poor one it wouldnt be so bad if we were always honest but were not we have to be smart to hold our jobs were like a patent dandruff cure we dont cure but we sting and the public thinks were beneficial notwithstanding his garrulity pope was noticeably ill at ease he was conscious of miss demorests hostile eyes and the pointed manner in which she ignored his presence was disquieting he had the feeling that she was carefully measuring him and preparing herself to take revenge in some characteristic feminine manner knowing extremely little of women he could not imagine what form that revenge would assume and the uncertainty annoyed him the dinner seemed slow in coming conversation dragged and rising he began to wander nervously about canvassing his mind for some excuse to leave bob appeared to enjoy his lack of repose and offered no relief at last pope turned to the piano and fluttered through the stack of sheetmusic he found there do you play inquired bob yes why you look as if you did youre kind of badly nourished know any ragtime pope shuddered i do not too bad i was going to ask you to stir up the ivories nobody likes good music any more growled the critic seating himself upon the bench his sensitive fingers idly rippled the length of the keyboard and a flood of melody filled the room say you do know your way around dont you cant you pick out here comes my daddy now with one finger the musician groaned what a pity after a moment he murmured i improvise a good deal the instrument perhaps for the first time in its life began to vibrate and ring to something besides the claptrap music of the day once he had found a means of occupying himself pope surrendered to his impulse and in a measure forgot his surroundings a short time later lorelei turned from the kitchenette to find adoree demorest poised a saladbowl in one hand a wooden spoon gripped in the other on her face a rapt expression of beatitude have you rubbed the dish with garlic inquired lorelei adoree roused herself slowly lordy she whispered id give both legs to the knee and one eye if i could play like that the mean little shrimp the embers of her resentment were still glowing when the four finally seated themselves at the table a furtive glance in popes direction showed that he was studiously avoiding her eyes she prepared once more to begin the process of flaying him youve been away for some time havent you bob was asking pope nodded i hate new york i went as far away as i could get and i managed to return just two jumps ahead of the sheriff it will take me six months to pay my debts im a grand little business man what was it this time mining no poultry adoree pricked up her ears you went west eh pursued bob no east long island did you know there are parts of the island that are practically unexplored by civilized man well there are theyre as remote from the influence of new york as the heart of new guinea popes thin lips parted in a smile the natives are all foreigners too there are portuguese picklepickers and hairyhanded hollanders who live with their heads lower than their knees and weedpulling wops who skulk in patches of cauliflower and lettuce but as for american settlers there aint none adoree complacently felt that she had the critic talking against time and the consciousness of her disturbing over him gratified her intensely their language is a sort of reverse english pope went on and its a hard country to explore because of the dialects some of the people are flesheaters but the price of poultry is so high and the freight on eggs is so low that most of them are vegetarians thats what got me started in the first place i saw a great opportunity to make money so i found a farm on a lake bought it and went to raising ducks ducks breathlessly exclaimed miss demorest but her interruption went unnoticed campbell popes features shone with the gentle light of a pleasurable remembrance it was lovely and quiet out there just like saskatchewan or the soudan sometimes i fancied i must be close to the fringe of civilization with the life of the outer world pulsing near at hand for i could hear whispers of it but i soon got over that idea the local inhabitants were shy but friendly they did me no harm but it was no place for ducks they swam all over the pond and spent so much time catching bugs on the bottom that they had no leisure for family obligations on land this gloomy recital met with an interest that prompted him to continue whimsically there was no home life among those ducks none whatever but they could swim nearly as well as miss kellerman they never took cramps either although they appeared to have chronic bronchitis and they must have learned to breathe through their tails because they stood on their heads for hours at a time all i could see was acres of white tails sticking up like patches of cubist pondlilies they swam all their fat off and i had the pond dredged and never found an egg miss demorest giggled audibly she had lost all interest in her food she was tingling with excitement why didnt you fence them in she asked pope eyed her for a fleeting instant then his gaze wavered i fenced in the whole pond to begin with it nearly broke me a duck shouldnt have much water what kind were they plymouth rocks or holsteins or jersey lilies anyhow they were white white pekins the critic frowned argumentatively what is a duck for if he isnt to swim what is his object we had six on my fathers farm and they swam all the time of course six isnt many but naturally they didnt do well but they did do well and quite naturally too they did beautifully in fact they never had an ache or a pain what do you know about ducks adoree answered in a tone of calm and utter certainty i know everything ive read hundreds maybe thousands of duck books i have a whole library of them a duck library i thought so but did you ever own a library of ducks theres a difference a man doesnt have to know anything to write a book ive done it myself practical experience is the thing did you keep cows for them pope stared at his inquisitor for a moment then he explained with patient politeness these were not carnivorous ducks they ate bugs and fish and corn corn adoree was shocked incredulous her eyes glittered with the fire of fanaticism she no longer saw in this man an enemy a vile creature branded with the mark of the beast but a fellowenthusiast a surprisingly ignorant one to be sure but an enthusiast for all that and therefore bound to her by unbreakable bonds live steam would have been more easily confined than the vast fund of technical knowledge with which she was crammed you should have fed soft food and sour milk she began buttermilk would have been all right and in that way your cows would have been selfsupporting you need a good pasture with a duckfarm when i was in germany i saw the most wonderful incubator a child could operate it id like to show you some brooderhouse plans i had drawn over there you see you made your first mistake in choosing freshwater if i had a good location near saltwater not too near and proper surroundings id show you something about ducks id start with a thousand thats plenty then kill for the market as they quit laying and mix the stock right and in three years bob wharton signaled frantically to his wife but there was no stopping the discussion that had begun to rage back and forth it lasted until the conclusion of the meal and it was only with an effort that adoree tore herself away she was in her element and in a little time had won the critics undivided attention he listened with absorption he even made occasional notes as the two girls dressed hurriedly for the theater adored confessed golly im glad i stayed hes not bright hes perfectly silly about some things and yet hes the most interesting talker i ever heard and cant he play a piano chapter xvii hannibal wharton arrived in new york at five oclock and went directly to merkles bank at eight oclock jarvis hammon died during the afternoon and evening other financiers summoned hurriedly from new england shores and adirondack camps were busied in preparations for the struggle they expected on the morrow during the closing hours of the market prices had slumped to an alarming degree a terrific raid on metal stocks had begun and conditions were ripe for a panic hammon had bulked large in the steel world and his position in circles of high finance had become prominent but alive he could never have worked onehalf the havoc caused by his sudden death that persistent rumor of suicide argued in the public mind the existence of serious money troubles and gave significance to the rumor that for some time past had disturbed the street hammons enemies summoned their forces for a crushing assault in this emergency bobs father found himself the real head of those vast enterprises in which he had been an associate and until a late hour that night he was forced to remain in consultation with men who came and went with consternation written upon their faces the amazing transformation which followed the birth of the giant steel trust had raised many men from welltodo obscurity into prominence and undreamedof wealth since then the older members of the original clique had withdrawn one by one from active affairs and of the younger men only wharton and hammon had remained equally these two had figured in what was perhaps the most remarkable chapter of american financial history both had been vigorous selfmade practical men but the outcome had affected them quite differently riches had turned jarvis hammons mind into new channels they had opened strange pathways and projected him into a life foreign to his early teachings his duties had kept him in new york while whartons had held him in his old home hammon had become a great financier wharton had remained the practical operating expert and owing to the exactions of his position he had become linked more closely than ever to business detail at the same time he had become more and more unapproachable unlimited power had forced him into the peculiar isolation of a chief executive he had grown hard suspicious arbitrary even to his son he had been for years a remote being it was not until the last conference had broken up not until the last forces had been disposed for the coming battle that he spoke to merkle of bobs marriage merkle told him what he knew and the old man listened silently then he drove to the elegancia bob and lorelei had just returned from the theater much be it said against the bridegrooms wishes bob had been eager to begin the celebration of his marriage in a fitting manner and it had required the shock of hammons death added to loreleis entreaties to dissuade him from a night of hilarity he was flushed with drink and in consequence more than a little resentful when she insisted upon spending another night in the modest little home say im not used to this kind of a place he argued im not a cavedweller its a lovely flat for a murder but its no place to live and besides it doesnt look right for me tocome to your house when all the hotels are gasping for my patronage i never heard of such a thing makes me feel like a rummy dont be silly she told him we acted on impulse we cant change everything at a moments notice i couldnt bear a hotel just yet but people take trips when they get married that is different are you in a position to take me away tonight with an eloquent gesture bob turned his trousers pockets wrong side out not tonight perhaps but tomorrow i cant quit the show without two weeks notice two weeks he was aghast two minutes two seconds i wont have you dodging around stagedoors tomorrow youll breeze in and tell my old friend regan youve quit just say i quit thats notice enough bergman wont let me go it wouldnt be right to ask him but bob was insistent it pains me to pull the props out from under the profession and leave the drama flat but matrimony was a successful institution before the circuit theater was built and a husband has rights i intend to cure you of the work habit you must learn to scorn it look at me im an example of the unearned increment well kiss this dinky flat a fond farewell its impossible really i refuse to share such a dark secret with you tomorrow we leave it for the third and last time what dyou say to the sunny side of the ritz until we decide where we want to travel you dont want to leave new york you know she told him soberly youre offering to go because you think its the proper thing to do and because you dont know what else to suggest but i have to work ah the family eh well retire em and put an end to this child labor now as for the trip weve got to do something we cant just live where do you have your clothes made lorelei named several tailors of whom bob had seldom heard that wont do he said positively ill get a list of the smartest shops from mrs thompsonbellaire and i want you to buy enough gowns to last till we reach paris a couple dozen will do then well fit out properly ill bet you never went shopping really shopping did you and bought everything you saw of course not i never dreamed of such a spree well that will be lesson number two can you ride not well must know how to ride thats number three and very important ill get you some horses when we return well spend our mornings at durlands for a while and ill teach you to play polo too all the girls are going in for it lately youll need an electric motor i suppose for calling and shopping theyre making some stunning bodies in that wicker effect now whats your favorite jewel i havent had time to get your ring yet this whole day was upside down everything had closed before i opened up but tomorrow well paw through tiffanys stock and you can choose what you like im going to select a blackopal set for you theyre the newest thing and the price is scandalous he paused eying her curiously then with a change of tone inquired say are you in mourning for somebody why no you dont seem to care for all these things ive bought lorelei laughed spontaneously for the first time during the long day of course i care but where is the money coming from you havent a dollar my dear so long as the western union lasts youll never see a wrinkle on my brow well begin by destroying everything you own hats gowns jewelry then well start at the beginning just then the apartment bell rang bob went to the door he returned with his father at his heels mr wharton tramped in grimly nodded at his daughterinlaw who had risen at the first sound of his voice then ran his eyes swiftly over the surroundings i hear youve made a fool of yourself again he began showing his teeth in a faint smile have you given up your apartment at the charlevoix not yet said bob were considering a suite at the ritz for a few days indeed youre going back to the charlevoix tonight lorelei started she had expected opposition but was unprepared for anything so blunt and businesslike i think you and bob can talk more freely if i leave you alone she said hannibal wharton replied shortly no dont leave ill talk freer with you here it appeared however that robert stood in no awe of his fathers anger he said lightly they never come back dad im a regular married man lorelei is my royal consort my yokemate my rib well have to scratch the charlevoix this levity left the caller unmoved to lorelei he explained i want no notoriety so all we need talk about is terms youll fare better by dealing directly with me than through lawyers ill fight a lawsuit so lets get down to business you should realize however that these settlements are never as large as theyre advertised ill pay you ten thousand dollars and stand the costs of the divorce proceedings you are making a mistake she told him quietly i expected you to refuse but ten thousand dollars is better than nothing talk it over with your people now bob come with me where demanded his son anywhere you cant stay here youre infallible in business dad bob protested but where sentiment is concerned youre a terrible failure not at all not at all mr wharton exclaimed irritably i know real sentiment when i see it and ill foot the bill for this counterfeit but im too tired to argue lorelei was standing very white and still now she said dont you think youd better go the elder man laid aside his hat and gloves then spoke with snarling deliberation ill go when i choose no high and mighty airs with me if you please after a curious scrutiny of them both he asked his son you dont really imagine that she married you for anything except your money do you i flattered myself bob began stiffly bah youre drunk moderately perhaps or let us say that i am in an unnaturally argumentative mood i take issue with you you see dad ive been crazy about lorelei ever since i first saw her and to be sure thats quite natural but why in hell did you marry her that wasnt necessary was it lorelei uttered a sharp cry bob rose his eyes were bright and hard mr wharton merely arched his shaggy brows inquiring quickly of the bride whats the matter i state the case correctly do i not no gasped lorelei lets talk plainly thats a bit too plain even from you dad bob cried angrily its time for plain speaking you got drunk and she trapped you im here to get you out of the trap its a matter of money isnt it well then dont lets allow sentiment to creep in addressing himself to lorelei he said you probably counted on five times the sum i offer but ten thousand dollars will buy a lot of clothes and the publicity wont hurt you professionally itll do you good you might even spend the winter in europe and catch another victim i believe thats the amount merkle offered you isnt it merkle what are you talking about bob demanded did mr merkle tell you how and why he came to make that offer asked lorelei indignantly no but he offered it did he not yes and i refused it ask him why we dont seem to be getting along very well bob interposed lorelie is my wife and your daughterinlaw whats more i love her so i guess that ends the reno chatter he crossed to loreleis side and encircled her with his arm theres no pricetag on this marriage dad and youll regret what youve said wharton senior shrugged wearily you tell him miss maybe hell believe you tell him what asked lorelei the truth of course he paused for a reply and receiving none broke out wrathfully then i will shes a grafter bob and her whole family are grafters now let me finish she makes her living in any way she can she smirks at you out of every catchpenny advertisement along broadway shes the chewinggum girl and the petticoat girl and the bathtub girl theres nothing dishonest in that just a minute i wont have my daughters face grinning at me every time i get into a streetcar id be the laughingstock of the country its legitimate perhaps but its altogether too damned colorful for me is that all you have against her not by any means shes notorious newspaper talk is it shes made her living by bleeding men by taking gifts and renting herself out the way she did at hammons supper men dont support showgirls from chivalrous motives i had her family looked up and it didnt take two hours listen to this report he extracted a typewritten sheet from his billcase adjusted his glasses and began to read peter knight former residence vale new york held several minor offices sheriff for one term involved in scandal over public works and defeated for reelection reputation bad detailed record can be had if necessary moved to this city clerk in department of water supply gas and electricity until injured by taxicab while intoxicated believed to be crippled james knight son reputation bad generally known as a loafer suspected of boosting for socalled wiretappers operating on upper west side last spring believed to have some connection with more than one blackmailing scheme details available he figured in recent scandal concerning wellknown financier and actress of late employed as steerer for max melchers gamblinghouse west fortysixth street broker living at charlevoix apartments reported to have lost large sums through his efforts no police record as yet mathilda knight wife of peter dyou want the rest mr wharton inquired no lorelei gulped no police record as yet broker living at the charlevoix apartments injured by a taxicab while intoxicated quoted wharton scandal blackmail graft its all here bob and i hadnt come to this girls record the report was made by one of our own men and its incomplete but i can have it elaborated what do you say mrs wharton is it true lorelei dropped her head most of it i dare say did you try to blackmail merkle no your mother and your brother did she was silent they tried to scare him into marrying you did they not hammon said something about that ejaculated bob but i dont believe lorelei checked him its quite true merkle said you had nothing to do with it personally conscientiously explained mr wharton and im willing to take his word but thats neither here nor there there was a moment of silence during which he folded and replaced the report then he shook his head exclaiming secondhand goods my boy thats a lie loreleis voice was like a whip mr wharton eyed her grimly thats something for bob to determine i have only the indications to go on i dont blame him for losing his wits youre very goodlooking but the affair must end youre not a girl id care to have in my family pardon my bluntness she met his eyes fairly at no time had she flinched before him although inwardly she had cringed and her flesh had quivered at his merciless attack you have told bob the truth she began slowly in the worst possible way you have put me in the most unfavorable light i dare say i never would have had the courage to tell him myself although he deserves to know ive been pretty commercial because i had to be but i never sold myself and i shant begin now bob isnt a child hes nearly thirty years old old enough to make up his own mind and he must make this decision not i bob opened his lips but his father forestalled him what do you mean by that i have no price if hes sick of the match well end it and it wont cost you a cent bob looked inscrutable his father smiled for the first time during the interview thats very decent of you he said but of course i shant put the good faith of your offer to the test i dont want something for nothing ill take care of you nicely thus far bob had yielded precedence to his father but he could no longer restrain himself now let me take the chair he commanded easily my mind is made up you see i didnt marry peter knight residence vale nor james knight reputation bad nor even mathilda knight wife of peter i married this kid and the books are closed you say the knights are a bad lot and loreleis reputation is a trifle discolored maybe youre right but mine has some inky blots on it too and i guess the cleanest part of it would just about match the darkest that hers can show i seem to have all the best of the deal dont be an ass growled his father ive always been one i may as well be consistent bob felt the slender form at his side begin to tremble and smiled down into the troubled blue eyes upturned to his maybe well both have to do some forgiving and forgetting i believe thats usual nowadays oh im not whitewashing you hannibal snapped she probably knows what you are i do agreed lorelei hes a drunkard and everything that means but you taught him to drink before he could choose for himself mr wharton smiled sneeringly admirable i begin to see that youre more than a pretty woman get his sympathy its good business now hell think he must act the man but that will wear off and understand this you cant graft off me you and your family are due for a great disappointment bob hasnt anything and he wont have until i die but im good for thirty years yet im not going to disinherit him im merely going to wait until you both get tired take my word for it poverty is the most tiresome thing in the world we can manage said lorelei you speak for yourself but he cant make a living unless he has something in him that i never discovered i fear youll find him rather a heavy burden throughout the interview mr wharton had kept his temper quite perfectly and his coolness at this moment argued a greater fixity of purpose than might have been inferred from a display of rage he made a final appeal to his son cant you see that it wont do at all bob i wont stand parasites unless theyre my own either have done with the matter and let me pay the charges or go through to the bitter finish on your own feet shes supporting three loafers i dare say she can take care of another but it isnt quite right to put it upon her shes sure to weary of it sometime youll notice ive said nothing about your mother so far but shes with me in this ill be in the city for several days and id like to have you return to pittsburg with me when i go mother is expecting you if you decide to stick it out whartons face showed more than a trace of feeling his deep voice lowered a tone you may go to hell with my compliments and ill sit on the lid to keep you there he rose took his hat and stalked out of the apartment without so much as a backward glance chapter xviii whew that was a knockout but who got licked bob went to the little sideboard and helped himself to a stiff drink did he mean it my dear time wears away mountains and rivers dry up and the whole solar system is gradually running down i believe but dad isnt governed by any natural laws whatsoever hes built of reinforced concrete and time hardens him hes impervious to rust or decay and gravity exerts no power over him then i think youd better make your choice tonight bobs eyes opened i have dont you understand im going to stand pat that is unless he hesitated his smile was a bit uncertain unless youre sick of your bargain im afraid you havent come out of the deal very well you thought i was rich and so did i until a moment ago but im not ive run through a good deal i dont blame you for considering me a fine catch or for marrying me you see i never expected to find a girl whod take me for anything except my money so im not offended or disappointed or surprised a bankaccount looms up just as big on fifth avenue as it does on amsterdam and there arent any more love matches over there than elsewhere im not blind to my shortcomings either there are a lot of bad habits waiting to be acquired by a chap with time and money like me i cant live without booze i dont know how to earn a living im a corking spendthrift thats one side balanced against that i possess let me see i possess a fair sense of humor not a very even account is it for once in his life bob showed unmistakable selfconsciousness this was so far as lorelei knew his maiden effort to be serious he ran on hurriedly what i mean to convey is this i have no regrets no questions to ask no reproaches i got all i expected and all i was entitled to when i married you but it seems that youve been cheated and im ready to do the square thing ill step aside and give you another chance if you say so during this little declaration lorelei had watched him keenly she appeared to be seriously weighing his offer i was getting pretty tired of things he added and i spose id have wound up in the d t parlors of some highly exclusive institution or behind a bathroom door with a gastube in my teeth but i met you and you went to my head i wanted you worse than i ever wanted anything worse even than i ever wanted liquor and now i have you ive had you for one day and thats something i suppose its silly to talk about starting over i dont want to reform if i dont have to moderation strikes me as an awful cold proposition but it looks as if reform were indicated if im to keep you im just an album of expensive habits and were broke maybe i could do something with myself if you took a hand its a good deal to ask of a girl like you but he regarded her timidly then averted his eyes if you cared to try it we might make it go for a while and you might get to care for me a little if i improve again he paused hopefully ive been as honest as i know how now wont you be the same lorelei roused herself and spoke with quiet decision ill go through to the end bob bob started and uttered an inarticulate word or two in his face was a light of gladness that went to the girls heart his name had risen freely to her lips he felt as if she had laid her hand in his with a declaration of absolute trust you mean that she nodded he took her in his arms and kissed her gently then feeling her warm against his breast he burst the bonds that had restrained him up to this moment and covered her face her neck her hair with passionate caresses for the first time since his delirium of the night before he abandoned himself to the hunger her beauty excited and she offered him no resistance at last she freed herself and straightening the disorder of her hair smiled at him mistily wait please beautiful his eyes were aflame youre my wife nothing can change that nothing except yourself now you must listen to me she forced him reluctantly into his chair and seated herself opposite he leaned forward and kissed her once more then seized her hand and held it at intervals he crushed his lips into its pink palm we must start honestly she began do you mind if i hurt you you cant hurt me so long as you dont leave me your eyes have haunted me every night ive seen the curve of your neck your lips no woman was ever so perfect so maddening always that youre not a husband at this moment youre only a man he frowned slightly thats what makes this whole matter so difficult she went on dont you see he shook his head you dont love me youre drunk with something altogether different to love its true she insisted you show it you dont even know the real me beauty may be only a skin disease bob laughed but ugliness goes clear to the bone i married you for your money and you married me because i seemed physically perfect because my face and my body roused fires in you i think we are both pretty rotten at heart dont you no anyhow i dont care to think about it i never won anything by thinking kiss me again she ignored his demand with her shadowy smile i deliberately traded on my looks i put myself up for a price and you paid that price regardless of everything except your desires we muddled things dreadfully and got our deserts i didnt love you i dont love you now any more than you love me but i think were coming to respect each other and that is a beginning you have longings to be something different and better so have i lets try together i have it in me to succeed but im not sure about you thanks for the good cheer youre afraid you cant make a living for us i know you can im merely afraid you wont what do you mean he asked i dont believe the liquor will let you nonsense any man can cut down cutting down wont do for us bob he thrilled anew at her intimate use of his name the chemistry of your body demands the stuff you couldnt be temperate in anything youll have to quit all right ill quit i divorce the demon rum lovers once but strangers now ill quit gambling too lorelei laughed that wont strain your willpower in the least for half my salary goes up amsterdam avenue and the rest will about run this flat her listener frowned forget that salary talk he said shortly dyou think id let you support me dyou think im that kind of a nosegay when i get so i cant pay the bills ill walk out tomorrow you quit work and we move to the ritz they know me there and this delightful homelike grotto of yours gives me the collywabbles who will pay the hotel lorelei smiled mr george w bridegroom of course ill get the money never fear i know everybody and ive borrowed thousands of dollars when i didnt need it my rooms at the charlevoix are full of expensive junk ill sell it and that will help as soon as were decently settled ill look for a salaried job then watch my smoke to quote from the press of a few months hence the meteoric rise of robert wharton has startled the financial world surpassing as it does the sensational success of his father young mr wharton was seen yesterday at his wall street office and took time from his many duties to modestly assure our representative that his ability was inherited and merely illustrates anew the maxim that a chip of the old block will return after many days that will please dad hell relent when i attribute my success to him you must quit drinking before you begin work said lorelei i have quit with a person of such resilient temperament one who gamboled through life like a faun argument was difficult bob wharton was pagan in his joyous inconsequence his romping spirits could not be damped he bubbled with the optimism of a robin goodfellow ahead of him he saw nothing but dancing sunshine heard nothing but the pandean pipes the girl wife watched him curiously i wonder if you can she mused before we begin our new life were going to make a bargain binding on both of us youll have to stop drinking i wont live with a drunkard ill work until youve mastered the craving no bob declared firmly ill take the river before ill let you keep me why if i lorelei rose and laid her hand over his lips saying quietly im planning our happiness dont you understand and its a big stake you must pocket your pride for a while nobody will know weve made a botch of things so far and there is only one way for us to win out a man whod let his wife a man who wouldnt let his wife have her way at first is a brute you shouldnt ask it he cried sullenly i dont ask it i insist upon it if you refuse we cant go on surely you dont mean that he looked up at her with grave troubled eyes i do im entirely in earnest you havent strength to go out among your friends and restrain yourself no man as far gone as you could do it ive a simpler way than that he told her after a moments thought there are institutions where they straighten fellows up ill go to one of those no she rejected this suggestion positively they only relieve they dont cure the appetite comes back this is something you must do yourself once and for all you must fight this out in secret this city is no place for men with appetites they cant control do this for me bob and and ill let you do anything after that ill let you beat me getting no response from him she added gravely it is that or nothing i cant let you go bob said finally good well keep this apartment and ill go on working he hid his face in his hands and groaned gee im a rotter you can sell your belongings at the charlevoix and well use the money well need everything for i cant piece out my salary the way ive been doing there cant be any more supperparties and gifts i should hope not he growled ill murder the first man who speaks to you then is it a real binding bargain it is if youll bind it with another kiss he agreed with a miserable attempt at cheerfulness but i shant look myself in the face for the first time she came to him willingly doesnt it seem nice to be honest with yourself and the world she sighed after a time yes he laughed im sorry to cut the governor adrift but hell have to get along without our help despite his jocularity he was deeply moved as the situation grew clearer to him he saw that this girl was about to change the whole current of his careless life her unexpected firmness her gentle womanly determination at this crisis was very grateful he desperately longed to retain its support and yet the arrangement to which she had forced his consent went sorely against his grain his struggle had not been easy her surrender to him was as complete and as unselfish as his own acquiescence seemed unmanly and weak he rose and paced the little room to relieve his feelings days and weeks of almost constant dissipation had affected his mental poise quite as disastrously as the strain of the past twentyfour hours had told upon his physical control and he was shaking nervously he paused at the sideboard finally and poured himself a steadying drink lorelei watched his trembling fingers fill the glass before she spoke you mustnt touch that she said positively eh he turned still frowning absentmindedly oh this he held the glass to the light you mean you want me to begin now a fellow has to sober up gradually my dear i really need a joltim all unstrung i sealed the bargain but lorelei he set the glass down with a mirthless laugh of course i wont if you insist i intended to taper off a chap cant turn teetotaler the way he turns a handspring he eyed the glass with a sudden intensity of longing lets begin tomorrow nobody starts a new life at two a m and its all poured out she answered by taking the glass and flinging its contents from the open window this done she gathered the bottles from the sideboard there were not many and opening the foldingdoors that masked the kitchenette she upended them over the sink when the last gurgle had died away she went to her husband and put her arms around his neck you must she said gently if youll only let me have my way well win but bob dear its going to be a bitter fight loreleis family spent most of the night in discussing their great good fortune even jim worn out as he was by his part in the events connected with the marriage sat until a late hour planning his sisters future and incidentally his own after he had gone to bed mother and father remained in a glow of exhilaration that made sleep impossible and it was nearly dawn when they retired to dreams of hopes achieved and ambitions realized about ninethirty on the following morning just when the rival wall street forces were gathering hannibal wharton called up the knight establishment mrs knight was impatient and at first refused to be disturbed but when the servant at last made it plain that it was hannibal c wharton not his son robert calling she leaped from her bed with the agility of an acrobat peter she cried its mr wharton himself peter likewise awoke to a tremendous excitement he probably wants to get acquainted exclaimed the invalid tell him to come right up i can see him any time his wife was nervously pinning up her straggling hair as if she feared the millions of the steel baron gave him the occult power to direct his vision along the wire what shall i say to him she gasped i suppose ill have to call on him and mrs wharton but i havent a thing to wear for gods sake dont mention money implored peter try to be pleasant for once in your life better let me talk to him but at this suggestion mrs knight flared up angrily you stay where you are she snapped i know how to handle rich people mathilda he shouted as she hurried from the room her slippers slapping loosely a discolored wrapper clutched over her bony chest when he talks about lorelei cry for him shes our only daughter and our only support see we cant bear to let her go if youd only help me to the phone the retort that came back was shrewish but the next instant mathildas voice became as honey how do you do mr wharton she was bubbling i didnt mean to keep you waiting but i couldnt imagine yes this is loreleis mother im all upset over the marriage and of course you are too but young people do the strangest things nowadays dont they we forgave them of course one couldnt be angry with robert hes such awhat peter knight let himself back into his bed with a feeble curse women were such hysterical fools what man could swallow that sickly society tone then he lifted himself again roundeyed with apprehension in that attitude he remained frozen why mr wharton came echoing through the door how can you say such a thing we knew nothing about it we did not shes a good girl ill have you understand youre talking to her mother he is not jim is a oh you talk like an old fool i you the sickly society tone was no longer in evidence mathildas voice was shrill and furious it rose higher with every second peter shouted he struggled with the bedclothes meanwhile his wife appeared to be having a fit had a grounded wire poured an electric shock into her body she could not have clung to the instrument with more desperate tenacity she writhed her broken cries were plainly wrung from her by nothing less than agony at last there came a cessation of her incoherence and a tinkling of the bell as she furiously vibrated the hook hello hello central my party rang off hello the door of jims room burst open what the devil he cried mathilda mathilda wailed peter mrs knight rushed into her husbands presence like a destroying angel jim followed in his pajamas she was more disheveled than ever her eyes were rolling her cheeks were livid her hair seemed to bristle from its fastenings she was panting in a labored effort to relieve her feelings whats the matter ma matter hell that was hannibal wharton stormed the invalid its all over shrilled mrs knight he wont have it hes cut them off he called me a a once more she choked in her rage her teeth chattered bobs broke wait a minute jim cried roughly lets hear all about it before you bite somebody is wharton sore hes crazy he said we trapped bob he called us grafters and thieves and blackmailing parasites rats bobs got money of his own not a cent hes in debt and the old man wont give him a dollar until hes divorced i dont believe it protested jim peter mocked at them his bloated pasty face convulsed with anger fine job you made of it you two so this is your grand match this is how you put us on easy street eh you married the girl to a bum why didnt you look him up why didnt you screamed his wife you didnt say anything everybody thinks hes rich he is too jim asserted he must be old wharton is bluffing but well find out get into your dress ma well see bob ive got an ace buried and if that dirty loafer sold us out ill put him over the jumps he cant doublecross me understand ive got the goods on him and on all of em oh weve been doublecrossed all right sneered peter loreleis down and out now shes no good any more i guess youll listen to me next time his son turned upon him furiously crying shut up or ill he left his threat unfinished and rushed back to his room muttering under his breath as he flung himself into his clothes he could hear the quarrel still raging between the other two and he lifted his clenched hands above his head with an oath fuss fight and fury he wailed fine place for a nervous guy if i dont end in a madhouse ill be lucky chapter xix on the way to the elegancia mrs knight recounted in greater detail and with numerous digressions and comments what hannibal wharton had said to her not only had he given full vent to his anger at the marriage but he had allowed himself the pleasure of expressing a frank opinion of the entire knight family in all its unmitigated and complete badness mrs knight herself he had called a bloodsucker it seemed the good woman shook with rage at the memory and he had threatened her with the direst retribution if she persisted in attempting to fasten herself upon him bob he had explained was a loafer whom he had supported out of a sense of duty if the idiot was ungrateful he would simply have to suffer the consequences but bobs mother felt the disgrace keenly and on her account hannibal had expressed himself as willing to ransom the young fool for say ten thousand dollars disgrace eh ten thousand dollars jim growled what does he think we are anyhow why that aint cigarette money i never was so insulted in my life stormed mrs knight you should have heard him with a show of confidence not entirely real jim rejoined now ma dont heat up everybody forgets me but im going to draw cards in this game the interview that followed their arrival at loreleis home was far from pleasant for mrs knight was still too indignant to leave the discussion in jims more capable hands and lorelei wishing bob to cherish no illusions allowed her relatives to make a complete and distressing exhibition of their greed at his first opportunity bob explained rather briefly i offered lorelei her freedom last night when my income was amputated youve had time to think it over his wife interposed do you still want me why of course and you she shrugged i dont change in one night now i wish you and jim would leave mother and me bob acquiesced glad to escape even in company with his redoutable brotherinlaw when he and jim had gone mrs knight addressed lorelei with motherly candor hes a pleasant fellow of course and hes crazy about you but dont lets be sentimental if theres no chance to make it up with his family we must get out of this mess and save what we can was mr wharton very angry was he mrs knight rolled her eyes in mingled rage and despair im positively sick over the things he said everybody seems to be against us and im almost ready to give up but at least you saved your good name it was a marriage not a scandal we have that to be thankful for she followed this outburst of optimism with another you can keep the name and go into vaudeville the publicity will help you and that old crank will surely stretch his offer to keep his name off the billboards of course we wont get anything like what we expected but well get something fifteen or twenty thousand is better than noting the shadow of a smile upon her daughters lips she checked her rush of words you dont seem to care what i dont mrs knights face twisted into an expression of pained incredulity surely you dont mean to live with bob she gasped not now i do mean to the mothers lips parted closed parted again she seemed to taste something unspeakably bitter she groped for words to fit her state of mind but words failed her when she did speak however the weakness of her vocabulary was offset by the shrill tone of her surprise my dear why my dear he hasnt a cent of course youre quite confused now youve been through a lot and you think hes the only man in the world but its impossible its absurd the marriage was only a form youre no more his wife in the sight of god than lets not talk about god cried lorelei that ceremony was scarcely legal not to speak of religion or decency youve lost your mind youve changed completely yes i have you see i wasnt a wife until yesterday until bob and i had an understanding but i am a wife now and i suppose ill never be a girl again ive begun to think for myself mother ive begun to understand ive had a suspicion that my old ideas were wrong and they were fiddlededee youre hysterical you cant make me believe you learned to love that man i dont say i love him mrs knight snorted her triumph loudly then you mustnt live with him another moment my dear child such a relationship is well think it out for yourself lorelei saw the futility of argument but certain thoughts demanded expression and she voiced them as much for her own sake as for her mothers its too late to talk about that kind of honor but theres another kind when i married bob i sold myself and all of us i mean the family knew that what i sold was counterfeit he thought he was getting something more than my body but we knew he wasnt and now that we find we took bad money for a worthless article how can we pretend to be swindled when people try to cheat and get cheated themselves what do they do if theyre game they smile and take their medicine dont they it was plain that this form of logic impressed the listener not at all lorelei continued ive learned that marriage is more than i considered it mother its an obligation i intend to live up to my part just as long as bob lives up to his if he complained of the fraud we practised on him id be willing to leave him but he doesnt so the matter is out of our hands mrs knight relieved her steadily increasing anger by a harsh outburst i never thought you could be so silly after the way you were raised you talk about obligations what about your obligation to your parents didnt we give up everything for you didnt peter sacrifice his lifes work to give you an opportunity ill keep on sharing my salary with you salary mrs knight spat out the word after all our plans salary my god youre probably just as honest in your ideas as i am in mine lorelei told her i shant allow you to want for i should hope not since youre to blame for peters condition oh you know you are if you hadnt wanted a career hed still be in vale a strong healthy man instead of a cripple i didnt want a career lorelei denied with heat and father almost had to leave vale nothing of the sort he was a big man there had to leave vale eh so youve turned against your own blood and disparage your father anyhow he was hurt while he was working to give you a start and now hes helpless who waits on him i do if i believed in prayers id pray that you may never have a child to disappoint you as youve disappointed him and me her voice quavered as she tried for pathos but her fury was still too fresh to be entirely restrained and it scalded her like vitriol if bob wharton was half a man hed step aside but of course he wont until hes had enough of your beauty thats all he wants your beauty and youll be fool enough to let him have it for nothing im sure i wish you joy with the selfish wretch and with your newfangled ideas of wifely devotion this will kill peter youll have his death on your conscience think that over now that youre so fond of thinking ten thousand dollars right now would save his life think that over too when your own father is dead and gone white with anger sick with disappointment mrs knight whisked herself out of the apartment bob returned in excellent spirits nothing had power permanently to dampen his cheerfulness and seizing loreleis hand he slipped a diamond ring upon her third finger then a plain gold band over that now were legally wrapped up in the same package and labeled wed he declared ive been terribly embarrassed how did you manage to buy these lorelei inquired with some curiosity i earned the money fact it was a premium on abstinence i met a friend he invited me to drink i refused friend was stunned before he recovered i ran through his pockets like a pet squirrel it beats a mask and a lead pipe we cant begin this way she laughed i love pretty things and this is your first gift she kissed the solitaire but please dont give me anything more for a while im not going to lecture you nor wear a long face nor find fault ever were going to wear smiles while our experiment lasts tomorrow is sunday will you take me somewhere will i bob cried in delight ill hire a car and well motor up to tuxedo theres a dandy crowd out there well take adoree and the immaculate critic and well have dinner at the club campbell can show the latest effects in negligees and thats too expensive lets all go to coney island coney how do you get there i dont know will you go certainly if you want to i dare say well meet some of the best steamfitters in the city well patronize everything from the mystic maze to the trained fleas well bump the bumps and youll throw your arms around me and scream and well look at the incubator babies and blush i cant wait strangely enough the news of bob whartons marriage had not leaked into the papers up to this time and lorelei having regard for the feelings of his parents insisted that he help her to keep the matter secret as long as possible bob rebelled at first for he adored publicity he rejoiced in his newest exploit and desired his world to hear of it while the prospect of further mortifying his father was so agreeable that it required much persuasion to make him relinquish it with her own family lorelei had less difficulty for they were by no means eager to advertise their bad bargain and had withdrawn behind a stiff restraint leaving the couple to their own devices this attitude spared the bride much unpleasant notoriety enabling her to pursue her work at the theater without comment bobs society proved in some ways a welcome change from the sordid drabness of her own relatives for he was colorful versatile and nearly always goodhumored he kept lorelei entertained at least and if at times he provoked her it was only as a mischievous boy tries the patience of a parent he was weirdly prankish serious happenings reacted strangely upon him misfortune aroused in him a wild hilarity cares excited mirth he bore his responsibilities lightly and displayed them to his friends with the same profound pride with which a small boy exhibits a collection of beetles but they meant nothing more lorelei realized before long that this very jocundity of his since it fed upon constant change and excitement constituted the gravest menace to their happiness the man lived entirely outside of himself he utterly lacked the power of selfamusement and although he seemed content when she was near during the long hours of her absence he was like a fretful child he refused to frequent the theater ostensibly because of their secret in reality because of his shame at allowing her to work as lorelei came to know him better and to understand the conflicting forces within him she began to wonder how long he could hold himself true to his bargain during the first week of their married life his system struggled to throw off the effects of his recent dissipations and in consequence it craved only rest greatly encouraged by this lack of desire he boasted that the battle was already won and lorelei pretended to agree with him she did not deceive herself however and a brief experience convinced her that to be merely a wife to one of bobs vagrant disposition was not enough that in order to keep his new self alive she must also be his sweetheart his chum and his partner if she failed in any one of these roles disaster was bound to follow but to succeed in them all when there was no love to strengthen her was by no means easy always she felt a great emptiness and a disappointment that her life had been so crookedly fashioned sometimes she even felt degraded and wondered if she were doing right after all reason argued that to live with a man she did not love was immoral and the mere fact that she and bob were legally married gave her no comfort whatever there had been nothing sacred in their union she supposed that the courts would dissolve it if the truth became known more than once lorelei had spurned offers far more profitable and no less holy than that existing between her and bob and it seemed to her now that the difference between mistress and wife must lie in something besides the mutterings of a sleepy hoboken court officer just where the line of demarcation lay however or upon which side of that line she stood she could not determine in the course of a fortnight bob began to grow restless one evening when he came for her she saw that he was nervous a strained tired look had crept into his eyes and she thought she understood nevertheless his spirits were ebullient when they reached home he ushered her into the apartment with a flourish and lorelei was amazed to find their table set with strange linen silver and china and the diningroom decorated as if for a party whos coming what on earth she exclaimed a little surprise a supper for just you and me my dear two strangers evidently caterers men were completing the final preparations for an extravagant banquet noting a collection of wineglasses at each place lorelei glanced at bob reproachfully but he only laughed saying take heart the liquid diet is all a bluff kindly note the centerpiece she saw that the center of the table was occupied by a highly decorated silver winecooler empty there it sits bob exclaimed the little temple of bacchus overgrown with roses it used to be my shrine and my confessional until i saw the light now that ive escaped from the bondage of sin sickness and error im giving a triumphal feast upon the altar steps it was one of his whims during the meal he made elaborate speeches in the names of his friends his imaginary guests congratulated him in empty glasses they toasted the bride they extolled her beauty they praised his own gallantry and vaunted his conquest of the demon rum as the supper progressed bob simulated a growing intoxication while the hired servants looked on as if at the antics of a lunatic he made it amusing and lorelei entered into the spirit of the makebelieve but when they were alone and all traces of the feast had disappeared he swooped down out of the clouds and confessed miserably i thought i could kid myself but i cant i want a drink i want a drink god how i want it lorelei went swiftly to him the fight is just beginning bob youre doing nobly it isnt thirst he explained and she saw that same strained uneasiness in his bright eyes im not thirsty im shaky inside my ego is wabbling on its pins and im rattling to pieces i manage well enough when youre around but when im alone i remember she felt him twitch and shiver nervously and there are so many places to get booze everywhere i look i see a bartender with arms outstretched when i grit my teeth the damned appetite leaves me alone but when im off my guard it gumshoes in again i get tired of fighting lorelei nodded sympathetically thats why its so hard to reform ones conscience tires but temptation is always fresh its not thirst bob repeated my soul is dried out i get to thinking late at night im afraid im going to quit you must keep busy im going to work no no not yet she cried quickly you must fight it out where i can help bob smiled gratefully youre a thoroughbred i promised to let you have your way and you shall even if we lose the patient it will be a dandy operation beginning with the next morning lorelei inaugurated a change in the domestic routine every day thereafter she and bob took a long walk he rebelled of course as soon as the novelty wore off for he detested walking so did she for that matter but she pretended to like it and her simulated zest overcame his reluctance they did not amble aimlessly about the streets she led him on purposeful tramps that kept them in the open air most of the day and although her feet blistered until she could hardly drag herself to the theater when night came she persisted in time the walking grew to be a dreadful task it took all her determination but she would not give up with admirable craft she gradually won him away from the cafes assuming delight in household duties that she was far from feeling in reality she was a wretched cook but she declared her intention of becoming an expert and insisted upon preparing at least two of their daily meals at which time she saw to it that bob ate more sweets and more salt foods than he was accustomed to the former took the place of alcohol the latter roused a healthy thirst and thirsty men drink water these were only little things her heaviest task lay in keeping his mind occupied at times this was easy again the effort wore her out bob began to have surly spells for the first time in her life lorelei really worked and worked not for herself but for another although the experience was interesting in its novelty the result remained unsatisfactory for not only did love fail to respond to these sacrifices but she could see no improvement in bobs condition the thing she fought was impalpable yet enormous it was weak yet strong it seemed to sleep yet it was ever awake of necessity the two lived in the closest intimacy than which nothing is ordinarily more fatal to domestic happiness but bob was unique he did not tire he began to rely upon lorelei as a sick man leans upon his nurse and to worship her as a man worships his sweetheart there was more than passion in his endearments now but it was discouraging to the girl who gained no strength from her penance and derived no satisfaction whatever in service for services sake the whole arrangement tried her patience desperately she was weary in mind and body and looked back with regret upon her former easy life there was no time now for recreation bob had to be amused salaryday assumed a new importance and she began to count the cost of every purchase so spring went and midsummer came it was terribly hot in the city the nights were breathless the days were glaring and this heat was especially trying to one in bobs condition in his periods of gaiety he showered his wife with attentions and squandered every dollar he could borrow in presents for her in his hours of depression he was everything strange morose and irritable without her knowledge he applied to his old firm for a salaried position and was refused he appealed to merkle with the same result but succeeded in borrowing a thousand dollars with which he bought lorelei a set of black opals going into debt for half the price chapter xx loreleis family continued to smart under a sense of bitter injustice but although they kept aloof they were by no means uninterested in her experiment on the contrary they watched it with derisive enjoyment predicting certain failure after hannibal whartons insult jim was all for a prompt revenge but he could not determine just how to use his dangerous knowledge to the best advantage he considered the advisability of enlisting the aid of max melcher but not liking the thought of dividing the loot he decided provisionally to engineer a separation between bob and lorelei his desire to make mischief arose in only a slight degree from resentment jims method of making a living had long since dulled the edge of feeling it was merely the first step in a comprehensive scheme with bob and lorelei estranged a divorce would follow and divorces were profitable a divorce moreover would open the way for a second inroad upon the wharton wealth for with loreleis skirts clear jim could proceed with a larger scheme of extortion based on the hammon murder one evening after lorelei had gone to the theater jim appeared at the apartment and found bob in a mood so restless and irritable that he dared not go out i had a hunch you were lonesome the caller began so i came up to whittle and spit at the stove now jim could be agreeable when he chose his parasitic life had developed in him a certain worldly goodfellowship he was frankly unregenerate and he had sufficient tact never to apologize nor to explain therefore he kept bob entertained a few nights later he returned with a fund of new stories and during the evening he confessed to a consuming thirst death valley has nothing on this place he mourned bob explained apologetically im sorry but theres nothing in the house wetter than croton water i understand will you object if i sweeten a glass of it with some scottish rites im afraid of germs and if water rots leather think what it must do to the sensitive lining of a human stomach jim drew a flask from his pocket then hesitated as if in doubt dont mind me bob assured him hastily im strapped in the drivers seat but he looked on with eager appreciation as his brotherinlaw filled a long glass and sipped it bob had never been a whiskydrinker yet the faint odor of the liquor tantalized him when in the course of time he saw jim preparing a second drink he stirred kind of itchy eh lets whip across the street and have a game of pool suggested jim and bob was glad to escape from the room an agreeable hour followed but bob played badly and found that his eye had lost its sureness his hand was uncertain too and this lack of coordination disgusted him he was sure that with a steadying drink he could beat jim and eventually he proved it but mindful of his resolution he compromised on beer which jim agreed could not reasonably be called an intoxicant on his way to the theater bob chewed cinnamon bark and when he kissed lorelei he held his breath this was the first of several pool matches and after a while bob was gratified to find that beer in moderation left no disagreeable effect whatever upon him he rejoiced in his power of restraint there came a night when he failed to meet his wife after waiting nearly half an hour lorelei went home only to find the apartment deserted she nibbled at a lonely lunch trying to assure herself that nothing was seriously amiss but she could not make up her mind to go to bed she tried to read and failed an hour passed then another a thousand apprehensions crowded in upon her and she finally found herself walking the floor but pulled herself together with a mirthless laugh so it had come she reflected with mingled bitterness and relief her fight was over her part of the bargain was ended she was free to live her own life as she chose certainly she had done her best and above all question she was not the sort of wife who could wait patiently night after night for a drunken husband bob when he did arrive entered with elaborate caution he paused in the little hall then tossed his hat into the livingroom where his wife was waiting after a moment his head came slowly into view and he said when the hat stays in go in when it comes out beat it lorelei saw that he was quite drunk i just came from the theater he explained but it was dark has the show failed dearie he tried to kiss her but she turned her face away come must have my little kiss he insisted then as she rose and moved away leaving him swaying in his tracks he began gravely to unroll an odd thin package that resembled a tennisracket removing a soiled white wrapping then an inner layer of oiled paper he exposed the sad remains of what had been an elaborate bouquet of double english violets fringed with gardenias he stared at the flowers in some bewilderment must have sat on em he opined at last then he cried brightly ha pressed flowers im full of oldfashioned sentiment after studying loreleis unsmiling face his tone altered oh i know i slipped but it couldnt be helped nature insisted and i yielded gracefully but no harm done none whatever this isnt a defeat my dear its a victory i licked the demon rum and proved myself a man of iron i subjugated the cohorts of general benjamin booze then i signed a treaty of peace and there was no bad blood on either side after an uncomfortable pause during which he vainly waited for her to speak he explained more fully my dear nothing is absolute life is a series of compromises have a heart would you rob the distiller of his livelihood think of the struggling young brewer with a family could you take the bread from the mouths of his little ones the president of a bottlingworks may be a christian he may have a sick wife remember the boys that work in the hopfields and the joyous peasant girls of france moderation is the thing live and let live lorelei nodded exactly we shall live as we choose only of course we cant live together after this then her disgust burst its control and she demanded bitterly havent you any strength whatever havent you any balance bob he grinned at her cheerfully i should say i had i walked a fence on the way home just to prove it and i scarcely wabbled balance strength why you ought to see jim they had to carry him jim was jim with you in spirit yes in body only for a time for a brief while we went gaily hand in hand then jim lagged hes a nice boy but weak he falters beneath a load and as for pool why ive slept on pooltables so naturally i know the angles better than he ha thats a funny line isnt it i know the angles of pooltables because ive slept on em see dont hurry ill wait for you even an act like mine needs applause but lorelei was in no laughing mood she questioned bob searchingly and soon learned of jims visits of the flask of the pool games when she understood it all her eyes were glowing but she found nothing to say at last she got bob to bed then lay down beside him and stared into the darkness through many wakeful hours in the morning he was not only contrite but badly frightened yet when he undertook to make his peace he found her unexpectedly mild if youre sorry thats all i ask she said i changed my mind during the night never again he promised feelingly i thought i had cured myself lorelei smiled at him faintly cured how long have you been a drinker oh nearly always when were you first drunk i was eighteen i think youve been undergoing a bodily change for ten years during all that time your braincells have been changing their structure and theyll never be healthy or normal until theyve been made over you cant accomplish that in a few weeks say you dont mean im going to stay thirsty until my eggshaped dome becomes round again well yes why that might take years it took ten years to work the damage it will probably take ten years to repair it bob was aghast good heavens in ten years ill be too old to drink id tremble so that id spill it but where did you get all this m d dope ive been reading ive been talking to a doctor too you see i wanted to help lets change doctors ten years it cant be done im afraid youre right theres no such thing as reformation a born criminal never reforms only those who go wrong from weakness or from bad influences ever make good drinking isnt a crime bob declared angrily any more than freckles its just a form of diversion lorelei shook her head if youre a born alcoholic youll probably die a drunkard im hoping that you didnt inherit the taste well whether it was left to me or whether i bought it i cant go dry for ten years then our bargain is ended he looked up sharply oh no it isnt yes he extended a shaking hand and his voice was supplicating as he said i cant get along without you kid youre a part of me the vital part id go to pieces quick if you quit now when we made our agreement i meant to live up to every bit of it lorelei told him gently but were going to try again for this was jims fault jim jim was sorry for me he tried to cheer loreleis smile was bitter jim was never sorry for anybody except himself my family hate you just as your family hate me and theyd like to separate us say thats pretty rotten bob exclaimed if he werent your brother id lorelei laughed mirthlessly go ahead i wish you would it might clear the atmosphere then i will after a moment he continued i suppose you feel you must go on supporting them of course just as you feel you must support me is it entirely duty in my case seeing her hesitate he insisted isnt there any love at all im afraid not bob the man pondered silently i suppose if i were the right sort he said at length with some difficulty id let you go under these circumstances well im not the right sort im not big or noble im just an ordinary mediumsized man and im going to keep you however im through sidestepping ive tried to outrun the barleycorn brothers but its no use so im going to turn and face them if they lick me ill go under but if i go under ill take you with me i wont give you up i wont i shant let you pull me down she told him soberly then youll have to bear me up when a mans drowning he grabs and holds on thats me theres nothing fine about me understand im human and selfish id be happy in hell with you youre not fair i dont pretend to be this isnt a bridge game this is life ill cheat ill hold out ill deal from the bottom if i cant win in any other way good god dont you understand that youre the only thing i ever loved the only thing i ever wanted and couldnt get ive never had but half of you dont expect me to give that up he rose jammed his hat upon his head as if to escape from the room then turned and crushed his wife to him with a fierce cruelty of possession lorelei could feel him shaking as he covered her face with kisses but nothing within her stirred even faintly in answer to his passion when bob reached the financial district that day and resumed his quest for work he was ablaze with resentment at himself and at the world in general he took up the search with a dogged determination that was quite unlike him one after another he canvassed his friends for a position and finally as if ill fortune could not withstand his fervor he was successful it was not much of a job that was offered him but he snapped at it and returned home that evening in the best of humor already the serious issues of the morning were but a memory he burst in upon lorelei like a gale shouting im chalkboy at crosset meyers so you can give bergman your notice tonight whats the salary it isnt a salary its a humiliation twentyfive a week is the total insult why bob that wont keep two and the family damn the family he quieted himself with an effort well you give your notice anyhow ill spear the coin for both establishments somehow come i insist i want to be able to shave myself without blushing loreleis objections were not easily overcome but at last in view of the fact that the summer run of the revue was drawing to a close and the show would soon take to the road she allowed herself to be persuaded throughout the next week bob wharton really tried to make good he was enthusiastic the excitement of actual accomplishment was so novel that he had not time to think of liquor when saturday came and he found himself in possession of honestly earned funds he felt a soulsatisfying ease he decided to invest his first savings in a present for lorelei then a graver sense of responsibility seized him and he wrote to mrs knight as follows my dear motherinnewjerseylaw inclosed find five handsome examples of the engravers skill same being the result of six industrious days i know your passion for these objets dart i appreciate your eagerness to share my fathers celebrated collection and i join you in regrets at your failure to do so but remember as a moth gnaws a garment so doth envy consume a man take these photogravures love them cherish them share them with the butcher the baker the hobbleskirt maker and console yourself with the thought that although you have lost much you have gained something above price in me thine in everlasting fetters robert having despatched this missive he set out to find jim for the afternoon was young and he wished to settle his obligations in full it is well to be systematic business is largely a matter of system anyhow and the tag ends of one weeks work should never be allowed to lap over into another a round of popular uptown resorts failed to discover jim but bobs search finally brought him to tony the barbers shop and here in the rear room he found his brotherinlaw playing cards with a popeyed youth and a repellent person with a cauliflower ear bobs greeting was hearty evening james he cried feel like taking your beating here eh whats the matter jim rose from his chair with a shocked intensity of gaze im just cleaning up my affairs for the day of rest and ive come to return your last call alas james i am a weak vessel your work was coarse but i fell for it to the other occupants of the room he apologized im sorry to spoil your little game of authors but necessity prods me he extended a muscular hand for jims collar and found it mr armistead was of the emotional kind he leaped to his feet and went to the rescue of his friend but his first blow was wild seizing a chair he swung it aloft a manoeuver which more effectively distracted bobs attention but this attack also failed when bobs fist buried itself in the spongy region of mr armisteads beltbuckle and that young man promptly lost all interest in jimmy knights affairs there had been a time when he might have weathered such a blow but of late years easy living had left its marks therefore he sat down heavily all but missing the chair he had just occupied his eyes bulged more prominently than usual he became desperately concerned with a strange difficulty in breathing alert aggressive bob turned to face the man with the swollen ear but young sullivan being a professional fighter made no capital of amateur affairs and declined the issue with an upraised palm friends eh bob panted brothers heartily ejaculated sullivan whereupon bob foiled jimmy knights short cut for the door and proceeded with the purpose of his call it was no difficult matter to chastise jim whose spirit was as wretched as his strength as the wind whips a flag as a man flaps a dusty garment so did bob shake his victim jim felt his spine crack and his limbs unjoint his teeth snapped he bit his tongue his heels rattled upon the floor bob seemed bent upon shaking the bones from his flesh and the marrow from his bones but try as he would jim could not prevent the outrage he struggled he clawed he kicked he yelled his arms threshed loosely like the limber appendages to a stuffed figure mr armistead unnaturally pale remained seated he emitted harrowing sounds like those made by air leaking into a defective pump sullivan looked on with the lively appreciation of a roughhouse expert when bob emerged from the rear room he found the barber shop in confusion tony was leading a charge at the head of his assistants who were supported in turn by the customers but he fell back at sight of the flushed victor it was nothing but a little family affair bob reassured him now if you please ill borrow a hairbrush in front of a mirror he tidied himself settled his scarf with a deft jerk then went out whistling as it was nearly closingtime for the matinees he strolled toward the circuit theater full of a satisfying contentment with the world now that he owed it nothing he resolved to meet his future obligations as they arose early on monday morning bob reported for work only to receive from mr crosset whom he had always regarded as a warm friend the notice of his discharge whats the matter didnt i make good he demanded crosset was a young man more than once he and bob had scandalized broadway some of their exploits were epic now he shrugged carelessly saying oh you made good i guess but we cant take a chance with you i suppose youre afraid ill steal some of your chalk crosset grinned then deponed with extreme gravity bob you drink youre unsteady in your habits its too bad but we cant i dont drink as much as you do nobody does but thats beside the question as a matter of fact ive quit this announcement drew a hearty chuckle youre a great comedian bob said crosset after surveying his friend for a moment bob responded with great earnestness but youre not this fails to hand me a laugh now tell me how did you wet your feet and whence comes the icy draught well from the direction of pittsburg if you must know it seems you are an undesirable citizen bob a dangerous character theres a can tied to you and we cant afford to antagonize the whole steel trust i see im afraid ill have to disown that father of mine whats the trouble anyhow at bobs explanation crosset whistled funny i didnt hear about it married and happy eh well im sorry i cant help you you can how lend me five hundred certainly crosset lunged at his desk scribbled a line to the cashier and handed it to bob then in response to a call from the customers room dashed away with a hearty farewell as bob passed through the outer office he ran his eye over the opening prices being half inclined to scalp with his sudden wealth but luck had never run his way and he reconsidered anyhow there were more agreeable uses to which he could put this money for one thing he needed several suits for another it was high time he gave lorelei some little remembrance he hadnt given her a present in nearly two weeks and women set great store by such attentions he decided to invest his money in maiden lane and demand credit from his tailor but a halfhour at a jewelry shop convinced him that nothing suitable to so splendid a creature as his wife could be purchased for a paltry five hundred dollars and he was upon the point of returning to crosset with a request to double the loan when his common sense asserted itself poverty was odious but not shameful he reflected ostentation on the other hand was vulgar would it not be in bad taste to squander this happy windfall upon jewelry when lorelei needed practical things bob was cheered by the breadth of these sentiments they showed that he was beginning soberly to realize the leaden responsibilities of a family man no instead of a jewel he would buy his wife a dog at a fashionable uptown kennel he found exactly what he wanted in the shape of a pekingese a playful pedigreed pocket dog scarcely larger than his two fists it was a creature to excite the admiration of any woman its family tree was taller than that of a spanish nobleman and its name was ying but here again bob was handicapped by poverty for sleeve dogs are expensive novelties and the price of ying was seven hundred dollars marked down from one thousand and evidently the bargain of a lifetime at that price bob hated to haggle but he showed that his ability to drive a sharp bargain was merely latent and he finally bore the animal away in triumph to outgeneral a dogfancier was a tribute to his shrewdness to save two hundred dollars on a single purchase was economy of a high order much elated he set out briskly for his tailors place of business chapter xxi it still lacked something of luncheontime when bob wharton swung into fifth avenue with ying snugly ensconced in his coat pocket bob was in fine fettle what with the anticipation of loreleis delight at his gift and the certainty of an agreeable hour with his tailor it was always a pleasure to deal with kurtz for in his shop customers were treated with the most delicate consideration salesmen cutters fitters all were pleasant acquaintances who displayed neither the fawning obsequiousness of fifth avenue tradespeople nor the sullen apathy of broadway clerks kurtz himself was an artist he was also a person of generally cultivated taste and a man about town his pleasure in making a sale was less than his delight at meeting and serving his customers and his books were open only to those he considered his equals a stonyfaced doorman kept watch and ward in the gothic hallway to discourage the general public from entering the premises the fact that bob owed several hundred dollars dismayed that young man not in the least for kurtz never mentioned money matters the price of garments being after all of far less consequence than fit and style and that elusive something which kurtz called effect our daily actions are controlled by a variety of opposing influences which are like threads pulling at us from various directions when for any reason certain of these threads are snapped and the balance is disturbed we are drawn into strange pathways and our whole lives may be changed through the operation of what seems a most trivial case in bobs case the cause approached all unheralded in the person of mr richard cady a youth whose magnificent vacuity of purpose was the envy of his friends cometlike he was destined to appear flash brightly then disappear below the horizon of this tale mr cady greeted bob with listless enthusiasm teetering the while upon his cane like a japanese equilibrist havent seen you for ages he began been abroad bob explained that he was spending the summer in new york a statement that filled his listener with the same horror he would have felt had he learned that bob was passing the heated season in the miasmatic jungles of the amazon just ran down from newport cady volunteered im sailing today better join me for a trip i know he cut bobs refusal short travels an awful nuisance i get seasick myself then why play at it cady rolled a mournful eye upon his friend girl said he hollowly showgirl if i stay ill marry her and that wouldnt do positively not so im running away ill wait over if youll join me im a workingman haw mr cady expelled a short laugh true and ive quit drinking now cady was blase but he had a heart his sympathies were slow but he was not insensible to misfortune accordingly he responded with a cry of pity running his eye over his friend to estimate the ravages of temperance midway in its course his gaze halted he passed a silkgloved palm lightly across his brow and looked again a tiny head seemed to protrude from bobs pocket a pair of bright inquiring eyes seemed to be peering directly at the observer i guess id better quit too said cady faintly are you alone bob gently extracted ying from his restingplace and the two men studied him gravely little beggar isnt he cady remarked has he got a brother id like to give one to you know hes alone in the world im his nearest of kin give you five dollars for him cady offered i just paid five hundred and hes worth a thousand why his people came over ahead of the mayflower the gloomy lover was interested in his face there gleamed a faint desire think of it well make it a thousand ill send him in a bunch of orchids haw he doubled over his stick convulsed with appreciation of his own originality but again bob refused dont be nasty ill make it fifteen hundred bob carefully replaced the canine atom and grinned at his friend i need the money but nothing doing up against it hopefully inquired the other broke i couldnt afford a nickel to see an earthquake ill lend you fifteen hundred and take ying as security but bob remained inflexible and mr cady relapsed into gloom muttering gee youre a rotten business man so says my heartless father he has sewed up my pockets and scuttled my drawingaccount hence the dinnerpail on my arm im in quest of toil ill bet you starve brightly predicted mr cady in an effort at encouragement ill lay you five thousand that you make a flivver of anything you try ive quit gambling too as they shook hands cady grunted my invitation to globetrot is withdrawn fine company youd be as bob walked up the avenue he pondered deeply wondering if he really were so lacking in ability as his friends believed money was such a common thing after all the silly labor of acquiring it could not be half so interesting as the spending of it anybody could make money but to enjoy it to circulate it judiciously one must possess individuality of a sort money seemed to come to some people without effort and from the strangest sources kurtz for instance had grown rich out of coats and trousers bob halted frowning while ying peered out from his hidingplace at the passing throngs exposing a tiny limp pinkribbon tongue if kurtz armed only with a pair of shears and a foolish tape had won to affluence why couldnt another stockbroking was no longer profitable none of bobs friends had earned their salt for months and old hannibals opposition evidently forced a change of occupation the prospect of such a change was annoying but scarcely alarming to an ingrained optimist and bob took comfort in reflecting that the bestselling literature of the day was replete with instances of disinherited sons impoverished society men ruined bankers or mere idlers who by lightning strokes of genius had mended their fortunes overnight some few in the earlier days of frenzied fiction had played the market others the ponies still others had gone west and developed abandoned goldmines or obscure waterpowers a number also had grown disgustingly rich from patenting rattraps or shoebuttons one young man had discovered a way to keep worms out of railroadties and had promptly bludgeoned the railroad companies out of fabulous royalties over the stockmarket idea bob could work up no enthusiasm he knew too much about it and inasmuch as horseracing was no longer fashionable opportunities for a pittsburg phil future seemed limited moreover he had never saved a jockeys life nor a jockeys mother from eviction hence feedbox tips were not likely nor did he know a single soul in the business of inventing rattraps or shoebuttons as for going west he was clearly of the opinion that a search for abandoned goldmines or forgotten waterfalls wasnt in his line and the secret of creosoting railroadties now that he came to think of it was still locked up in the breast of its affluent discoverer besides as the whole episode had occurred in the second act of a play the safety of building upon it was doubtful at best no evidently the wellrecognized short cuts to wealth had all been obliterated by many feet and he must find another but where at length bobs wrinkled brow smoothed itself and he nodded his path was plain it led around the nearest corner to his tailors door mr kurtzs greeting was warm as bob strolled into the stately showroom with its highbacked flemishoak chairs its great carved tables its paneled walls with their antlered decorations this it may be said was not a shop not a store where clothes were sold but a studio where mens distinctive garments were draped and the difference was perfectly apparent on the first of each month bob gave ying his freedom to the great interest of the proprietor who studied the dogs points with a practised eye kurtz began bob abruptly i just bet dick cady five thousand dollars that i can make my own living for six months this falsehood troubled him vaguely until he remembered that high finance must be often conducted behind a veil mr kurtz genial shrewd gray raised admiring eyes from the capering puppy and said ill take another five thousand but bob declined no im going to work this announcement interested the tailor deeply whos going to hire you he asked you are kurtz blinked maybe youd like to bet on that too he ventured ill give you odds work is one of the few things i havent tried you need a good salesman no i dont i have seven already say wouldnt you like the trade of the whole younger set i can bring you a lot of fresh customers fellows like me fresh customers is right laughed kurtz then sobered quickly youre joking of course im so serious i could cry how much is it worth to you to make clothes for my crowd well the tailor considered quite a bit the boys like to see dick trimmed its a matter of principle with them never to let him win a bet and theyd do anything for me youre the best tailor in the city but too conservative now im going to bring you fifty new accounts every one good for better than two thousand a year thats a hundred thousand dollars how much am i offered going going wait a minute would you stick to me for six months if i took you on my dear kurtz ill poultice myself upon you for life ill guarantee myself not to slide slip wrinkle or skid thirty years hence when you come hobbling down to business youll find me here mr kurtz dealt in novelties and the idea of a society salesman was sufficiently new to appeal to his commercial sense ill pay you twenty per cent he offered for all the new names you put on my books make it twentyfive on first orders and twenty on repeaters ill bring my own luncheon and pay my carfare there wouldnt be any profit left demurred kurtz good then its a bargain twentyfive and twenty now watch me grab the adolescent offshoots of our famous four hundred bob chased ying into a corner captured him then took a bus up the avenue to the college club for luncheon at three oclock he returned accompanied by four flushed young men whose names gave kurtz a thrill in spite of their modish appearance they declared themselves indecently shabby and allowed bob to order for them a favor which he performed with a rajahs lofty disregard of expense he sat upon one of the carved tables teasing ying and selecting samples as if for a quartette of bridegrooms being bosom cronies of mr cady the four youths needed little urging when they had gone in to be measured kurtz said guardedly whew thats more stuff than ive sold in two weeks a mere trifle bob grinned happily say kurtz this is the life this is the job for me panhandling juvenile plutocrats no office hours no heavy lifting and thursdays off im going to make you famous youll break me with another run like this how much did they order the proprietor ran over his figures incredulously twentyfour sack suits two ridingsuits one knicker four evening suits four dinnersuits forty fancy waistcoats sixteen evening waistcoats four pairs ridingbreeches four motorcoats three vicuna overcoats two ulsters you dont think theyre bluffing why should they bluff theyll never discover how many suits they have now figure it up and tell me the bad news mr kurtz did as directed announcing fiftyfive hundred and five dollars pikers exclaimed the new salesman then he began laboriously to compute twentyfive per cent of the sum using as a pad a bolt of expensive whitesilk vest material thirteen hundred and seventysix dollars and twentyfive cents is my blackmail kurtz thats what i call a safe and sane fourth not bad for dull times and yet it might be better anyhow its the hardest thirteen hundred and seventysix dollars i ever earned hard the merchants lips twitched oscillating his cigar violently hard ill bet those fellows even bought your lunch i suppose you mean its the first money you ever earned he seemed to choke over the last word well its worth something to get men like these on the books but thirteen hundred and seventysix dollars and twentyfive cents mr kurtz gulped in one day why i could buy a farm for that how much will you have to earn to cover your living expenses for six months ah there we journey into the realm of purest speculation bob favored him with a sunny smile as well ask me how much my living expenses must be in order to cover my earnings whatever one is the other will be approximately ditto or perhaps slightly in excess thereof anyhow nothing but rigid economy bane of my life will make the one fit into the other but i have a thought something tells me these boys need white flannels so get out your stock kurtz if they cant play tennis they must learn for my sake bobs remarkable stroke of fortune called for a celebration and his four customers clamored that he squander his first profits forthwith ordinarily such a course would have been just to his liking but now he was dying to tell lorelei of his triumph and fearing to trust himself with even one drink he escaped from his friends as soon as possible thus it chanced that he arrived home sober it was a happy homecoming for ying was adorable and made his way instantly into loreleis heart while bob was in a state of exaltation he had no desire to bind himself to kurtzs service for six months or for any other period nor had he the least thought of living up to his agreement until lorelei began to treat the matter seriously then he objected blankly why it was all right as a joke but i dont want to be a tailor theres no romance in woolen goods how much do you owe she asked really ive no idea its something you dont have to remember somebody always reminds you in plenty of time and then you borrow enough to pay up lets forget the romance and pay up without borrowing remember you have two families to support noting that the idea of permanent employment galled him she added craftily of course youll never sell another lot of clothes like this but why not its like selling candy to a child you cant go with that crowd without drinking is that so now you sit tight and hold your hat on i can make that business pay if i try and still stay in the rainmakers union theres big money in it enough so we can live the way we want to im sick of this telephonebooth anyhow well present it to some nice newsboy and rent an apartment with a closet this ones so small i dont dare to let my trousers bag besides weve been under cover long enough and i want you to meet the people i know we can afford the expense now that im making thirteen hundred and seventysix dollars and twentyfive cents a day i should like to know nice people lorelei confessed im sick of the kind ive met the men are indecent and the women are vulgar ive always wanted to know the other kind bob was delighted his fancy took fire and already he was far along toward prosperity youll make a hit with the younger set youll be a perfect rave bert hayman told me today that his married sister is entertaining a lot and since the drama will be tottering on its way to destruction without you in a few days ill tell him to see that were invited out to long island for a weekend chapter xxii under loreleis encouragement bob put in the next two weeks to good advantage in fact so obsessed was he with his new employment that it was not long before his imaginary bet with cady assumed reality in his mind moreover it became gossip around his clubs and in quarters where he was well known his method of winning the wager was deemed not only characteristic but ingenious his exploits were famous and his friends rejoicing in one more display of eccentricity and relishing any mild misfortune to dick cady in the majority of cases changed tailors business at kurtzs increased so substantially that bob was treated with a reverential amazement by every one in the shop the other salesmen gazed upon him with envy kurtzs bearing changed in a way that was extremely gratifying to one who had been universally accounted a failure and bob expanded under success he began to feel more than mere amusement in his experiment his marriage in some way had become public but although it occasioned some comment the affair was too old to be of much news value and therefore it did not get into the papers except as an announcement now that he had escaped the disagreeable notoriety he had expected and was possessed of larger means bob inordinately proud of his wifes beauty and boyishly eager to display it undertook to win social recognition for her it was no difficult task for one with his wide acquaintance to make a beginning lorelei was surprised and delighted one day to receive an invitation for her and her husband to spend a weekend at fennellcourt the country home of bert haymans sister she had not been sorry to give up her theatrical work and the prospect of meeting nice people of leaving for good and all the sordid unhealthy atmosphere of broadway bathed her in a glow of anticipation she had considerable knowledge of rich men in their hours of recreation at least but of their women she knew little and nothing whatever of the life which went on in exclusive circles during the fortnight of preparation before the visit her feelings more nearly approached stagefright than upon the occasion of her first public appearance fennellcourt is one of the showplaces of the wheatley hills section the house itself is a pretentious structure of brick and terracotta crowning a hill a formal and a sunken garden the latter with a pergola and a temple of venus grassy terraces rows and clumps of ornamental trees and dwarfed shrubs dazzling patches of flowers and empty green lawns evidence the skill of a highly paid landscapeartist while stables greenhouses a natatorium tennis and squash courts in the background testify to the expensive habits of the owners the gardens are a feature of the estate a fortune is represented in the stone pools the massive urns the statuary and the potted plants spotless brillianthued tiled walks lead between riotous beds ablaze with every color and the main driveway swings to the crest of a ridge that overlooks this charming prospect bert hayman drove the whartons out from the city and loreleis first glimpse of fennellcourt was such that she forgot her vague dislike of hayman himself bert who had met her and bob for luncheon had turned out to be instead of a polished man of the world a glib youth with an artificial laugh and a pair of sober heavylidded eyes loreleis shyness at meeting him had quickly disappeared when she found that he knew more theatrical people than she and that he was quite unable to talk interestingly about anything except choruses and coryphees of the former he was a merciless critic of the latter he was an enthusiastic supporter that he possessed a keen appreciation of feminine beauty he showed by surrendering unconditionally to loreleis charms she might have been flattered had he not pressed his attentions overboldly as it was seeing that bob was pleased at the tribute to his wifes loveliness rather than offended at his friends effrontery she did her best to smother her resentment as haymans car rolled up the driveway and the beauties of fennellcourt displayed themselves lorelei found her heart throbbing violently was not this the beginning of a glorious adventure was not life unfolding at last was she not upon the threshold of a new world the flutter in her breast was answer bert led the way through an impressive hall that bisected the building then out upon a stately balustraded stone terrace where in the grateful shade of gaudy awnings a dozen people were chatting at teatables mrs fennell the hostess a plainfaced dumpy young matron welcomed the newcomers then made lorelei known as for bob he needed no introductions a noisy outburst greeted him and loreleis heart warmed at the welcome there were a few embarrassing moments when she felt critical eyes measuring her but her first instinctive appraisal of the other women made her easy it needed no more than a modest estimate of her own attractions to tell her that she was the smartest person in this smart assembly the swift startled admiration of the men proved it beyond question a few moments of chatter then she and bob were led into the house again and up to a cool wide bedroom as lorelei removed her motorcoat and bonnet she exclaimed breathlessly what a gorgeous house and those people they werent the least bit formal bob laughed formality is about the last thing theyre famous for theres liable to be too much informality say you made those dames look like the monday morning washladies parade i knew you would you said this was the younger set but that awful thompsonbellaire widow is here and that blonde girl i met with her alice wyeth yes i thought she was going to kiss you bob grinned so did i she will too if she feels like it wont you have anything to say about it what could i say alice does just as she likes so does everybody else for that matter ive never gone in for this sort of thing very much after a moment lorelei ventured i suppose theyre all hard drinkers that wasnt spring water you saw in their glasses are you going to lorelei eyed him anxiously i cant very well make myself conspicuous by refusing everything i dont want to look like a zebra in a henyard and a cocktail before dinner wouldnt hurt anybody noting his wifes expression he kissed her lightly now dont spoil your first party by worrying over me just forget youre married and have a good time music greeted them as they descended the stairs and they found some of the guests dancing to the strains of a giant orchestrion built into the musicroom hayman promptly seized upon lorelei and whirled her away but not before she saw the wyeth blonde making for bob as an eagle makes for its prey society was tangomad the guests could not wait for evening but indulged their latest fancy in the open air and in the light of day doubtless the naiads used to dance in daylight when they made merry but modern terpsichorean figures are suitable only for the evening the spectacle of a redfaced haremskirted matron wabbling through a onestep her billowing amplitude restrained only by a boneless sixinch corset is even less classic than the antics of a dancing bear guests continued to arrive from time to time some from westchester and the connecticut shore others from neighboring estates one couple in ridingclothes out for a gallop dismounted and stayed for a trot the huge tiled terrace began to resemble a broadway the dansant there was more freedom more vivacity than lorelei was accustomed to even in the gayest downtown resorts the fun was swift and hilarious there was a great deal of drinking bob after a manful struggle against his desires and a frightened resistance to the advances of miss wyeth had fled to the billiardroom the widow tb odorous of cocktails plowed through the intricacies of the latest dances wallowing like a bluffbowed tramp steamer full to the hatches with a cargo of rum and sugar bert hayman fatuously inflamed with loreleis beauty waged a bitter contest with the other men for her favor he appropriated her he was affectionate he ventured to become suggestive in a snickering covert way his intimate manner of dancing would not have been tolerated in any public place and lorelei was upon the point of objecting until she saw that the others men and women alike were exaggerating the movements and entwining their limbs even more pronouncedly harden fennell loreleis host explained we dont dance in the cafes any more theyre so strict its no fun fennell was a slight man of thirty or fifty colorless of face and predatory of nose he had a shocking sense of humor which he displayed by telling lorelei a story that left her mute with indignation until she saw that he was quite unconscious of any breach of etiquette when he finally left her she was sadly bewildered and found herself wondering if the occurrences of this afternoon were not a part of some bad dream certainly such an erotic atmosphere could not be considered smart this complete freedom from restraint could not be a recognized social usage the suspicion that fennell had presumed upon her reputation as a showgirl to lower the bars of decorum troubled her until she heard him repeat his vile story to other women from the general laughter she judged that her own ideas would be thought puritanical she became interested in watching miss courtenay the girl in the ridinghabit one of the seasons debutantes who it seemed was especially susceptible to the influence of liquor if you shake a bartowel at elizabeth she goes under the table bert hayman explained we love to get her full it excited great merriment when some time later miss courtenay had to be sent home in an automobile leaving her saddlehorse to be led by her escort lorelei was glad when it came time to dress for dinner as she went to her room mrs fennell stopped her on the stairs to say my dear youre stunning in that little black and white where did you get it lorelei gave her the name of her tailor really i never heard of her mrs fennell smiled and laid a soft hand upon her guests arm elizabeth courtenay was frantically jealous of you of me i dont understand she and bert are great friends and hes gone perfectly daft over you why hes telling everybody lorelei flushed to the evident amusement of her hostess who ran on oh bert means it i never heard him rave so quite a compliment my dear he declares hes going to win you so make up your mind to it he never takes no for an answer with a playful pat she went on her way leaving the young wife weak with dismay when bob came in he betrayed an elation only too familiar youve been drinking cried lorelei i had to i ran fifteen three times my abstinence is the marvel of the whole party why clayton has composed a song about it im afraid say you cant help sneezing when you have a cold whats a fellow going to do in a crowd like this but dont worry i know when to quit in truth he did seem better able to take care of himself than most of the men lorelei had seen so she said no more as he throttled himself with his evening tie bob gasped having a good time yees lorelei could not summon courage for a negative answer she could not confess that her dream had turned out wretchedly and that what bob seemed to consider simply the usual thing impressed her as abnormal and wanton well thats good he said im not strong for these weekend slaughters but its something youll have to do is all society like this she inquired umm yes and no society is like a layercake because its made of dough bob laughed partly anyhow the upper crust is icy and while the lower layer is just as rich as those above its more indigestible theres the heavy soggy layers in between too i dont know any of that crowd theyre mostly dodos the kind that endow colleges this younger set keeps the whole cake from getting tasteless after a while lorelei ventured im still a little nervous i wish youd stay close to me this evening cant be done bob declared its a rule at fennellcourt that husbands must ignore their wives betty doesnt invite many married couples and a wifelover is considered a pest when in rome do as the tourists do lorelei finished dressing in silence dinner was quite different to anything bobs wife had ever experienced and if the afternoon had been embarrassing to her the evening was a trial as the cocktails were served harden fennell distinguished himself by losing his balance and falling backward to the great amusement of his guests no one went to his assistance he regained his feet by climbing a highbacked chair hand over hand and during the dinner he sat for the most part in a comatose state his eyes bleared and staring his tongue unresponsive lorelei had little opportunity of watching him since bert hayman monopolized her attention the latter made love openly violently now and it added to her general disgust to see that bob had again fallen into the clutches of miss wyeth who made no secret of her fondness for him lorelei was not the only one to take special note of the blonde girls infatuation mrs thompsonbellaire was equally observant and at length made her disapproval patent by a remark that set the table laughing and drove the blood from loreleis face as if further to vent her resentment at bob the widow turned spitefully upon his wife seeing lorelei wince hayman murmured consolingly oh dont mind the old heifer shes jealous of any man alice speaks to but mrs thompsonbellaire seemed to take a quenchless delight in embarrassing her victim and sometime later lorelei heard her explain to the man on her right we werent surprised in the least bobs always doing some crazy thing when hes drunk his latest fancy pretty of course but from some western village i believe cant possibly last why should it the words were purposely made audible and during the rest of the meal when mrs thompsonbellaire was not bitingly sarcastic to lorelei she was offensively patronizing bert hayman it transpired was not only an authority on musical comedies and pony ballets but he was equally well posted on dogs and a debutante across the table appealed to him for advice in breeding an airedale bitch she had purchased at the last show the discussion that followed was sufficiently frank to embarrass the aristocratic airedale herself had she been present but it did not appear to shock the diners mrs madden a neighbor who was a leader in the polo set dropped in for coffee and a cigarette lorelei was surprised to see her clad in a wellfitting mans dinnersuit mrs maddens hair was tightly drawn back with a neat part on the left side she smoked extra large cigarettes from a mans jeweled case her voice was coarse her mannerisms distinctly masculine nor was this eccentricity a passing whim she masqueraded thus so hayman affirmed whenever she dared and had once attempted to attend a horseshow in trousers after dinner lorelei had a better opportunity than during the afternoon of becoming acquainted with the women of the party but the experience was not pleasant mrs thompsonbellaire had struck a popular note by patronizing her and the other women followed suit lorelei amused and interested them in a casual way but she was made to understand that they regarded her not as bobs wife in any real sense but rather as his latest and most fleeting fancy his marriage they seemed to look upon as a bizarre adventure such as might happen to any man in their set who was looking for amusement there was more dancing during the evening miss wyeth continued to monopolize bob and lorelei was offended to note that his resistance gave signs of weakening she smothered her feelings however and remonstrated gently only to find that he was in no condition to listen the dinner had been too much for him there were many gaieties to enliven the party and although outward decencies were observed after a fashion lorelei was sickened by the sheer license that she felt on every hand unable to endure the growing heat of haymans advances she slipped away at last and hid herself in another room only to overhear a quarrel between alice wyeth and mrs thompsonbellaire the fierceness of which was only equaled by its absurdity lorelei stole out of the room again with ears burning her dislike of the muscular widow had turned to loathing and she was glad to return to the lights and laughter she had a wild desire to make her excuses and escape from fennellcourt but bob had disappeared and she gathered that he and bert were playing off some fabulous wager in the billiardroom pleading a headache she excused herself as soon as she could so sorry said mrs fennell then with a knowing laugh theres no likelihood of bobs annoying you for some time bertie will see to that chapter xxiii once in her room lorelei gave way to the indignation that had been slowly growing in her breast how dared bob introduce her to such people if this was the world in which he had moved before his marriage he had shown his wife an insult by bringing her into it surely people like the fennells bert hayman mrs thompsonbellaire the madden woman were not typical members of new yorks exclusive circles applied to them smart was a laughably inadequate term they were worse than fast they were frankly vicious this was more than a gay weekend party it was an orgy loreleis anger at her betrayal was so keen that she dared not send for bob immediately for fear of speaking too violently but she assured herself that she would leave in the morning even though he chose to remain still in a blazing temper she disrobed and sat down to calm herself and to wait for her husband a halfhour passed then another at last she sent a maid in quest of him but the report she received was not reassuring bob was scarcely in a condition to come to his room loreleis lips were white as she dismissed the servant by and by the music ceased she heard people passing in the hall and distinguished betty fennells voice bidding good night to some one still she waited heavy with resentment sick from disillusionment she finally crept into bed leaving one electric candle burning upon her dressingtable although she knew she could not sleep she determined to postpone a scene with bob by feigning slumber when the door opened with a cautious hand she closed her eyes and lay still she heard bob turn the key and tiptoe toward her but even when he stood over her and she caught the odor of his garments she did not lift her lids a moment passed then some sixth sense gave her warning and her eyes flew open hayman was standing at the bedside peering down at her he extended a cautious hand saying dont make a fuss everything is all lorelei spoke sharply but with a restraint that surprised her what are you doing here what am i why nothing especial had to tell you good night you know he laughed guardedly nervously she saw that he was considerably drunker than when she had escaped from his attentions but evidently he knew quite well what he was about kindly get out and close the door after you she directed still without raising her voice the doors closed and locked he snickered lorelei sat up with eyes blazing oh dont worry about bob muttered hayman reassuringly bobs good for two hours yet ive seen to that and he couldnt find his way upstairs anyhow say i want to talk to you youve got me going lorelei youve been drinking mr hayman im willing to think that you made a mistake in the room if you go at once the intruder took no warning from her crisp tones nor from the fact that her twilight eyes were as dark as a midnight sky on the contrary he suddenly bent low over her his odorous breath beating into her face his arms reaching for her with the lithe alertness of a leopard she evaded him the next instant the bed was between them and she had whipped a negligee about her for an instant they faced each other then she pointed a quivering arm gasping in a voice that sounded strange and throaty to her ears get out get out you beast hayman was unused to opposition he had engineered this moment carefully a galling anger rose to meet hers as he felt his labors wasted dont get flighty he growled you knew id come didnt you whyd you leave your door unlocked if you didnt expect me lorelei stepped to her dressingtable and pressed the pearl pushbutton holding her finger upon it and staring at hayman oh ring and be damned he cried call bob ill tell him you asked me in he moved toward her his body swaying his hands shaking his face convulsed but as he groped forward she snatched one of the electric candlesticks from among her toilet articles and swung it above her head the fixture was of heavy brass and its momentum ripped the connection from its socket her arm was tense with the strength of utter loathing as she brought the weapon down hayman reeled away covering his face with his hands and cursing wildly then profiting by his retreat lorelei was at the door had turned the key and was in the hall before he could prevent her guided more by instinct than by reason or memory she found mrs fennells chamber and pounded upon its door with blind fury she heard a stir from the direction whence she had come and haymans voice calling something unintelligible then mrs fennells startled face appeared before her whats the matter my dear youll wake everybody in the house your brother forced his way into my room what are you talking about mrs fennell drew her guest swiftly inside hush dont make a show of yourself whas all this came from harden fennell who was sprawled in a chintzcovered easychair minus coat waistcoat and collar he rose slowly as lorelei incoherent with rage poured out her story whas trouble he mumbled bobs all right and sos bert theyre both drunk but bobs the drunkes whatre you talkin about anyhow be still his wife cried sharply its bertie again then of lorelei she inquired but why did you let him into your room if if you were going to quarrel mrs fennell now now dont be silly bertie didnt mean anything hes intoxicated and theres no harm done you said you struck him with something i presume hes hurt and everybody in the house will know about it got into your room eh harden pennell said thickly then exploded in moist laughter berties work is all right but its coarse dont you mind him mrs wharton will you send some one for bob lorelei asked more quietly i want to leave but her hostess protested now why stir up trouble bob is drunk he and bertie are old friends bertie will apologize in the morning and after all it was nothing i told you he was mad about you hes just like any other man and you shouldnt have encouraged him will you send for my husband mrs fennells gaze hardened she stiffened herself saying coldly why certainly if you insist upon rousing the whole household but hes in no condition to understand this silly affair you might have some consideration for us sure echoed the husband go to sleep and forget it dont spoil the party you realize we have other guests snapped mrs fennell bright disks of color were burning in loreleis cheeks she was smiling peculiarly rest easy she said ive no wish to embarrass you nor to drag my husband into this rotten business it seems hes as modern as the rest of you but im oldfashioned there came a knock at the door and haymans voice calling betty let me in his sister opened the door an inch or two you mustnt come in now she expostulated then cried sharply why youre badly hurt youre all bloody as hayman agreed in a burst of profanity she exclaimed fretfully oh this is dreadful go to your room for heavens sake ill see what i can do with this with mrs wharton bert continued to growl until his brotherinlaw led him away down the hall then mrs fennell turned acidly upon her outraged guest well youve caused enough trouble it seems to me without involving the rest of us in it a woman of your experience should be more careful im sure bertie never would have taken such a liberty if he hadnt thought you were accustomed to such things lorelei broke out sharply youre as badly mistaken as your brother was but i should have been more careful i suppose a woman of my experience shouldnt have come here at all now i dont want to cause any trouble nor scandal so if youll permit me to thank you for your hospitality ill leave at once leave at this hour in ten minutes if youll rouse a chauffeur and let him drive me to the station nonsense you cant get bob bob neednt know anything about it im sure that will be pleasanter all around ill go alone loreleis forced smile bared her even white teeth of course if its too much trouble i can walk no trouble at all mrs fennell showed some relief i think youre acting very rudely but i dare say it would save a lot of unpleasantness berties furious he and bob might fight i im dreadfully sorry still i cant permit you in ten minutes then if theres no train i may ask your chauffeur to drive me into the city why to be sure er what shall i tell bob when he asks for you use your own judgment please you can handle drunken men better than i and dont trouble to send a maid to my room ill be downstairs when the car comes the hostess continued to demur feebly but lorelei cut short any further discussion and once behind her own locked door she dressed with feverish haste her only desire now was to escape from fennellcourt and all its guests as quickly as possible her thoughts concerning bob at the moment were too much involved in anger at the fennells and at hayman to be quite coherent she was pacing the gloom of the portecochere when an automobile swung out from among the trees and swept the shadows flying with its brushes of flame as she directed the driver from an open window behind her came a drunken shout a burst of mens laughter followed the car as it rolled away so that was the charmed circle to which she had aspired those the people she had envied behind her was that life to which she had sold herself and this was the end of her dream of fine ladies and gallant gentlemen lorelei scarcely knew whether to laugh or to cry as she stared out at the night shapes capering past she felt acute personal shame that she had been tricked into even a brief association with so vile a crew that uproar of mens voices rang in her ears like a jeering farewell and she realized that in all probability her flight would appear ridiculous to bobs friends women like the kalsomined widow the masculine matron the jaded wyeth girl would echo that laughter and score her with their gossip on the morrow the thought turned her mind bitterly toward bob he had defiled her by bringing her into contact with those libertines he had left her defenseless against their insults and unprotected from the assaults of men he knew to be capable of anything he had told her to forget she was married and have a good time he had refused her appeal for protection she asked herself dazedly what sort of a creature he could be of a sudden the old life of the theater and the cafe seemed clean as opposed to the fetid existence behind her even jim adventurer crook blackmailer that he was appeared wholesome compared with men like hayman and his brotherinlaw although lorelei under ordinary circumstances was eventempered her anger once aroused was tenacious as she brooded over her humiliation her indignation at bob began to take definite shape and purpose she reached the little apartment in the hushed hours before the dawn and straightway began her packing since bob was doubtless in a drunken stupor which would last for hours she did not hurry only once did she halt in her labors and then only from surprise in a bureau drawer she uncovered a bundle of letters and documents addressed to her husband which in some way aroused her curiosity swallowing her qualms she examined the contents they proved to be in the main letters from bobs mother and father urging him to break off his marriage those from mr wharton were characteristically intolerant and dictatorial those from bobs mother were plaintive and infinitely sad both parents she perceived had exhausted every effort to win their son from his infatuation both believed lorelei to be an infamous woman bent upon his destruction and judging from the typewritten reports inclosed with some of the fathers letters there was ample reason for such a belief these reports covered loreleis every movement they bared every bit of ancient scandal connected with her they recounted salacious stage gossip as fact and falsely construed those actions which were capable of more than one interpretation it gave the girl a peculiar sensation of unreality to see her life laid out before her eyes in so distorted a shape and when she read the businesslike biographies of herself and the members of her family she could only marvel at bobs faith for evidently he had not answered a single letter nevetherless after preparing an early breakfast she sent her trunks downstairs and phoned for a taxicab chapter xxiv on tuesday afternoon a badly shaken exceedingly frightened young man called at campbell popes boardinghouse good lord bob been on another bat cried pope at sight of his caller wharton took a fleeting glance at himself in a mirror and nodded noting for the first time the sacks beneath his eyes the haggard lines from nostrils to lipcorners im all in loreleis quit me he said dully quit you pope frowned tell me about it well i climbed the vine again and fell off she packed up disappeared been gone since saturday night and i cant find her nobody seems to know where she is i came up for air sunday but im hard hit pope im ready to quit the game if i cant find her me for a seafoam pillow sure oh im not kidding ill start walking from here toward jersey god i keep thinking that maybe she took the river you see im all gone he sank into a chair twitching and trembling in a nervous collapse better have a drink pope suggested but bob returned roughly thats what broke up the sketch i got stewed at fennellcourt highhat weekend party fast crowd and the usual trimmings never again that is if i find my wife fennellcourt suppose you tell me all about it if theres a chance that its suicide popes reportorial instinct brought the last word into juxtaposition with fennellcourt and he saw black headlines judge for yourself maybe you can help me nobody else can bob recounted the story of the houseparty how he and lorelei had met bert hayman how once in the company of his old friends he had succumbed to his weakness and how he had caroused most of saturday night he told pope that he could remember little of sundays occurrences having been plunged in an alcoholic stupor so benumbing that not until late that evening had he fully grasped the fact that lorelei had gone even then he was too befuddled to act neither mrs fennell nor her husband could give him any help and bert hayman who had been with lorelei all saturday evening had no explanation to give of her departure bob remembered in passing that bert had been confined to his room all day sunday as the result of a fall or an accident of some sort monday morning while still suffering from the effects of his spree bob had returned to the city to find his home deserted and for twentyfour sleepless hours now he had been hunting for his wife he had called up loreleis family but they could give him no clue nor could he find trace of her in any other quarter so as a last resort before calling in the police he had come to pope when he had finished his somewhat muddled tale he stared at the critic with a look of dumb appeal campbell began in a matteroffact positive tone shes altogether too healthy to think of suicide rest easy on that score youre weak enough emotionally to do such a thing but not she besides why should she i cant imagine that any act of yours could very deeply offend anybody even your wife however he studied briefly have you been to see miss demorest sure adoree hasnt seen her possibly pope eyed his caller speculatively so you decided to jimmy her into society eh who was at the party oh lord he exclaimed as bob muttered over the list of names how did she compare with those sacred cows oh great the men went crazy over her i knew they would but how did the women treat her why all right i didnt notice anything what no of course you didnt you were probably too drunk to notice much bob flushed you introduced her to the fastest people in new york then left her entirely to her own resources while you went away and made an ass of yourself well something must have happened to alarm her and since you were too maudlin to be of any assistance she evidently took the bit in her teeth i cant blame her for heavens sake why did you set her in with that crowd if you wanted to take her slumming why didnt you hire a guide and go into the redlight district bob defended himself listlessly thats the only crowd i know its the only set thats open to a pittsburg furnacemans son those people arent so bad i guess theyre no worse than the rest if a person goes looking for nastiness he can find it nearly anywhere i never did and i never saw anything very scandalous around that bunch ones observations are never very keen when theyre made through the bottom of a glass observed pope bob exploded irritably all right lieutenant play jerusalem on the cornet while i pass the tambourine damn the postmortems i want my wife not a ballington booth on the terrors of intemperance ive got to have her too i cant last this way shes the only person who can straighten me up i was doing fine had a job ill go straight to hell again if i dont find her there was no doubt of the mans sincerity his mental and his physical condition were obvious pope did his best to repair the wreckage in some degree and having quieted the sufferer he set out for miss demorests home adoree clad in a slightly soiled negligee answered his ring then recognizing him blocked the door hastily exposing a face overcast with defiance and contempt aha she exclaimed aha and popes sensitive ego recoiled before the fierce challenge of her tone physically the caller stood his ground but inwardly he retreated in disorder adoree never failed to affect him uncomfortably for he was conscious of having wronged her and he could in no way reconcile her public reputation with his personal impressions of her his inability to keep her notorious character constantly in mind made him angry with himself and further she offended him by assuming bewilderingly different aspects every time they met invariably she greeted him with contumely invariably he arose to the challenge and overcame her attack invariably she fought him on every subject and yet all the time he vaguely suspected that they were really in complete accord and growing to like each other ive come to see lorelei he explained affably oh youre looking for scandal eh breathed miss demorest well you wont get it bodysnatcher pope bowed gravely you overwhelm me with your courtesy he said i do not represent the press today im here as a friend bobs nearly dead serves him right i suppose youve left another reporter to take down his dying words for the evening paper dont be silly i want to see shes not here then id like to talk with you the door opened slightly and pope smiled whereupon the opening narrowed no you cant come in ive just cleaned house in desperation the man exclaimed i wont sit down but i must talk to you really i must about ducks if nothing else ducks adorees expression altered lets be sensible i want you to like me pope tried to appear amiable but the effort resulted in a painful smirk huh we like the same things lets be friends you neednt tell me anything about lorelei but i do want your advice about bob i suppose theres no reason why you shouldnt come in youll probably wriggle in somehow even if you have to steal a key if you dont know the truth youll probably make up something about lorelei as you did about me buzzard pope began to perspire as he always did when deeply embarrassed but the door swung wide and he entered with a strained unnatural smile upon his face you see im not concealing her anywhere miss demorest challenged of course not we never suspected you but were afraid something has happened to her something has what adoree tossed her head youre paid to find out see here im not always a newspaper man try and forget that side of me for once bob will drink himself to death or do something equally foolish if lorelei doesnt come back hes repentant hes in a terrible condition i really believe she can straighten him out if shell have patience and you know hes too good a man to lose he thinks she left him because he got drunk but im sure there must have been some other reason i should say there was you want scandal ill give you some adorees eyes were flashing now if hes going to drown himself he ought to realize what he did and think it over when he comes up for the third time have you any idea what that girl went through out there on long island listen she plumped herself down beside pope and began to talk swiftly with an intensity of indignation that made her forgetful of her dishabille she was animated she had an expressive impulsive manner of using her hands when interested and now she gesticulated violently she also squirmed bounced hitched flounced she seized popes arm she emphasized her points from time to time by a shake or by a dig of her white fingers when she had finished her story her shocked blue eyes interrogated his and the critic roused himself with an effort he found that he was tightly holding the fingers of her right hand but dropped them and cleared his throat you say shes staying here with you i didnt say so but she is doesnt she care for bob any more yyes at first she was furious but weve talked a good deal and i think she does care away down underneath she may not know it herself but she does especially now that what asked pope as adoree hesitated and flushed nothing but she wont go back she declares she wont spoil her whole life for a drunken wretch like him and shes quite right of course shes quite wrong of course bobs done pretty well for a man of his type and hes had a hard lesson after all its a womans part to sacrifice shes not happy unless she gives more than she gets you and i must bring them together how pope had been thinking while he talked and now he sketched his plan eagerly you are perfectly detestable and horrid she told him when he had finished but i suppose there must be some good in you dont think you argued me into this however for you didnt theres an altogether different reason why i want those two to make up she laid her hand upon his arm again and when pope caught her meaning his sallow cheeks were glowing and his eyes as bright as hers gee youre all right said he ill call for you after the show adorees smile was uncertain as she demurred perhaps youd better meet me here what will people say but pope was insistent we are accustomed to resent the efforts of our friends to arrange our affairs for us and we pray for deliverance from their mistakes yet without their assistance we would often make miserable failures of our lives so it was in the case of bob and lorelei burning with shame and resentment she had been strong in her determination to end their marriage and this frame of mind had continued for some time but as her anger cooled she dimly understood that a change had come over her and that she no longer looked upon the world with the eyes of a girl simultaneously there came another discovery which completely upset all her calculations and to which she had not fully adjusted herself even up to the time of the critics visit to adoree one great mystery she had solved another the deepest mystery of a womans life had begun to unfold and as yet she could scarcely give it credence she was surprised when adoree brought campbell pope home with her that night and she was somewhat diverted by the complete change in their mutual attitude now that the first clash was over now that they had expressed their dislike and disapproval of each other they no longer quarreled pope was frankly admiring and adoree could not conceal her awe at campbells literary and musical ability she explained to lorelei i asked him in for the sake of the piano i knew you were blue and theres nothing so cheering as music but when pope finally got around to play the result was not altogether happy adoree to be sure seemed delighted but lorelei felt herself gripped by a greater loneliness than usual popes music was far from lively and he had cunningly chosen the hour when it exerts its greatest emotional appeal he was artist enough moreover to work his effects with certainty lorelei sought relief at length in the seclusion of adorees rear room and there in the midst of a crying spell bob found her her first quick resentment at the deception practised upon her melted at sight of him for he had suffered and he was evidently suffering now he was not the bob she had known but chastened repentant speechless with a tremulous delight at seeing her again in the next room campbell played on smoothing the way for a reconciliation lorelei found herself in her husbands arms listening dazedly to his passionate protestations and his earnest selfdenunciation bob had received the fright of his life his lesson had been seared into him and he lost no time in telling his wife about it at last lorelei laid her fingers upon his lips her eyes misty and luminous with the light of a new and wondrous certainty wait let me speak she said ive done a lifetime of thinking in these few days im not sorry that i left you for it has enabled me to see clearly but ill never leave you again bob no matter what you do i cant he crushed her to him then held her away at the hint of something unsaid you mean youve begun to love me he inquired gladly perhaps i dont know something has changed tremendously under his bewildered gaze the blood rose warming her cheeks her eyes swam but not with tears her bosom was tremulous with the knowledge that clamored for freedom and yet refused to come dont you understand stupid she said seeing him still mystified she hid her face then whispered in his ear whereupon he fell to trembling and the fervor of his embrace relaxed he held her gently tenderly as if he suddenly found her to be a fragile thing my dear my dear and then he too hid his face as if blinded by a pitiless light when he raised it tears glistened on his lashes and a happiness that was like pain pierced him oh if i had only known he choked kid what a fool ive been never to think that this might come i cant believe it its true she smiled and her cheeks were still dyed with that virginal flush perhaps thats why ive changed toward you something has happened bob and you mustnt leave me now i couldnt bear to do without you you may forgive me he cried but ill never forgive myself to think that i should learn of this right now after what i did well im through making new promises im going to keep some of the old ones i think its about time we both came to earth no need for you youre the sensible one if i cant straighten up on my own account and on yours surely i can and will for this an hour later adoree tiptoed back to the piano after a surreptitious peek into the back room whence nothing but the faintest murmurs issued her face was radiant youve played some highpriced divorce lawyer out of a good case mr cricket she beamed on campbell shes in his lap popes rippling fingers paused his hands dropped and he sighed i could have set them quarreling just as well but the role of cupid suits me tonight his shoulders drooped wearily the feverish brightness of his eyes and the pallor of his thin face indicated that he had indeed spent all his nervous force cupid in a sweater adoree exclaimed well i believe it for your playing made me positively mushy ive been hugging a sofacushion and dreaming of heroes for ever so long why at this moment id marry the janitor with the eager shyness of a boy he inquired do you really like to hear me play can i come and play for you again not without a chaperon she told him positively wool tickles my cheek pope rose hastily and in some embarrassment he could write about love with a cynics pen but he could not bear to talk about it even in a joking way he eyed the speaker with the frightened fascination of a charmed rabbit until she laughed in mischievous enjoyment of his perturbation oh never fear it will take more than music to make me forget what you are say she yawned doubled up her little fists and stretched wont you play something to make those lovers go home so i can go to bed he shook his head not until we go to the nearest cafe and have a bite to eat there are no cafes open at this hour in spite of her protestations that she was not hungry he bore her away with him bareheaded as she was and in the next block they found an unsuspected little place called the chauffeurs lunch where a man was busy making sandwiches of the whitest bread and the most delicioussmelling hamburger for a hungry cabby with a battered hat and there they each ate a bowl of crackers and milk with a baked apple using the arms of their chairs for tables popes bill was forty cents and strangely enough not even when he paid it did he remember that this was the woman for whose company at supper other men paid five hundred dollars chapter xxv bobs work as a salesman continued to be so effective that kurtz finally offered him a salaried position but instead of accepting bob made a counterproposition that caused the little man to gasp briefly it was to extend the scope of the present business by laying in a stock of extravagant highpriced shirt and necktie materials with bob as partner in the new venture kurtz protested that he was not a haberdasher but he was constrained to admit that bob had the right idea of smart business and after some discussion accepted his employees nonchalant offer to go halves on the new venture and share in its profits the fact that bob had no money with which to carry through his part of the deal troubled that youth not in the least kurtzs credit was ample bobs theory of securing the fifth avenue trade was to double existing prices and if this did not bring the business to double them a second time and this theory was correct as he demonstrated when the new department was organized but despite the excellent income he now began to make there was never anything left in the wharton bankaccount for bob moved his wife to a more pretentious apartment on riverside drive and managed to increase their expenses so as to balance his earnings very nicely it was quite a feat to adjust a fixed outlay to a varying income so that nothing whatever should remain and he considered it a strong proof of his capacities that he succeeded by christmas the haberdashery venture had shown such a profit that he began to pile up a small bankaccount in spite of himself so he bought an automobile which served to eat up any monthly profits and guarantee a deficit under the most favorable circumstances being thus relieved of financial uncertainty he laid plans to wrest from kurtz a full partnership in the tailoring business itself the whartons new home was charming and bob provided his wife with every luxury lorelei did not regret that she was prevented from going out as much as formerly her experience at fennellcourt had cured her of any desire to get into her husbands social set and unconsciously she and bob began to develop a real home life as time went on and evidences of prosperity showed themselves loreleis family forgot some of their dislike of bob and became more companionable strangely enough too their cost of living increased in proportion to their friendliness but bob never questioned any amount they asked him for and he swelled their allowance with characteristic prodigality lorelei was proud of him as she had reason to be but she had occasion for sorrow as well his generosity was really big his pagan joyousness banished shadows but he was intensely human in his failings and in spite of his determination to stop drinking in spite of all his earnest promises the old appetite periodically betrayed him for a month for two months at a time he would manfully fight his desires then without excuse without cause just when he was boasting loudest of his victory he would fall and yet drinking did not brutalize him as it does most men he never became disgusting liquor intoxicated him but less in body than in spirit his repentance followed promptly his chagrin was intense and his fear of lorelei almost ludicrous but the girl had acquired a wider charity a gentler patience she grieved she tried to help him and his frailty endeared him to her love had been slow to awaken in fact she had not been definitely aware of its birth but suddenly she had found it flowering in her soul and now it flourished the more as that other interest intensified and began to dominate her bob responded to all her efforts save one she could not make him serious on the whole however they were more happy than they had ever been one day during the slack holiday season hannibal wharton appeared at the kurtz establishment he appraised the elaborate surroundings with a hostile eye and stared at his son impassively so youre a seamstress now he began and bob grinned merkle told me you repaid his loan and had an automobile thats true secondhand car no how much do you owe nothing except for stock stock what do you mean kurtz and i are partners in one end of this business ill be damned breathed mr wharton then he inquired curiously do you like this work its not what i prefer still there is a margin of profit huh i should think so at ninety dollars a suit well this town is full of fools bob agreed but we dress em better than they do in pittsburg after a moments consideration hannibal said slowly mothers at the waldorf she wants to see you youve just about broken her heart bob were not going out much but perhaps we could call on her we i said she wants to see you and not my wife certainly not neither do i you dont seem to understand bob answered smoothly certainly i understand you think ninety dollars is too much for a suit perhaps i can show you something in scarfs of an exclusive design dont be funny growled his father really dad youd better go that suit of yours is a sight somebody may think we made it for you mr wharton remained silent for a moment the situation is impossible and anybody but you would see it we cant accept that woman and we wont shes notorious no more so than i or you for that matter shes a grafter shed quit you if i paid her enough how do you know her mother has been to see me half a dozen times ive offered to pay her anything within reason but theyre holding out for something big you come back bob let her go back to her own people and whats to become of the other one bob was smiling faintly the other one what do you mean i mean there will be three in the family soon dad youre going to be a grandfather the effect of this announcement was unexpected hannibal wharton was momentarily stricken dumb for once he was utterly at a loss then instead of raising his voice he spoke with a sharp stuttering incisiveness so thats her game eh i suppose she thinks shell breed her way into the family well she wont it wont work i was willing to compromise before so long as there was no tangible bond between that family and mine but theyve got their blood mixed with mine theyve got a fingerhold in spite of hell and i suppose theyll hold on but i wont acknowledge a grandchild with scum like that in its veins good god now listen you whartons jaw was outthrust his gaze hard and unwavering no child tainted with that blood will share in one penny of my money now or at any other time understand perfectly bobs color had receded but in no other way did he show his struggle for selfmastery my wife isnt having a baby to spite you and if it ever needs a grandfather well adopt one theyve pulled you down into the mud now theyve tied you there hereditys stronger than you or i watch your child grow up and watch its mothers blood tell then remember that i tried to free you before it was too late well im through this settles me goodby and god help you with that rotten gang hannibal wharton turned and strode out of the room shaking his head and mumbling jimmy knight had fallen upon evil times a combination of circumstances had seriously affected his mode of making a living and that of his friends to outward appearances the frequenters of tony the barbers place were as thrifty as usual but in the pinochleroom at the rear there was gloom reason for these hard times lay in an upheaval of public sentiment that had galvanized the police department into one of its periodic spasms of activity and the cause ran back to a sordid quarrel between two factions of the tenderloin at about the time when jimmy came to new york the contention had become too bitter for the underworld to hold and echoes of it had begun to leak out later it culminated in the murder of the leader of one clique murders it is true are not uncommon in new york but this one was staged in the glare of broadway and with a bold defiance of the law that aroused popular indignation there followed a chain of fortuitous happenings that issued in the capture of the murderers in a widespread exposure of social conditions and in a great outburst of public indignation against a police system that allowed such abuses to exist of course there came a loud protest from the guardians of the law a frantic waving of spotless banners and a prating of virtue but the popular will has a way of obtaining its desires regardless of red tape trickery or politics and in this case it demanded a reorganization of the department and got it discipline suddenly strengthened and as a result gambling almost ceased wiretapping languished organized blackmail was conducted under cover only crime in its crudest forms continued as usual and it followed therefore that jimmy knight was not prosperous had it not been for his share in bobs generosity he would have been forced to the distressing necessity of asking for employmenta thing to curdle his blood it was characteristic of young knight that he did not scruple to accept charity from the man he hated although he cherished the memory of that public beating at bobs hands and the humiliation of it gnawed him like a cancer more than once lately jim had been tempted to turn his knowledge of the hammon suicide into cash but he could think of no safe and certain means of doing so until one day max melcher dropped a bit of intelligence that promised to open a way who do you suppose i just heard from max inquired one raw afternoon in march when he had found jim in their usual haunt lilas lynn jim made no attempt to conceal his surprise and interest where is she she wrote from liverpool asking for money can you beat that money why she had a satchel full whats become of it melcher shrugged shes taken the jumps english derby paris racemeet monte carlo huh she fished all the suckerholes along the route eh of course you cabled her a few cs jim snickered do i look as if i had shes sick got a cough and says its the con she wants to come home jim started say thats no hospital bark of hers its nothing but the coke after a moment he asked casually wheres she stopping liverpool whats her address ill drop her a line to cheer her up she wrote from the hotel melcher checked himself and shot a questioning look at his friend why this sudden charity jims gaze was bland his tone one of wounded innocence cant a guy offer to cheer youre not in the business of cheering sick dames melcher said sharply then after a pause you never came through with me jim there was something phony about lilass getaway she left too suddenly after the hammon suicide and shes been under cover now for eight months i never got it quite right whatre you holding out jim sparred adroitly but without effect oh youve got an ace buried somewhere melcher said youre a shifty guy of course this is a friendly game were playing but just the same i never bettered a poker hand by leaving the room i dont even turn my head to spit when im sitting in with a fellow like you lilas has got something on her mind and i believe ill cable her the price of a ticket that was enough for jim he began to weaken and at last made a clean breast of all the circumstances surrounding jarvis hammons death rather than risk the result of a meeting between max and lilas when he had finished his story melcher was leaning forward his pink smoothshaven agreeable face gravely intent so that was the way of it wharton and merkle and a fourwheeler by god that was nervy on merkles part especially he took a chance and lilas shot the old man eh nobody saw her do it jim explained lorelei was in the diningroom at the time it happened and hammon swore he did it himself he stood on that to the last i didnt know they grew men the size of that fellow max mused after all its the suckers that die game and you were going to put this over singlehanded eh you and lilas perhaps my boy you must learn to shoot before you go hunting why theres a hundred thousand quick money in this if wharton had done the shooting or merkle yes whats the difference who did it why its a cinch get this lilas comes home broke shes sick and sees the undertaker flirting with her so she decides to spill the whole story and take the consequences understand its conscience mr melcher laughed lightly at his little joke a sick womans conscience is an expensive thing it takes money to square it merkle wont stand and wharton cant on account of his wife your sister hell tap his old man and hannibal will loosen for the family honor after theyre dry weve got the hammon widow to work on itll take money to do this protection too well ive got both i suppose well split three ways max pursed his lips thoughtfully nno you and lilas are broke ive got the money and the police ill take half jims acquiescence to these terms came hard and he cursed himself as a fool for putting himself at the mercy of this man he was still raging inwardly when melcher left to send a cablegram but there was ample leisure for reflection during the week that followed and being possessed of some ingenuity jim had formulated a scheme before lilas lynns arrival in due time she came and melcher saw her established at a modest hotel before making known in detail his intentions lilas was little more than a wreck of what she had been it seemed impossible that eight short months could have worked so great a change in one of her youth and strength ill she undoubtedly was she was thin her nerves had yielded to the ravages of the drug and a queer unhealthy pallor had blanched her skin her eyes were big and feverish and restless only at such times as she was without cocaine did her mind suffer when she had it she was unnaturally alert having lately felt the harsh grip of poverty she was obsessed now by the need of money and offered no objections to maxs schemes rather she welcomed them fiercely she and max and jim mapped out a course of action together but a day or two later when jim thought the moment propitious he secured her ear alone and gave voice to his resentment against max as soon as lilas understood his drift she met him more than halfway she was vulturelike in her greed and with a full understanding between them the two conspired to use max only so long and so far as suited their purposes in spite of bob whartons peculiarly mutable temperament he was not remiss in his duties toward lorelei during the period that led up to the birth of their child utterly careless and improvident in his own affairs he was naturally considerate of others and possessed a surprising depth of sympathy hence he met the responsibilities of his present situation with considerable credit one evening he was concerned to find his wife greatly agitated and upon learning the cause his consternation matched hers loreleis eyes were big and frightened as she explained lilas is back she was here today lilas good lord what did she want nothing she just came to see me shes changed dreadfully and talked about nothing except that awful night you remember im nearly in hysterics now that wont do you pass your worries on to me lilas cant make trouble for us without making more for herself but lorelei seemed oppressed with a premonition of trouble im frightened bob she confessed she acted so strangely suppose oh suppose i should have to go to jail now or to court bob took his wife in his arms and did his best to cure her of these sick fancies but it was no easy task to quiet her for a million apprehensions had sprung into life with the reopening of that old horror at last he reminded her gently remember dear your thoughts are like brandingirons just now they leave their marks we want our child to be brave and confident and steadfast not a coward or something worse this is how cowards are made how can a child inherit weakness when its mother is without fear profiting by this experience bob undertook to guard against another visit from lilas he was really worried although he pretended to dismiss the matter as inconsequential and his fears flared into full blaze again a few days later when jimmy knight called upon him and announced cautiously say you know lilas is back well shes gone off her nut shes going to give herself up give herself up how shes going to tell the truth about the hammon affair she thinks shes dying where do we go from here if she does that bob could not conceal his alarm which increased when his brotherinlaw begged him to do something quickly to save them all from disaster i wouldnt come to you jim confessed candidly if i knew what to do for you dont like me and im not crazy about you but weve got to stand together on account of lorelei not that id enjoy a call on the district attorney at any time agreeing that there was no time to waste the two men hastened to lilass hotel only to receive a greeting that was far from auspicious when they had adroitly brought the conversation around to the point at issue lilas explained yes the doctors have ticketed me theyve shown me the gate she coughed hollowly and laid her hand on her chest oh its the white bug that closes the show for me she appeared very ill and it did not occur to bob to doubt her jim began briskly why thats nothing lilas arizona is the place for you arizona is a long jump from broadway ill help you if you need help bob hastened to offer lilas flashed him a grateful glance from eyes that were doubly large and dark against her pallor youre a prince with your money but its too late nonsense oh theyd get me sooner or later i may as well face the music do you mean slow music do you mean the bugs will get you jim inquired no i mean id have to take it on the dodge if i went and whats the use of that ive talked too much with a sudden flash of feeling she cried ive been through hell for eight months and im tired out i came home broke sick thinking of that night when you know i seem to see his face everywhere it bothers me at night i used to dream of my father and a stream of molten steel well the dreams are getting worse only now i see jarviss face in place of my fathers and i tell you i cant stand it i cant stand these dreams and that face of his looking at me all the time so im going to give myself up have it over with and do my penalty maybe i can sleep then if my lungs hold out all right if they dont well ill sleep anyhow you see i cant make a living for i cant go back on the stage why i cant leave this hotel and take my trunks jimmy knight broke out nervously that penalty talk is all right for you lilas but think about the rest of us yes lorelei for instance bob added she isnt strong you mustnt think of doing this thing i know miss lynn nodded im sorry but ill furnish all the money you want she looked her gratitude again you must buck up and try to get well for some time the two men jointly attempted to argue lilas out of her black despondency and when they left it was with a hardwon promise that she would do nothing definite at once outside the room jim heaved a sigh of relief whew i could feel the knot under my ear but glory to god it slipped just the same im going to buy some oakum and make a false beard in case she flops in this way the trap was set and baited so skilfully that the victim was without suspicion that evening lilas jim and max melcher dined together in very good spirits and strangely enough the girl showed an excellent appetite for one so troubled in soul wharton was as good as his word not only did he put lilas in funds but he exerted his every power of persuasion to rouse her from her despondency and reawaken a healthy desire for life it transpired that she had assumed some outrageous obligations and moreover had hired a number of expensive lung specialists for whom she asked him to settle nevertheless he met her demands and was encouraged when she began to purchase a new wardrobe although he considered himself a spendthrift her reckless disregard of money gave him a jolt but he was working to gain time and his relief on loreleis account deadened all other feelings before long he had advanced several thousand dollars to the girl and still her desire for martyrdom had not entirely vanished realizing that the mere presence of one so temperamentally hysterical as she was a constant menace he insisted upon her going south and in order to provide handsomely for her comfort he borrowed from his friends he was aghast when he finally reckoned up the amount he had spent upon her there followed a short interval of relief during which lilas pretended to be making ready then upon the very eve of her departure she sent for him in much haste and awoke him rudely from his trance she began by saying that his kindness and liberality had aroused in her a desire to live and to begin anew if not for her own then for his and loreleis sakes but that she was in terrible trouble her punishment had sought her out after all it was a long time before bob could make head or tail out of what she told him but eventually he learned that in the hour of her deepest dejection she had confided her secret to others and the result of this confidence had now arisen to thwart all their plans with a dizzy feeling of insecurity bob asked who did you tell melcher he sent me money to come home with and he seemed to be my only friend friend i thought you and he were enemies oh he doesnt love me and he doesnt hate me lilas explained he seemed sorry for me and i was grateful for any sympathy no matter where it came from you see i didnt know what i was doing and i didnt realize my mistake until it was too late melcher of all people bob groaned wait thats not all you see i wanted to go clean and yet i was afraid of the police so max advised me to hire a lawyer whod get me off light well i did goldberg i suppose bob breathed a malediction as lilas nodded why didnt you hire a hall or book yourself through the lyceum bureau dont be hard on me lilas had foresworn the stage but she did a creditable bit of emotional acting a frantic woman will do almost anything well present your bill in full whats the next misfortune i had no idea men could be so vile yesterday i told max of the change in my plans that youve made life possible to me and showed me that i couldnt go through without consequences to others he she dropped her hands in a gesture of resignation whats the use you know the kind of man he is go on lilas began to weep silently rocking her body to and fro its just my luck when i had another chance too i dont care for my own sake but i do love lorelei and youve certainly been a prince bob good lord max cant insist on your giving yourself up why thats absurd oh he doesnt care what becomes of me its its lilas broke out in a passion i never thought i was putting you in his power and and lorelei too and jim and mr merkle of course you wont believe that but i cant help what you think i wouldnt blame you for killing me why id go to the chair to keep you people clear but those are the facts now youve got it all max sees money in sight i presume thats all he sees money my god hes mad why he doesnt talk figures that i understand its nothing but blackmail bob and you mustnt stand for it hes a queer man he helped me when i was broke now hed hitch me to a bull and ticket me up the river to get that money why hed strap the coppers on my feet and turn on the juice with his own hand rather than lose this chance as her flow of speech died down to apologetic murmurs bob said gravely i never thought merkle and i could cover a thing like hammons death but after all they cant do much to us its mighty kind of you to say so ill stand whatever comes to me i was thinking more of lorelei shes in no condition bob uttered an exclamation youre right weve got to gain time after the babys born it wont matter so much max is no fool he wont wait besides goldbergs been to see inspector snell already on my account and snell is in the know hes holding back warrants now for all of us i couldnt leave town if i wanted to the numbing force of the calamity coming at this of all times fairly stupefied bob rendering him incapable of clear analysis or even of the suspicions his ordinary intelligence would have prompted why doesnt snell get busy he inquired blankly at which lilas lost her patience dont you see hes in on the graft snell doesnt want to pinch us he doesnt care how jarvis died any more than max or goldberg cares they want money money coin thats how things are run in this town thats how the police are squared if you dont come across theyll try to show that it was murder instead of selfdefense remember it was my gun that killed that did the work and it was found in hammons library before bobs arrival lilas had prepared herself for this scene by a liberal dose of cocaine but the strain of her acting had exhausted her strength her brain was tiring accordingly she excused herself and once in her bathroom prepared a fresh solution of the powder leaving bob the while to meditate upon his plight when she returned her eyes were brighter and she had regained the mastery of her unruly nerves bob looked up with a drawn expression that almost moved her to pity how much do they want he inquired dully dont be a fool bob you helped me i wont see you gouged no matter what you gave theyd frame you over again wed better face it i cant face it he cried alone i would in a minute no court in the world would hold merkle and me for what we did but i cant let em hurt my wife and my kid why lorelei would die of fright he choked and stammered they want money how much merkle is the man theyre after how much he insisted it would take a hundred thousand to square it bob gasped this is the worst dream i ever had i told you i couldnt understand their figures but merkles a millionaire if you had ten dollars youd give one to square a copper wouldnt you well your names wharton and his is merkle theres fifty million dollars behind those two names and max knows it if i had the price id pay it to save you people who helped me when i needed help but what have i got i told max he could go to hell and youd better tell him the same thing now what do you want me to do bobs lips were white stand pat and wait until i rob a bank ive got to buy three weeks time no matter what it costs when he had gone lilas phoned first to melcher and reported progress then she called up jim the latter appeared in person that evening and the two sat until late talking guardedly chapter xxvi there was but one man to whom bob dared appeal in this unhappy situation and that man was john merkle the banker listened gravely to bobs recital then inquired with apparent irrelevance you are mighty fond of lorelei arent you why of course merkle nodded reflectively i was mistaken in you he admitted i didnt think the marriage would last i suppose you are immensely pleased with yourself reformed character arent you his face expressed a cynical inquiry pleased with myself not much lorelei reformed me i didnt have anything to do with it good i wondered if you took all the credit to yourself lorelei did do it and i dont intend to let you forget the fact now about this lynn woman you have been stung bob you think so i wonder dont be a fool you think it is a frameup what else could it be think bob exploded in desperation i cant think with my wife in this condition however if youre right im going to see max melcher and tell him about lorelei then im going to make him wait make him make him yes im going to make him wait bobs lips were white he raised his eyes slowly and merkle saw that they were heavy with resentment nonsense exclaimed the latter where is your common sense never use violence it is antiquated and expensive suppose you let me handle this thing in my own way have you any plan im never without one theyre not all good plans understand some are very bad in fact but you see i have been expecting something like this for a long time i saw blackmail in your brotherinlaws face the night jarvis hammon was killed i dont sleep much so i have time to think and being dyspeptic im always suspicious dyspepsia has spared me many disappointments people are never any worse than i believe them to be you dont believe jim is in this too why he is loreleis brother what possible difference can that make to a man of his stamp the banker demanded querulously dont you know your own brotherinlaw to a conscienceless rogue its no more unnatural to conspire against ones relatives than against total strangers it is the logical thing to do it is natures method of protecting the stranger and its one of the penalties for having relatives you are young and sentimental so i shant tell you what my plan is meanwhile though you may tell lilas that you have acquainted me with the situation and that i am willing to spend a lot of money to avoid publicity do you mean you are willing to pay her merkle smiled sourly let her put her own construction on the statement beyond this merkle would give bob little satisfaction but later in the day after a short telephone conversation he called at one of the uptown political clubs and inquired for senator sabin the senator was expecting him and merkle lost no time in explaining his trouble nature had endowed sabin with the faculty of hearing more than people said and saying less than people heard he sat now with a graven smile upon his fat goodhumored face but with eyes that were serious and watchful only once did he interrupt his callers recital and then at the mention of inspector snell snell he exclaimed sharply are you sure so the woman says sabin nodded he carefully matched his fingers tip to tip and then relapsed into silence merkle went on with his story feeling the while as if he were addressing an audience of two men one a sympathetic convivial soul the other a baffling sinister person behind a mask but when sabin finally spoke it was as neither his voice was friendly and matteroffact this is a bad business john the banker broke out irritably now dont begin that i have a pastor who keeps me in spiritual uncertainty and a doctor who torments me physically and a business thats hell in both directions i didnt come here to swap tears i want help it may cost of course it may i dont expect you to square it with a bunch of double english violets but it can be squared and it must be if only for the sake of hammons women folks it wont serve any good purpose to air that old scandal the senator nodded first we will have to eliminate the gang clean them out he made an expansive eloquent gesture you dont object kill em if necessary merkle growled vindictively very well ill do my best then its done merkle rose with relief shook the senators limp and pudgy hand then departed knowing that the secret of jarvis hammons death was quite as safe in sabins keeping as in his own that plump imperturbable politician had long been one of the triumvirate that ruled the city and merkle knew him to be the tomb of confessions far more startling than this he knew also that although sabin took toll of the public in the way of all powerful political rulers he put no price on his favors that evening inspector snell occupied the same chair in which merkle had sat and found himself the target of sabins veiled stare snell was a bulky forceful unimaginative man he was vastly impressive in his uniform but the senators questions appeared to bewilder him what do you mean melcher the inspector finally inquired he claims you give him protection the officers face purpled oh he does does he well youd know if i did wouldnt you thats how them fellows get along by selling something they cant deliver ever take any of his money not a cent what do you know about the killing of jarvis hammon hammon the steel man why he wasnt killed was he snell was plainly puzzled well well he confessed when the truth had been gently eased into his mind thats news im much obliged for the tip senator wait a minute thats not the idea at all sabin said quickly the woman acted in selfdefense ha they all do im thinking about myself these are big names this is a big case and it will do me a lot of good to work it out it will break you the senator murmured quietly you are getting ahead just as fast as it is possible snell cut out this graverobbing stuff and make some real friends understand you need friends of the right sort and this is your chance for some time longer the two men talked guardedly at last the inspector rose to leave saying i think i have all the details now and ill scatter the gang as quick as possible i can hang something on the woman easily enough and the boys too but its different with max he has a drag leave max to me do you need money not from your friends senator the officer disclaimed hastily im only too glad to help out in any way i can to bob wharton the suspense of the next few days was trying in the extreme particularly as merkle kept declaring there was nothing to report while jimmy knight betrayed an apprehension so pitiable as wellnigh to banish suspicion of his complicity in the plot but before long there came to pass in various quarters certain events which gave bob cause for thought strangely enough these events one and all had some effect either direct or indirect upon the habitues of tony the barbers place to begin with tony himself was summoned to headquarters and forced to spend a distressing halfhour with a harsh illnatured police official as a result of which the pinochleroom at the rear of the barbershop was closed and the door nailed up with an unnatural show of indignation tony warned its frequenters to stay away from his shop naturally he had recourse to melcher who promised to square the misunderstanding but for once melcher failed when his efforts proved fruitless he was puzzled so was tony the man upon whom max relied for help was likewise at a loss and finally hazarded the opinion that tony must have made an enemy of somebody higher up this chilling phenomenon was still a subject of discussion when armistead was arrested for selling cocaine now armisteads addiction to the drug was well known in fact he readily confessed to it but knowing only too well the risks involved in its sale he had never even contemplated such a thing he was outraged and incredulous but a dopeshattered derelict swore out a complaint against him and when armisteads room was searched strange to relate the police discovered a considerable amount of cocaine concealed therein bail was fixed at an unusually high figure even for a felony and max melcher wondered vaguely as he arranged to meet it misfortunes multiplied rapidly on the very next day young sullivan was caught picking pockets in the times square subway station and once more max was forced to journey jailward sullivans story gave his chief still more occasion for thought for this arrest seemed plainly a frame being absurd upon its face the pugilist had huge misshapen paws that could scarcely explore his own much less anothers pockets and his stiffened fingers could not palm a coin in the dark yet a stranger had accused him of deftly lifting a watch it seemed significant that two plainclothes men should have been at sullivans elbow at the moment the prizefighter had acted according to his nature and a fine row had resulted in the midst of which there had dropped out of his clothes a gold watch which sullivan violently protested he had never seen before his imperious demand upon max for help was resentfully couched but melcher dared not refuse to act as his bondsman max was worried when he left the jail and his perturbation increased when he discovered late that night that armistead had disappeared with the evident intention of jumping his bond convinced now that something must be badly out of joint he lost no time in warning lilas lynn to go slow with her blackmailing enterprise indeed he ordered her to drop it entirely until he had time to discover where the trouble lay upon the girl this command had an unexpected effect for not only did it prove to her that max had lost his pull at headquarters but it also strengthened her determination to betray him in accordance with jimmy knights suggestion why indeed should she share her gains with anybody if max had no right to any part of the loot what possible claim had jim to share in it once lilass cupidity was aroused it banished even that meager ghost of honor that is supposed to prevail among thieves and disregarding maxs caution she decided to take things entirely into her own hands riding this wave of success to the finish accordingly she sent for bob it did not take her long to see that wharton had changed since their last interview and accordingly she did not put herself to the trouble of acting in fact bob allowed her no opportunity of doing so now dont give me that stall about melcher he said in answer to her first inquiries im on miss lynns cheeks had lost the power of changing color but her eyes were as expressive as ever and now as she stared at her victim they showed a certain inflexibility of purpose you must have been talking to merkle she said slowly exactly hes not such a fool as i am well there was an insolent rising inflection in lilass voice what are you going to do about it bob had prepared himself for some denial for some pretense of ignorance at least and he was taken aback at this ready acceptance of his challenge something malevolent in her air increased his uneasiness the girl was as hard as flint and seemed capable of any desperate action you say you love lorelei you pretend to be grateful to me as if the mere heat of his accusation had ignited her fury lilas interrupted him angrily oh cut out that loveandgratitude talk i want money do you understand money you think i wont dare go through with this and so does merkle you neither of you can understand why ill take a chance on the chair just to make you pay well thats because you are men and because you are healthy and happy and have something to live for but what have i got im sick im going to pieces ill be gone in a few years if i dont get the coin ive always fought and ive usually been licked but i wont be licked this time men like you and john merkle licked me why i was licked before i had learned to fight back and you taught me to hate you before i had put on long dresses you know thats not true bob cried sharply you harmed men before they ever harmed you you hated jarvis hammon and yet he did more for you than any one in all your life merkle helped you too when you needed help and so did i lorelei was your friend bah i havent any friends i never had any and i dont want any now nobody ever did anything for me you and john merkle are going to pay me for what other men have put me through oh come im not bluffing youre afraid to stand the gaff but im not im getting old my looks are gone whos going to pay me if you dont who lilass voice which has risen steadily broke now and she shook a clenched fist in whartons face he saw that she had worked herself up into one of her abrupt reasonless rages ive got you she keened i can drag you and your sick wife and merkle and those hammon women out into the light and ill do it too i can make you all squirm so lets get down to cases theres millions of dollars among you millions that were squeezed out of my kind of people now im going to try my hand at squeezing if i lose very well but ill holler and youll have to stop my mouth or the world will hear you dont dare holler im glad youre in the open at last bob told her roughly well see if melcher is as desperate as to hell with melcher screamed the girl hes a fool hes scared already but im not and im the one to settle with remember that she was aquiver now her nerves tortured from overstimulation were jumping but she felt a tremendous sense of power together with a contemptuous disregard of consequences go to max if you want to sound the alarm do anything you please she mocked but get your pennies together or ill bawl you out from the housetops there was no arguing with her as she was drunk with the sense of her advantage and bob could only depart his ears ringing unpleasantly with her threats as to just what effect her unrestrained spleen would have or in which direction it might work the greatest damage he was uncomfortably in doubt for himself he had no particular fears but he dreaded terribly the effect upon his wife it seemed to him therefore that the only way of gaining time was to pay lilas enough to satisfy her the more he thought of this the more imperative seemed the necessity but when he ventured to submit the proposition to merkle the banker curtly refused to entertain it sick with anxiety weak at thought of the peril to his wifes health bob determined to call upon max melcher and demand immunity upon pain of violence accordingly he turned his steps in the direction of the metropolitan club but as he neared his destination he found a crowd gathered in front of the place two patrolwagons were backed up to the curb opposite the gamblinghouse a line of policemen streamed in and out of the premises some of the officers were armed with axes and sledges others carried burdens that evoked jeers and taunts from the bystanders doubting the evidence of his own eyes bob elbowed his way closer it was true the metropolitan club the oldest the safest the bestprotected palace of chance in the city was the object of a daylight raid its sacred doors had been battered in and the fragments of furniture that came out gave evidence that the raiders had used their destructive weapons with unusual violence racks of multicolored ivory chips farolayouts splintered remains of expensive roulette crap and poker tables of mahogany and rosewood were flung carelessly into the waiting wagons and driven away bob whartons amazement was shared by the onlookers for nothing like this had even been known in the tenderloin bob was not a dull young man in time a light broke through his troubled mind and he returned to broadway lost in thought evidently merkles plan was working chapter xxvii adventures of moment had also fallen to the lot of jimmy knight on this day lacking the hospitality of tonys back room jim had of late taken up loafingquarters in a seventh avenue saloon frequented by a coterie of parasitic young men who subsisted on the crowds which passed daily in and out of the pennsylvania station on the very afternoon of the melcher raid jim was sitting at a table with one of these fellows lending a willing ear to tales of easy money when he felt a touch upon his shoulder and looking up found a plainclothes man standing over him the stranger wore no visible badge of authority but jim knew him instantly for what he was in the background another person with the same indefinable stamp of the bull watched proceedings with an expressionless face now jim had the heart of a rabbit and being forever busy in framing some one his first suspicion was that he himself was being framed this suspicion proved all too correct never in his worst dreams had he experienced anything so distressing as what followed his arrest for it seemed as if these officers cherished a personal grudge against him they seemed prejudiced for no reason whatever and they made their aversion patent in several professionally effective ways jim found his arms twisted backward and upward until his bones cracked and his joints came loose with wrists pinioned behind his shoulderblades and walking on his toes he was propelled into the street since this was his first arrest he did not know enough to go quietly and when one of his captors released his grip he tried to wrench himself loose cossacks could not mistreat a prisoner more brutally than these policemen mistreated poor cringing spineless jimmy knight he reached the stationhouse more dead than alive and then when he saw a loaded revolver removed from his own pocket he utterly collapsed weeping like a woman he was led to a cell and left to meditate upon the inconsistencies and injustices of the sullivan law as the hours crept by and his efforts to obtain assistance proved unavailing he began to understand something of young sullivans and armisteads feelings then light came to him he learned of the disaster to the metropolitan club and immediately lost faith in melchers ability to help him with the result that when he was finally led to inspector snells office for the third degree he squealed promptly in his panic to save himself he volunteered even more of his private history than the inspector desired to hear and was only too willing to make known all of the facts of the hammon case nor did he withhold the truth about the present attempt at blackmailing bob wharton and merkle the first question along this line served to unlock his lips and he whiningly laid bare the entire conspiracy it seemed however that his earnest desire to help the law was scarcely appreciated for even after he had blindly affixed his signature to the documents which inspector snell placed before him he was led back to his cell rules were far from strict at lilas lynns hotel the employees were not overcourteous at any time and although in theory callers announced themselves by telephone before going upstairs this was a custom generally honored in the breach no question therefore was raised when a heavily built capablelooking man with large hands and feet inquired for miss lynns roomnumber and stepped into the elevator without declaring his business lilas herself opened the door at his knock but showed some reluctance at admitting him until he murmured the magic word headquarters whereupon she fell back with a look of startled inquiry in her eyes the stranger did not trouble to remove his hat after a swift inventory of the room he announced the inspector sent me to see you what inspector snell yes lilass voice was badly controlled for there was something disturbing about this mans behavior your orders is to leave town be out and away at eight oclock thats four hours understand you must be crazy lilas cried with a show of spirit what have i done who do you think i am inspector snell eh i dont know him and he doesnt know me i guess he knows you all right eight bells sister ill be back then but what for i havent done anything incensed at the fellows total indifference she ran on fiercely i wont go im no crook you cant hustle me out like this ill fight ive got friends and ive got money and im going to stay right here you havent anything on me for i havent done anything im behaving myself and im clean you can tell inspector snell so for me the policeman silently drew from his pocket an envelope which he handed to her before you talk any louder suppose you give this the once over he said lilas glanced at the proffered package with a sneer bah dont you think i know a warrant then as she opened the envelope and scanned its contents she started to conceal the tremor of her hand she spread the documents upon her centertable and turned her back to the visitor an odd rigidity crept over her when she swung about to speak her voice was harsh but her defiance had lessened i dont understand oh i guess you do anyhow the whole storys there you see armistead spilled thats why he jumped his bond he was afraid of melchers gunmen we got sullivan too he was tough but we got him finally and as for knight say that little grafter sprained his wrist signing affidavits rot you dont expect me to believe all this lilas demanded uncertainly why these confessions are probably phony you dictated them yourself for all i know anyhow they dont mean anything to me well youd ought to know whether they do or not the policeman calmly refolded the papers what about max what does he say about this oh he takes it all right he knows weve got it on him and he knows when to lay down a hand max is a good sport but i aint here to swap gossip if i was you id take it on the run you cant win anything by sticking i wont go stormed the girl its a putup job to get me away have it your own way but ill be back at eight with a regular honesttogoodness warrant the officer nodded and walked out heavily when she was alone again lilas felt as if her knees would give way for the first time she realized that she had no single friend to whom she could turn or in whose assistance she could put faith before the plainclothes man she had maintained a pretense of firmness but it had been mere bravado for in her soul she had known those documents to be authentic their contents proved them so and now that the police knew all resistance was plainly futile during her last talk with bob wharton lilas had felt unbounded confidence in her ability to go through with her plans come what might but now the mere knowledge that those plans were known changed everything in common with all evildoers lilas entertained an exaggerated distrust of the law and a keen fear of its trickeries the fact that she had been betrayed the fact that she now had the open hostility of the police to combat convinced her that the game was up as she pondered the situation anger at the treachery of her confederates grew and caused her to forget her own intended treachery to them even while she was defying the officer she had begun to reconcile herself to the idea of flight and now she set about her preparations four hours well they had given her time enough much could be done in four hours eight oclock would see her well out from under the shadow of the law the law lilas sneered as she reflected that the law invariably shielded the rich and prosperous while it oppressed the poor and the needy of late her periods of independence from cocaine were becoming shorter and of less frequent occurrence and before she had proceeded far with her packing she found herself badly in need of stimulation her resistance was running low it seemed that splendid recklessness which had sustained her when she flung her demand at bob was entirely gone now she was oddly nervous and unstrung so she turned to the white powders their effect was prompt and pleasant as always they enabled her to lay vigorous hold once more upon her scattered faculties as she flung her belongings into her trunk her first black regrets and disappointments began to lighten and she found herself looking at the matter more philosophically after all things were never quite hopeless she had played for big stakes and lost through no fault of her own but through the treachery of others well this was not her first defeat and certainly it would not be her last opportunity she would pretend to yield she would go away and wait yes that was best she could always return and so long as her money lasted so long as those blessed powders were available she was assured of bodily and mental comfort at least meanwhile no one could rob her of her secret and sometime somehow it could be coined into money bob wharton john merkle the hammon women through their influence with the police might exile her from new york might hound her from place to place but so long as she retained that secret they were all more or less in her power and could not deny her at least a comfortable living she even smiled contemptuously as she looked back upon the way she had fooled bob wharton and the concern he had shown for lorelei then of a sudden lilas awoke to the fact that she disliked hatedbobs wife it seemed as if she had always hated her perhaps it was because of loreleis beauty or her superior ways or yes because of her clean soul that nothing had been able to smirch character what was it but hypocrisy or a luxury upon which some people prided themselves from lorelei lilass thoughts wandered naturally to jim thence to his companions and finally to max melcher one and all those men at the first hint of danger to themselves had thrown her over and sought protection that was manlike it pleased her at this moment to call down punishments upon them and to imagine the forms those punishments would take if she possessed the power to inflict them she owed those fellows something and in particular she owed max a grudge for the whole scheme had been his the cocaine was working swiftly now lilas had reached the stage of exaggerated selfregard her enmity toward melcher grew with unnatural rapidity she had evened more than one score in the past she mused why not even this one in jarvis hammons case for instance she had taken the law into her own hands and had exacted payment for a wrong that most people would have considered dead to vengeance truly that had been a revenge for a long time the memory of that nights events had been almost intolerable the picture of that dimlit library of the staring stricken face of her victim had more than once filled lilas with such horror that she had taken refuge in double doses of cocaine but now strangely enough she felt no repugnance whatever in looking back upon it on the contrary she was thrilled by the remembrance and exulted in her act without restraint she fancied at this moment that she could feel the cold contact of the revolver against her palm the leap of the exploding weapon the fierce triumph that had flamed through her when hammon had halted in his tracks then withered and crumpled as his wound took effect that had been an instant worth all the pain and risk it cost she lived again through the white heat of it but it left her unsatisfied there were others who had wronged her and who deserved the same fate as hammon max melcher for instance max had been her evil counselor in all things he had always used her as a tool and now like a tool which he no longer had use for he cast her aside lilas found herself pacing the floor in a peculiar emotional frenzy outwardly she was cool inwardly she was a prey to the wildest and wickedest passions it is by the use of cocaine that most of the hired assassins of the east side prepare themselves to kill taken in sufficient quantities the drug tends to produce a homicidal mania in the consumer at the same time leaving him in supersensitive control of his faculties mind and body are unnaturally stimulated by it whisky numbs a mans mind and makes his hands unsteady cocaine not only crazes him but lends him accuracy in shooting moreover it deadens his sensibility so that he goes on fighting even though riddled with wounds thus the use of this drug explains why the modern gunman is so deadly in his work and at the same time so difficult of capture as it does the similar phenomena among the southern negroes who since they have been denied rum by state prohibition have taken to cocaine just how or when lilas arrived at the determination to kill max melcher she did not know the idea was there fullgrown and firmly fixed in her mind when she discovered it she began at once to shape its execution first she called tony the barber by phone for now that the metropolitan club was closed she knew of no other way of discovering her victims whereabouts max was not at the barber shop she learned but he would be there promptly at half past six oclock for his shave yes tony declared he always came there at that time it was a habit of years standing lilas ordered her trunks sent down paid her bill at the hotel and then sought the nearest pawn shop she had some difficulty in buying a revolver but succeeding at length she returned to her room to arrange the final details of her plan that she had fixed upon melcher rather than upon bob or merkle or some one else can be explained only through the vagaries of a disordered mind for although the girl did not realize it she was by this time quite out of her head a desire as keen and as compelling as hunger clamored for maxs death and it did not occur to her to resist it yet lilas had no intention of sacrificing herself much of the pleasure of the deed she reflected would result from a successful get away and therefore she craftily arranged her escape she would drive to tonys so ran her plan tell her taxicab driver to wait then enter the place quietly and swiftly max would be stretched out in one of the chairs and quite unaware of her approach until she bent over him he would gain no hint of her design until he felt her weapon against his body such a simple mode of procedure could not fail and this ferocious longing to kill would be satisfied in the confusion following the shot lilas reasoned it would be easy to slip out of the place step into her taxi and drive to the station once she was lost in that crowded place who could apprehend her in half an hour she would be out of the state there still remained some time to wait and to guard herself against a diminution of the drugs effect she took another liberal dose after a time this resulted in an added intensity of concentration an even greater mental activity and strength of purpose she felt equal to anything afraid of nothing in heaven or earth for fear that max might anticipate his regular time of arrival she again telephoned to tony but learning that he had not done so she gossiped briefly with the barber discussing the raid on the metropolitan the misfortunes that had overtaken their mutual friends and other topics of interest she realized from tonys laughter that she was talking with unusual wit and brilliance her buoyancy was becoming a trifle oppressive now so she rang off and a few moments later discovered that her last inhalation of the drug was beginning to affect her heart before long its palpitation had become unpleasant though not alarming as yet and probably no more than a passing phase however since ample time remained she decided to lie down the reclining position gave her some relief but that odd nightmarish overstimulation continued in fact it increased until it became almost unbearable she closed her eyes only to behold a whirling confusion of shapes and visions gradually her mind became peopled by distorted fancies the moments crept on and the phantasmagoria continued lilas realized at last that she was ill she was confused hysterical wretched she tried to rise but failed she found herself swimming through space blinding lights and choking vapors enveloped her she noted with a dull sense of alarm that her heart was skipping this frightened her into calling for help but her voice sounded weak and unreal everything was unreal objects in the room were distorted and queer what was it that so terrified her was it death chapter xxviii late that night john merkle telephoned bob wharton to say headquarters just rang me up and told me prepare yourself for a shock lilas lynn is dead dead bob cried in a startled voice dead how when did it happen i cant believe it merkle made known the details that had come to him looks like suicide but theyre not sure anyhow she took too much dope of some sort you can sleep easy now i wish i could i suppose its the law of compensation compensation merkles voice sounded querulous theres no such thing dont talk to a wall street man about the law of compensation well then call it providence providence has too much on its hands to bother with people like her no there is a certain well immovability about the conventional and lilas wasnt strong enough to topple it over i im shocked of course and yet i cant help feeling greatly relieved rotten thing to say not at all im delighted once i read about a flareback on a battleship and how a fellow threw himself into the door of the powdermagazine to prevent an explosion thats me im nearly scorched to death bobs anxiety had been so intense of late that this unexpected solution of his difficulties seemed indeed nothing less than a godsend lorelei thank heaven had been saved from any knowledge of the affair and when he went down to business it was with a lighter heart than he had felt for some time bobs acquaintance with lilas lynn had been far from pleasant she had repaid his kindness with treachery and now although he was not a callous person he could not pretend that his pity exceeded his relief his regrets at the girls tragic end were those which any normal man would have felt at the death of an acquaintance but they were far overbalanced now by his joy at the fact that no further shadows menaced the peace of his wife and that once again the future was all dancing sunshine bob had seldom been conscious of a deliberate effort to please himself for to want a thing had always meant to have it almost before the desire had been recognized the gratification of his impulses had become a sort of second nature to him and now feeling that he owed a debt of friendliness to the world he was impelled to liquidate it he did struggle halfheartedly against his first drink but after he had taken it and after other drinks had gone the way of the first he was troubled less and less by the consciousness of broken resolves he met a number of people whom he liked and to whom he was inspired to show his liking and strange to say the more he drank the more of such friends he discovered by late afternoon he was in a fantastically jubilant mood and seizing kurtz he bore him across the way to delmonicos now kurtz was worldly and therefore tolerant he had grown to like and to understand his young associate very well indeed and something about bobs riotous disposition to gladness awoke a response in the little tailor it was that expansive and expensive hour of the afternoon when business worries are dropped and before social cares are shouldered it was cocktailtime along the avenue the hour when sprees are born and engagements broken and as it lengthened wharton celebrated it as in days gone by his last regret had vanished he was having a splendid time when a page called him to a telephonebooth adorees voice greeted him she was speaking from his own home and her first words almost sobered him something was wrong bob was needed quickly lorelei was asking for him for more than an hour they had been vainly trying to locate him they had succeeded in reaching the doctor and he was there with a nurse adorees voice broke probably it was nothing serious but lorelei was frightened and so was the speaker bob had better waste no time for one never could tell what might happen in cases of this sort when bob lurched out of the booth he was white the noisy group he had left rose in alarm at sight of his stricken face his legs led him a crooked course out of the cafe bringing him into collision with chairs and tables and causing him to realize for the first time how far he had allowed himself to go in a shaking voice he called for a taxicab meanwhile allowing the raw air of the street to cool his head but as he was hurried up the avenue his fright grew until he lost himself in a dizzy drunken panic he tried to lay hold of himself but his thoughts were as unruly as his legs had been the significance of his conduct and its probable effect upon his wife filled him with horror fate had cunningly timed her punishment before long he began to attribute this catastrophe whatever it might prove to be directly to his own criminal behavior and for once in his carefree life he knew the taste of bitter regret but he could not think coherently black fears were pouring in upon him with a speed to match the staggering objects that fled past his open cab window the terror of the unknown was upon him what if lorelei should die bob asked himself a swing of the vehicle flung him into a corner where he huddled slackjawed staring he was unable to shut out this last suggestion if lorelei died he would be her murderer that was plain he had wanted a child to be sure but until this moment he had never counted the risk nor realized what price might be exacted no child could be worth a risk to lorelei but regrets were unavailing something had gone wrong and lorelei needed him she was calling for him and he was drunk he would reel up to her bed of pain with bleared eyes with poisoned lips how could he kiss her how could he explain the cab swung into the curb and he scrambled out then stumbled blindly up the steps and into the building where he lived adoree met him at his own door loreleis summons had evidently found the dancer dressed for anything except such a crisis for miss demorest was arrayed in the very newest importation the lower half of her figure was startlingly suggestive of the harem while above the waist she was adorned like a chinese princess a tango cap of gold crowned her swirls of hair and from it depended a string of tremendous beads looped beneath her chin she presented a futurist combination of colors mainly mandarin yellow and royal blue both of which in some peculiar way seemed to extend upward tingeing her cheeks but whartons impression was vague he saw little more than the tragic widening of the girls eyes as she recognized his condition am i as bad as that he stammered do you think shell notice it oh bob adoree cried in a stricken voice how could you at this time you said she wanted me i couldnt take time yes she has been calling for you but im sorry i found you a silentfooted figure in a nurses uniform emerged from the diningroom and her first expression of relief at sight of bob changed swiftly to a stare of startled wonderment bob was not too drunk to read the halfspoken protest on her lips then he heard his wife calling him and realized that somehow she knew of his coming at the sound of her voice strangely throaty and hoarse from pain the strength ran out of his body the doctor heard him fumbling at the bedroom door and admitted him then a low aching cry of disappointment sounded and adoree demorest bowed her head upon her arms when bob groped his way back into the livingroom his look was ghastly his face was damp his eyes were desperate she sent me away he whispered poor thing he winced at adorees tone god i heard her when she saw you i wonder if you realize oh yes he nodded slowly i dont get drunk all over like most men im afraid ill never forget that cry he was trembling and his terror was so pitiful that adoree laid a compassionate hand upon his shoulder dont let go bob hold your thoughts steady and sober up we must all help tell me you know about these things tell me honestly what do i know about such things what can i tell you bitterly cried the dancer i dont know anything about babies i never even held one in my arms im worse frightened than you are darkness found bob huddled in his chair fighting for his senses but as the liquor died in him terrible fancies came to life those muffled cries of pain rising now and then terrorized him and yet the long intervals of silence between were worse for then it seemed to him that the fight must be going against his wife and that her strength must be proving insufficient there were times too when he felt the paralyzing conviction that he was alone in the house and more than once he stole down the hall his heart between his teeth his body shaking in a palsy of apprehension a frightened maid began preparations for his dinner but he ordered her away then when she brought him a tray anger at the thought that his own comfort should be considered of consequence made him refuse to touch it at length his inactivity became unbearable and feeling the desperate need of sane counsel he telephoned to john merkle bob was too deeply agitated to more than note the bankers statement that mr and mrs hannibal wharton were in the city but recalling it later he experienced a stab of regret that his mother was not here to comfort lorelei in the first great crisis of her womanhood it had been loreleis wish that her own mother be kept in ignorance of the truth and now therefore the girl had no one to lean upon except an unpractical stagewoman and a drunken husband in bobs mind the pity of it grew as the time crept on but adoree demorest was wonderful despite her inexperience she was calm capable sympathetic and best of all her normality afforded a support upon which both the husband and the wife could rest when she finally made herself ready for the street bob cried piteously youre not going to leave us i must its nearly theatertime she told him its one of the penalties of this business that nothing must hold the curtain but ill be back the minute the show is over lorelei needs you adoree nodded her eyes met bobs squarely and he saw that they were wet her face was tender and in spite of her grotesquely affected toilette she appeared very simple and womanly at this moment her absurd theatricalism was gone she was a natural unaffected young woman i wish i could do something to help wearily continued bob but adoree shook her head so violently that the barbaric beaded festoon beneath her chin clicked and rattled she knows youre close by thats enough this is a poor time to preach but it seems to me if youve got a bit of real manhood in you bob youll never drink again the shock of seeing you like this when she needed you didnt help her any i know i know the words were wrung from him like a groan but the thing is bigger and stronger than i am it takes both of us to fight it if she should leave me id never pull through and i wouldnt want to never until she left loreleis house and turned toward the white lights of broadway did adoree demorest fully realize whither her theatrical career had carried her lorelei it seemed to her now had lived to high purpose she was soon to be a mother but as for herself the dancer cringed at the thought what had her life brought notoriety shame in the eyes of men she was abominable she had sold herself for the satisfaction of seeing a false name blazoned in electric lights while lorelei had played the game differently and won yes she would have won even though she died tonight but how could a woman like adoree demorest the kings favorite the woman with the rubies hope for wifehood or for motherhood the bitterness of these reflections lay in the fact that adoree knew herself to be pure but the world considered her evil and evil in its eyes she would remain how could she hope to bring anything but misery to a husband or bequeath anything but shame to a child at this moment she would gladly have changed places with that other girl whose life hung in the scales john merkle had never lost interest in lorelei nor forgotten her refusal of his wellmeant offer of assistance from the night of their first meeting she had intrigued his interest and her marriage to bob had deepened his friendly feeling although he prided himself upon a reputation for harsh cynicism and cherished the conviction that he was wholly without sentiment he was in reality more emotional than he believed and loreleis courageous efforts to regenerate her husband her vigorous determination to build respectability and happiness out of the unpromising materials at her hand had excited his liveliest sympathy it pleased him to read into her character beauties and nobilities of which she was utterly unconscious if not actually devoid now that she had come to a serious crisis merkles slowly growing resentment at bobs parents for refusing to recognize her burst into anger the result was that soon after his talk with bob he telephoned hannibal wharton making known the situation in the most disagreeable and biting manner of which he was capable strange to say wharton heard him through then thanked him before ringing off when hannibal had repeated the news to his wife she moved slowly to a window and stood there staring down into the glittering chasm of fifth avenue bobs mother was a frail erect impassive woman wearied and saddened with the weight of her husbands millions there had been a time when society knew her but of late years she saw few people and her name was seldom mentioned except in connection with her benefactions even the true satisfaction of giving had been denied her since real charity means sacrifice wealth had lent her a painful conspicuousness and had made her a target for multifarious demands so insistent so illconsidered so unworthy many of them that she had been forced into an isolation more strict even than her husbands great responsibilities had changed hannibal wharton into a machine he had become mechanical even in his daily life in his pleasures in his relaxations his suspicions and his dislikes were also more or less automatic but in all his married life he had never found cause to complain of anything his wife had done he was serenely conscious moreover of her complete accord with his every action and now therefore in reporting merkles conversation he spoke musingly as a man speaks to himself john loves to be caustic he likes to vocalize his dyspepsia the old man muttered well if its as serious as he seems to think we may be spared the disgrace of a grandchild mrs wharton did not stir there was something uncompromising in the rigid lines of her back and in her stiffly poised head people of her kind always have children he continued and thats what i told bob i told him he was laying up trouble for himself bob had more to him than we thought irrelevantly murmured the mother more than we thought hannibal shook his head not more than i thought i knew he had it in him you were the one no no we both doubted perhaps this girl read him sure she read him snorted the father she read his bankbook but i fooled her do you remember when bob was born eh do you remember i had trouble too into hannibals eyes came a slow and painful light of reminiscence the doctors thought of course i remember her husband broke in those damned doctors said youd never come through it yes i wasnt strong but you did i was with you i fought for you i wouldnt let you die remember it the speaker moistened his lips why i never forgot bob is experiencing something like that tonight hannibal started then he fumbled uncertainly for a cigar when he had it lighted he said gruffly well it made a man of me i hope itll help bob still staring out across the glowing lights and the mysterious inky blots that lay below her mrs wharton went on you are thinking only of bob but that girl is suffering all i suffered that night and im thinking of her too she is offering her life for the life of a little child just as i offered mine there was a silence then hannibal looked up to find his wife standing over him with face strangely humble her eyes were appealing her frail figure was shaking wretchedly my dear he cried rising i cant keep it up hannibal i cant pretend any longer its bobs baby and its ours disregarding his denial she ran on swiftly i wanted more children but i couldnt have them so ive starved myself all these years you cant understand but im lonely hannibal terribly lonely and sad bob grew up and went away and all we had left was money the dollars piled up year by year they grew heavier and heavier until they squeezed our lives dry and crowded out everything they even crowded out our son andspoiled him they made you into a stone man they came between me and the people and the things i loved they walled me off from the world my life is empty empty i want to mother something hannibal inquired hoarsely not this baby surely not that womans child its bobs baby and ours he looked down at her queerly for a moment the breed is rotten if he had married a decent girl john merkle says she is splendid how do you know i have talked with him i have learned whatever i could about her wherever i could and its all good after all bob loves her and isnt that enough but she doesnt love him stormed the father she said she didnt she wants his money and she thinks shell get it this way do you think money can pay her for what she is enduring at this minute shes frightened just as i was frightened when bob was born shes sick and suffering but do you think all our dollars could buy that child from her money has made us hard hannibal lets be different im afraid we have put it off too long he answered slowly she wont forgive us and im not sure i want her to bobs in trouble wont you go to him hannibal wharton opened his lips closed them then taking his hat and coat he left the room but as the old man went uptown his nerve failed him he was fixed in his ways he had a blind faith in his own infallibility twice he rode up in the elevator to his sons door twice he rode down again the hallman informed him that the crisis had not passed so finding the night air not uncomfortable hannibal settled himself to wait after all he told himself this was not the moment for a painful reconciliation as time dragged on he came to a reckoning with his conscience and his meditations brought home the realization that despite his success despite the love and companionship of his wife he too was growing old and lonely during the chill still hours after the city had gone to rest an automobile drew up to the apartment house when its expected passenger emerged from the building a grimfaced stranger in a greatcoat accosted him one glance challenged the physicians attention and he answered yes its all over a boy and mrs wharton the mother youth is a wonderful thing and she has everything to live for she is doing as well as could be expected youre a relative i presume the old man hesitated then his voice came boldly yes im her father when the doctor had driven away hannibal strode into the building and telephoned to the waldorf but now his words were short and oddly broken nevertheless they brought a light of gladness to the eyes of the woman who had waited all these hours chapter xxix adoree demorest still in her glittering hybrid costume but heavylimbed and dull with fatigue paused outside her own door early that morning the time lacked perhaps an hour of dawn the street outside and the building itself was silent yet from adorees parlor issued the sound of light fingers upon pianokeys adoree entered to find campbell pope with collar loosened and hair on end seated at the instrument the air within the room was blue and reeking with the odor of stale tobaccosmoke and the ashreceiver at his elbow was piled high with burnt offerings one of which was now sending an evilsmelling streamer toward the ceiling pope rose at adorees entrance eying her anxiously is everything all right he cried is what all right the er lorelei oh yes what are you doing here i suppose i must apologize you see i heard the news and came here after the show when i learned where you were i decided to wait and and help you decided to help adoree eyed the disheveled musician queerly by smelling up my parlor and playing my poor piano all night is that how you help what do you mean help the critic appeared to realize for the first time the lateness of the hour glancing at his watch he gasped why i had no idea it was this time ive been here all night havent i you see after i got in i was afraid to go out without explaining what do you mean by saying you wanted to help miss demorest repeated curiously youve helped to break my lease ill be thrown out of this house sure pope stammered guiltily i was playing for bob and lorelei with one glove half off adoree slowly seated herself showing in her face an amazement that increased the mans embarrassment i knew it was a serious matter he explained and being terribly fond of bob and lorelei i naturally wanted to do what i could yes go on pope took a deeper breath then burst out oh i have a sixtyhorsepower imagination and it seems to me that music is a sort of prayer anyhow its the only way i know of praying good music is divine language its what the angels speak if there are any angels sometimes it seems to me that i can soar heavenward on the wings of of melody and get close enough to make myself heard in my own way i was sort of praying for those two children foolish isnt it im sorry i told you it sounds nutty to me when i stop to consider it pope stirred uneasily under adorees gravely speculative eyes loreleis all right adoree nodded its a boy there was a moment of silence did you ever see a brandnew baby lord no miss demorests gaze remained bent upon pope but it was focused upon great distances her voice when she spoke was hushed and awestricken neither did i until this one i held it i held it in my arms oh i was frightened and yet i seemed to know just what to do and and everything it was strange it hurt me terribly for you see i didnt know what babies meant until tonight now i know pope saw the shining eyes suddenly fill and threaten to overflow instead of the grotesquely overdressed and artificial stage favorite he beheld only a yearning woman whose face was softened and glorified as by a vision poor lorelei he murmured at a loss for words poor lorelei adorees lips twisted mirthlessly of course you dont understand how could you why its her baby shes a mother i can hold it once in a while she can hold it always i didnt know you cared for children adoree shrugged the beads at her throat clicked barbarously neither did i but i suppose every woman does if she only knew it tonight i began to understand what this ache inside of me means her gaze came back and centered upon his face but it was frightened and panicstricken now ive sacrificed my right to children how can you say oh you know it as well as i do a flush wavered in the speakers cheeks then fled leaving her white and weary you of all men must understand im notorious im a painted woman a wicked woman the wickedest woman in the land and that reputation will live in spite of anything i can do she began to cry now in a way strange to popes experience for her tears appeared grew and spilled themselves slowly down her cheeks and she made no attempt to hide them the sight depressed him dreadfully for at heart he was intensely sentimental i didnt know what it means to be notorious she stated tensely i didnt know what i was doing when i agreed to be adoree demorest popes habitual restraint all at once gave way nonsense he exploded the thing that counts is what you are not what you seem to be i know the truth i dont give a damn what people say now there was nothing sufficiently significant about these words to bring a light of wonderment and gladness to the girls face but her tears ceased as abruptly as they had commenced and noting the slowly growing radiance of her expression campbell was stricken dumb with fright at the possible consequences of temerity the knowledge of his shortcomings robbed him of confidence and helped to confuse him adoree rose she removed her tango cap and the mantle elaborately draped from one shoulder that served as an evening wrap then with a lingering backward glance she disappeared into her chamber she bathed her eyes powdered her cheeks patted her hair into more becoming fashion gave a final dab of the puff upon her nose as an expert billiardplayer chalks his cue when she had quite finished she returned to the critic who meanwhile had remained frozen in his tracks for a moment she stood looking up at him with a peculiar tender smile then took him by the lapels of his shapeless coat and drew his thin face down to hers im not going to let you back out she declared firmly you asked me didnt you adoree no no think what you are doing he cried sharply but she continued to smile up into his eyes with a gladness that intoxicated him she snuggled closer to him murmuring cozily i dont want to think well have plenty of time to think when were too old to talk now i just want to love you as hard as you have been loving me for the last six months during the days of loreleis recovery bob wharton was in a peculiarly exultant mood her ready forgiveness of his behavior did much to renew his faith in himself besides doubling his devotion to her he did not feel that he could ever learn to love her any more than he did for at times the strength of his passion frightened him but her allowance for his weakness brought them into closer touch with each other and kindled in him an aching humility that craved selfsacrifice dwarfing these and kindred emotions however was a feeling altogether new which had come with the birth of his son at first the baby awed and frightened bob it oppressed him with a sense of tremendous responsibility but on the heels of this came a dawning pride and then an insatiable curiosity he began to spend a great deal of time with the infant he studied it he stared at it when no one was looking he felt of the little fellow gingerly and would have enjoyed examining it minutely had he dared his hands itched for it and its weak strangling gurgles sent indescribable thrills through him the easy dexterity with which the nurse handled it as if the precious atom were a bundle of rags excited bobs liveliest apprehension and at such times he hovered near by poised upon tiptoe for fear she might drop it he felt that it should be borne on silken cushions while heads were bowed and backs bent rather than upon the hip or in the crook of a careless elbow when he ventured to voice this feeling to his wife he was offended at her amusement and for a whole day tortured himself with the suspicion that the childs mother did not truly love it to all young fathers there comes a certain readjustment of values to bob who had always led a selfish thoughtless existence it was at first bewildering to discover that his place at the head of his household had been usurped by another heretofore he had always been of supreme domestic importance but now the order of things was completely reversed if not hopelessly jumbled first in consequence came this new person tiny and vastly tyrannical because of its helplessness then the nurse an awesome person a sort of oracle and regent combined who ruled in the name and stead of the new heir nurses wisdom was unbounded her lightest wish was law and next to her in authority was a fat bearded prime minister who daily came and went in an automobile and who wrote edicts on a little pad this persons frown threw the entire establishment into confusion lorelei herself occupied no mean station in the new scheme for at least she shared the confidence of the nurse and the doctor and ranked above the cook and the housemaid but not so bob somewhere at the foot of the list he found his own true place now strange to say this novel arrangement was extremely agreeable to the deposed ruler bob took a shameless delight in doing menial service to fetch and to carry for all hands filled him with joy but once outside of the premises he reasserted himself and his importance grew as gas expands he swelled to the burstingpoint he strutted he grinned he was broadly tolerant and more than once he startled total strangers by laughing hilariously at nothing when he could not talk he whistled in tune to the singing voices within him but it was seldom indeed that he could not talk and before long his intimate friends began to avoid him like a plague it was his partner kurtz who finally dubbed him the pestilence that talketh in darkness and the destruction that wasteth our noondays scarcely less interested in the new baby was campbell pope pope in fact was becoming interested in almost everything of late he was growing youthful too in a way that vaguely alarmed his acquaintances his cynicism was disappearing his dramatic reviews began to assume a commendatory tone that all but destroyed their journalistic value when lorelei had recovered sufficiently to receive visitors the two lovers appeared one afternoon laden with packages weve been shopping for the baby adoree explained as she began to unload herself and pope announced enthusiastically that the experience had been the most exciting of an adventurous lifetime both of them it seemed had given free rein to their extravagance for to begin with there was a marvelous locomotive that ran on a circular track slightly too large to fit any room in the apartment it was no ordinary tin toy it had a bell that rang and a whistle that tooted and a queer little painted manikin inside the cab there were moreover a depot a bridge and a frowning mountain range pierced by a tunnel all in all the outfit weighed perhaps sixty pounds and required the operating skill of a practical mechanic and it proved to be a dangerous plaything too for once it had been thoroughly wound up and set in motion it developed an unsuspected and terrifying energy bob subdued it only after it had completed a speed trial down the hall in the course of which it substantially damaged baseboard and plaster popes taste ran to mechanical contrivances among his contributions there were in addition to this public nuisance an automobile a camera a bowlingalley and a set of small carpenters tools the mere sight of which brought out a sweat of apprehension upon the babys father adoree on the other hand had invested heavily in animals her gifts included a roaring lion a peacock with a leasebreaking voice an elephant that walked accompanied by strange whirring abdominal sounds besides many other products of the toymakers fancy there was a huge doll which miss deniorest had purchased because of its resemblance to herself and which was promptly christened aunt adoree there were an ermine coat and a toy theater also a full morocco set of lives of famous musicians in six volumes this being an afterthought of popes who feared the effects of bobs low musical tastes upon a tender child in addition to all these there was an elaborate enameled babys bed with garlands of bisque flowers and a point desprit canopy this adorees sadfaced footman had held upon the front of the automobile during an embarrassing trip up fifth avenue and riverside drive during the examination of these interesting objects the lovers made known their happiness then after the customary felicitations adoree explained everything is arranged we are going to be quietly married at once im afraid hell get away from me if i put it off not a chance popes sallow face colored happily as soon as i finish my theatrical contract adoree ran on we are going to drop quietly out of sight and stay out of sight going to live abroad bob inquired worse pope explained long island were going to raise ducks ducks adoree echoed beatifically hundreds and thousands of ducks little ducks and big ducks fuzzy ones and smooth ones campbell can write plays and ill wear kimonos and be comfortable its wonderful to think about isnt it pope supplemented her eagerly im looking for a bungalow on saltwater with a south exposure for the brooderhouses say were going to live i tell you bob theres money in ducks im reading up on the subject my dear fellow do you realize that he swung into his pet subject so swiftly that bob could not head him off and was forced to listen somewhat dazedly lorelei reached forth and drew adoree down to her whispering im so glad dear i knew he would end by loving you for everybody does pope concluded a lengthy harangue by saying my mistake last year was in the food ducks need soft food listen bob raised a hand and nodded in the direction of the girls theyre discussing that very subject top milk indeed adoree was crying indignantly ours will have cream when they want it and lots of it too my dear it will be fatal lorelei was horrified use nothing but top milk and barleywater be sure to sterilize the bottles and soak the nipples in borax say campbell pope flushed painfully and rose to his feet theyre not talking ducks women havent the least delicacy have they lets go out and smoke one day after bob had acquired sufficient confidence in himself and in the baby to handle it without anxiety to the nurse he begged permission to show it to the hallman downstairs he returned greatly elated explaining that the attendant who had some impossible number of babies of his own and might therefore be considered an authority declared this one to be the finest he had ever beheld oddly enough this praise delighted bob out of all reason he remained in a state of suppressed excitement all that day and on the following afternoon he again kidnapped the child for a second exhibition it seemed that the infants fame spread rapidly for soon the tenants of neighboring apartments began to clamor for a sight of it and bob was only too eager to gratify them every afternoon he took his son downstairs with him until finally lorelei checked him as he was going out bob dear she said with the faintest shadow of a smile i dont think its good for him to go out so often why dont you ask your father and mother to come up wharton flushed then he stammered i what makes you er think why i guessed it the very first day loreleis smile saddened they neednt see me you know bob laid the child back in its bed but thats just what they want they want to see you only i wouldnt let you be bothered theyre perfectly foolish over the kid mother cries and father but just wait he rushed out of the room and in a few moments returned with his parents hannibal wharton was deeply embarrassed but his wife went straight to lorelei and bending over her chair placed a kiss upon her lips there said she when you are stronger im going to apologize for the way weve treated you were old people were selfish and suspicious and unreasonable but were not entirely inhuman you wont be too hard on us will you the old ladys eyes were shining the palms which were clasped over loreleis hand were hot and tremulous the look of hungry yearning that greeted the elder womans words was ample answer and with a little choking cry she gathered the weak figure into her arms and thrilled as she felt the amber head upon her breast hannibal trumpeted into his handkerchief then cleared his throat premonitorily but bob forestalled him with a happy laugh dont hold any postmortems dad lorelei knows everything you intend to say im blamed if she does rumbled the old man because i dont know myself im not much on apologies i can take em but i cant make em his voice rose sternly young lady the night that baby was born i stood outside this house for hours because i was afraid to come in and my feet hurt like the devil too i wouldnt lose that much sleep for the whole steel trust but i didnt dare go back to the hotel for mother was waiting and i was afraid of her too i dont intend to go through another night like that bobs mother turned to her son saying she is beautiful and she is good too anybody can see that we could love her for what she has done for you if for nothing else well i should say so proudly vaunted the son she took a chance when she didnt care for me and she made me into a regular fellow why she reformed me from the ground up ive sworn off every blessed thing i used to do including drinking gruffly queried the father yes lorelei smiled her slow reluctant smile at the visitors and her voice was gentle as she said he thinks he has but its hard to stop entirely and you mustnt blame him if he forgets himself occasionally you see drinking is mostly a matter of temperament after all but he is doing splendidly and some day perhaps they nodded understandingly youll try to like us wont you for bobs sake pleaded the old lady timidly i intend to love you both very dearly shyly returned the girl and noting the light in loreleis face bob wharton was satisfied restraint vanished swiftly under the old couples evident determination to make amends but after they had gone lorelei became so pensive that bob said anxiously i hope you werent polite to them merely for my sake lorelei shook her head no i was only thinking do you realize that none of my own people have been to see me that i havent had a single word from any of them bob stirred uncomfortably he started to speak then checked himself as she went on not without some effort im going to say something unpleasant but i think you ought to know it when they learn that your parents have taken me in and made up with us theyre going to ask me for money its a terrible thing to say but its true do you want to see them do you want them to see the baby n no lorelei was pale as she made answer not after all that has passed bob heaved a grateful sigh im glad they wont trouble you any more why what ive been waiting until you were strong to tell you ive noticed how their silence hurt you but its my fault that they havent been here i sent them away you sent them away yes i fixed them with money and theyre happy at last theres considerable to tell jim got into trouble with the police and finally sent for me he told me everything and it wasnt pretty id rather not repeat all he said but it opened my eyes and showed me why they brought you here how they put you on the auction block and how they cried for bids he told me things you know nothing about and could never guess when he had finished i thanked god that they had flung you into my arms instead of some other mans its a miracle that you werent sacrificed utterly where is jim now somewhere in the boundless west he gave me his promise to reform he never will of course not and i dont expect it of him you see i know how hard it is to reform but mother and father im coming to them my dad came around the day after our baby was born and shook hands he wanted to stamp right in here and tell you what a fool he had made of himself but i wouldnt stand for it finally when he saw the kid he blew up entirely and right away proposed breaking ground for a jasper palace for the youngster he wanted to build it in pittsburg where he could run in going to and from business mother was just as foolish too well when i had had my little understanding with jim and learned the whole truth about your people i realized that no matter where we went they would be a constant menace to our happiness unless they were provided for it struck me that you had made a game fight for happiness and i couldnt stand for anything to spoil it at the last minute i went to mother and told her the facts and she seemed to understand as well as i how you must feel in spite of all they had done so we shook down the governor for an endowment bob what do you mean lorelei faltered in bewilderment we asked him for a hundred thousand dollars and got it lorelei gasped he bellowed like a bull he spat poison like a cobra he writhed like a bucket of eels but we put it over a hundred thousand dollars whispered the wife to a penny and its in the bank to your credit but i didnt stop there bobs voice hardened i went to your mother and in your name i promised her the income from it so long and only so long as she and peter stayed away from you she accepted rather greedily i thought and they have gone back to vale they have your old house and i have their promise never to see you except upon your invitation of course you can go to them whenever you wish but theyre happy and i think we will be happier with them in vale than in new york i hope you dont object to my arrangement there was a long silence then lorelei sighed you are a very good man bob it was my dream to do something of this sort but i could never have done it so well her husband bent and kissed her tenderly it wasnt all my doings i had help and you mustnt feel sad for something tells me youre going to learn finally the meaning of a real mothers love yes yes the answer came dreamily then as a fretful complaint issued from the crib at her side lorelei leaned forward and swiftly gathered the baby into her arms is he sick bob questioned in alarm no silly hes only hungry there in the gathering dusk bob wharton looked on at a sight that never failed to thrill him strangely in his wifes face was a beautiful content and it seemed to him fitting indeed that this country girl who had come to the city in quest of life should end her search thus with a baby at her breast the end
