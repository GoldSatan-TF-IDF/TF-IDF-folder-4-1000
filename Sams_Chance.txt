young outlaw and is designed to illustrate the gradual steps by which that young man was induced to give up his bad habits and deserve that prosperity which he finally attains the writer confesses to have experienced some embarrassment in writing this story the story writer always has at command expedients by which the frowns of fortune may be turned into sunshine and this without violating probability or at any rate possibility for the careers of many of our most eminent and successful men attest that truth is oftentimes stranger than fiction but to cure a boy of radical faults is almost as difficult in fiction as in real life whether the influences which led to sams reformation were adequate to that result must be decided by the critical reader the author may at any rate venture to congratulate sams friends that he is now more worthy of their interest and regard than in the years when he was known as the young outlaw sams chance chapter i sams new clothes if im goin into a office ill have to buy some new cloes thought sam barker he was a boy of fifteen who for three years had been drifting about the streets of new york getting his living as he could now blacking boots now selling papers now carrying bundles everything by turns and nothing long he was not a model boy as those who have read his early history in the young outlaw are aware but on the other hand he was not extremely bad he liked fun even if it involved mischief and he could not be called strictly truthful nor honest but he would not wantonly injure or tyrannize over a smaller boy and there was nothing mean or malicious about him still he was hardly the sort of boy a merchant would be likely to select as an office boy and but for a lucky chance sam would have been compelled to remain a bootblack or newsboy one day he found in an uptown street a little boy who had strayed away from his nurse and ascertaining where he lived restored him to his anxious parents for this good deed he was rewarded by a gift of five dollars and the offer of a position as errand boy at five dollars a week sam decided that he must have some new clothes before he could enter upon his place at present his costume consisted of a ragged shirt and a pair of equally ragged pantaloons both were of unknown antiquity and had done faithful service not only to sam but to a former owner it was quite time they were released from duty to buy a complete outfit with five dollars might have puzzled many an able financier but sam knew just where to go somewhere in the neighborhood of baxter street there was a secondhand clothing establishment which he had patronized on previous occasions and where he knew that the prices were low it was to this place that he bent his steps a wrinkled old man the proprietor stood outside scanning with cunning eyes the passersby if any one paused to examine his stock he was immediately assailed by voluble recommendations of this or that article and urgently entreated to just step inside when sam approached the old mans shrewdness was at fault he did not suspect that the ragged street boy was likely to become a customer and merely suffered his glance to rest upon him casually but sam accosted him with a businesslike manner look here old man have you got any tiptop cloes to sell today yes my son answered the old man with an air of alacrity who are you atakin to i aint your son and i wouldnt be my fathers a member of congress did he send you here to buy cloes asked the old man with a grin yes he did he said youd let me have em half price so i will my boy this is the cheapest place in the city well old man trot out your best suits i want em in the style you know i know that from your looks said the old man a grin illumining his wrinkled face as he glanced at the rags sam wore oh you neednt look at these my best cloes is to home in the wardrobe what have you got for shirts a redflannel article was displayed but sam didnt like the color it aint fashionable he said heres a blue one said the old man thats more like how much is it fifty cents fifty cents do you want to ruin me i wont give no fifty cents for a shirt its worth more it cost me fortyfive ill give thirtyfive after some haggling the price was accepted and the article was laid aside now show me some of your nice suits said sam ive got a place and i want to look like a gentleman have you got any money asked the old man with the momentary suspicion that he might be throwing his time and trouble away upon a penniless purchaser yes said sam what do you take me for how much have you got what do you want to know for i want to know what cloes to show you sam was about to answer five dollars when a shrewd thought changed his intention ive got four dollars he said even this was beyond the expectations of the dealer all right my son he said ill give you some nice cloes for four dollars youd better if you want me to come here again if you do well by me ill get all my cloes here a young man of fashion could not have spoken more condescendingly or with an air of greater importance than sam he was right in thinking that his patronage was of importance to the old man ill dress you so fine the gals will look at you as you go along the street he said go ahead said sam do your best by me and ill send my friends here without going into details it may be said that our hero selected everything to his satisfaction except a coat here he was rather particular finally he espied a blue coat with brass buttons hanging in a corner take down that coat he said i guess thatll suit me that costs too much i cant give you that and the rest of the things for four dollars why cant you id lose too much opposition confirmed sam in his determination to own it give it to me ill try it on he said putting it on he surveyed himself with satisfaction in a small cracked mirror true it was about two sizes too large but sam felt that in getting more cloth he was getting a better bargain thats my style he said dont i look fashionable ill have to ask you twentyfive cents more for that coat said the old dealer no you wont yes i must i ought to ask more then you may keep the rest of the cloes i dont want em sam made a movement as if to leave the store give me twenty cents more my son didnt i tell you i wasnt your son i wont give you no twenty cents but ill tell you what ill do ill give you these cloes ive got on the old man looked at them dubiously they aint worth much he said i know they aint but theyre worth twenty cents there was another critical inspection and the decision was given in sams favor you may have the cloes said the old man now wheres your money sam produced a fivedollar bill give me a dollar back he said the old man looked at him with the expression of one who had been cheated you said you had only four dollars he complained no i didnt i said i had four i didnt say that was all these cloes are worth five dollars no they aint and you wont get it from me do you think im going to give you all the money ive got the old man still looked dissatisfied im losin money on these cloes he muttered oh well if you dont want to sell em you neednt said sam independently theres another place round the corner give me four fifty no i wont i wont give you another cent ill give you four dollars and these cloes i have on a bargains a bargain if youre goin to do it say the word and if you aint im off sam carried his point and received back a dollar in change you neednt send the cloes round to my hotel ill change em here said our hero he set to work at once and in five minutes the change was effected the other clothes fitted him moderately well but the blue coat of the kind popularly called a swallowtail nearly trailed upon the ground but for that sam cared little he surveyed himself with satisfaction and felt that he was well dressed i guess ill do now he said to himself complacently as he walked out of the shop chapter ii sams first day in business is the boss in the speaker was sam barker and the young man addressed was a clerk in the office of henry dalton co he gazed with wonder and amusement at the grotesque figure before him have you business with mr dalton he inquired i should think i had said sam is he in not yet hell be here presently all right ill wait carefully parting the tails of his coat sam coolly deposited himself in an office chair and looked about him are you in business for yourself asked the clerk i have been said sam but im goin to work for mr dalton now did mr dalton hire you of course he did hes goin to pay me five dollars a week how much does he pay you thats a secret said the young man goodnaturedly is it well ill excuse you youre very kind thats a stylish coat youve got on isnt it said sam proudly and rising from the chair he turned around in order to display fully the admired garment who is your tailor i forget his name but he hangs out on chatham street i only bought this coat yesterday dont you think its a little too long maybe it is said sam but i dont mind it i can cut it down if i want to maybe theyve got another like it if you want one im supplied just at present said the young man what do you expect to do here im to be the errand boy does the boss work you very hard oh no hes reasonable how did you happen to get in with him i brought home his little boy the little chap was cryin round the streets when i met him and took him home oh youre the boy i heard him speak of well youre in luck for mr dalton is an excellent employer have you been with him long about four years do you think hell raise me soon that will depend a good deal upon yourself if you work faithfully no doubt he will sam made a resolution to work faithfully but then he found it easier to make resolutions than keep them theres mr dalton now said the clerk sam rose and faced his employer the latter looked at him in some surprise not immediately recognizing under the strange dress the boy whom he had engaged who are you he asked im the new boy said sam dont you remember you told me youd hire me at five dollars a week oh you are the boy are you why you look like an old man where did you raise that coat i bought it it makes you look like your own grandfather does it said sam rather taken aback i thought it was stylish you better exchange it i dont want a boy in my employment to be dressed in that way youll be taken for an old gentleman from the country sam smiled but looked rather disturbed i dont know as the man will take it back he said go and see ill give you a couple of dollars he will change it if you pay him something extra ill fix it said sam accepting the money with alacrity shall i go now yes and come back when you have made the exchange get something suitable for a boy of your age and not too large sam left the countingroom and made his way to the secondhand shop where he had made the purchase he succeeded in effecting an exchange for a coat which was less noticeable and that without paying any bonus if the boss dont say anything about the two dollars he thought ill be so much in much to his joy no questions were asked as to the terms on which he made the exchange and he felt that he could afford to go to the old bowery that evening when he came back he was called into the countingroom now my boy what is your name asked the merchant sam barker how old are you fifteen are your parents living no sir where do you live sam hesitated i aint got no regular place he answered at length where have you generally slept at the newsboys lodge i suppose you were a newsboy some of the time well it makes no difference what you have been you are now my errand boy i have engaged you without knowing very much about you because you have been of service to my little boy i hope you will serve me faithfully oh yes i will said sam looking particularly virtuous if you do your duty i shall take an interest in you and promote you as you deserve and give me more pay suggested sam yes if i find you deserve it i would rather pay high wages to a boy who suits me than small wages to an inefficient boy thems my sentiments said sam promptly but whether his sentiments referred to the service or the pay he did not make quite clear mr dalton smiled i am glad you agree with me he said there is one other point i wish to speak of as you are in my employment i want you to have a regular boardingplace i think it much better for a boy or young man you ought to be able to get board and a decent room for four dollars a week i guess i can said sam i will let you go at three oclock this afternoon two hours before our usual hour of closing that will give you time to secure a place now go out and mr budd will set you to work the clerk whom sam had first encountered was named william budd and to him he went for orders you may go to the post office for letters first said budd our box is all right said sam he rather liked this part of his duty it seemed more like play than work to walk through the streets and it was comfortable to think he was going to be paid for it too as he turned into nassau street he met an old acquaintance pat riley by name with a blacking box over his shoulders hello sam said pat hello yourself hows business times is dull with me what are you doin im in an office said sam with conscious pride are you what do you get five dollars a week how did you get it asked pat enviously they came to me and asked me if i would go to work said sam where are you goin now to the post office to get the letters youre in luck sam and no mistake got some new cloes aint you yes said sam how do you like em bully i had a tiptop coat blue with brass buttons but the boss made me change it he aint got no taste in dress thats so when i get money enough ill buy it for best to wear sundays he cant say nothing to that in course not well sam when you get rich you can let me black your boots all right pat said sam complacently who knows but ill be a rich merchant some time here pat spied a customer and the two had to part company sam continued on his way till he reached the old brick church which used to serve as the new york post office he entered and met with his first perplexity he could not remember the number of the box heres a go thought sam whats that number i wonder there was a thirtysix to it i know i guess it was anyhow ill ask for it is there any letters in he asked four letters were handed him sam looked at the address they were all directed to ferguson co that aint the name thought sam i guess im in a scrape but anyhow ill carry em to mr dalton so hell know i went to the office chapter iii sam finds a room heres the letters said sam as he entered the office on his return you may carry them in to mr dalton said william budd now for it thought sam as he entered the countingroom with reluctant step heres the letters mr dalton said our hero looking embarrassed mr dalton took them and glanced at the superscription whats all this he demanded this letter is for ferguson co and so are the rest what does it mean i guess theres some mistake said sam uncomfortably why did you take these letters did you think my name was ferguson demanded mr dalton no sir didnt you know they were not for me then they gave them to me at the post office stammered sam did you give the number of my box yes sir what number did you call for i dont remember answered sam abashed then you dont remember the number of my box i dont remember now sam admitted did you call for no yes said sam promptly thats not the number said the merchant quietly you must return these letters instantly and call for my mail i will give you the number of my box on a card and then you cant make any mistake you have made a blunder which must not be repeated yes sir said sam glad to get off with no sharper admonition he returned to the post office and this time he did his errand correctly at three oclock sam was permitted to leave the office and look out for a boardingplace he had managed to scrape acquaintance during the day with henry martin an errand boy in the next store and went to consult him where do you board he asked near st johns park answered henry is it a good place it will do i want to find a place to board is there room where you are yes you can come into my room if you like whatll i have to pay i pay a dollar and seventyfive cents a week for my room and get my meals out but the old lady will let the two of us have it for two fifty thatll make seventyfive cents for me said sam how do you make that out you pay just the same as you do now and ill make it up to two fifty look here young fellow youre smart but that wont go down said the other boy why not asked sam innocently you wont have to pay any more will you i would have to pay more than you and i dont mean to do it if we pay two fifty that will be just one twentyfive apiece thats better than you can do alone well ill try it said sam when are you goin round as soon as i get through work at five oclock ill wait for you sam might have gone back and finished out his afternoons work but it did not occur to him as desirable and he therefore remained with his new friend till the latter was ready to go with him how much wages do you get asked sam as they were walking along five dollars a week so do i havent you just gone into your place yes ive been in mine two years i ought to get more than you why dont you ask for more it wouldnt be any use i have asked and they told me to wait when ive been at work two years i expect to get ten dollars a week said sam youll have to take it out in expecting then will i asked sam rather crestfallen the fact is we boys dont get paid enough said henry no i guess not said sam assenting readily do you have to work pretty hard he inquired as hard as i want to it must be jolly to be a boss and only have to read letters and write em said sam who had rather an inadequate notion of his employers cares id like to be one ive got a rich uncle said henry martin i wish hed set me up in business when im twentyone how much is he worth about a hundred thousand dollars i dont know but more do you think he will set you up asked sam rather impressed i dont know if he does you might take me in with you so i will if your rich uncle will give you a lot of money too i havent got no rich uncle said sam i only wish i had mine is more ornamental than useful so far said henry well here we are at my place they stood before a shabby brick dwelling which bore unmistakable marks of being a cheap lodginghouse it isnt very stylish said henry apologetically i aint used to style said sam with perfect truth itll do for me ill call mrs brownly said henry after opening the front door with a latchkey well ask her about your coming in mrs brownly being summoned made her appearance she was a tall angular female with the worn look of a woman who has a hard struggle to get along mrs brownly said henry martin heres a boy who wants to room with me you said youd let the room to two for two dollars and a half a week yes said she cheered by the prospect of even a small addition to her income i have no objection what is his name same barker answered our hero have you got a place asked mrs brownly cautiously yes hes got a place near me answered henry martin for him i expect to be paid regularly said mrs brownly im a widow dependent on what i get from my lodgers i settle all my bills reglar said sam i aint owin anything except for the rent of a pianner last quarter mrs brownly looked surprised and so did henry martin the room you will have here isnt large enough for a piano she said i aint got no time to play now said sam my business is too pressing will you pay the first week in advance asked the landlady i dont think it would be convenient said sam then can you give me anything on account asked mrs brownly half a dollar will do sam reluctantly drew out fifty cents and handed to her now well go up and look at the room said henry it was a hall bedroom on the second floor back which was to be sams future home it appeared to be about six feet wide by eight feet long there was a pine bedstead one chair and a washstand which would have been improved by a fresh coat of paint over the bed hung a cheap print of gen washington in an equally cheap frame a row of pegs on the side opposite the bed furnished conveniences for hanging up clothes how do you like it asked henry martin tiptop answered sam with satisfaction well im glad you like it said his companion theres six pegs you can use half of them what for asked sam to hang up your extra clothes of course i havent got any except what ive got on said sam you havent no i suppose youve got some extra shirts and stockings no i havent ive been unfortunate and had to sell my wardrobe to pay my debts henry martin looked perplexed you dont expect to wear one shirt all the time do you he asked ill buy some more when ive got money enough youd better now lets go out and get some supper sam needed no second invitation chapter iv first lessons when supper was over sam inquired what shall we do suppose we take a walk suggested his companion id rather go to the old bowery i should like to go but i cant afford it you get five dollars a week dont you yes but i need all of it for board lodging and washing so will you too i advise you to be careful about spending whats the use of living if a fellow cant have a little fun grumbled sam there wont be much fun in going a day or two without anything to eat sam we wont have to let me see about that it costs a dollar and a quarter for the room to begin with then our meals will cost us as much as forty or fifty cents a day say three dollars a week that will leave seventyfive cents for clothes and washing it isnt much sam admitted i should think not i dont see how i am going to get any clothes you certainly cant if you go to the theater i used to go sometimes when i was a newsboy and i didnt earn so much money then probably you didnt have a regular room then no i didnt and sometimes i only had one meal a day that isnt a very nice way to live youre so old now you ought to be considering what youll do when you are a man i mean to earn more than five dollars a week then so do i but if i were a street boy picking up my living by blacking boots or selling papers i shouldnt expect to now we have a chance to learn business and improve were you ever a street boy asked sam becoming interested in his companions history no that is not over a month i was born in the country so was i said sam my father and mother both died leaving nothing and the people wanted to send me to the poorhouse but i didnt like that so i borrowed five dollars and came to new york when i got here i began to think i should have to go back again i tried to get a place and couldnt finally i bought some papers and earned a little money selling them it was better than nothing but all the while i was hoping to get a place one day as i was passing the store where i am now i saw some boys round the door i asked them what was going on they told me that hamilton co had advertised for an errand boy and they were going to try for the place i thought i might as well try too so i went in and applied i dont know how it was but out of about forty boys they took me did they give you five dollars a week right off no i only got three dollars the first year answered henry you couldnt live on that could you i had to you didnt have the room you have now did you i couldnt afford it i lived at the newsboys lodge and took my breakfast and suppers there that cost me eighteen cents a day or about a dollar and a quarter a week out of the rest i bought my dinners and clothes so i got along till the second year when my wages were raised to four dollars at the beginning of the third year i got a dollar more i suppose youll get six dollars next year i hope so mr hamilton has promised to put me in the countingroom then it seems a long time to wait said sam yes if you look ahead but after all time goes fast next year i expect to lay up some money do you think you can i know i can if i am well ive got some money in the savingsbank now you have exclaimed sam pricking up his ears yes how much thirty dollars thirty dollars ejaculated sam id feel rich if i was worth thirty dollars henry smiled i dont feel rich but i am glad ive got it you aint saving up money now are you i mean to now that i pay fifty cents a week less rent on account of your coming in with me i am going to save all that how can you i shall get along on two dollars and a half for meals i always have and i can do it now you can do it too if you want to i should starve to death said sam ive got a healthy appetite and my stomach dont feel right if i dont eat enough i dont like to stint myself any more than you but if i am ever to be worth anything i must begin to save when i am a boy do you ever smoke asked sam never and i wouldnt if it didnt cost anything why not its jolly it isnt good for a boy that is growing and i dont believe it does men any good do you smoke when i get a chance said sam it warms a fellow up in cold weather well it isnt cold weather now and youll find plenty of other ways to spend your money i cant help it if i dont go to the theater i must have a cigar sam stopped at a cigar store and bought a cheap article for three cents which he lighted and smoked with apparent enjoyment the conversation which has been reported will give a clew to the different characters of the two boys who after less than a days acquaintance have become roommates henry martin was about sams age but much more thoughtful and sedate he had begun to think of the future and to provide for it this is always an encouraging sign and an augury of success sam had not got so far yet he had been in the habit of living from day to day without much thought of the morrow whether he would be favorably affected by henrys example remains to be seen after a walk of an hour or more the boys went back to their room are you going to bed henry asked sam not yet what are you going to do study a little study exclaimed sam in astonishment whos goin to hear your lessons perhaps you will said henry with a smile i why im a regular knownothing what are you going to study to begin with im going to do some sums henry drew from under the bed a tattered arithmetic and a slate and pencil he opened the arithmetic at interest and proceeded to set down a problem on the slate have you got away over there asked sam yes ive been at work ever since last october i dont get on very fast because i have only my evenings what do you do when you come to a tough customer i try again there are some sums i have tried a half a dozen times you must have a lot of patience said sam i dont know about that i always feel paid when i get the right answer at last it must be dull work studyin every night i couldnt do it it would make my head ache your head is tougher than you think for said henry just let me see what sum you are tryin his roommate handed him the books and he read the following example john smith borrowed at per cent and repaid it at the end of two years five months and six days what amount was he required to pay can you do that asked sam i think so it isnt very hard i never could do it its too hard oh yes you could if you had gone over the earlier part of the arithmetic whats the use of it any way dont you see its business if you are going to be a business man you may need to understand interest i shouldnt expect to be promoted if i didnt know something about arithmetic i am only an errand boy now and dont need it i wish i knew as much as you what else do you study i practice writing every evening here is my writingbook henry drew out from under the bed a writingbook which was more than half written through he had evidently taken great pains to imitate the copy and with fair success sam was quite impressed you can write as well as the teacher i went to up in the country he said you can write cant you sam not much i havent tried lately everybody ought to know how to read and write a decent hand i spose so said sam but theres a lot of work in it he got into bed and while he was watching henry doing sums he fell asleep his roommate devoted an hour to arithmetic and wrote a page in his copybook then he too undressed and went to bed chapter v sams finances sam did not find it quite so pleasant being in a place as he had anticipated he had been accustomed to roam about the streets subject only to his own control now he was no longer his own master he must go and come at the will of his employer to be sure his earnings were greater than in his street life and he had a regular home he knew beforehand where he was going to sleep and was tolerably sure of a meal but before the end of the first week he got out of money this was not strange for he had begun without any reserve fund on the third day he applied to henry martin for a loan if you dont lend me some stamps ill have to go without breakfast he said when shall you get your first weeks pay asked henry saturday night the boss said though i didnt go to work till wednesday then you need money for your meals today and tomorrow yes said sam ill lend you a dollar if youll be sure to pay me up tomorrow night ill do it sure there it is then now sam i want to give you a little advice what is it tomorrow after paying me and putting by enough to pay the rent of the room youll have two dollars and seventyfive cents left so i shall said sam with satisfaction you mustnt forget that this has got to last you for meals for the next week how much is it a day about forty cents i guess i can make it do i shall get along for two fifty and you ought to find what you will have left enough ive had to live on ten cents a day moren once said sam thats too little i should think it was i went to bed hungry you bet well theres no need of being so economical as that youve got to eat enough or you wont be fit for work youll have to be careful though if you want to come out even oh i can manage it said sam confidently but sam was mistaken he proved himself far from a good calculator on sunday he gratified an unusually healthy appetite besides buying two fivecent cigars this made necessary an outlay of seventyfive cents the next day also he overran his allowance the consequence was that on wednesday night he went to bed without a cent he did not say anything about the state of his finances to henry however till the next morning henry he said i guess ill have to borrer a little more money what for asked his companion i havent got anything to buy my breakfast with how does that happen i dont know said sam i must have lost some out of my pocket i dont think you have you have been extravagant thats whats the matter how much did you spend on sunday i dont know i do for i kept account you spent seventyfive cents thats twice as much as you could afford it was only for one day at any rate you have used up in four days as much as ought to have lasted you the whole week i dont get enough pay grumbled sam who was unprepared with any other excuse there are plenty of boys that have to live on as small pay i am one of them will you lend me some money ill tell you what i will do ill lend you twentyfive cents every morning and youll have to make it do all day i cant live on that you spend more yourself i know i do but if you spend twice as much as you ought one day youve got to make it up another give me the money for three days all at once said sam no i wont why not youd spend it all in one day and want to borrow some more tomorrow no i wouldnt then you dont need it all the first day youre mean grumbled sam no im not im acting like a friend its for your own good what can i get for twentyfive cents thats your lookout you wouldnt have had to live on it if you hadnt been too free other days in spite of sams protestations henry remained firm and sam was compelled to restrain his appetite for the remainder of the week i am ashamed to say that when saturday night came sam tried to evade paying his just debt but this his roommate would not permit that wont do sam he said you must pay me what you owe me you neednt be in such an awful hurry muttered sam its better for both of us that you pay it now said henry if you didnt youd spend it ill pay you next week i want to go to hear the minstrels tonight you cant go on borrowed money if i pay you up i dont have enough to last me till next pay day thats your lookout do you know what i would do if i was in your place what would you do id live on four dollars a week till id got five dollars laid aside id like the five dollars but i dont want to starve myself it would be rather inconvenient living on four dollars i admit but you would feel paid for it afterward besides sam you need some shirts and stockings i cant keep lending you mine as i have been doing ever since you came here i cant afford to buy any ill tell you what ill do ill buy some for you if youll agree to pay me up at the rate of fifty cents a week all right said sam who was very ready to make promises give me the money and ill buy some tonight id rather go with you and see that you get them said henry quietly you might forget what you were after and spend the money for something else perhaps sam recognized the justice of his companions caution at any rate he interposed no objection i hope my young readers who are used to quite a different style of living will not be shocked on being told that sam purchased secondhand articles at a place recommended by his roommate considering the small sum at his command he had no choice in the matter boys who have to pay their entire expenses out of five dollars a week cannot patronize fashionable tailors or shirt makers so for three dollars sam got a sufficient supply to get along with though hardly enough to make a display at a fashionable watering place sam put the bundle containing this important addition to his wardrobe under his arm not without a feeling of complacency now said henry it will take you six weeks to pay me for these at half a dollar a week all right said sam carelessly he was not one to be disturbed about a debt and his companion was shrewd enough to see that he must follow sam up if he wanted to get his money paid at the periods agreed upon henry martin continued to devote a part of every evening to study he tried to prevail upon sam to do the same but without success i get too tired to study said sam and while his roommate was at home he was in the habit of strolling about the streets in search of amusement on the next tuesday evening he met a boy of his acquaintance who inquired where he was going nowhere in particular said sam come into frenchs hotel and see them play billiards sam complied there was one vacant table and presently the other proposed a game i cant afford it said sam oh it wont be much if you beat me ill have to pay sam yielded and they commenced playing both being novices the game occupied an hour and sam who was beaten found to his dismay that he had to pay sixty cents it dont seem moren fifteen minutes he said to himself its awful dear so it is said his companion but if you had beaten me you would have got off for nothing i dont see how im goin to live on five dollars a week thought sam uncomfortably i wonder when theyll raise me chapter vi sams luck when towns and cities find their income insufficient to meet their expenditures they raise money by selling bonds sam would gladly have resorted to this device or any other likely to replenish his empty treasury but his credit was not good he felt rather bashful about applying to his roommate for money being already his debtor and in his emergency thought of the senior clerk william budd mr budd he said summoning up his courage will you lend me a dollar what for inquired the young man regarding him attentively i havent got anything to pay for my meals the rest of the week said sam how does that happen i cant live on five dollars a week then suppose i lend you a dollar i dont see that you will be able to repay me oh ill pay you back said sam glibly have you got any security to offer me any security asked sam who was inexperienced in business yes have you got any houses or lands any stocks or bonds which you can put in my hands as collateral i guess not said sam scratching his head if i had any houses id sell em and then i wouldnt have to borrer so you cant get along on five dollars a week no the boy that was here before you lived on that ive had to pay a lot of money for clothes sam explained brightening up with the idea how much well i had to buy the suit i have on and then i had to get some shirts the other day how much does it cost you for billiards asked william budd quietly sam started and looked embarrassed billiards he stammered yes thats what i said who told you i played billiards no one i guess youre mistaken then said sam more boldly concluding that it was only a conjecture of his fellow clerk i dont think i am i had occasion to go into frenchs hotel to see a friend in the office and i glanced into the billiard room i saw you playing with another boy of about your age did he beat you yes and you had to pay for the game dont you think as your income is so small that you had better stop playing billiards till you get larger pay i dont play very often said sam uneasily i advise you not to let mr dalton know that you play at all he would be apt to think that you were receiving too high pay since you could afford to pay for this amusement i hope you wont tell him said sam anxiously no i dont tell tales about my fellow clerks then wont you lend me a dollar inquired sam returning to the charge i would rather not under the circumstances sam was disappointed he had five cents left to buy lunch with and his appetite was uncommonly healthy why wasnt i born rich thought sam i guess i have a pretty hard time i wish i could find a pocketbook or something sam was a juvenile micawber and trusted too much to something turning up instead of going to work and turning it up himself however strangely enough something did turn up that very afternoon restricted to five cents sam decided to make his lunch of apples for this sum an old woman at the corner would supply him with three and they were very filling for the price after eating his apples he took a walk being allowed about forty minutes for lunch he bent his steps toward wall street and sauntered along wishing he were not obliged to go back to the office all at once his eye rested on a gold ring lying on the sidewalk at his feet he stooped hurriedly and picked it up putting it in his pocket without examination lest it might attract the attention of the owner or some one else who would contest its possession with him thats almost as good as a pocketbook thought sam elated its gold i could see that i can get something for that at the pawnbrokers ill get some supper tonight even if i cant borrer any money some boys would have reflected that the ring was not theirs to pawn but sam as the reader has found out by this time was not a boy of high principles he had a very easy code of morality and determined to make the most of his good fortune when he got a chance he took a look at his treasure there was a solitary diamond of considerable size set in it sam did not know much about diamonds and had no conception of the value of this stone his attention was drawn chiefly to the gold of which there was considerable he thought very little of the piece of glass as he considered it id orter get five dollars for this he thought complacently five dollars will be a great help to a poor chap like me ill go round to the pawnbrokers just as soon as i get out of the store william budd was rather puzzled by sams evident good spirits considering that he was impecunious enough to require a loan which he had been unable to negotiate it was rather remarkable have you succeeded in borrowing any money sam he asked with some curiosity no answered sam with truth i havent asked anybody but you you dont seem to mind it much whats the use of fretting said sam im expecting a legacy from my uncle how much five dollars that isnt very large i hope you wont have to wait for it too long no i hope not i guess ill get along did you get any lunch yes i bought three apples did they fill you up asked budd with a smile theres a little room left answered sam if youd like to try the experiment theres a peanut then thankful for small favors im afraid itll be lonely if you dont give me another take that then its the last one i have hes a goodnatured boy after all thought the young clerk some boys would have been offended with me for having refused to lend he did not understand the cause of sams good spirits but thought him unusually light hearted when the office closed and sam was released from duty he took his way at once to a small pawn office with which he had become familiar in the course of his varied career though he had not often possessed anything of sufficient value to pawn the pawnbroker a small old man a german by birth scanned sam attentively regarding him as a possible customer how do you do my boy he said politely oh im tiptop have you got any money to give away what shall i give it for asked the old man ive got a ring here said sam that i want to pawn show it to me the pawnbroker started in surprise and admiration when his eye fell on the sparkling brilliant where did you get it he asked it was left by my grandmother said sam promptly the pawnbroker shrugged his shoulders not believing a word of the story isnt it a nice ring asked sam so so answered the old man i have seen much better how much do you want for it how much will you give me two dollars answered the old man then you wont get it said sam you wont get it for a cent under five that is too much said the old man from force of habit ill give you four no you wont youll give me five and i wont sell it for that neither i may want to get it back as it was my aunts you said your grandmother left it to you said the old man shrewdly so she did answered sam unabashed but she left it to my aunt first when my aunt died it came to me without dwelling upon the efforts which the pawnbroker made to get the ring cheaper it is sufficient to say that sam carried his point and marched out of the store with five dollars and a pawn ticket in his pocket chapter vii twentyfive dollars reward henry martin was rather surprised at not receiving from sam another application for a loan that evening he had watched sams rate of expenditure and decided that he must be at the bottom of his purse he was surprised therefore to find that his roommate ordered an unusually expensive supper and paid for the same out of a twodollar bill i didnt think you were so rich sam he remarked i can manage better than you think i can said sam with an important air i am glad to hear it i want you to get along i guess ill get along heres the fifty cents i was to pay you this week you were not to pay it till saturday never mind ill pay it now henry martin was surprised but his surprise was of an agreeable character he was convinced that sam must have obtained money from some other quarter but decided not to inquire about it he would wait till sam chose to tell him are you going back to the room sam he inquired no im going to the theater wont you go too no i dont want to give up my studies one evening wont matter perhaps not but i will wait till some other time you must have a sweet time working all day and studying all night said sam rather contemptuously not quite all night answered henry smiling you dont take any time for amusement i am looking forward to the future i want to rise in the world so do i but i aint going to kill myself with work i dont think you ever will sam ill be willing to insure you from dying in that way sam laughed i guess youre right there he said well if you wont go ill leave you i spose youll be asleep when i get home so goodnight goodnight sam said henry goodhumoredly i wonder how soon hell be wanting to borrow money again he thought the next morning when sam reached the office he found william budd glancing at the herald you are late said the young clerk i was out late last evening said sam apologetically at a fashionable party i suppose not exactly i was at the theater i thought you were out of money yesterday oh i raised a little it seems to me you are rather extravagant for your means i guess ill come out right said sam carelessly by the way you havent found a diamond ring have you asked budd his eyes fixed upon the paper sam was startled but his fellow clerk was scanning the paper and did not observe his embarrassment what makes you ask that sam inquired nothing only youd be in luck if you did why would i heres an advertisement from a man who has lost such a ring offering twentyfive dollars reward to the finder twentyfive dollars ejaculated sam in excitement does he say where he lost it supposed to have been lost in wall street wall street repeated sam it must be the one i found he thought yes i dont suppose theres much chance of his getting it back again let me see the advertisement said sam there it is said budd handing him the paper sam read it carefully and impressed the address upon his memory no wall street the advertiser was john chester are you going out to look for it asked william in joke i guess there wouldnt be much show for me probably somebody has picked it up already no doubt shall i go to the post office of course not till after you have swept the office did you expect me to do that sam probably never swept so quickly before he was anxious to get out and see what chance he had of earning the twentyfive dollars for he was convinced that the ring advertised for was the one he had found he was provoked to think he had been so quick in pawning it if he only had it in his possession now he would have nothing to do but to call on mr chester and receive twentyfive dollars with that amount he would feel as rich as a millionaire now the problem was to get hold of the ring and this in sams circumstances was not an easy problem to solve of the five dollars he had received from the pawnbroker he had but three left and it was idle to expect to recover it unless he should pay the full price and the commission besides what shall i do thought sam perplexed here is a chance to make twenty dollars extra if i only had three dollars more a bright idea dawned upon him if he would only get his weeks wages in advance he would be able to manage he would broach the subject do you think mr budd mr dalton would be willing to pay me my weeks wages today instead of saturday he inquired i know he wouldnt its contrary to his rule but it is important for me to have the money today pleaded sam dont you think he would do it if i told him that budd shook his head it wouldnt be a good plan to ask him he said he would conclude that you were living beyond your means and that he doesnt like couldnt you lend me the money asked sam i told you yesterday i couldnt that is i am not willing to i dont approve of the way you spend your money its only for this time said sam ill never ask you again i may as well be frank with you said the young man if you were economical and were short o money from sickness or any other cause which you could not control i would say yes but while you complain of your salary as insufficient you play billiards and spend the evening at the theater and these things i dont approve i didnt do that when i was in your position how do i know but you want your money in advance to spend in the same way i dont said sam what do you want of it then the fact is said sam its to get something out of the pawnbrokers what is it its a coat said sam forced to tell a lie when did you pledge it yesterday and you spent the money going to the theater said budd sarcastically yes said sam confused then you ought to be ashamed of yourself i wont do it again if you will lend me money to get it out you can wait till saturday when you receive your wages you have a coat on and certainly cannot need the other i didnt know that you had another by the way sam was beginning to see that he had only got himself into a scrape by his false statement and he did not know how to extricate himself i need it before saturday he said why do you wont this do the fact is said sam theres a fellow wants to buy it from me and he wants it today or he wont take it why do you want to sell your clothes sam because i need the money it seems to me you are managing very poorly rather than economize you pawn your coat and then try to sell it so you are continually getting yourself into trouble i know it said sam but i dont mean to do it again if youll take my advice you will leave your coat where it is till you are able to redeem it dont think of selling it for a new one would cost you more than you will get for it this advice was good but it did not apply to sams case since he had no coat to pawn it will easily be understood therefore that it proved unsatisfactory to him he didnt reply but finished his sweeping and then putting on his hat he went to the post office for letters chapter viii an unexpected obstacle as sam walked rapidly to the post office he tried to think of some way of raising the money he needed if his credit had been better henry martin might have accommodated him but sam was conscious that he had not treated his roommate in such a way as to inspire confidence then it occurred to him that he might obtain the ring back by giving the pawnbroker what money he had and leaving his vest on deposit with him at any rate it would do no harm to try there was no time to go round to the pawnbrokers now for his employer was very particular about receiving his letters promptly and so great a delay might lead to his dismissal he waited therefore until dinner time and then went round the pawnbroker recognized him at once and regretted to see him he knew the value of the ring and was afraid sam wished to redeem it what can i do for you he asked pretending not to know him i was here yesterday said sam dont you remember me i have so many come in i cant remember them all but i left a ring here a ring repeated the pawnbroker vacantly what kind of a ring a ring with a stone set in it oh you left it here yes and you gave me five dollars on it did i then i gave you too much sam was glad to hear this evidently the man so he thought did not understand the value of the ring and would be glad to let him have it again it was for his interest to let him think so i guess youre right he said the ring wasnt worth much but my grandfather left it to me and so i like it you said it was your grandmother yesterday remarked the pawnbroker shrewdly did i well its all the same said sam getting over the little difficulty i should like to have it again have you got the receipt asked the pawnbroker to gain time yes ive got it here the man looked discomfited but sams next words freed him from anxiety i want to ask of you a favor said sam i havent got money enough here but ill pay you what ive got and bring you the rest tomorrow oh no you wont said the old man smiling and wagging his head do you think i am a fool that isnt the way i do business my boy but i swear to you i will bring you the money said sam earnestly ill give you a little extra besides to pay you for waiting you are very kind said the pawnbroker revealing his yellow teeth in a cunning smile but i cant do it sam had one other resource then he proposed ill pay you all the money i have and give you my vest besides to keep till tomorrow how much money have you got three dollars and your vest is worth about twentyfive cents twentyfive cents repeated sam looking insulted do you think i would wear a twentyfive cent vest it is all it is worth to me i lent you five dollars and you want to put me off with three dollars and a quarter but i would come round tomorrow and give you the money shall you have the money tomorrow inquired the dealer yes answered sam where will you get it i aint obliged to tell that it dont make no difference to you well if you get the money tomorrow you can come round tomorrow said the old man with the air of one who had announced his ultimatum but i want it today particular persisted sam why do you want it today particular asked the pawnbroker looking curious im going to a party tonight said sam whose imagination was always to be relied upon i want to wear the ring there did you expect to go to the party without a vest queried the old man oh ive got another at home said sam composedly youll have to do without the ring till you bring me the money said the pawnbroker finally sam saw from his manner that he was in earnest and as perplexed as ever he left the shop what am i going to do now he thought its a shame to give up the reward on account of that mean old man why cant he trust me id like to know does he think i would cheat him then a new fear disturbed sam the pawnbroker might see the reward and himself go to the advertiser and claim it i wonder whether he takes the herald thought our hero something must be done and at once it was quite impossible to let such a golden chance slip by so finally he determined to see henry martin and if absolutely necessary tell him the whole story and get him to accompany him to the pawnbrokers shop on his way back he happened to overtake henry in the street and broached the subject to him henry listened to him attentively so that is where you got your supply of money from sam he said yes i thought you must have raised some somewhere or you would have been borrowing of me i want to borrow three dollars of you now or three fifty to make sure i have enough you had no right to pawn that ring sam you ought to have remembered that it was not yours i couldnt help it i was out of money besides i didnt know whose it was it was your duty to find out or try to find out could i go round the city asking everybody if the ring belonged to them no but you could have advertised it in some paper how could i when i was dead broke you know i couldnt well what do you propose to do now i want you to lend me money enough to get back the ring then ill go round to wall street and return it and get the twentyfive dollars reward and pay you back every cent i owe you henry reflected i dont know but thats the best way he said but i must go with you to see that its all right of course you can i want you to said sam relieved we cant go now for there isnt time come into my place as soon as you get away and well go round together all right henry youre a trump and no mistake i thought youd help me out sams cheerfulness returned and he went to work with more alacrity all the afternoon he was forming plans for the disposal of the reward when it came into his hands about a quarter after five the two boys entered the pawnbrokers office the latter was not particularly pleased to see sam and his countenance showed it i guess ill take that ring mister said sam in an independent tone what ring oh you know well enough have you brought the money yes ive got it here it will be five dollars and a half that is too much but ill give it to you so just hand it over wait a minute my friend said the pawnbroker where did you get the ring ive told you already you said your grandmother left it to you but i dont believe it i cant help what you believe just hand it over i have a strong suspicion my young friend that it is stolen its a lie said sam angrily im not sure about that i think ill call a policeman here henry martin interfered did you think it was stolen when you advanced money on it he asked yes i did said the pawnbroker your friends story was too thin then said henry quietly youve got yourself into trouble you can be arrested for receiving stolen goods the pawnbroker turned pale he knew very well that he was in a dilemma my friend didnt tell you the truth continued henry he found the ring and now he has found the owner he wants to return it and that is why he is here unless you give it up i will myself call a policeman henrys quiet assured manner produced its effect with great reluctance the pawnbroker produced the ring the charges were paid and the two boys retired triumphant chapter ix restoring the ring now said henry we had better go down to wall street and see the advertiser at once if we can restore the ring tonight we shall avoid the risk of losing it what makes you say we asked sam uneasily you dont expect any of the reward do you i only expect you to pay me back what you owe me sam the ring was found by you and you are entitled to the reward sam looked relieved of course ill pay you all i owe you as soon as i get the twentyfive dollars he said have you got the advertisement can you tell the name and number of the advertiser yes his name is john chester and his office is at no wall street good we must go down directly or he will be gone the boys hurried to the office which was on the third floor of the building a young man of eighteen or nineteen was in sole possession it may be remarked by the way that mr chester was a lawyer and this young man had just entered the office as student that cant be mr chester said henry in a low voice as the young man turned upon their entrance and fixed his eyes inquiringly upon them ill ask said sam are you mr chester he inquired the youth looked flattered at being mistaken for his employer mr chester has gone home he answered consequentially but perhaps i can do well do you come on business yes said sam ahem law business i suppose said the lawyers assistant looking wise state your case and i may be able to assist you is it a case of trespass or do you wish to obtain a habeas corpus or a caveat or a nisi prius what a lot he knows thought sam respectfully i dont want none of those things perhaps you want to obtain a divorce said the budding barrister in a jocular tone i am afraid we cant manage that for you we want to see mr chester on particular business said henry martin well you cant see him tonight hes gone home where does he live he dont see clients at his house it wont be any use going there i guess hell see us well take the risk what is your business about asked the young man with curiosity its private said henry very important no doubt said the disappointed neophyte mr chester will think so said sam where did you say he lived did you come about the ring asked the young man with a sudden thought what ring asked sam cunningly mr chester lost a ring in wall street yesterday and advertised it in the herald i didnt know but you had found it suppose we had said sam then you can give it to me and ill take it up to mr chester thank you but if ive found it ill carry it up myself have you got it you can ask mr chester about it tomorrow morning where does he live ive a great mind not to tell you said the law student resentfully then ill find out in the directory and let mr chester know you wouldnt tell us upon this sam got the desired information he was told that mr chester lived in west thirtyfifth street let us go said henry sam followed him out shall we go up there tonight he asked yes it is no doubt very valuable and the sooner we get it into the hands of the owner the better they took the university place cars and in a little more than half an hour reached thirtyfifth street they heard the neighboring clocks strike six as they rang the bell the door was opened by a colored man does mr chester live here asked sam yes was the reply can i see him hes just gone in to dinner i only want to see him a minute mr chester dont like to be disturbed when hes at dinner you can come round again in an hour sam looked at henry for advice tell mr chester said henry that we have found something belonging to him and wish to return it to him you havent found his ring said the servant excited yes we have but we will only deliver it into his hands come right in just stand here in the hall and ill tell him presently a pleasantlooking man of middle age came from the diningroom and looked inquiringly from one to the other which is the boy that has my ring he asked im the one said sam promptly show it to me if you please you promised a reward of twentyfive dollars said sam with anxiety certainly if the ring is mine you shall have the reward thereupon sam produced the ring mr chester received it with great satisfaction yes it is the one he said where did you find it sam described the place as well as he could so you saw my advertisement yes sir a friend of mine read it to me this morning why didnt you bring it to my office before sam hesitated but henry said in a low voice tell the truth sam the fact is said he i pawned it and it was some trouble for me to get it again you pawned it how much did you get on it five dollars five dollars why the ring cost six hundred dollars henry and sam looked at each other in blank astonishment how could that little ring be worth so much i am glad we didnt know how much it was worth said henry it would have made us feel nervous i am surprised that the pawnbroker gave it back to you at all said mr chester he must have known something of its value he didnt want to give it up he said it was stolen and he would call the police what did you say then henry asked him if he thought it was stolen when i brought it to him and he said yes then henry threatened to have him taken up for receiving stolen goods good said mr chester laughing your friend would make a good lawyer at any rate i am glad i have got it back have you had dinner boys no sir answered henry then come in and dine with me my family are all away except my wife and there is plenty of room thank you sir said henry martin we will accept your invitation you can hang your hats up and follow me sam began to feel bashful but he obeyed directions and followed mr chester into a handsome diningroom in the rear extension where a lady was already sitting at one end of the table i bring you two guests mrs chester said her husband these two young gentlemen have brought me my diamond ring you are indeed fortunate in recovering it said his wife young gentlemen you can sit one on this side the other opposite i think john you will have to introduce them by name really that is more than i can do said the lawyer laughing my name is henry martin said henry who was perfectly selfpossessed mine is sam barker said the young outlaw shall i send you some soup mr martin yes thank you and you mr barker sam stared and wanted to laugh it seemed so droll to be called mr barker but he managed to answer properly mr chester was a man of some humor and he enjoyed sams evident embarrassment he took pains to be ceremoniously polite sam who was used to the free and easy ways of a restaurant hardly knew how to act henry martin though now thrown upon his own exertions had been well brought up and betrayed no awkwardness at the close of the meal to which sam despite his bashfulness did full justice mr chester opened his pocketbook and produced twentyfive dollars in bills is this to be divided between you he inquired no sir said henry sam found the ring it is all for him allow me to offer you five dollars also said the lawyer who was pleased with henrys manner thank you sir i would rather not take it at all events if i can ever be of any service to you let me know thank you sir soon afterward the boys left the house chapter x sams investment what a fool you were not to take the money he offered you said sam when they were in the street why should i i didnt find the ring i had no claim to it no matter if he was willing to give it to you he can afford it i have no doubt of it but i didnt want to take it you aint much like me henry you wouldnt catch me refusing i presume not said henry smiling i say wasnt that a tiptop dinner said sam smacking his lips as he thought of it it beats the restaurant all hollow wed have had to pay a dollar apiece for such a lot of things and then they wouldnt have been so good thats so sam we cant expect to live like that every day theres one thing seems funny henry them bowls of water they bring on at the end to wash your hands in i was just goin to drink mine when i saw mr chester wash his fingers in his it dont seem nice to have wash bowls on the dinnertable we never have been much into fashionable society sam ive no doubt there are a good many things that would seem strange to us if we did when i am rich ill live just like mr chester said sam enthusiastically we have never been much into fashionable society sam ive no doubt there are a good many things that would seem strange to us if we did when i am rich ill live just like mr chester said sam enthusiastically if you ever want to be rich you must save up money i cant now why cant you save up part of these twentyfive dollars i owe part of it to you only about five dollars ive got to get along till the end of the week you ought to be able to save fifteen dollars at any rate ill go with you to the savingsbank and you can put it in tonight i know a bank that keeps open till eight oclock sam hesitated and looked reluctant i guess ill wait and see how much i need to carry me through the week he said at any rate pay me what you owe me and ill deposit a part of it on my own account settlement was made and henry accompanied by sam went round to the sixpenny savingsbank then established on astor place in a part of the mercantile library building it is kept open every day in the week from a m till p m thus affording better accommodation to depositors than most institutions of the kind sam had never been in a savingsbank before and he looked about him with curiosity henry took the fivedollar bill which sam had paid him and handed it with his bankbook to the receiving clerk saying i want to deposit three dollars of this an entry was made in the book which was returned to him with two dollars change henry turned away is that all asked sam yes that is all supposin you wanted to draw out money what would you do then go to that other clerk and tell him how much you wanted to draw he would give you a paper to sign and then hed give you the money how much money have you got here now henry thirtyfive dollars answered his companion with pardonable pride thats about twice as much as i have got here yes dont you think you had better take out a book i guess i will come next week said sam hesitating you have no idea how independent it makes me feel said henry now if i am sick i know i shant have to suffer for a time at least i could live for seven or eight weeks on what ive got here in the bank thats so i wish i had thirtyfive dollars you may have it after a while if youll do as i do be economical and saving ill think about it said sam id like to have something to fall back upon in my old age henry commended this plan though he knew sam too well to have much hope of his carrying it out as it turned out not a dollar of the reward which he had been paid found its way to the savingsbank how it was disposed of we shall see the next day as sam was going to the office he met a young man with whom he had lately become acquainted how are you sam he asked tiptop answered sam how does the world use you pretty well ive just made some money how much twentyfive dollars that isnt bad how did you do it i found a diamond ring in wall street and got the money for a reward have you got it now most of it what are you going to do with it henry martin advises me to put it in the savingsbank who is henry martin he is a boy that rooms with me take my advice and dont do it why not would the bank break i dont know as it would but what good would it do they give you interest dont they yes but its only six per cent the interest on twentyfive dollars would only come to a dollar and a half in a year thats too slow for me what would you advise me to do then asked sam is there any way of making money ill tell you what id do if i were you id buy part of a ticket in the havana lottery could i make money that way say you bought a fifth of a ticket that would come to ten dollars now the biggest prize is a hundred thousand dollars it almost took away sams breath to think of such a large sum i couldnt draw that could i he asked eagerly you might draw a fifth of it that would be twenty thousand dollars why that would make me rich exclaimed sam in excitement id never have to work no more besides there are other prizes a great many only smaller id be pretty sure to draw something wouldnt i youd stand just as good a chance as anybody have you got any tickets in the lottery yes i bought a fifth of a ticket yesterday where do they sell em asked sam his companion told him i guess ill go round and buy one he said it must be better than putting the money in the savingsbank thats what i think you may not get a big prize the first time to be sure but its worth waiting for sam was not much of a financier nor did he know how little real chance there was of drawing the large prize he desired he did not know that it was about the most foolish use he could make of his money he was deceived by the consideration that somebody would win the prize and that his chance was as good as anybody it is always unlucky for a boy or young man when he yields for the first time to the fatal fascination of the lottery he may fail time after time but continue to hug the delusion that the next time will bring him luck there are clerks in new york and other large cities who have not only squandered all their own savings but abstracted money from their employers led on by this ruinous passion during his noon intermission sam went round to the lottery office and returned with the coveted ticket he put it away with great complacency and gave himself up to dreams of future wealth if he could only win that twenty thousand dollars how rich he would be how he would triumph over henry with his poor thirtyfive dollars in the savingsbank poor henry ill do something for him if i only win the prize he thought maybe ill buy out some big business and make him my clerk with a good salary wont it be jolly no doubt it would but sam was counting chickens that were not very likely to be hatched there was another bad consequence of his purchase it made him lavish of the money he had left it amounted to nine dollars and some odd cents had he followed henrys advice a part of this would have been deposited in the bank but sams dreams of wealth led him to look upon it as a mere trifle hardly worth taking into account so day by day it melted away till there was none left chapter xi henry becomes a merchant while sam was impatiently awaiting the drawing of the havana lottery henry too made an investment but of an entirely different character he was in the employ of a shipping house which dispatched vessels to different parts of the world with assorted cargoes the head of the firm was james hamilton a man who stood deservedly high not only in the mercantile world but as a citizen he had served his native city as an alderman and had been offered the nomination for mayor by the party to which he belonged but had declined on account of the imperative claims of his private business mr hamilton had long noticed with a feeling of approval henry martins faithful performance of duty though he had not promoted him rapidly he was observing him carefully fully determined to serve him in the future if he should deserve it this henry did not know his employer was not a man of many words and he was not aware that he had attracted his attention sometimes even he felt depressed by the thought that he was getting on so slowly but it did not so affect him as to make him careless or neglectful of his duties even if he did not obtain promotion he meant to deserve it one morning about this time a clerk came to henry and said mr hamilton wishes to see you in his private office henry was a little startled the idea came to him that he might have done something which had displeased his employer and that he was to be reprimanded perhaps discharged this would be so disastrous to him that the thought of it made him turn pale still think as he might he could not call to mind any error he had committed and this somewhat encouraged him he entered the office saying respectfully did you wish to see me sir yes said the merchant looking up from his writing sit down please it may be remarked that it was mr hamiltons custom to be as polite to his subordinates as to his social equals henry sat down how long have you been in my employ henry asked the merchant i am now on my fourth year how old are you nearly sixteen sir you entered upon your business career very early yes sir earlier than i wished but i was obliged to earn my living and had no choice have you parents living no sir are you entirely dependent upon what i pay you for your support yes sir i hope you dont get into debt no sir i have even saved a little money indeed said his employer with interest what have you done with it deposited it in the sixpenny savings bank that is well how much have you saved thirtyfive dollars it isnt much but it is a beginning it is a good deal for a boy in your circumstances to save said mr hamilton with emphasis how much do i pay you five dollars a week i suppose you consider that small pay henry smiled any addition will be acceptable he answered but i dont complain of it it shall be raised to seven at once said the merchant thank you sir said henry his face showing the delight he felt you are very kind i shall feel quite rich now i suppose you will now live in a little better style suggested mr hamilton i dont think i shall sir i shall increase my savings that is well i commend your selfdenial and prudence how much interest does the savingsbank pay you six per cent sir i will propose a different investment i am about to send a cargo of goods to rotterdam the venture will i think prove a paying one would you like to join in it henry stared at his employer in surprise how could he a boy with thirtyfive dollars capital join in such an enterprise i dont see how i can he replied i am afraid you take me for a capitalist so you are said his employer have you not money in the bank henry smiled i dont think that will go very far he said perhaps not and therefore if you are going to take part in my venture i suggest that you borrow five hundred dollars henry was surprised once more he began to think mr hamilton was out of his head yet he did not look so on the contrary as he smiled kindly upon henry he looked what he was a shrewd kindly longheaded man of business still he had just advised an almost penniless boy to borrow five hundred dollars i dont know anybody that would lend me so much money said henry why dont you apply to me suggested his employer would you lend me five hundred dollars asked the boy in surprise am i to regard that as an application inquired mr hamilton yes sir said henry if you think it well for me to borrow it then i answer yes upon conditions first let me explain why i advise you to borrow i have little doubt that you will find the venture a profitable one next you may place your savingsbank book in my hands as security thirtyfive dollars will pay a years interest on the five hundred dollars i lend you so my interest is secure but suppose the speculation shouldnt pay mr hamilton as to that i know so much about it that i am willing to take the risk i do not scruple to say that if the money were to be placed in your hands for investment according to your own judgment i should have some doubts as to your being able to repay it to me at the end of the year probably you are right sir said henry but as it is i am willing to take the risk do you think of any objections i was only thinking said henry that i might want to save up more money from my wages but if you have the book i could not have them entered there will be no trouble about that though you leave this book with me you can start another account in another savingsbank indeed i would advise you to do so there is an old saying never put all your eggs in one basket so it may be as well to divide your money between two banks i didnt think of that sir i will follow your advice i dont know that i have any more to say to you we understand each other now i will put you down on my books as a partner to the extent of five hundred dollars in my rotterdam shipment and you may place the savingsbank book in my hands tomorrow thank you sir i am very grateful to you for your kind interest in me that is a good boy one of the right stamp soliloquized the merchant a boy who has the prudence and selfdenial to save money out of a weekly income of five dollars is bound to succeed in life i will push him as he deserves well henry asked the clerk curiously have you been receiving a lecture from the boss yes answered henry smiling did he blow you up not very high youve been with him full twenty minutes we were discussing important business said henry i hope it was satisfactory to you very much so you havent had your pay raised have you yes how much from five to seven dollars a week thats a good raise i wonder whether im to be raised too perhaps so i hope so for im fifty dollars in debt and dont see how i am to pay it you get twelve dollars a week dont you yes but whats twelve dollars i have been living on five and you dont owe anything not a cent blessed if i see how you do it i need fifteen and i ought to have it hes like sam thought henry if mr hamilton finds out that he is in debt he wont stand much chance of having his wages raised im glad ive got something ahead it makes me feel independent i hope i shall make something on my borrowed money so henry and sam have both made investments it remains to be seen how they will come out chapter xii how sam succeeded sam did not tell henry of his purchase of a lottery ticket being well aware that his roommate would not approve such an investment ill wait till the lottery is drawn and then if i get a prize ill tell him about it he cant say anything then such were sams thoughts he knew of course that he might draw a blank but he did not take much account of that he lived in a dream of wealth till the day when the result was to be made known on a certain day the lucky numbers were to be published in the herald and for this issue sam was anxiously waiting the number of his ticket was seven is a lucky number said the acquaintance who induced him to buy your number begins and ends with a seven its likely to draw something sam listened to this prediction with complacency he did not reflect upon the absurdity of one number being luckier than another and congratulated himself that he had been so fortunate as to get a number containing two sevens sam was not usually an early riser as a general thing he lay in bed as late as he dared to but on the particular morning which was to terminate his suspense he jumped out of bed at halfpast five oclock what are you going to do sam inquired henry opening his eyes im going to get up answered sam whats up do you have to go to work earlier than usual no that isnt it answered sam evasively im tired of lying abed rather strange thought henry can it be possible that sam is turning over a new leaf he did not give much credence to this but concluded that sam had a particular reason which he would learn in due time sam dressed hastily and walked round to the herald office and purchased a copy of the paper which he unfolded eagerly he did not immediately find the list of lucky numbers but at length his eye rested on them he looked eagerly through the long list hoping to see number in it but in vain a prize of fifty dollars was drawn by but that was the nearest approach to good fortune poor sam his heart sank within him he had been dreaming golden dreams of fortune for a week past but now he was brought down to the cold and barren reality all his money was gone except a dollar on which he must live for two days and a half till his weekly wages were due its a shame muttered sam in bitter disappointment i was sure my ticket would win something wasnt there two sevens in it i believe they cheated it was too early yet for breakfast and he sauntered about idle and purposeless suddenly he came upon the young man upon whose advice he had purchased his ticket he too had a herald in his hand but was not looking particularly elated he hasnt got anything either thought sam shrewdly just then he caught sight of sam did you draw a prize he asked no i did not said sam gloomily i wish i hadnt bought a ticket that ten dollars is just throwed away i wish i had it back better luck next time what goodll that do me inquired sam im dead broke i havent got money enough to buy another ticket didnt you tell me i was sure to win with two sevens in my number i didnt say you were sure i only said it was a lucky number well i wish i had my money back thats all ive only got a dollar to last me till saturday night i aint much better off myself sam but its no use giving up of course a feller cant be sure to win a big prize the first time its worth trying five or six times wheres the money coming from ten dollars dont grow on every bush cant you borrow my credit aint good then save up till you have enough money how am i to save when i only get five dollars a week well i am sorry for you sam but im just as bad off as you are are you going to buy another ticket as soon as i can the two parted and sam began to reflect perhaps he is right i couldnt expect to draw a prize the very first time i wish i could get money enough to buy another ticket henry could lend me it as well as not but i know he wouldnt hed just give me a lecture for buying a ticket at all i wonder if there is any way there seemed to be none except to try henry and small as the chance was he decided to do it henry was just thinking of getting up when sam returned back so soon sam he said have you had breakfast not yet i see you have the herald there whats the news i havent looked to see you dont generally buy a morning paper no but there was something i wanted to look at this morning you havent found another ring and bought the herald to see whether its advertised no i wish i could find something have you thought about putting part of your money in the savingsbank sam how can i when its all gone twenty dollars gone in little more than a week exclaimed henry in genuine amazement yes answered sam rather confused what on earth did you do with it all i guess i must have spent about ten dollars going to the theater and so on what has become of the other ten dollars then i bought a lottery ticket said sam little uncomfortably well you were foolish said henry what made you do it a friend of mine advised me to he had one himself he couldnt have been much of a friend of yours i suppose you didnt draw anything no i didnt expect you would other people did though said sam inclined to uphold the lottery system do you see that long list of prizes i never knew anybody that drew a prize said henry quietly though ive known a good many who bought tickets forbes tells me if i buy another ticket im pretty sure to get something then youd better not mind what forbes says of course somebody must draw prizes said sam obstinately its a poor way to get money even if you could win one id risk that id like to buy another ticket henry shrugged his shoulders i dont think you are very wise sam it is well you havent any more money to throw away this was not promising but sam did not mean to give it up henry he said i wish youd lend me ten dollars what for i want to buy one more ticket i cant lend it i should think you might if i dont get anything this time ill never buy again i cant oblige you sam you mean you wont said sam sulkily no it happens to be true that i cant havent you thirtyfive dollars in the savingsbank i had you havent spent the money i have invested it how ive given the book to my employer as security to pay interest on a loan then seeing that sams curiosity was aroused he proceeded to explain that he had borrowed five hundred dollars of his employer to pay for a share in a mercantile venture do you think youll make any money out of it asked sam eagerly i hope to about how much perhaps i may make a hundred dollars i wish i had that much i suppose you would buy ten lottery tickets suggested henry smiling sam admitted he should invest a part that way i prefer to invest my money in legitimate business said henry i dont know about that said sam i might have drawn the twentythousanddollar prize thats better than a hundred dollars so it is but if i keep on i have a good deal better chance of getting up to twenty thousand dollars than you i wish my boss would lend me five hundred dollars said sam i wouldnt advise him to said henry smiling now let us go to breakfast chapter xiii henrys good fortune three months passed to henry martin they passed very satisfactorily at his new rate of payment he was able to lay up two dollars a week without denying himself anything absolutely necessary to his comfort at the end of this period therefore he had twentysix dollars on deposit in a new savingsbank of his venture he had heard nothing he remained perfectly easy about this however knowing that in due time he would hear from it mr hamilton he observed took more notice of him than formerly he frequently greeted him in passing through to his office with a pleasant word or smile and henry felt justified in concluding that he was in favor with him it was after the interval of time already mentioned that he again received a summons to the countingroom mr hamilton had a long paper before him closely filled with figures sit down henry he said thank you sir you remember our conversation three months since i suppose yes sir perfectly you consented to take a share in a venture was sending out to rotterdam yes sir i have just received a statement of it and you are interested i have called you in to let you know how it has turned out thank you sir said henry eagerly i find that after deducting all expenses your share of the profits will amount to one hundred dollars one hundred dollars exclaimed henry in astonishment and delight yes i think we have been very successful henry felt flattered by that word we it seemed to associate him humble office boy as he was with the eminent merchant who employed him that is better than the savingsbank sir said henry yes it is but i ought to add that it is not always so sure all ventures do not turn out so profitably to return to your affairs i shall charge you interest on the five hundred dollars you borrowed of me at the rate of seven per cent you have had the use of the money for three months then the interest will amount to eight dollars and three quarters said henry promptly quite right you are very quick at reckoning said mr hamilton looking pleased that is not a difficult sum answered henry modestly i did not suppose you knew much about computing interest you left school very young did you not at twelve sir you had not studied interest then had you no sir i have studied it since at eveningschool no sir i studied by myself in the evening how long have you done that for two years and you keep it up regularly yes sir occasionally i take an evening for myself but i average five evenings a week at studying you are a remarkable boy said the merchant looking surprised if you flatter me sir i may grow selfconceited said henry smiling you have some right to feel satisfied with yourself tell me what was your object in commencing this course of work i picked up at a bookstore on nassau street an old book containing the lives of some men who rose from obscurity and i found that many of them studied by themselves in early life being unable to attend school it seemed to me that education was necessary to success and as i had nothing else to depend upon i began to work evenings did you not find it irksome were you not tempted sometimes to give it up just at first but afterward i got to enjoy it here mr hamilton asked henry a few questions with a view of testing his knowledge both as to extent and accuracy and the result was so satisfactory as more and more to prepossess him in favor of the boy he returned to business it appears he said that interest deducted you have ninetyone dollars and a quarter to your credit with me you are at liberty to draw it if you wish what would you advise me to do mr hamilton asked henry you had better leave it in my hands for such use as i may think likely to prove profitable i shall dispatch a vessel to marseilles in a week would you like to take a share in this venture yes sir then i will assign six hundred dollars to you five you may continue to borrow of me one is your own not quite sir you remember the interest that need not be charged till the end of the year i will still retain the savingsbank book you left with me as a guaranty is that satisfactory entirely so sir have you been able to save up anything lately yes sir i have twentysix dollars on depost in another bank very good you are then provided for in any case of emergency henry went back to work his reflections as may be imagined were very pleasant he figured up what he was worth and it stood thus sixpenny savings bank second bank account proceeds of venture net thus he figured up a grand total of one hundred and fiftytwo dollars and twentyfive cents making a gain in three months of one hundred and seventeen dollars and twentyfive cents why at this rate thought henry i shall soon be rich of course he owed a large part of this sum to the favor of his employer but this again was earned by his fidelity and economy two qualities which i wish were more common among boys of his age returning to his room he looked for his savingsbank book but to his dismay it was nowhere to be found where can it be he asked himself perplexed perhaps sam has seen it but sam had not yet returned from the store though it was past his usual time it is very strange thought henry i am sure it was at the bottom of my trunk can the trunk have been opened chapter xiv the savings bank book during the three months which to henry brought good fortune sam had grown no richer indeed just at this time he was very hard up he had applied to henry for a loan but as he was already indebted to his more prudent roommate the latter declined to lend i think you are mean henry said sam in disappointment i cant help it sam you can live on five dollars a week just as well as i can youve got a lot of money in the bank said sam reproachfully because i am more prudent than you i thought you were a friend of mine so i am but i cannot encourage your extravagance it wouldnt be a friendly thing to do oh its easy enough for you to find excuses you dont want to lend thats all i dont want to give for that is what it would amount to sam saw that it would be of no use to persist in his request and he went out sulkily that day he found a bunch of keys in the street this was not a very valuable discovery and he was tempted at first to throw them down again when an idea struck him he dropped the keys into his pocket and when his lunch hour came instead of going to a restaurant as usual he hurried back to his boardinghouse the landlady met him as he was going upstairs have you lost your place she asked suspiciously for in this case sam would probably be unable to pay his weekly rent oh no said sam i left something at home thats all he entered his room and carefully locked the door behind him then he got down on his knees and one after the other he tried the lock of henrys trunk with the keys he had found the fifth opened it sam blushed with shame as he saw the inside of the trunk with its contents neatly arranged in spite of his faults he had some honorable feelings and he felt that he was engaged in a contemptible business he was violating the confidence of his friend and roommate who had been uniformly kind to him though he had declined to lend him money latterly sam admitted to himself that in this refusal he was justified for he knew very well that there was very little chance of repayment sam hoped to find some money in the trunk but in this hope he was destined to be disappointed henry was in the habit of making a weekly deposit in the savingsbank and therefore he had no surplus stock of money but at the bottom of his trunk was his savingsbank book sam opened it and his eyes sparkled when he counted up the deposits and found that they amounted to twentysix dollars i didnt think henry had so much money he said to himself he thrust the book into his pocket and hurriedly locked the trunk he went downstairs and hastened to the bank which unlike the sixpenny savings bank was located downtown and not far from the city hall henry had selected it on account of its nearness sam entered the banking house and went to the window of the paying clerk he had accompanied henry to the bank more than once and knew just where to go how much do you want asked the clerk in a businesslike tone twenty dollars replied sam who had made up his mind not to take the whole this was not due to any particular consideration but on the way he had read the rules of the bank and ascertained that a weeks notice would be necessary before the whole account could be withdrawn the clerk filled an order for twenty dollars and pushed it over to sam sign that he said sam hastily signed the name of henry martin and passed it back the clerk went to a large book and compared the signature with the one recorded therein now there was a considerable difference between sams and henrys handwriting and he detected it at once you are not henry martin he said on his return sam was astonished at this discovery but was too much alarmed to deny it no sir he said what is your name sam barker what made you sign the name of henry martin asked the bank officer suspiciously he is my roommate did he ask you to draw this money for him yes answered sam he ought to have known that we would not pay it except upon his written order he thought it would do just as well if i signed his name said sam growing bolder then he was mistaken cant you give me the money then no he must come himself all right said sam ill tell him he spoke so naturally that the clerk was inclined to think his suspicions were needless and that sam was really an authorized agent of the real depositor but when he got into the street sams vexation found vent everything goes against me he grumbled it hasnt done me a bit of good taking this book i shall only have the trouble of putting it back again i cant do it now for i must go back to the store without my lunch too he counted upon replacing the book before it was missed but henry reached home first and discovered his loss as related in the preceding chapter chapter xv sam is found out henry was not a little disturbed at the disappearance of his bankbook he felt confident that he had laid it away in his trunk and in that case it must have been stolen but who possessed a key to the trunk could it be sam henry recalled sams application for a loan and he feared that it was really he he determined to make inquiries as soon as his roommate came home he had scarcely formed this determination when sam entered you are home early henry he said no it is you who are late i didnt get out quite as soon as usual i wonder whether he has missed the bankbook thought sam if hed only go out id put it back where i took it from sam was soon informed as to the bankbook being missed i cant find my bankbook anywhere sam said henry looking searchingly at his companion cant you where did you put it asked sam trying to look unconcerned in my trunk then it must be there now it is not i have looked carefully then you didnt put it there you must be mistaken no i am not you may have dropped it out of your pocket on the way from the bank no i remember distinctly putting it in my trunk sam shrugged his shoulders i suppose you know best but if you put it there it must be there now unless it has been taken from my trunk said henry significantly just so said sam readily perhaps the landlady has taken it or bridget the chambermaid i dont think they have will you lose the money if you dont find the book no i can report my loss at the bank and they will give me a new one then youre all right i dont like the idea of my book being taken the same one who took the old book may take the new one well i havent got any bankbook to worry about said sam are you going out to supper yes then you dont know anything about my book i of course not answered sam what should i know of it i dont know come then well go to supper sam saw that he was suspected and he knew that he deserved it but he did not want henry to ascertain definitely that such was the fact he wanted to return the book as soon as he could without observation but for this he must wait a while when supper was over they took a walk of half an hour and then henry started to return to his room ill stay out a little longer said sam are you going to the theater asked henry not unless you lend me the money said sam im hard up myself you generally are of course i am how can i help it on such a mean salary i dont know what to think said henry to himself if sam has the book he hasnt drawn any money on it or he would go to the theater perhaps he is innocent sam stayed out late he did not go to the theater being as he said short of money but he lounged away the evening in billiard saloons and it was a quarter past eleven before he got back to his room when he entered henry was fast asleep sam congratulated himself upon this he felt that now was his chance to return the book he might have replaced it in the trunk but as henry had thoroughly searched it he would at once suspect that it bad been replaced besides henry might wake up and detect him in the act after some consideration sam put it into henrys inside coat pocket and then undressing himself went to bed ive got clear of it now he thought and whatever henry suspects he cant prove anything the next morning as henry was dressing he chanced to put his hand in his coat pocket and drew out the book whats that asked sam who had been watching him its my savingsbank book answered henry where did you find it in my pocket then you didnt put it in your trunk after all yes i did thats foolish if you had it wouldnt have got into your pocket henry did not reply but examining the book discovered to his satisfaction that no money had been withdrawn you see you were wrong said sam at any rate i am glad to get the book back again said henry quietly i wonder if he suspects anything thought sam henry did suspect but he was determined to verify his suspicions before saying a word on the subject during the day he managed to get away from the store long enough to visit the savingsbank he went at once to the desk where payments were made and showing his book asked the clerk if he remembered whether any one had presented it the day before yes was the answer a friend of yours wanted to draw out some money on your account but of course we did not pay it without your order i am glad you didnt then you did not send the boy who presented it no i thought it might be so how much did he want to draw twenty dollars henry looked serious this certainly looked bad for sam he did not like to think that a boy to whom he had always been kind would so abuse his confidence i shall take better care of my book in future he said the boy had no authority from me to draw money we saw that the signature was not correct and refused to honor the draft henry made a deposit of two dollars increasing the amount to twentyeight dollars and then left the bank on his way back to the store he made up his mind that he would no longer room with sam even if he increased his expenses he could not consent to have for a roommate one who had made an attempt to defraud him chapter xvi sam loses his place mr dalton wants you to go to the bank and make a deposit said william budd to sam on the forenoon of the same day all right said sam be particularly careful as the deposit is unusually large oh yes ill be careful sam received the checks and drafts amounting to several thousand dollars and started for the fourth national bank on nassau street when he had accomplished a part of the distance he met an old acquaintance whom he had known in his bootblacking days how are you sam said tim brady i havent seen you for a long time im all right tim i havent seen you either where have you been to boston answered tim briefly you have exclaimed sam interested how did you like it i dont like it as well as york why not aint it a nice place tisnt half as big as york besides there aint half so much fun there aint no old bowery there nor tony pastors i didnt know what to do with myself nights what were you doing did you black boots no answered tim i was in a store on dock square what sort of a store clothing store how did you get the place it is kept by a cousin of the old woman he wrote that hed take me if id come on so i went but i didnt like it where did you live with him he had a house in chelsea just over the river like brooklyn is i got my board and a dollar a week that aint much said sam no i should say not i had to pay my way over the ferry out of it too it didnt leave me no money for cigars nor nothing how long were you there about three months i would not have stayed so long only i couldnt get money to get back you got it at last or did you walk back walk i guess not its three or four hundred miles this was not quite exact but near enough for a guess how much did it cost you to come back five dollars thats a good deal where did you get so much i found it in the street one day answered tim with a little hesitation how long have you been back about a week ive been looking round for you where do you hang out ive got a room of my own answered sam with an air of importance you have youre in luck what are you doin ive got a place with dalton co on pearl street what business merchant hes awful rich just look at that sam displayed his bundle of checks i dont see nothin particular except some bits of paper you dont know anything about business tim thems checks are they theyre good for a lot of money heres a check for twelve hundred dollars and theres others besides that piece of paper worth twelve hundred dollars said tim incredulously yes what are you going to do with it take it to the bank what bank fourth national bank tim looked at sam with respect he must certainly occupy a responsible business position if he was trusted with such a large amount of money sam in putting back his checks was careless enough to drop the twelvehundreddollar check he hurried off unconscious of his loss and tim quietly secured it he ought to have restored it to sam as he easily might have done but an idea struck him he would instead carry it round to mr dalton and in all probability secure a reward for his honesty this was sharp practice and hardly consistent with friendship for sam but tim was a boy not particularly scrupulous who cared more for number one than for any friend he went into a store near by ascertained the number of mr daltons place of business and hurried down there is the boss in he asked of william budd whom he first encountered yes id like to see him what for important business answered tim budd looked at him rather incredulously if you want to apply for a place its no use weve got a boy already that aint my business ive picked up something in the street that belongs to mr dalton im thinkin what is it a check sam must have dropped it thought william instantly let me see it he said aloud ill show it to the boss said tim obstinately come on then here is a boy mr dalton who thinks he has found something belonging to you said the young man mr dalton looked up what is it my boy he said its a check said tim and taking off his ragged hat he handed the paper to mr dalton its nesbitts check for twelve hundred dollars exclaimed the merchant where did you find it in nassau street how could it be there mr budd asked mr dalton i sent sam to the bank not long since he must have dropped it it is not the first time he has been careless i am afraid we shall have to discharge him how does he perform his duties generally not very satisfactorily sir send him to me as soon as he returns now my boy what is your name tim brady sir did you know the value of this check yes sir its worth twelve hundred dollars how did you know where to bring it i saw the name and looked in the directory to find your place of business you are a good and honest boy thank you sir i try to be said tim meekly you have done me a service here are ten dollars thank you sir said tim joyfully youre a gentleman mr dalton smiled always keep honest honesty is the best policy i think so myself sir said tim tim retired quite elated from a corner nearly opposite he watched for sams return he looks sober said tim to himself its likely hell get bounced i wonder will i stand a chance for his place sam said william budd on his entrance mr dalton wants to see you sam looked startled he had ascertained his loss and was perplexed and troubled about it mr dalton looked up as he entered have you been to the bank samuel he asked yes sir did you deposit all the checks given you i lost one check some way stammered sam you must have been very careless said his employer in a tone of reproof i dont think i was said sam you must have been did you not know that you had charge of a large amount yes sir then knowing this you should have been particularly careful ill go back and look for it sir fortunately there is no need of this as it was picked up and brought here by an honest boy it was a check for twelve hundred dollars then youve got it again said sam relieved shall i go round to the bank and carry it no i shall not again trust you to go to the bank indeed i am sorry to say that i cannot retain you in my employ i hope youll keep me said sam alarmed i cannot do it in justice to myself call mr budd william budd entered mr budd said mr dalton i think you told me you had a cousin who desired a place yes sir tell him to come here tomorrow i have discharged sam thank you sir i do not forget sam continued the merchant that you once rendered me a service in bringing home my little boy i regret that i cannot keep you in my employ to compensate you for the disappointment i will give you twentyfive dollars and you are at liberty to go at once if you desire it sams eyes sparkled with pleasure he felt so rich that he cared little for the loss of his place thank you sir he said i wish you good luck samuel said mr dalton goodnaturedly again sam thanked him and left the store looking so cheerful that tim who was watching for his appearance was quite bewildered he seems glad hes bounced thought tim ill go and ask him about it chapter xvii tim is unmasked before sam had gone far tim brady managed to throw himself in his way where are you goin now he asked have you been to the bank yes answered sam i lost one of them checks you dont say said hypocritical tim it was the twelvehundreddollar one what did the boss say did he blow you up inquired tim puzzled by sams cheerful manner yes im bounced you dont seem to care much said tim watching him curiously no i dont im tired of the old place what are you goin to do are you goin back to boot blackin no answered sam scornfully i should say not you aint goin to retire on a fortune are you look here tim said sam displaying a roll of bills what do you say to that did you save all that asked tim in great astonishment no mr dalton just gave it to me give it to you when he bounced you yes you see i found his little boy in the street one day and took him home he give me a place for that and now that im sacked hes give me this money i say sam youre in luck how much is there twentyfive dollars you couldnt lend a feller five dollars said tim insinuatingly yes i could answered sam cooly but i wont why not i want it all myself you might let me have a little pleaded tim ill give you a square meal said sam but i cant do no more im goin to boston whats put in into your head to go to boston you have well i hope youll like it better than i do which way would you go asked sam fall river line theyre got nice steamers when do they go five oclock all right ill go this afternoon youll be comin back soon said tim maybe i will but i want to see the place i aint never traveled much and now im goin youd better stay and take me to tony pastors tonight sam shook his head oh yes youd like me to spend all my money on you but i dont see it you neednt be so afraid ive got some money too said tim nettled youve got fifty cents i spose does that look like fifty cents tim displayed the ten dollars he had received from mr dalton for restoring the lost check sam was astonished beyond measure where did you get that money he asked its some i had over when i failed and with all that money in your pocket you asked me for five dollars exclaimed sam with justifiable indignation why shouldnt i havent you got more than i have tim began to see that he had made a mistake in proclaiming his riches especially when sam added that he might buy his own dinner that he wasnt going to treat him you promised you would said tim i didnt know you had so much money i thought you was hard up youre a fraud so are you said tim resentfully i dont want no more to do with you tim was nettled he wanted to be revenged and his secret slipped out you neednt feel so big he said i got you bounced here was much cause for astonishment you got me bounced repeated sam in surprise yes i did i found that check you dropped and took it round to your boss he give me this ten dollars and bounced you this was too much for sams equanimity that a boy who had so injured him should try to wheedle money and a treat out of him struck him as so atrocious that he felt action to be imperative a sudden movement of the foot upset tim and sam without waiting to see how he relished his downfall fled round a corner before tim could retaliate hes the meanest boy i ever knew thought our retreating hero he got me sacked and then wanted me to treat him i guess he wont ask me again sam was still determined to go to boston that afternoon before he went he wanted to say goodby to henry martin and as the boat would sail before business hours was over he decided to go round to the store where he was employed henry was just leaving the store on an errand when sam came up it was the first time they had met since henrys discovery of sams attempt to appropriate his savings he could hardly be expected to feel very friendly toward him ill walk along with you henry said sam i want to talk with you and i want to talk with you said henry coldly ive found out all about my bankbook have you replied sam disconcerted yes ive found out that you opened my trunk and took it out then went to the bank and tried to get twenty dollars on it and all the while you were rooming with me and pretending to be my friend sam felt consciencestricken the enormity of his act flashed upon him still he wanted to extenuate his conduct its true henry he admitted and i ought to be ashamed of myself but i didnt get any money after all and i returned the book to you i know that but it was only because they wouldnt let you have anything on it dont think too hard of me henry said sam i cant help thinking hard of you you wanted to rob me i only wanted to borrow the money without my leave i meant to return it to you as soon as i could the fact is henry i was awful hard up thats your own fault as for returning the money i hope you dont think me quite such a fool as to believe that sam was really disturbed he saw that henry was perfectly justified in being angry and that his representation was the correct one im very sorry i did it he said i hope youll forgive me ill forgive you but we can no longer occupy the same room i will move out and leave the room to you or you can move out and leave the room to me ill move henry thats what i came to speak to you about i came to bid you goodby there is no need of saying goodby we shall see each other again no we shant for a good while anyway im just goin to boston what exclaimed henry in astonishment im goin on this afternoon why sam whats up sam explained i dont know whether its a good plan said henry when he had ended nor i said sam but im goin anyway if i dont like it ill come back somehow goodby goodby and good luck sam said henry offering his hand sams a strange boy he said to himself as he pursued his way alone its hard to tell how hes coming out i hope hell get wiser as he grows older chapter xviii the fall river boat when sam left henry somehow he felt in lower spirits than before he had become attached to his roommate in spite of the difference in character between them and henrys reproaches seemed to throw a new light upon his conduct he felt it the more because he was about to leave him i did treat him mean he admitted to himself his conscience touched for the first time perhaps in years im glad they wouldnt let me have any of his money at the bank i wont act so mean again it is not to be supposed that this repentant mood lasted long as sam neared the wharf from which the fall river line of steamers left for boston his thoughts were on the journey he was about to take and his spirits rose the steamer was moored alongside the wharf perhaps halfway down there was a confused mass of trunks bales and baggage of various kinds on the pier waiting to be stowed away on board it was early but a few passengers were already on board and others were passing over the gang plank at intervals sam thought he would go on board too and look about a little he had never been on board one of these steamers and was curious to see the accommodations he went upstairs and found himself in a long and elegantly furnished saloon with lines of staterooms on either side three passengers were seated on sofas or in armchairs two were engaged in reading an afternoon paper and the third a girl of about fifteen had her attention absorbed by a bird cage containing a canary she looked up as sam passed and asked pleasantly is it almost time for the boat to start sir it was the first time sam had been addressed as sir and he felt flattered i guess not he said theres only a few people on board i dont think itll start for an hour i wish it would go soon said the girl i am in a hurry to get home do you live in boston asked sam yes ive been to visit my uncle in brooklyn and now im going back are you going to boston too yes answered sam do you live there no i never was there i suppose youve got relations there said the young lady in an inquiring tone no im going on to see if i cant get a place the young girl surveyed him with interest do you have to earn your own living she asked yes you are young to do that oh ive had to earn my living ever since i was eleven or twelve you dont mean it why what did you do i was clerk in a store on pearl street said sam who did not care to mention his previous experience as a bootblack and newsboy well i hope youll get a good place ive got a brother almost as old as you but hed never think he could earn his own living his name is frank whats his last name asked sam bluntly stockton i am julia stockton my name is sam barker said sam thinking such confidence ought to be requited ive got a cousin sam julia remarked but i never knew any one of the name of barker before is that your bird inquired sam by way of prolonging the conversation yes he sings sweetly sometimes but i guess hes frightened now im glad hes with me it isnt quite so lonely i never traveled alone before are you used to traveling alone mr barker i never traveled much answered sam trying to look dignified on first being addressed as mr barker but i dont mind being alone thats because youre a boy boys can take care of themselves better than girls do you know what time we get to boston no i dont but ill inquire said sam shall i find you here oh yes ill be here sam went down below and noticed that some were already procuring tickets at the captains office it struck him that he might as well obtain his accordingly he joined the line and when his turn came inquired for a ticket fall river or boston asked the man in charge boston five dollars thats pretty steep thought sam i shall have only twenty dollars left a ticket was handed him with on it whats that for asked sam its the number of your berth when will we get to boston between six and seven in the morning as sam turned away he was accosted by a newsboy papers sir an idea struck sam he would get a picture paper for his new acquaintance it was probably the first mark of attention he had ever paid to a girl but the idea pleased him and he bought a harpers weekly and carried it upstairs he found miss julia stockton sitting where he had left her she smiled pleasantly when she saw sam i bought you a picture paper he said feeling a little awkward i thought you might like to read it oh thank you you are very kind did you find out when we would reach boston yes miss julia we shall get there between six and seven in the morning thats pretty early i hope papa will be at the depot waiting at the depot does the boat go into a depot asked sam julia laughed oh no she said did you think we went all the way by boat yes i thought so we go the last fifty miles by cars that is from fall river all the better said sam that will give us a little variety meanwhile the passengers were pouring in and the cabin was getting full i guess ill go out on deck said sam i want to see the boat start i should like to ever so much come with me then ill take care of you said sam manfully let me carry your cage its too heavy for you so the two went out on deck together chapter xix mutual confidences the reader who has followed sams fortunes closely may wonder how a boy so shabbily dressed as sam could be treated as an equal by a young lady of good family this leads me to explain that about a month before sam had been presented with a neat suit of clothes originally made for a nephew of his employer but which had proved too small thus it happened that with the exception of his hat which was rather the worse for wear our hero presented quite a respectable appearance julia stockton remained outside with sam till the boat rounded the battery and for threequarters of an hour longer sam was very well qualified to answer her numerous questions about the different places they passed what is that island asked julia that is blackwells island answered sam is that where the penitentiary is she inquired with interest yes it is that long stone building how gloomy it is said julia with a shudder how can people be so wicked as to need to go to such a place sam winced he knew very well that he had done things or at any rate planned them which would have entitled him to a place in the prison they were now passing how ashamed i should be if i were ever sent there and julia should know it he thought what makes you look so sober asked julia i was pitying the poor people who are confined there it must be horrid but i suppose it cant be helped i dont see how anybody can want to steal sam thought he could understand it was not so long since he himself had tried to appropriate the property of another but he only determined that this should not happen again he could not consent to forfeit the good opinion of julia stockton and the class to which she belonged a new ambition began to stir in sams soul the ambition to lead a thoroughly respectable life and to rise to some creditable position i will turn over a new leaf i really will he said to himself ill be a very different boy from what i have been they remained outside a while longer till the steamer had passed through the channel into the broader waters of the sound and then reentered the cabin the gong for supper had already sounded wont you go down to supper asked sam yes i think i will you will come too yes i will go too answered sam feeling complimented by the invitation as they were approaching the stairs julia dropped a scarf from her neck it was picked up by a gentleman who handed it to sam with the remark your sister has dropped her scarf he takes you for my sister said sam turning to julia with evident pleasure i am afraid you wouldnt own me for a sister said julia smiling coquettishly i should be proud to have such a sister said sam earnestly would you really yes i would i am afraid you only say so to compliment me i mean it but i am sure you would not want me for a brother i dont know said julia with a roguish glance do you always behave well i am afraid i dont always nor i either returned julia in a burst of confidence i used to play tricks on my governess sometimes i dont think that is so very wicked said sam wont you tell me about some of them after supper i will but i wouldnt like to have anybody else hear they sat down to the table side by side and made a satisfactory repast sam tried to pay for julias but here the young lady was firm she insisted on paying her own bill as indeed propriety required when the supper was over they returned to the saloon chapter xx too late for the train a stateroom had been engaged for julia but sam did not feel justified in paying a dollar extra for such a luxury when he was already entitled to a comfortable berth do you know when we reach fall river asked the young lady about halfpast four in the morning and the cars start by five thats awful early exclaimed julia in dismay how shall i wake up in time the gong will sound answered sam but if that dont wake you ill pound on your door i wish you would what should i do if i were left you could wait for the next train but i should not have you to go with me sam mr barker i mean i wish you would call me sam i like it better than mr barker then i will said julia frankly it does seem stiff to call you mr barker if you should be too late for the first train i will wait too said sam answering what she had said before will you i should like that but wont it put you out oh no said sam laughing there isnt any very important business to call me early to boston i had just as lieve wait as not but you wont have to i am sure the gong will wake me up but youll come to the door and go into the cars with me oh yes ill be on hand then goodnight sam i hope youll have a good sleep i shall sleep like a top i always do goodnight julia so they parted he seems to be a real nice boy and very polite thought julia i should feel very lonely without him shes a tiptop girl thought sam i never saw one i liked so well before sam had never had a sister and his acquaintance with girls had been exceedingly limited this was necessarily the case in the rough street life he had led in new york julia was a new revelation to him he was quite too young to be in love but he certainly liked julia very much and thought how pleasant it would be to have such a sister she says shes got a brother thought sam i wonder what sort of a boy he is and whether he will like me i suppose i never shall see him though or julia either after we get to boston this thought was rather disheartening and made sam feel sober but he brightened up at the thought that he should be in the same city and should therefore have some chance of meeting his pretty traveling acquaintance the berth sam was to occupy was on one side of the diningroom the tables were now cleared and there was nothing to prevent his retiring he took off his shoes and his coat and without undressing himself any further got into the berth it was not long before he was asleep he did not wake until morning and then not voluntarily on opening his eyes he saw one of the attendants on the boat at his bedside you must sleep pretty sound said the attendant did you wake me up asked sam yes but i had hard work to do it is it time to get up i should think it was didnt you hear the gong no it sounded loud enough well youd better hurry or youll be too late for the cars this roused sam he thought of julia and jumped out of the birth he quickly put on his coat and shoes and went up two flights of stairs to the saloon on either side of which were the staterooms he went to julias no near the forward end of the boat and found the door shut he knocked but was not immediately answered julia must have overslept herself too he thought he knocked again and presently he heard her ask in the tone of one just waking up whos there its i its sam he answered are you dressed no what time is it its very late didnt you hear the gong no is it morning the cars are almost ready to start oh dear what shall i do exclaimed julia in dismay dress as quick as you can and we may be in time after the lapse of five minutes the door opened and the young lady appeared im so sorry sam she said excusing herself shall we be in time well go down and see said sam they went below and out over the gangway but were only just in time to see the long train speeding on its way we are left said julia mournfully well said sam philosophically it cant be helped can it shall we have to stay here all day inquired the young lady alarmed oh no there is another train at halfpast six but it is a slower train than this when will it reach boston at nine oclock i asked the steward just now it wont make very much difference well get to the city pretty early father will be down to the depot and when he doesnt see me hell think i am not coming then how am i to get home ill be with you said sam valiantly ill see that you get home all right will you said julia brightly then i dont mind so much how stupid i was not to wake up i didnt wake up either one of the men woke me up i ran up as quick as i could but it was too late i got very tired yesterday said julia apologetically that was what made me sleep so sound when did you say the next train went at sixthirty what shall we do till then you can lie down if you want to and i will call you in time i dont dare to said julia besides i dont feel sleepy now they decided to sit down and while away the time and were not at a loss for topics of conversation at halfpast six they had taken their places in the cars in the full anticipation of a pleasant journey chapter xxi arrived in boston at nine oclock the train entered the old colony depot as they entered julia began to show signs of uneasiness i am afraid there will be no one here to meet me she said then ill see you safe home said sam rather hoping that it would be necessary for him to do so they got out of the cars and walked slowly along julia scanning every face anxiously in the hope of seeing her father or brother but she could see no familiar face they must have been at the first train and gone home she said in disappointment have a carriage sir asked the hackman i guess youd better take one said sam will you ride too i should be afraid to go alone yes i will go too answered sam any baggage asked the hackman ive got a trunk said julia i got it checked give me the check and ill see to it shall i asked julia appealing to sam yes itll be all right how much will you charge where do you want to be carried no mount vernon street answered julia i guess thats about right said sam agreeably surprised with the smallness of the charge in comparison with the extortionate demands of new york hackmen he considered it only gallant to offer to pay the hack fare and was glad it would not be too heavy a tax on his scanty resources the trunk was soon secured and sam and julia entered the hack it seems so good to be in dear old boston again said julia with a young girls warmth of feeling i suppose it does said sam but i never was here i dont think the streets are as wide as they are in new york oh weve got some wide streets said julia jealous of the fair fame of her native city this isnt the best part of boston by any means wait till you see the common shall we pass it i dont know said julia i guess we shall they did in fact go through a side street to tremont and drove alongside of the common what do you think of that asked julia triumphantly is that the common yes isnt it pretty its small answered sam is it the biggest park you have got isnt it big enough retorted julia its nothing to central park perhaps it isnt quite as large admitted julia reluctantly but its got bigger trees and then theres the frog pond there isnt any frog pond in central park theres a lake there and then theres the old elm too continued julia it was standing hundreds of years before america was discovered i dont see how that can be known said sam shrewdly who said so its an indian tradition i suppose where is it i should like to see it it was pointed out but its appearance neither contradicted nor confirmed julias assertion in regard to its antiquity what is that big building on the hill asked sam oh thats the state house you can go up to the dome and see the view from there its grand isnt bunker hill monument round here somewhere asked sam it over in charlestown only about two miles off i must go over there some time i knew a boy that went up there what was his name the boy referred to by sam was a bootblack named terry obrien a name which sam conveniently forgot when questioned by julia as he was anxious to have her think that he had moved in good society in new york mount vernon street was now close at hand the hack stopped before a nicelooking swellfront house such as used to be in favor with bostonians and julia exclaimed joyfully theres mother looking out of the window sam descended and helped julia out now mind said julia youre coming in i want to introduce you to mother she took out her purse to pay the driver let me attend to that said sam no said julia decidedly mother wouldnt like to have me the carriage was got on my account and i ought to pay for it the hackman was paid and julia and sam walked up the front steps chapter xxii first experiences in boston mamma said julia after the first greeting was over this young gentleman is mr sam barker who has been very polite to me i am much indebted to you mr barker said mrs stockton cordially extending her hand for your kindness to my daughter oh its nothing said sam embarrassed i didnt do anything i met him on the boat mamma and he saw me on the train and when there was nobody to meet me he came home with me in the hack your father was at the depot on the arrival of the first train said mrs stockton as you did not come then he concluded you did not start yesterday afternoon he was surprised that you did not telegraph him i did come mamma but would you believe it i slept so sound i didnt hear the gong nor sam either did you sam we both slept pretty sound said sam well julia i am glad you got through without accident have you had any breakfast not a mouthful mamma im as hungry as a bear i will have some sent up at once mr barker i hope you will join my daughter at breakfast thank you said sam not without satisfaction for he certainly did feel frightfully hungry a substantial breakfast was brought up and unromantic as it may seem both sam and julia made great havoc among the eatables i dont think i ever felt so hungry in the whole course of my life said julia did you sam i never did either said sam with his mouth full my dear said mrs stockton mr barker will think you very familiar it is not the custom to use a gentlemans first name on such short acquaintance i feel as if i had known sam ever so long he asked me to call him by his first name mrs stockton smiled considering sams youth she did not think it necessary to press the matter is this your first visit to boston mr barker she inquired yes maam i hope you will like it i think i shall maam are you a new yorker yes maam i know something of new york in what part of the city do you live sam was rather embarrassed he did not like to mention the unfashionable street where he had lodged i boarded downtown he answered indefinitely to be near my business you are young to have been in business i was a clerk in a pearl street store said sam are you visiting boston on business yes maam i shall try to find a place here i hope you may succeed thank you maam by this time breakfast was over and sam rose i think ill be going he said julia did not seek to detain him the fact was that after her absence there were quite a number of things she wanted to do among others to unpack her trunk what hotel are you going to stop at she inquired i havent made up my mind answered sam embarrassed he well knew that it would be very foolish for him to engage board at a firstclass hotel parkers is a good hotel suggested julia its on school street not far from here i would recommend a boardinghouse said mrs stockton the parker house is expensive and if mr barker is going to stay for some time he may wish to get along more economically i think i shall said sam be sure and call again said julia extending her hand we shall be glad to see you again mr barker said mrs stockton cordially mr stockton will wish to thank you for your attention to julia sam thanked her and went out into the street he had enjoyed a good breakfast and been cordially received by a lady who evidently stood high socially and these circumstances contributed to put him in good spirits i like boston he thought the people take more notice of a fellow than they do in new york sam was generalizing upon his very limited experience and perhaps might be led hereafter to change his views julia spoke of parkers hotel he said to himself i guess ill inquire where it is and take a look at it where is parkers hotel he asked of a boy who overtook him near the state house its on school street im going as far as tremont street myself and you can come along with me answered the boy thank you said sam i am a stranger in boston and dont know my way are you going to stop at parkers i dont think i shall i am afraid they will charge too much its pretty highpriced said his new acquaintance do you know what they charge for a room a dollar and a half and two dollars a day that is for the common rooms thats too much for me then youve got your meals to pay for besides i shall try to find a boardinghouse said sam do you know of any theres an acquaintance of mine a clerk who boards on harrison avenue where is that not far from washington street up near the boston and albany depot is it near the depot where i came in from new york how did you come by the fall river line then it isnt far away ill give you the number if you want it i wish you would heres tremont street said the guide and that is the parker house thank you said sam he went into the hotel and ascending a short staircase found himself in the office on one side was a writingroom on the other a readingroom it looks like a good hotel thought sam i should like it if i could afford to stay here sam went into the readingroom and saw lying on a chair a file of a new york paper it seemed in this strange place like a familiar friend he was reading the local news when some one addressed him in a nasal voice i say yeou do yeou live round here chapter xxiii sam finds a roommate looking up sams glance rested on a young man of rustic dress and manners which made him seem quite out of place in a fashionable hotel no answered sam i am a stranger in boston i came from new york you dont say its an allfired big city isnt it said the countryman it is very large said sam patronizingly i live in the country said the other quite needlessly so sam thought up in new hampshire ive come down here to get a job so have i responded sam with new interest in his companion are you boardin here asked the countryman no i am going to try to find a boardingplace the prices are too steep here let me go with you said the young man eagerly sam thought on the whole it would be pleasanter to have company and accepted this proposal they bought a copy of the boston herald and picked out a list of boardinghouses which appeared to come within their means among these were two on harrison avenue one of these was the very house which had already been mentioned to sam by his boy acquaintance of the morning do you know your way round the city asked sam of his companion a little said the other do you know how to go to harrison avenue yes i know that is it far not very far we can walk easy enough thats all right then let us go the two set out on their expedition walking up washington street as far as essex and turning there soon entered harrison avenue they beguiled the time on the way by conversation what was you calclatin to find to do asked the countryman i was clerk in a store in new york said sam id like to get into a store here so should i sam privately thought him too countrified in appearance for the position he desired but did not say so have you had any experience he asked curiously oh yes i used to drive the wagon for a grocery store to hum sam privately doubted whether this experience would be of any particular value to his new acquaintance however he had not much faith in his own qualifications and this concerned him more whats your name inquired sam abner blodgett was the reply whats yours sam barker you dont say theres a doctor in our town by the name of barker any relation i guess not i never heard of a doctor in our family presently they reached the number indicated sam rang the bell you are looking for a boardingplace he explained we saw your advertisement in the herald walk in said the servant ill tell mrs campbell mrs campbell presently appeared a shrewdlooking scotch lady but kindly in expression you are looking for a boarding place gentlemen she inquired yes maam i have one single room and one double one for the single room i have eight dollars a week for the double one fourteen that is seven dollars for each gentleman do you two gentlemen wish to room together yes answered blodgett immediately if you are willing he added aside to sam let us look at the rooms said sam and then we can tell better walk up this way gentlemen said mrs campbell she led the way first to the double room it was a square room the second floor back and looked quite neat and comfortable sam liked the appearance of it and so apparently did abner blodgett aint it scrumptious though he said admiringly we aint got many rooms like that to hum i suppose you are from the country sir said mrs campbell with a goodnatured smile yes said blodgett im from new hampshire away up near mount washington let me see the single room requested sam the single room was shown but it was of course much smaller and the furniture was inferior wed better take the big room together said abner sam hesitated a moment he was not very particular but he did not altogether fancy the appearance of mr blodgett how much do you charge for the large room for a single person he asked i couldnt take less than eleven dollars said the landlady it was of course impossible for sam to pay any such sum and he reluctantly agreed to occupy the room jointly with mr blodgett when will you move in asked mrs campbell today said sam i must ask you to pay something in advance to secure the room gentlemen sam had no luggage beyond a small bundle and he answered at once ill pay a week in advance thank you sir sam handed the landlady ten dollars and received in return three ill pay you tomorrow said blodgett ive got to get the money from my cousin ill wait till tomorrow to oblige you said the landlady but no longer oh ill have the money then said abner confidently will you be here to dinner gentlemen when do you have dinner at six oclock we used to have it in the middle of the day but it was inconvenient to some of our boarders and we changed it we have dinner to hum where i live at noon said abner we have lunch at halfpast twelve if you choose to come i guess we will said abner well go out and take a walk mr barker and come back in time just as you say answered sam after a walk they returned to lunch sam was usually possessed of a good appetite but he stared in astonishment when he saw blodgett eat that young man appeared to have fasted for a week and ate accordingly whats the matter with you mr barker you dont eat nothin he said i had a late breakfast said sam i guess youll get your moneys worth i mean to seven dollars is an awful lot to pay for board up to hum they dont charge but three then i wish theyd open a branch boardinghouse here suppose we go over to bunker hill said sam after lunch i want to see the monument just as you say said abner we can ask the way theres some cars go over that way ive heerd said abner as they were walking down washington street a young man rather flashily attired stopped blodgett whom he appeared to recognize whats in the wind now he asked who have you got in tow its my friend mr barker how do you do mr barker said the young man who appeared very much amused about something hows your father the deacon he inquired of blodgett and laughed again pretty smart said blodgett just give him my respects when you write will you i wont forget the new acquaintance winked and went his way sam was rather surprised at his manner and also at the fact of his countrified companion being apparently on intimate terms with a person so different in appearance who is that he asked thats a young man from our town said mr blodgett hes been living in boston for five or six years hes got a good place in milk street what sort of a fellow is he you dont say nothin about it said abner looking about him as if fearing to be overheard but im afraid hes a fast young man shouldnt wonder said sam ive heard that he plays cards added abner in a horrified whisper very likely said sam amused he had had some suspicions of his companion occasioned by the apparent good understanding between him and the young man they had met but this remark dissipated them he felt amused by the verdancy of abner blodgett and anticipated a good deal of entertainment from his remarks they took the horse cars to bunker hill sam paid the fare both ways as his companion did not expect to have any money till tomorrow he did not relish lending his own stock of money being so scanty but abner was so confident of being in funds the next day that he did not refuse he was interested in the view from the summit of the monument and spent an additional hour in exploring charlestown when the two got back to boston they found the afternoon well advanced and the dinner hour near chapter xxiv an unpleasant surprise after dinner sam and his roommate took a walk as they passed the boston theater abner proposed going in but sam knew very well that the expense of both tickets would come upon him and declined i am tired he said ive been walking about all day and besides i got up very early in the morning i would rather go home and go to bed lend me a dollar and ill go said abner i dont feel sleepy not much answered sam when youve got your money it will be time enough to go to the theater but if you havent got any more than i have youd better not go to the theater much the reader may be surprised at such sensible advice proceeding from sam but he had begun to feel the responsibilities of life more keenly than ever before for the first time too he saw how foolish he had been in the past and felt an eager desire to win a respectable position he was sanguine and hopeful and felt that it was not too late to turn over a new leaf all right said abner i can wait till another evening but i thought id like to go to the theater seein as i never went there never went to the theater exclaimed sam with a gratifying sense of superiority ive been ever so many times in new york ive been to the circus said abner there was one come round last summer to our place is the theater any like the circus no said sam but the circus is pretty good i like to see it myself you miss a good many things by living in the country did you ever live in the country inquired abner a good many years ago answered sam the fact is i was born there but i got tired of it and went to new york presently fatigue overpowered sam and he announced his intention of returning to the boardinghouse and going to bed i wont go yet said abner ill be along pretty soon sam did not lie awake long after once getting into bed the early hour at which he had risen on the boat and the miles he had traveled during the day were too much for him and he sank into a dreamless sleep at eleven oclock abner blodgett opened the door and softly entered he approached the bed on tiptoe fearing to wake sam poor fool he muttered smiling disagreeably he thinks i am a verdant rustic while i am able to turn him round my little finger theres nothing about city life that i dont know i can give him points and discount him as far as that goes even if he has been living in new york for years fast asleep he continued listening to sams regular breathing no danger of his waking up till morning i may as well see what money hes got he coolly felt in sams pocket and drew out his pocketbook eagerly examining the contents only ten dollars and a half he muttered in disappointment that hardly pays me for my trouble however its better than nothing let me see if there is anything more but this appeared to be all the money sam possessed and he put it in his pocket grumbling i guess itll be safe for me to go to bed and sleep till near morning abner said to himself the boy sleeps soundly and he wont be awake till six or seven he proved to be correct sam slept like a log and was not conscious when at a quarter of six abner hurriedly dressed and left the house with all of poor sams available funds its a pity he payed for his board in advance thought abner i would have got seven dollars more its money thrown away abner hoped to get out of the house without being seen by any one but he was destined to be disappointed as he was slipping out of the front door the landlady herself came downstairs you are going out early mr blodgett she remarked in some surprise yes maam said abner im used to gettin up early in the country im goin to take a walk before breakfast your young friend thought he wouldnt go out with you he got pretty tired yesterday hes sound asleep theres something about that man i dont like thought mrs campbell i dont believe hes so verdant as he pretends to be he must pay me something on account today or i wont keep him goodby old woman muttered abner as he closed the door and entered the street i dont care about seeing you or your house again i shall get my breakfast somewhere else mr blodgett walked rapidly till he reached a shabbylooking brick tenement house not far from dover street this he entered with a passkey and going up to a room which he generally occupied proceeded to change his clothes for others more comfortable to city style this alone changed his appearance greatly but not satisfied with this he took from a bureau drawer a black silky mustache and carefully attached it to his upper lip then he looked complacency in the glass and said with a smile i think my young friend from new york wont recognize me now if we meet and he suspects anything i can easily put him off the scent sam woke up about seven oclock he opened his eyes and looked about him in momentary bewilderment not immediately remembering where he was as recollection dawned upon him he looked for abner blodgett but nothing was to be seen of him the appearance of the bed however showed that he had occupied it he has got up thought sam i wonder if it is very late a church clock began to strike and he counted the strokes seven oclock he said well that isnt very late but i may as well get up ive slept like a top all night long i suppose i was sound asleep when my roommate came to bed i guess hes gone to take a walk before breakfast sam jumped out of bed and began to dress as he was drawing on his pants he thrust his hand mechanically into his pocket to feel for his money he did so without the faintest suspicion of his loss when he discovered that his pocketbook was not in its usual place he grew anxious and hurriedly examined his other pockets but in vain then he looked on the floor possibly it might have slipped out of his pocket and be lying on the carpet again his search was vain then for the first time suspicion of his roommate entered his mind sam was no stranger to the tricks and wiles of a large city and he saw clearly now how he had been cheated its that skunk abner blodgett he exclaimed indignantly hes regularly done me ill bet hes no more a countryman than i am i just wish i had him here id pound him sam was indignant but not discouraged he did not give up his money for lost yet he determined to seek abner everywhere and unmask him when found if he did not recover his money it would not be for want of trying as he finished dressing the breakfastbell rang and he went down to the diningroom though he had lost his money he had not lost his appetite when he entered the diningroom he found himself first in the field goodmorning mr barker said the landlady you are early but not so early as mr blodgett he left the house a little before six did you see him asked sam eagerly yes and spoke with him what did he say he said he was used to getting up early in the country and was going out for a walk hasnt he returned no answered sam and i dont believe he will what makes you say that asked the landlady noticing a significance in his tone i mean that hes gone off with all my money said sam bluntly you dont say so ejaculated the landlady why i thought he was more likely to be taken in himself wasnt he from the country thats what he said but i dont believe it i think he was in disguise i thought he was an old friend of yours i never saw him before yesterday he came up to me in the parker house yesterday morning what wickedness there is in the world i do declare did he take all your money every cent said sam im glad i paid you a week in advance or i should be badly off i wouldnt have turned you out mr barker said the landlady kindly i have a hard time to get along myself and it makes me sympathize with them that has had ill luck good mrs campbell was not quite grammatical but she was kindhearted and that is better thank you said sam but all the same im glad youve got the seven dollars instead of blodgett im going to try to find him and if i do ill have the money back unless he has spent it all be careful mr barker hes stronger than you are and he might do you some harm ill risk it said sam who with all his defects was not wanting in courage i want nothing better than to come across him chapter xxv in pursuit op a place sam was more angry than discouraged when he reflected upon the imposition which had been practiced upon him his indignation was excited when he considered how his confidence had been betrayed presently it occurred to him that abner had served him no worse than he intended to serve his roommate in new york the thought made him ashamed i didnt think i was acting so mean he said to himself i am glad henry didnt lose anything by me another thought followed and one which inspires confidence in sams reformation id rather have the money stolen from me than steal it from somebody else it was quite true that sams conscience had become more sensitive than formerly his meeting with julia stockton on board the fall river boat had kindled in him a new and honorable ambition to attain a respectable position in society in a strange city separated from his street acquaintances it really seemed as if he stood some chance of realizing his hope when he was met at the outset with this discouraging loss but sam was not discouraged he had been dependent upon his own resources for too many years to give up easily moreover he was hopeful and sanguine by temperament and determined to make the best of his position there was this to encourage him he had paid a weeks board in advance and therefore was sure of regular meals and a comfortable lodging for six days to come in that time he might get a situation as you are alone mr barker said mrs campbell i am afraid i must put you into the single room i may have opportunities to let this to two persons all right said sam but i have only paid seven dollars you said you should expect eight for the small room no matter about that for this week said the landlady you have been unfortunate and i will take that into consideration thank you when im a rich merchant ill make it up to you i hope you will become one for your own sake said mrs campbell smiling when breakfast was over sam strolled out into the streets he felt that the sooner he got something to do the better certainly in his situation there was no time to lose he had found out that the leading retail stores were on washington street and it seemed to him a good plan to begin there the first he selected was a drygoods store he entered and looked about him inquiringly a salesman asked him briskly what can i show you today if youll show me a situation where i can make a living youll oblige me answered sam we dont keep such goods for sale said the salesman smiling then perhaps you give them away can i speak to the boss there he is said the young man at the end of the store what is his name hunter sam was not bashful he went up to mr hunter and called him by name can i speak to you on business he asked what kind of business i want a place said sam bluntly we are not engaging any new clerks at present where do you live i have just come from new york did you have any experience there in the drygoods line no sir then you know nothing about it oh yes sir i can tell calico from silk thats more than i can always do said mr hunter jocosely i took you for silk and i find you to be calico youve got me there said sam then you cant give me anything to do i dont think it would be for my advantage to engage you do you think so i think it would be for mine said sam i guess i will look further i am afraid i dont know much about business thought sam i wish i knew what i am fit for and id go for it he kept on his way down washington street and entered the next large store where he repeated his request for a place here he was not so well treated clear out you young loafer was the rude response thank you said sam coolly youre extremely polite i dont waste my politeness on such fellows as you said the clerk disagreeably i wouldnt retorted sam you dont seem to have any to spare i guess i dont stand much chance there he considered i wouldnt want to be in the same store with that hog anyway the next store was devoted to millinery just outside was a small piece of paper on which sam read little girl wanted he went in those in charge of the store he found to be females youve got a notice in the window for help said sam yes was the reply do you want it for your sister i think not replied sam i havent any sister to begin with then what is your business i want a place for myself did you read the notice it says little girl wanted are you a little girl not that i am aware of said sam but i can do a little girls work perhaps you would not be willing to take a little girls pay how much is the pay two dollars a week declined with thanks said sam promptly i dont like to disappoint you but that wouldnt pay for my wardrobe the lady smiled im sorry i cant do anything for you she said amused so am i said sam presently he discovered a sign boy wanted and this inspired in him some hope he entered and made known his wishes you are altogether too large said a brisklooking man eying him rapidly we want a boy of twelve cant i do as much as a boy of twelve asked sam probably you can do you reside with your parents no sir where do you live i board on harrison avenue how much do you pay for board seven dollars a week have you any means of your own no then you dont want a situation with us we give only three dollars a week by this time sam began to feel a little despondent there were situations for small girls and small boys but none for him why didnt i stay a small boy he reflected but after all it is a question whether three dollars would defray the expenses of even a small boy boston dont seem to be much of a business place after all thought sam but perhaps it was hardly fair to draw such a conclusion from his own failure to procure a situation sam made one or two more ineffectual applications which did not tend to improve his spirits as he came out of the last one he saw to his great joy julia stockton passing by she recognized him at the same moment goodmorning mr barker she said frankly holding out her hand are you out shopping this morning itll be some time before i go shopping said sam why so i had all my money stolen last night you did what a shame tell me all about it said julia sympathizingly sam told his story the young lady showing her warm sympathy in her expressive face how will you get along without money she asked i must get a place right off said sam if if you wouldnt mind said julia in an embarrassed tone i have five dollars that i have no use for wont you let me lend it to you sam to his credit be it spoken declined the tempting proposal i am just as much obliged to you miss julia he said but i can get along somehow i have got my board paid for a week in advance and something will turn up in that time i am sure wont you take it then i really dont need it said julia earnestly if i get very hard up ill remember your kind offer said sam youll be sure to do it sam yes ill be sure i must bid you goodmorning now said julia im going into lorings library to get a new book here it is close by i am glad i met you thank you said sam dont forget to call at the house mamma will be glad to see you i would feel more like calling if i had a place thought sam soberly shes a bully girl and no mistake but i wouldnt like to take money from her its the first time i ever refused five dollars that i can remember chapter xxvi abner blodgett again the next day in his wanderings sam entered the parker house he had no definite object in view but feeling tired thought he would sit down a few minutes in the readingroom this is where that fellow roped me in he thought i wish i could get hold of him after sitting for quarter of an hour he strolled downstairs into the billiard room he stood on the threshold for a moment when a familiar voice struck his ear his heart beat rapidly with excitement for he recognized it as the voice of abner blodgett he glanced eagerly about to find him but he could see no one resembling the young man from the country who had victimized him i dont believe two voices can be so much alike he said to himself i must look more carefully the voice was heard again and this time sam perceived that the speaker was playing billiards on the second table to the right but it did not appear to be abner his personal appearance was very different and he had a black mustache but when sam scanned the upper part of the face he saw a strong resemblance he suspected the truth at once abner was disguised hes spending my money said sam to himself indignantly no wonder he can afford to play billiards when he gets his money so easy i wont lose sight of him by this time abner for it was he had finished his game and laid down his cue he had no money to pay for he had beaten his adversary he sauntered up to the door and was about to pass sam whom he had not noticed when our hero laid his hand upon his arm i want to speak to you mr blodgett he said on very particular business abner started when he recognized sam and changed color slightly but immediately his disguise occurred to him and he decided to brazen it out excuse me sir he answered coolly did you address me he changed his voice as well as he could in uttering these words and this confirmed sams previous suspicion i said i should like to speak to you on business mr blodgett sam repeated in an emphatic tone you have made a mistake in the person said abner shrugging his shoulders my name is not blodgett and i suppose your first name is not abner said sam certainly not well all i can say is you have changed your name within two days come out into the street and i will talk to you said abner not wishing the conversation to be heard sam followed him upstairs and they went into school street together what did you say my name was asked abner with an air of amusement abner blodgett ha ha thats a capital joke the best ive heard lately you told me you were from the country sam continued really i should think you must be from the country yourself to make such a mistake i am from the city of new york if you call that the country said sam in rather an important tone i am sorry for you but youve made a great mistake about me my dear young friend my name is john warburton and i am a student of harvard college in cambridge i only just came into boston this morning i havent been here before for a week he spoke so volubly and confidently that sam was staggered for a minute was it possible that he was mistaken after all was this really a harvard student whose voice happened to resemble that of abner blodgett abner saw that he was mystified and a gleam of exultation appeared in his face when sam detected this he felt sure that he had got the right man after all abner even ventured to ask why do you wish to see this abner blodgett whom i have the honor of resembling because said sam bluntly he stole my money stole your money repeated abner with mock indignation do you dare to take me for a thief me a harvard student belonging to one of the first families why it is an insult and an outrage i have a great mind to chastise you i dont know whether you belong to one of the first or one of the second families answered sam unterrified and i dont believe you are a harvard student at all just give me back them ten dollars you stole out of my pocket or ill make it hot for you you young scamp said abner now really angry youve insulted me long enough now clear out or ill kick you kick away said sam but first give me my money this is an outrage said abner who noticed the approach of a policeman but if you are really in want ill give you fifty cents though you dont deserve it i dont want your fifty cents i want the money you stole from me persisted sam who was not to be bought so cheap for heavens sake hush said abner nervously one of the professors is inside and i am afraid hell come out and hear you heres the fifty cents that wont go down mr blodgett said sam how much of my money have you got left by this time the policeman was within hearing distance sam saw him now and determined to press his claim vigorously ill complain to that policeman he said if you dont give up my money hush said abner wait till he goes by and well arrange it no we wont said sam stoutly do you want me to call him the policeman was now passing them he glanced casually at the pair rather to the discomfort of abner whose face was not wholly unknown to the force what do you say demanded sam in a significant tone ill lend you five dollars said abner desperately its all ive got now hand it over then said sam who had not expected to get back so much of the stolen property abner drew out a bill from his pocket and passed it over is that all youve got left mr blodgett asked sam dont call me blodgett it isnt my name i told you my name was john wharton of harvard college you said warburton five minutes since said sam dryly you didnt understand me said abner rather embarrassed the names sound alike i dont believe any of the names belong to you now when are you going to pay the rest of that money i told you i knew nothing of your money said abner then why did you give me that five dollars back out of charity then i wish youd give me a little more out of charity i have only enough to get me back to cambridge by the way mr blodgett said sam slyly what do you use to make your mustache grow so quick nothing at all what makes you ask when i saw you two days ago you had none its grown pretty well for so short a time i cant stop talking with you any longer i must go out to cambridge i have a recitation in latin in two hours may i go out with you i would like to see the college cant see it today said abner it isnt open to the public on saturday thats strange i can go to cambridge cant i if you want to but there isnt anything to see except the college he dont want me to find him out thought sam im bound to go if he goes i guess ill go he said quietly come along abner unwillingly started with his unwelcome companion and walked slowly to bowdoin square theres the cars he said just in front of the revere house jump in and ill be with you in a minute as he said this he dodged round a corner and sam found himself alone just as i expected thought he that fellow isnt a harvard student any more than i am im lucky to get back part of my money perhaps ill get the rest out of him some time he got into the car which had been pointed out to him and inquired of the driver does this car go to harvard college it is a mount auburn car but you can get out at harvard square i guess its all right said sam to himself i might as well go out and see harvard as ive got nothing else to do chapter xxvii sam is initiated into a college society before sam reached harvard square he caught sight of the college yard and the numerous buildings of brick and stone which had been erected within it for the accommodations of the students its a pretty big place thought sam his ideas of a college were very vague he had fancied that it consisted of one large brick building like the new york public schools i wonder what they want of so many buildings anyway said sam to himself there must be a lot of students he got out at harvard square and crossing the street entered the college yard or campus as it is sometimes more ambitiously called there were very few students about for it was saturday when there was a morning exercise only and the rest of the day being a holiday many of the students were accustomed to go to boston or to visit their friends elsewhere sam knew nothing of this and was surprised to see so few young men about now it happened that three sophomores having nothing more important to occupy their attention had made up their minds by way of a lark to play a trick on some freshman who from inexperience looked like an easy victim for conveniences sake i will call them brown jones and robinson as these three young men were walking arminarm in front of university hall they saw sam approaching of course where the classes are so large it is impossible for all to be personally acquainted which accounts for their instantly mistaking sam for a freshman theres a fresh said brown he looks green enough for our purpose suppose we take him all right said jones hell do sam was rather surprised when the three college boys stopped and brown addressed him what is your name sir barker answered sam all right said robinson in a low voice theres a barker in the freshman class ive noticed his name in the catalogue i believe mr barker said brown that you belong to the freshman class thats a good joke said sam to himself ill see it through he was not a little flattered at being mistaken for a collegian and nodded assent we have heard of you mr barker said jones in the most favorable manner we belong to the senior class and at our last meeting we elected you unanimously a member of the alpha zeta society you dont say so exclaimed sam really astonished we have inquired of the faculty concerning your scholarship and have been told that you are one of the best scholars in the class if thats so thought sam the class dont know much there are plenty that know more than me said sam aloud all your modesty mr barker said robinson we are convinced that you are a firstclass man and will be an acquisition to our society what does it all mean sam began to wonder we are a committee of the society appointed to initiate you by the usual impressive ceremonies said brown it is very fortunate we have met with you for saturday is our day for initiations is it yes have you any particular engagement for the next hour not as i know of then we will at once proceed to the society room and take you to the initiation are you ready i havent made my will yet said sam humorously the three sophomores looked at each other doubtfully perhaps their intended butt was not as verdant as they supposed that formality is not necessary said jones after a pause unless you desire to leave any money to the society i guess ill join first and see how i like it said sam quite reasonable said brown in a tone of satisfaction wed better not lose any time said robinson follow us mr barker said brown all right gentlemen robinson offered his arm and the four proceeded to one of the older college halls and ascended to a room on the third floor aint they sold though thought sam with an inward chuckle they think im a student and ill find out all about their society i cant think of the outlandish name the door was locked and then brown said mr barker you will not object to be blindfolded of course go ahead said sam if thats the regular thing im agreeable he was blindfolded by brown and seated in the center of the room he heard various movements lasting for perhaps five minutes then the bandage was removed and sam saw that his three companions were metamorphosed all wore masks the light of day had been shut out and four candles were burning on the table in the center was a skull and beside it was a large book a photograph book by the way barker said one of the masked figures in a sepulchral voice do you desire to join our mystic band you bet answered sam no levity was the stern reply before you are admitted you must swear solemnly not to divulge the secrets of the association i wont said sam tis not enough you must swear all right i swear kiss this book and swear with uplifted hand sam did so do you know what will be the penalty if you violate the oath ill be bounced i expect worse than that do you see this skull yes i do it is the skull of a freshman who joined our society five years since and divulged the secrets what did he die of asked sam he disappeared said brown impressively he was found dead in his bed one morning with a dagger in his heart you dont say so said sam impressed in spite of himself it was a fitting punishment dont incur it i wont said sam i dont know anything to tell anyway you shall know all our society was founded hundreds of years ago by the emperor charlemagne this didnt impress sam as much as was expected since he had never heard of the emperor charlemagne kings nobles prime ministers have belonged to our mystic ranks proceeded brown then i wonder they elected me in thought sam that book indicating the photograph album contains the records of the society may i look into it no said jones hurriedly laying his hand upon the book the time may come but not yet just as you say said sam submissively im in no hurry bandage his eyes once more said brown robinson advanced and tied a handkerchief over our heros eyes now stand up sam stood up brown proceeded to read a chorus from euripides which impressed sam as much as anything yet for the greek seemed but a strange and barbarous jargon to his unaccustomed ears do you understand what i have said asked brown at the close of his reading not entirely said sam then your education has been neglected but it matters not raise him jones and robinson proceeded to lift sam one by the head the other by the heels rather to his alarm whats your game he demanded resisting no harm is intended it is one of the necessary formalities go ahead then the two students bore sam about the room chanting discordantly as they went at length they set him down again in a chair then brown passed his hand several times over sams face explaining that this was one of the necessary formalities also then the bandage was taken off and a greek book was handed to sam we will test your scholarship said brown read sam stared at the greek page in bewilderment turning the book upside down but not finding it any more intelligible i cant read this stuff he said you need not render it into english said brown pronounce it in the original i cant said sam helplessly the three looked at each other you cant read greek said brown of course i cant then how did you get into college i walked in i mean how could you be admitted without knowing greek i wasnt admitted i never was here in my life before what are you not barker of the freshman class asked the three sophomores in chorus my name is barker sam barker but i dont belong to any class what made you say you did just for fun sold exclaimed the three in concert i guess this has gone far enough said brown lets unmask masks were removed the curtains raised sam was invited to wash his face which brown in his manipulations had blacked and there was a hearty laugh all round sam was invited to tell his story and did so the three students were wealthy and took up a contribution for his benefit amounting to ten dollars ill come round another day for half price said sam humorously the next time we initiate a freshman itll be the genuine article all the same weve had some fun wont you stay and dine with us we shall have dinner in an hour thank you said sam im agreeable well take you round to see the college before dinner we cant do less by a member of the alpha zeta society sam laughed i guess youll have to put down the name on a piece of paper he said or ill forget what society i belong to sams good humor and droll observations made him a favorite with the three students he learned to his surprise that brown was a cousin of julia stockton whose acquaintance he had made on the fall river boat i was in town yesterday and julia mentioned you said you were very polite to her it is very strange we should run across each other so soon after thats so said sam and calling to mind the ten dollars in his pocket he could not help adding to himself its mighty lucky too chapter xxviii browns plan brown jones and robinson roomed in one of the college dormitories but took their meals at a private boardinghouse not far from the college yard memorial hall had not yet been erected and there was no public diningplace as now they paid a high price and enjoyed in return a luxurious table about twenty students boarded at the same place but less than half that number were present when sam and the three sophomores entered the house leave your hat on the rack said brown and follow me he led the way into the diningroom and seated sam beside himself is that your brother brown asked bates a classmate who sat opposite yes answered brown do you think he looks like me he seems more intelligent said bates thank you i owe you one theres something about his left eyebrow that reminds me of you said bates reflectively yes i should know he was your brother i never saw him before continued brown hes been traveling ever since he was a baby but this morning witnessed his happy restoration to my arms sam listened to this chaffing with amusement he relished it better than a discussion which followed upon the relative merits of two greek authors which the students had been occupied with since entering college this talk seemed very dry to sam whose previous life had hardly fitted him to take an interest in such subjects the dinner however he did relish and did not fail to do justice to it i think sam said brown as the dessert came on that there is one society you will like better than the alpha zeta whats that asked sam the eta pi society i can eat a pie as well as anybody answered sam who however not being acquainted with the greek alphabet did not quite comprehend the joke i should never think of doubting your word on that score here mary bring this young man an extra large slice of apple pie he has been working hard this morning at length the dinner was over and the three students withdrew from the table well jones what are your plans for the afternoon asked brown im going into town on important business such as what ordering a new suit at my tailors thats important how is it with you robinson im going in with jones to help him order his suit i shant need any help in ordering it said jones i may need help in paying for it id rather help order it said robinson are you going into the city brown not till four oclock i have a little work to do first sam are you in any hurry to go back to boston no answered sam ive made ten dollars this forenoon and can afford to take it easy the rest of the day then stay with me until i go i may have something to say to you all right the three students parted jones and robinson jumping on board a street car while brown took sam to his room it was not the one in which sams initiation had taken place but another in the same dormitory and was handsomely furnished the walls were lined with fine engravings and various ornaments adorned the mantel brown must be rich though sam i wish i had such a nice room im going to read a little greek said brown i was away two days last week and i want to make up the lessons you may find something on that bookcase to amuse you stretch yourself out in that armchair and make yourself comfortable sam accepted the invitation willingly he was not particularly bashful and made himself quite at home most of the books on browns shelves struck him as very dry but he finally found one profusely illustrated and this entertained him till brown after an hours silence and turning over the pages of his greek dictionary closed his books and said well thank goodness that jobs over have you got through yes for today dont it make your head ache to study so hard asked sam curiously brown laughed i dont study hard enough to endanger my head he answered i am not likely to become a martyr to science you must know a lot said sam opening the greek book and surveying the pages with admiring awe my greek professor does not appear to be of that opinion said brown judging from the way he marks me however it is quite possible that he is prejudiced and cant appreciate modest merit what have you got there the arabian nights entertainments said sam do you like it its tiptop i wish i had that lamp ive been reading about aladdins lamp yes what would you do call for a lot of money you are poor said brown thoughtfully yes im about as poor as i want to be ive been lookin round for a fortune for five or six years but i havent found it yet what can you do i was a clerk in new york that means an errand boy doesnt it inquired brown shrewdly yes said sam not disturbed by being found out how much did you receive for your services in new york five dollars a week answered sam telling the truth by way of variety i am afraid it would be hard to get that in boston are you not fit for anything better i am afraid not said sam the fact is i dont know much in other words your education has been neglected yes it has thats in your way if you wrote a good hand and were good at figures you might perhaps do better than become an errand boy though even then it is doubtful whether you could obtain more than five dollars a week i dont see how i can live on that said sam even if i could get it it would be rather hard said the student i have twice that for spending money and dont you have to pay for your clothes or your meals asked sam no nor for my books nor any of my college bills your folks must be awful rich said sam not without a touch of envy my father is prosperous in business brown admitted does he live in boston no he lives in brookline where is that not far from the city not over three miles away couldnt your father give me a place in his store asked sam i dont think he has any vacancy sam looked despondent brown appeared to take an interest in him and he had hoped that he might do something for him but brown continued i have another plan for you what is it asked sam his hopes reviving i have a young brother of fourteen at home there are only two of us but he is small and delicate he is lame besides having met with an accident when quite young he is unable to go to school as it would prove too great a tax upon one in his delicate state of health he takes lessons at home however of a visiting tutor as in this way his studies can be arranged to suit his varying strength now i have been long of opinion that he requires a boy companion older than himself who is naturally lively and cheerful to share with him in his amusements to accompany him in his walks and share with him in his studies from what i have seen of you i think you are just the companion my brother wants have you any bad habits sam had shrewdness enough to perceive that it would be better for him to be truthful besides to do him justice browns kindness had made an impression upon him and he would have felt ashamed to deceive him i am afraid i have he answered but i could get rid of them what are your bad habits sometimes i swear said sam candidly will you give that up yes i will what else sometimes i smoke cigars you must give that up my father abominates cigars i will what else i dont always tell the truth said sam courageously lying is very ungentlemanly to say the least do you think you can get over that yes then i will ask my father to take you on trial i am going over to brookline to supper this afternoon and i will take you over and talk with him about it will you go ill go said sam eagerly id like to be with your brother ever so much chapter xxix arthur brown at halfpast five sam and his companion reached the home of the latter in brookline it was a handsome mansion with ample grounds standing some rods back from the street thats where i live sam said the young student its an elegant place said sam admiringly i hope your fatherll take me id like to live here ever so much theres my brother the one i spoke to you about brown pointed out a boy considerably smaller than sam who was hurrying to the gate as fast as his lameness would admit his thin pale face was lighted up with joy as he espied his brother i am glad you have come charlie he said its so lonely here during the week and how are you feeling arthur asked his brother laying his hand caressingly on the shoulder of the younger boy oh im all right only lonely ive brought you some company dont you see for the first time arthurs attention was drawn to sam i am glad to see you he said politely extending his hand are you a friend of charlies yes arthur the student replied anticipating our hero this is my friend sam barker are you in college mr barker asked arthur please call me sam said our hero i am only a boy and i dont begin to know enough to be in college nor i either said arthur come into the house said the elder brother has father got back from the city no he sent word that he should not be back till evening we are to take supper without him you are going to stop over sunday i hope charlie yes till tomorrow evening sam will stay too wont you take him up to the little room next to yours he will want to wash before supper sam did not know that he needed to wash but accepted this as a hint wont it be too much trouble for you he asked thinking of arthurs lameness oh no said the lame boy i can go upstairs almost as quick as if i wasnt lame come this way please sam followed him upstairs he was shown to a small but handsomely furnished chamber youll find everything you need i think said arthur that room pointing to one adjoining is mine so we shall be near neighbors i am glad of that if burglars get in in the night ill come to you for protection i am afraid i couldnt do you much good you are a great deal stronger than i then ill protect you do you live in boston sam i only came to boston a few days ago i came from new york did you live in the city yes were you ever there i have passed through new york on my way to saratoga i went up the hudson river on a steamboat we call it the north river there we stopped at the fifth avenue hotel thats a tiptop hotel ive been in there often are you going to live in boston if i can find anything to do i am not rich like you no said arthur but you are something better what is better than being rich asked sam incredulously you are strong and healthy you are not an invalid like me how long have you been lame arthur inquired sam who had naturally a kind heart and was already beginning to feel an interest in his new friend ever since i was a very small boy your brother is strong enough yes charlies got muscle said arthur proudly hes one of the strongest fellows in his class he goes to gymnasium regularly you ought to feel his arm hes going to belong to the boat club next year by this time sam had finished his ablutions come downstairs and ill show you the stable said arthur i guess therell be time before supper how many horses have you got three carriage horses father would buy me a pony but hes afraid i might fall and not be able to help myself do you go to school no my health is not good enough the doctor says i must be out in the open air a good deal and must not overtax my brain i suppose you have been to school a good deal well no said sam i am afraid of overtaxing my brain too arthur laughed i dont think from your looks that you need feel afraid he said youve no idea how delicate i am said sam humorously i should think you might be said arthur merrily but you are very successful in not showing it thats why i dont get any sympathy what do you do all day long if you dont go to school i study some and recite to a tutor who comes out from boston but i have a good deal of time to myself ive been very lonely since my mother died he added soberly how long ago was that sam inquired with sympathy a year ago her death was a great loss to me as charlie has been away from home so much and father is all day in the city are there no boys round here that you can play with there are boys but i cant join in their sports on account of my lameness i wonder whether he will like the idea of my staying with him thought sam we could have good times together they went out to the stable and looked about till the supperbell rang everything was well arranged and on a scale which indicated that mr brown was a man of wealth more and more sam though he would like to live there entering the diningroom where the supper was provided they found the older brother already present have you two boys got acquainted he asked yes said arthur it didnt take us long ive been showing sam the stable how do you like what you have seen asked the sophomore tiptop said sam take a seat there sam arthur you know your place i must preside in fathers absence they talked together socially during the meal sam getting to feel better and better acquainted as time went on after supper they took another walk and then arthur asked do you play backgammon sam i never learned shall i show you i wish you would the backgammon board was brought out and the two boys had a pleasant evening as the older brother heard their lively laughter and noticed how arthur seemed brightened up by sams companionship he felt more and more that it would be a good plan to keep him there when his father reached home a little before nine oclock he made the proposal to him i am convinced he said that arthur needs a young companion of a cheerful temperament who will brighten him up and keep him in good spirits do you know anything of this boy asked mr brown cautiously not much except that arthur appears to fancy him his education has been neglected that would not matter he could study regularly with arthur and recite to his tutor that occurred to me has he any bad habits no confirmed bad habits if it should prove so he can be dismissed would he like to come of that i am sure indeed it would be a great thing for him as he is poor and has no friends to help him along then he may stay a month on trial you may speak to him about it chapter xxx how it was arranged sam said the young student the next morning i have spoken to my father about your remaining here as a companion to arthur what did he say asked sam anxiously that you may stay a month on trial if the arrangement proves satisfactory you can remain longer im ever so much obliged to you said sam overjoyed i hope ill suit i hope you will too for arthurs sake you must bear in mind that we expect you to lay aside all your bad habits and try to become refined and gentlemanly ill try said sam earnestly you will take lessons of arthurs tutor and study with him though considerably younger than you are he is much more advanced in his studies and will be able to help you in any difficulties perhaps he wont want to be bothered with me on the contrary it will interest and amuse him to be so occupied there is no reason why you should not improve fast i want to know something said sam ever since i met that girl on the boat ive been ashamed of being such a knownothing i am glad to hear you say that it is encouraging to find that you are sensible of your deficiencies it is the first step toward remedying them will the tutor lick me if i dont know my lessons asked sam anxiously the student smiled he wouldnt do that he answered but he will inform my father that is if you persist in neglecting your lessons and that might lead to your being dismissed ill study said sam you see if i dont even if it makes my head ache awful you look as if you could stand a mode amount of study said the sophomore smiling goodnaturedly if your head aches very bad we can give you some pills i guess it wont said sam hastily for he had a distinct remembrance of having been dosed with some very nauseous pills in his early days my father will see that you are provided with suitable clothes proceeded brown and you shall have a little spending money also but you must not spend any of it for cigars i wont said sam virtuously it seems almost like a dream he added to think of my having a private tutor with nice clothes and spending money i wonder what henry martin would say who is henry martin i used to room with him in new york he is a nice boy henry is a good deal bettern me he used to save his money and put it in the bank and study evenings and you didnt i suppose no i was a fool but i wont be any longer im going to turn over a new leaf if you do i shall not regret having engaged you as a companion for arthur here arthurs voice was heard as he entered the room what are you two talking about he inquired i was telling sam you would miss him when he went away so i shall why cant he stay a little longer arthur had not yet been told of the plan for giving him a companion you would get tired of me said sam no i wouldnt not if i stayed a month will you really asked arthur his pale face brightening up with evident pleasure he shall stay if you would like to have him said his brother and study with you every day i think prof taylor will be willing to take one additional pupil will he live here in this house asked arthur with animation certainly then i shant feel lonely any more said arthur ive been wanting company i am sorry to say sams studies have been neglected and he may require some assistance in getting his lessons ill help him said arthur eagerly so it was arranged and so it was that sam after drifting about for years found at last a good home chapter xxxi two years later more than two years have elapsed in the fine old home at brookline sam and arthur are sitting out on the lawn both have changed arthur looks stronger and better than when sam first made his acquaintance his thin face is more full his pallor has been succeeded by a faint tinge of color and he looks contented and happy but the greatest change has come over sam he is now a young man of eighteen wellformed and robust handsomely dressed with a face not only attractive but intelligent these two years have improved him greatly as we shall see i can hardly realize that charlie is to graduate next week said arthur he was a sophomore when i first met him said sam how little i thought that the meeting would be so important to me and to me said arthur you have up idea how lonely i felt before you came you have an idea how ignorant i was at that time said sam you didnt know much to be sure said arthur smiling i remember how i had to drill you in the multiplication table my spelling was rather weak said sam i should say it was it was original at least said arthur to tell the truth i was rather dismayed when i found how little you knew but you have made it up bravely yes said sam complacently i think have but still you are ahead of me not in all things you write a much better hand than i i am afraid it is my only accomplishment said sam but not your only acquisition you are a good english scholar i dont mind telling you however that in the first three months i never expected you would be i used to have the headache pretty often about that time said sam yes i sympathized with you at first till i began to suspect that it was all put on it was harder for me to apply myself than you arthur my street life made it so it was only by degrees that i got the habit of application it was a good thing for me that i had to assist you it gave me an object in life besides it made me work harder myself in order to continue able to do it i used to get lowspirited and feel that i was of no use in the world you dont feel so now said sam with a look of affection for arthur seemed to him like a dear younger brother whom it was his duty to care for and protect oh no said arthur cheerfully i am much better and stronger now and that leads me to a little secret which affects both you and me would you like to hear it yes arthur father is going to take both of us into the office to learn business i shall only be there about half the day but you will have full hours how will you like that it is the very thing i would like above all others said sam with animation i want to be doing something i want to earn my own living when are we to go into the office on the first of september not till then no we are to spend the summer at the white mountains late in august charlie will sail for europe where he is to travel for a year and we two are to be disposed of as i have told you it was a lucky day for me arthur when i became your companion but for that i might have been the same shiftless fellow i was before fit for nothing except to run errands or sell newspapers are you sure you are fit for anything better now asked arthur mischievously i hope so said sam time will show the arrangement indicated was carried out sam through his bright sunny disposition had become a favorite with all the browns who besides felt grateful to him for the good effect his companionship had had upon arthurs health and happiness it had long been understood between charlie and his father that sam was eventually to be taken into the office and promoted as rapidly as his abilities would justify he was allowed a liberal salary and continued a member of mr browns family chapter xxxii conclusion henry martin meanwhile had not stood still two years after sam entered mr browns countingroom henry became chief clerk in the office of his new york employer mr hamilton had permitted him to share in the general ventures of the firm and this had enabled henry with his habits of prudence combined with his savings from a largely increased salary to lay up four thousand dollars which were securely invested his salary now was one hundred dollars a month and he was promised on the approaching first of january further increase his prudence industry and selfdenial had reaped their fitting reward he had never heard a word from sam since the latter left new york for boston it would be difficult to explain why sam had not written for he had learned to respect henry and to prize the traits he had formerly laughed at i am afraid sam has come to no good henry sometimes said to himself he was always a harumscarum fellow goodnatured but lazy and heedless i wish i could do him a good turn i have been so prospered that i could afford to help him along if i could only find him but months and years passed and there were no tidings of sam one day as henry was engaged at his desk a young man entered the countingroom he was handsomely dressed with a bright intelligent look and the appearance of one who was on good terms with the world he glanced inquiringly at henry and then said am i speaking to mr henry martin yes sir said young martin politely what can i do for you i believe i used to know you mr martin said sam smiling for it was our old friend the young outlaw i beg your pardon said henry martin i must apologize for my poor memory but i cannot recall your face i should have known you at once said sam you have the same sedate grave manner that you had when a boy did you know me as a boy asked henry puzzled slightly answered sam smiling again i used to room with you you are not sam barker exclaimed henry in the deepest astonishment who says i am not said sam henry martin jumped from his stool and grasped sams hands cordially i see it now he said there is the same look though you are five years older i am delighted to see you sam where have you been all these years in and near boston answered sam you look as if you had prospered i have i am bookkeeper for a boston merchant with a handsome salary where on earth did you pick up bookkeeping asked henry in continued amazement i studied under a private tutor for two or three years answered sam enjoying his perplexity i have only been in business two years didnt it make your head ache asked henry slyly it did at first but i got over that after a while i cant understand it at all sam it seems like a romance i never thought you would turn out like this nor i henry but it is a long story come and see me this evening at the st nicholas and i will tell you all i must leave you now as i have a little business to attend to that evening henry and sam met at the hotel and each told his story to the deep interest of the other you have been very lucky sam said henry at the end i never supposed you would reform so completely and thoroughly you were a pretty hard case when i knew you so i was said sam and i would have been to this day if i had not turned over a new leaf sometime i hope to introduce you to the two friends to whom i owe my reformation who are they a young lady of boston miss julia stockton and my most valued friend arthur brown so there is a young lady in the case sam i know what you are thinking of henry but it isnt as you suppose julia stockton will never be any more than a friend to me indeed she is engaged to be married next month to arthurs elder brother charlie who has just been admitted to the bar but i shall always feel indebted to her for first leading me to look upon myself as an ignorant and heedless boy i never became ambitious till i met her then my lectures did no good sam not at the time afterward i thought of them and saw that you were right and now that we have found each other henry dont let us remain strangers cant you come and see me in boston i am to visit boston on business in october sam i wont fail to look you up then henry kept his word sam received him with cordial hospitality and henceforth the two remained fast friends it is not necessary to sketch their future both are on the right track though sam was much later in finding it and the young outlaw as well as his more prudent companion is likely to prosper more and more
