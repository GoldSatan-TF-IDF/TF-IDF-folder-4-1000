peter bell the third is it a party in a parlour crammed just as they on earth were crammed some sipping punch some sipping tea but as you by their faces see all silent and all damned peter bell by w wordsworth ophelia what means this my lord hamlet marry this is miching mallecho it means mischief shakespeare dedication to thomas brown esq the younger hf dear tom allow me to request you to introduce mr peter bell to the respectable family of the fudges although he may fall short of those very considerable personages in the more active properties which characterize the rat and the apostate i suspect that even you their historian will confess that he surpasses them in the more peculiarly legitimate qualification of intolerable dulness you know mr examiner hunt well it was he who presented me to two of the mr bells my intimacy with the younger mr bell naturally sprung from this introduction to his brothers and in presenting him to you i have the satisfaction of being able to assure you that he is considerably the dullest of the three there is this particular advantage in an acquaintance with any one of the peter bells that if you know one peter bell you know three peter bells they are not one but three not three but one an awful mystery which after having caused torrents of blood and having been hymned by groans enough to deafen the music of the spheres is at length illustrated to the satisfaction of all parties in the theological world by the nature of mr peter bell peter is a polyhedric peter or a peter with many sides he changes colours like a chameleon and his coat like a snake he is a proteus of a peter he was at first sublime pathetic impressive profound then dull then prosy and dull and now dull oh so very dull it is an ultralegitimate dulness you will perceive that it is not necessary to consider hell and the devil as supernatural machinery the whole scene of my epic is in this world which is so peter informed us before his conversion to white obi the world of all of us and where we find our happiness or not at all let me observe that i have spent six or seven days in composing this sublime piece the orb of my moonlike genius has made the fourth part of its revolution round the dull earth which you inhabit driving you mad while it has retained its calmness and its splendour and i have been fitting this its last phase to occupy a permanent station in the literature of my country your works indeed dear tom sell better but mine are far superior the public is no judge posterity sets all to rights allow me to observe that so much has been written of peter bell that the present history can be considered only like the iliad as a continuation of that series of cyclic poems which have already been candidates for bestowing immortality upon at the same time that they receive it from his character and adventures in this point of view i have violated no rule of syntax in beginning my composition with a conjunction the full stop which closes the poem continued by me being like the full stops at the end of the iliad and odyssey a full stop of a very qualified import hoping that the immortality which you have given to the fudges you will receive from them and in the firm expectation that when london shall be an habitation of bitterns when st pauls and westminster abbey shall stand shapeless and nameless ruins in the midst of an unpeopled marsh when the piers of waterloo bridge shall become the nuclei of islets of reeds and osiers and cast the jagged shadows of their broken arches on the solitary stream some transatlantic commentator will be weighing in the scales of some new and now unimagined system of criticism the respective merits of the bells and the fudges and their historians i remain dear tom yours sincerely miching mallecho december ps pray excuse the date of place so soon as the profits of the publication come in i mean to hire lodgings in a more respectable street prologue peter bells one two and three oer the wide world wandering be first the antenatal peter wrapped in weeds of the same metre the solongpredestined raiment clothed in which to walk his way meant the second peter whose ambition is to link the proposition as the mean of two extremes this was learned from aldrics themes shielding from the guilt of schism the orthodoxal syllogism the first peter he who was like the shadow in the glass of the second yet unripe his substantial antitype then came peter bell the second who henceforward must be reckoned the body of a double soul and that portion of the whole without which the rest would seem ends of a disjointed dream and the third is he who has oer the grave been forced to pass to the other side which is go and try else just like this peter bell the first was peter smugger milder softer neater like the soul before it is born from that world into this the next peter bell was he predevote like you and me to good or evil as may come his was the severer doom for he was an evil cotter and a polygamic potter and the last is peter bell damned since our first parents fell damned eternally to hell surely he deserves it well part death and peter bell when he had been with freshimported hellfire warmed grew serious from his dress and mien twas very plainly to be seen peter was quite reformed his eyes turned up his mouth turned down his accent caught a nasal twang he oiled his hair there might be heard the grace of god in every word which peter said or sang but peter now grew old and had an ill no doctor could unravel his torments almost drove him mad some said it was a fever bad some swore it was the gravel his holy friends then came about and with long preaching and persuasion convinced the patient that without the smallest shadow of a doubt he was predestined to damnation they said thy name is peter bell thy skin is of a brimstone hue alive or dead ay sick or well the one god made to rhyme with hell the other i think rhymes with you then peter set up such a yell the nurse who with some water gruel was climbing up the stairs as well as her old legs could climb them fell and broke them both the fall was cruel the parson from the casement lept into the lake of windermere and many an eel though no adept in gods right reason for it kept gnawing his kidneys half a year and all the rest rushed through the door and tumbled over one another and broke their skulls upon the floor meanwhile sat peter bell and swore and cursed his father and his mother and raved of god and sin and death blaspheming like an infidel and said that with his clenched teeth hed seize the earth from underneath and drag it with him down to hell as he was speaking came a spasm and wrenched his gnashing teeth asunder like one who sees a strange phantasm he lay there was a silent chasm between his upper jaw and under and yellow death lay on his face and a fixed smile that was not human told as i understand the case that he was gone to the wrong place i heard all this from the old woman then there came down from langdale pike a cloud with lightning wind and hail it swept over the mountains like an ocean and i heard it strike the woods and crags of grasmere vale and i saw the black storm come nearer minute after minute its thunder made the cataracts dumb with hiss and clash and hollow hum it neared as if the devil was in it the devil was in it he had bought peter for halfacrown and when the storm which bore him vanished nought that in the house that storm had caught was ever seen again the gaping neighbours came next day they found all vanished from the shore the bible whence he used to pray half scorched under a hencoop lay smashed glass and nothing more part the devil the devil i safely can aver has neither hoof nor tail nor sting nor is he as some sages swear a spirit neither here nor there in nothing yet in everything he is what we are for sometimes the devil is a gentleman at others a bard bartering rhymes for sack a statesman spinning crimes a swindler living as he can a thief who cometh in the night with whole boots and net pantaloons like some one whom it were not right to mention or the luckless wight from whom he steals nine silver spoons but in this case he did appear like a slopmerchant from wapping and with smug face and eye severe on every side did perk and peer till he saw peter dead or napping he had on an upper benjamin for he was of the driving schism in the which he wrapped his skin from the storm he travelled in for fear of rheumatism he called the ghost out of the corse it was exceedingly like peter only its voice was hollow and hoarse it had a queerish look of course its dress too was a little neater the devil knew not his name and lot peter knew not that he was bell each had an upper stream of thought which made all seem as it was not fitting itself to all things well peter thought he had parents dear brothers sisters cousins cronies in the fens of lincolnshire he perhaps had found them there had he gone and boldly shown his solemn phiz in his own village where he thought oft when a boy hed clomb the orchard walls to pillage the produce of his neighbours tillage with marvellous pride and joy and the devil thought he had mid the misery and confusion of an unjust war just made a fortune by the gainful trade of giving soldiers rations bad the world is full of strange delusion that he had a mansion planned in a square like grosvenor square that he was aping fashion and that he now came to westmoreland to see what was romantic there and all this though quite ideal ready at a breath to vanish was a state not more unreal than the peace he could not feel or the care he could not banish after a little conversation the devil told peter if he chose hed bring him to the world of fashion by giving him a situation in his own service and new clothes and peter bowed quite pleased and proud and after waiting some few days for a new livery dirty yellow turned up with black the wretched fellow was bowled to hell in the devils chaise part hell hell is a city much like london a populous and a smoky city there are all sorts of people undone and there is little or no fun done small justice shown and still less pity there is a castles and a canning a cobbett and a castlereagh all sorts of caitiff corpses planning all sorts of cozening for trepanning corpses less corrupt than they there is a who has lost his wits or sold them none knows which he walks about a double ghost and though as thin as fraud almost ever grows more grim and rich there is a chancery court a king a manufacturing mob a set of thieves who by themselves are sent similar thieves to represent an army and a public debt which last is a scheme of paper money and means being interpreted bees keep your wax give us the honey and we will plant while skies are sunny flowers which in winter serve instead there is a great talk of revolution and a great chance of despotism german soldiers camps confusion tumults lotteries rage delusion gin suicide and methodism taxes too on wine and bread and meat and beer and tea and cheese from which those patriots pure are fed who gorge before they reel to bed the tenfold essence of all these there are mincing women mewing like cats who amant misere of their own virtue and pursuing their gentler sisters to that ruin without which what were chastity lawyers judges old hobnobbers are there bailiffs chancellors bishops great and little robbers rhymesters pamphleteers stockjobbers men of glory in the wars things whose trade is over ladies to lean and flirt and stare and simper till all that is divine in woman grows cruel courteous smooth inhuman crucified twixt a smile and whimper thrusting toiling wailing moiling frowning preaching such a riot each with neverceasing labour whilst he thinks he cheats his neighbour cheating his own heart of quiet and all these meet at levees dinners convivial and political suppers of epic poets teas where small talk dies in agonies breakfasts professional and critical lunches and snacks so aldermanic that one would furnish forth ten dinners where reigns a cretantongued panic lest news russ dutch or alemannic should make some losers and some winners at conversazioni balls conventicles and drawingrooms courts of law committees calls of a morning clubs bookstalls churches masquerades and tombs and this is hell and in this smother all are damnable and damned each one damning damns the other they are damned by one another by none other are they damned tis a lie to say god damns where was heavens attorney general when they first gave out such flams let there be an end of shams they are mines of poisonous mineral statesmen damn themselves to be cursed and lawyers damn their souls to the auction of a fee churchmen damn themselves to see gods sweet love in burning coals the rich are damned beyond all cure to taunt and starve and trample on the weak and wretched and the poor damn their broken hearts to endure stripe on stripe with groan on groan sometimes the poor are damned indeed to take not means for being blessed but cobbetts snuff revenge that weed from which the worms that it doth feed squeeze less than they before possessed and some few like we know who damned but god alone knows why to believe their minds are given to make this ugly hell a heaven in which faith they live and die thus as in a town plaguestricken each man be he sound or no must indifferently sicken as when day begins to thicken none knows a pigeon from a crow so good and bad sane and mad the oppressor and the oppressed those who weep to see what others smile to inflict upon their brothers lovers haters worst and best all are damned they breathe an air thick infected joydispelling each pursues what seems most fair mining like moles through mind and there scoop palacecaverns vast where care in throned state is ever dwelling part sin lo peter in hells grosvenor square a footman in the devils service and the misjudging world would swear that every man in service there to virtue would prefer vice but peter though now damned was not what peter was before damnation men oftentimes prepare a lot which ere it finds them is not what suits with their genuine station all things that peter saw and felt had a peculiar aspect to him and when they came within the belt of his own nature seemed to melt like cloud to cloud into him and so the outward world uniting to that within him he became considerably uninviting to those who meditation slighting were moulded in a different frame and he scorned them and they scorned him and he scorned all they did and they did all that men of their own trim are wont to do to please their whim drinking lying swearing play such were his fellowservants thus his virtue like our own was built too much on that indignant fuss hypocrite pride stirs up in us to bully one anothers guilt he had a mind which was somehow at once circumference and centre of all he might or feel or know nothing went ever out although something did ever enter he had as much imagination as a pintpot he never could fancy another situation from which to dart his contemplation than that wherein he stood yet his was individual mind and new created all he saw in a new manner and refined those new creations and combined them by a masterspirits law thus though unimaginative an apprehension clear intense of his minds work had made alive the things it wrought on i believe wakening a sort of thought in sense but from the first twas peters drift to be a kind of moral eunuch he touched the hem of natures shift felt faint and never dared uplift the closest allconcealing tunic she laughed the while with an arch smile and kissed him with a sisters kiss and said my best diogenes i love you well but if you please tempt not again my deepest bliss tis you are cold for i not coy yield love for love frank warm and true and burns a scottish peasant boy his errors prove it knew my joy more learned friend than you boeca bacciata non perde ventura anzi rinnuova come fa la luna so thought boccaccio whose sweet words might cure a a male prude like you from what you now endure a lowtide in soul like a stagnant laguna then peter rubbed his eyes severe and smoothed his spacious forehead down with his broad palm twixt love and fear he looked as he no doubt felt queer and in his dream sate down the devil was no uncommon creature a leadenwitted thief just huddled out of the dross and scum of nature a toadlike lump of limb and feature with mind and heart and fancy muddled he was that heavy dull cold thing the spirit of evil well may be a drone too base to have a sting who gluts and grimes his lazy wing and calls lust luxury now he was quite the kind of wight round whom collect at a fixed aera venison turtle hock and claret good cheer and those who come to share it and best east indian madeira it was his fancy to invite men of science wit and learning who came to lend each other light he proudly thought that his golds might had set those spirits burning and men of learning science wit considered him as you and i think of some rotten tree and sit lounging and dining under it exposed to the wide sky and all the while with loose fat smile the willing wretch sat winking there believing twas his power that made that jovial scene and that all paid homage to his unnoticed chair though to be sure this place was hell he was the devil and all they what though the claret circled well and wit like ocean rose and fell were damned eternally part grace among the guests who often stayed till the devils petitssoupers a man there came fair as a maid and peter noted what he said standing behind his masters chair he was a mighty poet and a subtlesouled psychologist all things he seemed to understand of old or new of sea or land but his own mind which was a mist this was a man who might have turned hell into heaven and so in gladness a heaven unto himself have earned but he in shadows undiscerned trusted and damned himself to madness he spoke of poetry and how divine it was a light a love a spirit which like wind doth blow as it listeth to and fro a dew rained down from god above a power which comes and goes like dream and which none can ever trace heavens light on earth truths brightest beam and when he ceased there lay the gleam of those words upon his face now peter when he heard such talk would heedless of a broken pate stand like a man asleep or balk some wishing guest of knife or fork or drop and break his masters plate at night he oft would start and wake like a lover and began in a wild measure songs to make on moor and glen and rocky lake and on the heart of man and on the universal sky and the wide earths bosom green and the sweet strange mystery of what beyond these things may lie and yet remain unseen for in his thought he visited the spots in which ere dead and damned he his wayward life had led yet knew not whence the thoughts were fed which thus his fancy crammed and these obscure remembrances stirred such harmony in peter that whensoever he should please he could speak of rocks and trees in poetic metre for though it was without a sense of memory yet he remembered well many a ditch and quickset fence of lakes he had intelligence he knew something of heath and fell he had also dim recollections of pedlars tramping on their rounds milkpans and pails and odd collections of saws and proverbs and reflections old parsons make in buryinggrounds but peters verse was clear and came announcing from the frozen hearth of a cold age that none might tame the soul of that diviner flame it augured to the earth like gentle rains on the dry plains making that green which late was gray or like the sudden moon that stains some gloomy chambers windowpanes with a broad light like day for language was in peters hand like clay while he was yet a potter and he made songs for all the land sweet both to feel and understand as pipkins late to mountain cotter and mr the bookseller gave twenty pounds for some then scorning a footmans yellow coat to wear peter too proud of heart i fear instantly gave the devil warning whereat the devil took offence and swore in his soul a great oath then that for his damned impertinence hed bring him to a proper sense of what was due to gentlemen part damnation o that mine enemy had written a book cried job a fearful curse if to the arab as the briton twas galling to be criticbitten the devil to peter wished no worse when peters next new book found vent the devil to all the first reviews a copy of it slyly sent with fivepound note as compliment and this short notice pray abuse then seriatim month and quarter appeared such mad tirades one said peter seduced mrs foys daughter then drowned the mother in ullswater the last thing as he went to bed another let him shave his head wheres dr willis or is he joking what does the rascal mean or hope no longer imitating pope in that barbarian shakespeare poking one more is incest not enough and must there be adultery too grace after meat miscreant and liar thief blackguard scoundrel fool hellfire is twenty times too good for you by that last book of yours we think youve double damned yourself to scorn we warned you whilst yet on the brink you stood from your black name will shrink the babe that is unborn all these reviews the devil made up in a parcel which he had safely to peters house conveyed for carriage tenpence peter paid untied them read them went half mad what cried he this is my reward for nights of thought and days of toil do poets but to be abhorred by men of whom they never heard consume their spirits oil what have i done to them and who is mrs foy tis very cruel to speak of me and betty so adultery god defend me oh ive half a mind to fight a duel or cried he a grave look collecting is it my genius like the moon sets those who stand her face inspecting that face within their brain reflecting like a crazed bellchime out of tune for peter did not know the town but thought as country readers do for half a guinea or a crown he bought oblivion or renown from gods own voice in a review all peter did on this occasion was writing some sad stuff in prose it is a dangerous invasion when poets criticize their station is to delight not pose the devil then sent to leipsic fair for borns translation of kants book a world of words tail foremost where right wrong false true and foul and fair as in a lotterywheel are shook five thousand crammed octavo pages of german psychologics he who his furor verborum assuages thereon deserves just seven months wages more than will eer be due to me i looked on them nine several days and then i saw that they were bad a friend too spoke in their dispraise he never read them with amaze i found sir william drummond had when the book came the devil sent it to p verbovale esquire with a brief note of compliment by that nights carlisle mail it went and set his soul on fire fire which ex luce praebens fumum made him beyond the bottom see of truths clear well when i and you maam go as we shall do subter humum we may know more than he now peter ran to seed in soul into a walking paradox for he was neither part nor whole nor good nor bad nor knave nor fool among the woods and rocks furious he rode where late he ran lashing and spurring his tame hobby turned to a formal puritan a solemn and unsexual man he half believed white obi this steed in vision he would ride high trotting over nineinch bridges with flibbertigibbet imp of pride mocking and mowing by his side a madbrained goblin for a guide over cornfields gates and hedges after these ghastly rides he came home to his heart and found from thence much stolen of its accustomed flame his thoughts grew weak drowsy and lame of their intelligence to peters view all seemed one hue he was no whig he was no tory no deist and no christian he he got so subtle that to be nothing was all his glory one single point in his belief from his organization sprung the heartenrooted faith the chief ear in his doctrines blighted sheaf that happiness is wrong so thought calvin and dominic so think their fierce successors who even now would neither stint nor stick our flesh from off our bones to pick if they might do their do his morals thus were undermined the old peter the hard old potter was born anew within his mind he grew dull harsh sly unrefined as when he tramped beside the otter in the death hues of agony lambently flashing from a fish now peter felt amused to see shades like a rainbows rise and flee mixed with a certain hungry wish so in his countrys dying face he looked and lovely as she lay seeking in vain his last embrace wailing her own abandoned case with hardened sneer he turned away and coolly to his own soul said do you not think that we might make a poem on her when shes dead or no a thought is in my head her shroud for a new sheet ill take my wife wants one let who will bury this mangled corpse and i and you my dearest soul will then make merry as the prince regent did with sherry ay and at last desert me too and so his soul would not be gay but moaned within him like a fawn moaning within a cave it lay wounded and wasting day by day till all its life of life was gone as troubled skies stain waters clear the storm in peters heart and mind now made his verses dark and queer they were the ghosts of what they were shaking dim graveclothes in the wind for he now raved enormous folly of baptisms sundayschools and graves twould make george colman melancholy to have heard him like a male molly chanting those stupid staves yet the reviews who heaped abuse on peter while he wrote for freedom so soon as in his song they spy the folly which soothes tyranny praise him for those who feed em he was a man too great to scan a planet lost in truths keen rays his virtue awful and prodigious he was the most sublime religious pureminded poet of these days as soon as he read that cried peter eureka i have found the way to make a better thing of metre than eer was made by living creature up to this blessed day then peter wrote odes to the devil in one of which he meekly said may carnage and slaughter thy niece and thy daughter may rapine and famine thy gorge ever cramming glut thee with living and dead may death and damnation and consternation flit up from hell with pure intent slash them at manchester glasgow leeds and chester drench all with blood from avon to trent let thy bodyguard yeomen hew down babes and women and laugh with bold triumph till heaven be rent when moloch in jewry munched children with fury it was thou devil dining with pure intent part double damnation the devil now knew his proper cue soon as he read the ode he drove to his friend lord macmurderchouses a man of interest in both houses and said for money or for love pray find some cure or sinecure to feed from the superfluous taxes a friend of ours a poet fewer have fluttered tamer to the lure than he his lordship stands and racks his stupid brains while one might count as many beads as he had boroughs at length replies from his mean front like one who rubs out an account smoothing away the unmeaning furrows it happens fortunately dear sir i can i hope i need require no pledge from you that he will stir in our affairs like oliver that hell be worthy of his hire these words exchanged the news sent off to peter home the devil hied took to his bed he had no cough no doctor meat and drink enough yet that same night he died the devils corpse was leaded down his decent heirs enjoyed his pelf mourningcoaches many a one followed his hearse along the town where was the devil himself when peter heard of his promotion his eyes grew like two stars for bliss there was a bow of sleek devotion engendering in his back each motion seemed a lords shoe to kiss he hired a house bought plate and made a genteel drive up to his door with sifted gravel neatly laid as if defying all who said peter was ever poor but a disease soon struck into the very life and soul of peter he walked about slept had the hue of health upon his cheeks and few dug better none a heartier eater and yet a strange and horrid curse clung upon peter night and day month after month the thing grew worse and deadlier than in this my verse i can find strength to say peter was dull he was at first dull oh so dull so very dull whether he talked wrote or rehearsed still with this dulness was he cursed dull beyond all conception dull no one could read his books no mortal but a few natural friends would hear him the parson came not near his portal his state was like that of the immortal described by swift no man could bear him his sister wife and children yawned with a long slow and drear ennui all human patience far beyond their hopes of heaven each would have pawned anywhere else to be but in his verse and in his prose the essence of his dulness was concentred and compressed so close twould have made guatimozin doze on his red gridiron of brass a printers boy folding those pages fell slumbrously upon one side like those famed seven who slept three ages to wakeful frenzys vigil rages as opiates were the same applied even the reviewers who were hired to do the work of his reviewing with adamantine nerves grew tired gaping and torpid they retired to dream of what they should be doing and worse and worse the drowsy curse yawned in him till it grew a pest a wide contagious atmosphere creeping like cold through all things near a power to infect and to infest his servantmaids and dogs grew dull his kitten late a sportive elf the woods and lakes so beautiful of dim stupidity were full all grew dull as peters self the earth under his feet the springs which lived within it a quick life the air the winds of many wings that fan it with new murmurings were dead to their harmonious strife the birds and beasts within the wood the insects and each creeping thing were now a silent multitude loves work was left unwrought no brood near peters house took wing and every neighbouring cottager stupidly yawned upon the other no jackass brayed no little cur cocked up his ears no man would stir to save a dying mother yet all from that charmed district went but some halfidiot and halfknave who rather than pay any rent would live with marvellous content over his fathers grave no bailiff dared within that space for fear of the dull charm to enter a man would bear upon his face for fifteen months in any case the yawn of such a venture seven miles above below around this pest of dulness holds its sway a ghastly life without a sound to peters soul the spell is bound how should it ever pass away
