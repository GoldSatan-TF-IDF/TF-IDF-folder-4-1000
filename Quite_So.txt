quite so by thomas bailey aldrich boston and new york houghton mifflin company copyright and i of course that was not his name even in the state of maine where it is still a custom to maim a child for life by christening him arioch or shadrach or ephraim nobody would dream of calling a boy quite so it was merely a nickname which we gave him in camp but it stuck to him with such burlike tenacity and is so inseparable from my memory of him that i do not think i could write definitely of john bladburn if i were to call him anything but quite so it was one night shortly after the first battle of bull run the army of the potomac shattered stunned and forlorn was back in its old quarters behind the earthworks the melancholy line of ambulances bearing our wounded to washington was not done creeping over long bridge the blue smocks and the gray still lay in windrows on the field of manassas and the gloom that weighed down our hearts was like the fog that stretched along the bosom of the potomac and enfolded the valley of the shenandoah a drizzling rain had set in at twilight and growing bolder with the darkness was beating a dismal tattoo on the tent the tent of mess company a th regiment n y volunteers our mess consisting originally of eight men was reduced to four little billy as one of the boys grimly remarked had concluded to remain at manassas corporal steele we had to leave at fairfax courthouse shot through the hip hunter and suydam we had said goodby to that afternoon tell johnny reb says hunter lifting up the leather sidepiece of the ambulance that i ll be back again as soon as i get a new leg but suydam said nothing he only unclosed his eyes languidly and smiled farewell to us the four of us who were left alive and unhurt that shameful july day sat gloomily smoking our brierwood pipes thinking our thoughts and listening to the rain pattering against the canvas that and the occasional whine of a hungry cur foraging on the outskirts of the camp for a stray bone alone broke the silence save when a vicious drop of rain detached itself meditatively from the ridgepole of the tent and fell upon the wick of our tallow candle making it cuss as ned strong described it the candle was in the midst of one of its most profane fits when blakely knocking the ashes from his pipe and addressing no one in particular but giving breath unconsciously as it were to the result of his cogitations observed that it was considerable of a fizzle the on to richmond business yes i wonder what they ll do about it over yonder said curtis pointing over his right shoulder by over yonder he meant the north in general and massachusetts especially curtis was a boston boy and his sense of locality was so strong that during all his wanderings in virginia i do not believe there was a moment day or night when he could not have made a beeline for faneuil hall do about it cried strong they ll make about two hundred thousand blue flannel trousers and send them along each pair with a man in it all the short men in the long trousers and all the tall men in the short ones he added ruefully contemplating his own leggear which scarcely reached to his ankles thats so said blakely just now when i was tackling the commissary for an extra candle i saw a crowd of new fellows drawing blankets i say there drop that cried strong all right sir didnt know it was you he added hastily seeing it was lieutenant haines who had thrown back the flap of the tent and let in a gust of wind and rain that threatened the most serious bronchial consequences to our discontented tallow dip you re to bunk in here said the lieutenant speaking to some one outside the some one stepped in and haines vanished in the darkness when strong had succeeded in restoring the candle to consciousness the light fell upon a tall shylooking man of about thirtyfive with long haycolored beard and mustache upon which the raindrops stood in clusters like the nightdew on patches of cobweb in a meadow it was an honest face with unworldly sort of blue eyes that looked out from under the broad visor of the infantry cap with a deferential glance towards us the newcomer unstrapped his knapsack spread his blanket over it and sat down unobtrusively rather damp night out remarked blakely whose strong hand was supposed to be conversation quite so replied the stranger not curtly but pleasantly and with an air as if he had said all there was to be said about it come from the north recently inquired blakely after a pause yes from any place in particular maine people considerably stirred up down there continued blakely determined not to give up quite so blakely threw a puzzled look over the tent and seeing ned strong on the broad grin frowned severely strong instantly assumed an abstracted air and began humming softly i wish i was in dixie the state of maine observed blakely with a certain defiance of manner not at all necessary in discussing a geographical question is a pleasant state in summer suggested the stranger in summer i mean returned blakely with animation thinking he had broken the ice cold as blazes in winter though isnt it the new recruit merely nodded blakely eyed the man homicidally for a moment and then smiling one of those smiles of simulated gayety which the novelists inform us are more tragic than tears turned upon him with withering irony trust you left the old folks pretty comfortable dead the old folks dead quite so blakely made a sudden dive for his blanket tucked it around him with painful precision and was heard no more just then the bugle sounded lights out bugle answering bugle in faroff camps when our not elaborate nighttoilets were complete strong threw somebody elses old boot at the candle with infallible aim and darkness took possession of the tent ned who lay on my left presently reached over to me and whispered i say our friend quite so is a garrulous old boy hell talk himself to death some of these odd times if he is nt careful how he did run on the next morning when i opened my eyes the new member of mess was sitting on his knapsack combing his blonde beard with a horn comb he nodded pleasantly to me and to each of the boys as they woke up one by one blakely did not appear disposed to renew the animated conversation of the previous night but while he was gone to make a requisition for what was in pure sarcasm called coffee curtis ventured to ask the man his name bladburn john was the reply thats rather an unwieldy name for everyday use put in strong if it would nt hurt your feelings i d like to call you quite so for short dont say no if you dont like it is it agreeable bladburn gave a little laugh all to himself seemingly and was about to say quite so when he caught at the words blushed like a girl and nodded a sunny assent to strong from that day until the end the sobriquet clung to him the disaster at bull bun was followed as the reader knows by a long period of masterly inactivity so far as the army of the potomac was concerned mcdowell a good soldier but unlucky retired to arlington heights and mcclellan who had distinguished himself in western virginia took command of the forces in front of washington and bent his energies to reorganizing the demoralized troops it was a dreary time to the people of the north who looked fatuously from week to week for the fall of richmond and it was a dreary time to the denizens of that vast city of tents and forts which stretched in a semicircle before the beleaguered capitol so tedious and soulwearing a time that the hardships of forced marches and the horrors of battle became desirable things to them rollcall morning and evening guardduty dressparades an occasional reconnoissance dominoes wrestlingmatches and such rude games as could be carried on in camp made up the sum of our lives the arrival of the mail with letters and papers from home was the event of the day we noticed that bladburn neither wrote nor received any letters when the rest of the boys were scribbling away for dear life with drumheads and knapsacks and crackerboxes for writingdesks he would sit serenely smoking his pipe but looking out on us through rings of smoke with a face expressive of the tenderest interest look here quite so strong would say the mailbag closes in half an hour aint you going to write i believe not today bladburn would reply as if he had written yesterday or would write tomorrow but he never wrote he had become a great favorite with us and with all the officers of the regiment he talked less than any man i ever knew but there was nothing sinister or sullen in his reticence it was sunshine warmth and brightness but no voice unassuming and modest to the verge of shyness he impressed every one as a man of singular pluck and nerve do you know said curtis to me one day that that fellow quite so is clear grit and when we come to close quarters with our palmetto brethren over yonder hell do something devilish what makes you think so well nothing quite explainable the exasperating coolness of the man as much as anything this morning the boys were teasing muffin fan a small mulatto girl who used to bring muffins into camp three times a week at the peril of her life and jemmy blunt of company k you know him was rather rough on the girl when quite so who had been reading under a tree shut one finger in his book walked over to where the boys were skylarking and with the smile of a juvenile angel on his face lifted jemmy out of that and set him down gently in front of his own tent there blunt sat speechless staring at quite so who was back again under the tree pegging away at his little latin grammar that latin grammar he always had it about him reading it or turning over its dogseared pages at odd intervals and in outoftheway places half a dozen times a day he would draw it out from the bosom of his blouse which had taken the shape of the book just over the left breast look at it as if to assure himself it was all right and then put the thing back at night the volume lay beneath his pillow the first thing in the morning before he was well awake his hand would go groping instinctively under his knapsack in search of it a devastating curiosity seized upon us boys concerning that latin grammar for we had discovered the nature of the book strong wanted to steal it one night but concluded not to in the first place reflected strong i havent the heart to do it and in the next place i have nt the moral courage quite so would placidly break every bone in my body and i believe strong was not far out of the way sometimes i was vexed with myself for allowing this tall simplehearted country fellow to puzzle me so much and yet was he a simplehearted country fellow city bred he certainly was not but his manner in spite of his awkwardness had an indescribable air of refinement now and then too he dropped a word or a phrase that showed his familiarity with unexpected lines of reading the other day said curtis with the slightest elevation of eyebrow he had the cheek to correct my latin for me in short quite so was a daily problem to the members of mess whenever he was absent and blakely and curtis and strong and i got together in the tent we discussed him evolving various theories to explain why he never wrote to anybody and why nobody ever wrote to him had the man committed some terrible crime and fled to the army to hide his guilt blakely suggested that he must have murdered the old folks what did he mean by eternally conning that tattered latin grammar and was his name bladburn anyhow even his imperturbable amiability became suspicious and then his frightful reticence if he was the victim of any deep grief or crushing calamity why did nt he seem unhappy what business had he to be cheerful its my opinion said strong that he s a rival wandering jew the original jacobs you know was a dark fellow blakely inferred from something bladburn had said or something he had not said which was more likely that he had been a schoolmaster at some period of his life schoolmaster be hanged was strongs comment can you fancy a schoolmaster going about conjugating baby verbs out of a dratted little spellingbook no quite so has evidently been a a blest if i can imagine what he s been whatever john bladburn had been he was a lonely man whenever i want a type of perfect human isolation i shall think of him as he was in those days moving remote selfcontained and alone in the midst of two hundred thousand men ii the indian summer with its infinite beauty and tenderness came like a reproach that year to virginia the foliage touched here and there with prismatic tints drooped motionless in the golden haze the delicate virginia creeper was almost minded to put forth its scarlet buds again no wonder the lovely phantom this dusky southern sister of the pale northern june lingered not long with us but filling the once peaceful glens and valleys with her pathos stole away rebukefully before the savage enginery of man the preparations that had been going on for months in arsenals and foundries at the north were nearly completed for weeks past the air had been filled with rumors of an advance but the rumor of today refuted the rumor of yesterday and the grand army did not move heintzelmans corps was constantly folding its tents like the arabs and as silently stealing away but somehow it was always in the same place the next morning one day at last orders came down for our brigade to move we re going to richmond boys shouted strong thrusting his head in at the tent and we all cheered and waved our caps like mad you see big bethel and bull run and balls bluff the bloody bs as we used to call them had nt taught us any better sense rising abruptly from the plateau to the left of our encampment was a tall hill covered with a stunted growth of redoak persimmon and chestnut the night before we struck tents i climbed up to the crest to take a parting look at a spectacle which custom had not been able to rob of its enchantment there at my feet and extending miles and miles away lay the camps of the grand army with its campfires reflected luridly against the sky thousands of lights were twinkling in every direction some nestling in the valley some like fireflies beating their wings and palpitating among the trees and others stretching in parallel lines and curves like the streetlamps of a city somewhere far off a band was playing at intervals it seemed and now and then nearer to a silvery strain from a bugle shot sharply up through the night and seemed to lose itself like a rocket among the stars the patient untroubled stars suddenly a hand was laid upon my arm i d like to say a word to you said bladburn with a little start of surprise i made room for him on the fallen tree where i was seated i may nt get another chance he said you and the boys have been very kind to me kinder than i deserve but sometimes i ve fancied that my not saying anything about myself had given you the idea that all was not right in my past i want to say that i came down to virginia with a clean record we never really doubted it bladburn if i did nt write home he continued it was because i had nt any home neither kith nor kin when i said the old folks were dead i said it am i boring you if i thought i was no bladburn i have often wanted you to talk to me about yourself not from idle curiosity i trust but because i liked you that rainy night when you came to camp and have gone on liking you ever since this is nt too much to say when heaven only knows how soon i may be past saying it or you listening to it thats it said bladburn hurriedly thats why i want to talk with you i ve a fancy that i sha nt come out of our first battle the words gave me a queer start for i had been trying several days to throw off a similar presentiment concerning him a foolish presentiment that grew out of a dream in case anything of that kind turns up he continued i d like you to have my latin grammar here you ve seen me reading it you might stick it away in a bookcase for the sake of old times it goes against me to think of it falling into rough hands or being kicked about camp and trampled underfoot he was drumming softly with his fingers on the volume in the bosom of his blouse i did nt intend to speak of this to a living soul he went on motioning me not to answer him but something took hold of me tonight and made me follow you up here perhaps if i told you all you would be the more willing to look after the little book in case it goes ill with me when the war broke out i was teaching school down in maine in the same village where my father was schoolmaster before me the old man when he died left me quite alone i lived pretty much by myself having no interests outside of the district school which seemed in a manner my personal property eight years ago last spring a new pupil was brought to the school a slight slip of a girl with a sad kind of face and quiet ways perhaps it was because she was nt very strong and perhaps because she was nt used over well by those who had charge of her or perhaps it was because my life was lonely that my heart warmed to the child it all seems like a dream now since that april morning when little mary stood in front of my desk with her pretty eyes looking down bashfully and her soft hair falling over her face one day i look up and six years have gone by as they go by in dreams and among the scholars is a tall girl of sixteen with serious womanly eyes which i cannot trust myself to look upon the old life has come to an end the child has become a woman and can teach the master now so help me heaven i did nt know that i loved her until that day long after the children had gone home i sat in the schoolroom with my face resting on my hands there was her desk the afternoon shadows falling across it it never looked empty and cheerless before i went and stood by the low chair as i had stood hundreds of times on the desk was a pile of books ready to be taken away and among the rest a small latin grammar which we had studied together what little despairs and triumphs and happy hours were associated with it i took it up curiously as if it were some gentle dead thing and turned over the pages and could hardly see them turning the pages idly so i came to a leaf on which something was written with ink in the familiar girlish hand it was only the words dear john through which she had drawn two hasty pencil lines i wish she had nt drawn those lines added bladburn under his breath he was silent for a minute or two looking off towards the camps where the lights were fading out one by one i had no right to go and love mary i was twice her age an awkward unsocial man that would have blighted her youth i was as wrong as wrong can be but i never meant to tell her i locked the grammar in my desk and the secret in my heart for a year i could nt bear to meet her in the village and kept away from every place where she was likely to be then she came to me and sat down at my feet penitently just as she used to do when she was a child and asked what she had done to anger me and then heaven forgive me i told her all and asked her if she could say with her lips the words she had written and she nestled in my arms all atrembling like a bird and said them over and over again when marys family heard of our engagement there was trouble they looked higher for mary than a middleaged schoolmaster no blame to them they forbade me the house her uncles but we met in the village and at the neighbors houses and i was happy knowing she loved me matters were in this state when the war came on i had a strong call to look after the old flag and i hung my head that day when the company raised in our village marched by the schoolhouse to the railroad station but i couldnt tear myself away about this time the ministers son who had been away to college came to the village he met mary here and there and they became great friends he was a likely fellow near her own age and it was natural they should like one another sometimes i winced at seeing him made free of the home from which i was shut out then i would open the grammar at the leaf where dear john was written up in the corner and my trouble was gone mary was sorrowful and pale these days and i think her people were worrying her it was one evening two or three days before we got the news of bull run i had gone down to the buryingground to trim the spruce hedge set round the old mans lot and was just stepping into the enclosure when i heard voices from the opposite side one was marys and the other i knew to be young marstons the ministers son i did nt mean to listen but what mary was saying struck me dumb we must never meet again she was saying in a wild way we must say goodby here for ever goodby goodby and i could hear her sobbing then presently she said hurriedly no no my hand not my lips then it seemed he kissed her hands and the two parted one going towards the parsonage and the other out by the gate near where i stood i dont know how long i stood there but the nightdews had wet me to the bone when i stole out of the graveyard and across the road to the schoolhouse i unlocked the door and took the latin grammar from the desk and hid it in my bosom there was not a sound or a light anywhere as i walked out of the village and now said bladburn rising suddenly from the treetrunk if the little book ever falls in your way wont you see that it comes to no harm for my sake and for the sake of the little woman who was true to me and did nt love me wherever she is tonight god bless her as we descended to camp with our arms resting on each others shoulder the watchfires were burning low in the valleys and along the hillsides and as far as the eye could reach the silent tents lay bleaching in the moonlight iii we imagined that the throwing forward of our brigade was the initial movement of a general advance of the army but that as the reader will remember did not take place until the following march the confederates had fallen back to centreville without firing a shot and the national troops were in possession of lewinsville vienna and fairfax courthouse our new position was nearly identical with that which we had occupied on the night previous to the battle of bull run on the old turnpike road to manassas where the enemy was supposed to be in great force with a fieldglass we could see the rebel pickets moving in a belt of woodland on our right and morning and evening we heard the spiteful roll of their snaredrums those pickets soon became a nuisance to us hardly a night passed but they fired upon our outposts so far with no harmful result but after a while it grew to be a serious matter the rebels would crawl out on allfours from the wood into a field covered with underbrush and lie there in the dark for hours waiting for a shot then our men took to the riflepits pits ten or twelve feet long by four or five deep with the loose earth banked up a few inches high on the exposed sides all the pits bore names more or less felicitous by which they were known to their transient tenants one was called the pepperbox another uncle sams well another the rebtrap and another i am constrained to say was named after a nottobementioned tropical locality though this rude sort of nomenclature predominated there was no lack of softer titles such as fortress matilda and castle mary and one had though unintentionally a literary flavor to it blairs grave which was not popularly considered as reflecting unpleasantly on nat blair who had assisted in making the excavation some of the regiment had discovered a field of late corn in the neighborhood and used to boil a few ears every day while it lasted for the boys detailed on the nightpicket the corncobs were always scrupulously preserved and mounted on the parapets of the pits whenever a rebel shot carried away one of these barbette guns there was swearing in that particular trench strong who was very sensitive to this kind of disaster was complaining bitterly one morning because he had lost three pieces the night before theres quite so now said strong when a minieball comes ping and knocks one of his guns to flinders he merely smiles and does nt at all see the degradation of the thing poor bladburn as i watched him day by day going about his duties in his shy cheery way with a smile for every one and not an extra word for anybody it was hard to believe he was the same man who that night before we broke camp by the potomac had poured out to me the story of his love and sorrow in words that burned in my memory while strong was speaking blakely lifted aside the flap of the tent and looked in on us boys quite so was hurt last night he said with a white tremor to his lip what shot on picket why he was in the pit next to mine cried strong badly hurt badly hurt i knew he was i need not have asked the question he never meant to go back to new england bladburn was lying on the stretcher in the hospitaltent the surgeon had knelt down by him and was carefully cutting away the bosom of his blouse the latin grammar stained and torn slipped and fell to the floor bladburn gave me a quick glance i picked up the book and as i placed it in his hand the icy fingers closed softly over mine he was sinking fast in a few minutes the surgeon finished his examination when he rose to his feet there were tears on the weatherbeaten cheeks he was a rough outside but a tender heart my poor lad he blurted out its no use if you ve anything to say say it now for you ve nearly done with this world then bladburn lifted his eyes slowly to the surgeon and the old smile flitted over his face as he murmured quite so
