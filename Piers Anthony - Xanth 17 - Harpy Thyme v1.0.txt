xanth harpy thyme piers anthony from the inside cover one could never be quite certain that a demon wasnt still around they walked on out of the demon realm there were no more odd events evidently the demon had gotten bored with them that was a relief the fungus along the marked route turned brownish the air became chill gloha closed her wings closely around her body insulating it with the feathers cynthia suffered less because she had more furry mass but she did take a jacket out of her backpack and put it on over her shirt to protect her maidenly human torso evidently she had never adopted the

flapped her feather wings until she was high above the harpy hutch the land of xanth spread obligingly out below her so that she could see all the way to its mediumfar corners there was lake ogrechobee with its ogre tribe on the shore and its toothy reptilian swimmers there was the great gap chasm with its horrendous sixlegged gap dragon there was all the monsterinfested jungle between them she loved all of it but she couldnt pause to appreciate the sights she had important business she had to go see the good magician so she could ask him a question with luck and a years service she might have his answer then maybe she would have her heaving little hearts desire she leveled off and flew swiftly toward the good magicians castle she knew exactly where it was but had never thought she would one day have to go there that was because she had just somehow assumed that her life would work out well on its own after the frustrations of childhood worked their way out of her system the moment she turned eighteen and became party to the adult conspiracy unfortunately when she actually became party she realized that she needed a male of her kindand she knew of none she was the only person of her new species in xanth that had become a problem so now she was off to the good magician humfrey and after doing her year of service for his answer she would be able to settle down with the man of her dreams and live happily forever and ever after and torment their children unmercifully by not letting them know the secret of stork summoning she was nineteen years old now and would be twenty then which would still leave her a faint bit of her youth for her true love to appreciate before they both became adult dullards the following year she was not so vain as to assume that she would be different from all the other adults who had ever existed it was too bad that life had to consist of the two problems of childhood and adulthood with only that brief window of romance wedged in between but that was the way it was she knew she had observed she was mostly humanoid and that was the way humanoids were she reached the region of the castle and paused in her flight there was a meanlooking vapor hovering over it that looked uncomfortably like cumulo fracto nimbus the worst of clouds but what would he be doing here he wouldnt dare harass the good magician reassured by that thought she resumed flight but the closer she got the larger the cloud loomed and the uglier it looked soon she realized that this wasnt merely the magic of perspective that changed things according to their distance that cloud was looming uglier on purpose it was fracto she flew lower to pass under the meanspirited blob but fracto extended his vapors downward to intercept her she tried to go around but he sent boiling fog out to the sides to cut her off his big amorphous mouth formed a gassy o ho ho ho it gusted this was a real nuisance gloha had never liked fracto and this encounter was making her emotion ripen into active detestation of all times for the blowhard to be in her way he must know where she was headed so was getting his flatulent jollies from interfering with her somehow he always seemed to know when something important was happening like a picnic and he always came to spoil it how was she going to get through to the good magicians castle she realized now that the evil cloud would stay here as long as she did just so he could ruin her mission she hovered in the air and waved her fine little fist at the big ugly cloud oh you make me so angry i could utter a bad word she exclaimed ho ho ho a twisty gust reached out to blow her skirt up over her head so that way too much of her lithe little legs was exposed now stop that she cried quickly pushing the skirt down she realized belatedly that she should have worn slacks on this trip but she had wanted to look dainty and feminine because she would probably meet one of the good magicians five and a half wives after she got through the challenges that would bar entry to the castle of course the good magician always had three challenges to discourage those who werent really serious about their quests for information he didnt like to be bothered frivolously then something clicked in her pretty little head the challenges this must be the first one the disreputable cloud must owe the good magician a debt and so was doing him a service it wasnt coincidence at all she had to figure out how to get past fracto that put an entirely different complexion on it her own comely little complexion relaxed all she had to do was figure out how to get past this messy old cloud and she would be a third of the way through there was always a way she just had to find it could she insult fracto and make him blow himself out that was the way grundy golem would do it but grundy had a mouth that was the envy of harpies he could spew out insults faster than they could gloha was half harpy because her father was hardy harpy so she should be able to spew out a stinking stream of invective but somehow she had never cared to acquire that ability her mother was glory goblin who was beautiful and good and gloha just preferred to emulate her if her brother harglo were here he could have let out an oath that burned a hole in the cloud but this was a challenge she had to handle by herself so steaming fracto was out avoiding him seemed to be out too because he was hovering right over the castle she had to reach by no accident what was left outsmarting him she just knew she was smarter than a creature whose brain was swirling vapor but how could she prove it this seemed to be a situation in which intellect didnt count for much all he had to do was sit there and wet on her if she tried to get through well maybe she would just have to get wet it wasnt as if she were made of spun sugar whatever impression she preferred to give others gloha set her firm little face in an earnest little expression and flew directly toward where she hoped the castle was on a level course fracto puffed up like a mottled wart he opened his sodden maw and breathed out a sickly gust of wind it surrounded her coating her true little tresses with smog and her winsome little wings with dirty ice foul air clogged her nice little nose and fuzzed her open little eyes suddenly she was flying blind and losing altitude she was in danger of crashing gloha sneezed the force of it shot her spinning back out of the foul air and she was able to blink her eyes clear she still had some altitude and was able to pull out of her tailspin she brought out her handsome little hankie and wiped her face fractos ugly puss was laughing and spitting out broken bits of wind and cloud that drifted in stenchy colors it seemed that she couldnt just try harder the awful cloud had too much ill wind well if she couldnt fly there she would walk there she was a goblin girl with harpy wings and though she had spent most of her time with winged monsters she was at home on the ground too fracto couldnt stop her from using her fast little feet she glided down to the ground before the evil cloud could work up another foul gust to blow her away she had hoped to find an enchanted path going there but saw none so her lovely little lady slippers touched down in an isolated glade and she began to walk there was an ordinary path that would serve she had noted its direction as she descended and was sure it would take her there she would simply have to watch out for hostile monsters and other ilk because they would be able to harass her on an unenchanted path fracto was furious he huffed and he puffed and he blew up such a storm that in two and a half moments snow was pelting down in the remaining half moment it was piling up so thickly that all trace of the path was gone oops how was she to find her way now she knew she would get lost in the trackless snow she couldnt even make her own tracks because the snow was covering them up just about as fast as she made them in addition it was cold her tight little tootsies were freezing she would have to take shelter until the storm blew over maybe she could find a blanket bush and hide under the blankets and the snow would cover her so that fracto wouldnt know where she was and would drift away at least she would be warm while she waited but she saw no blanket bushes and no pillow bushes this glade was singularly bereft of useful plants there was only a big snowball at the edge of the glade she certainly didnt need that but as her teeth began to chatter in an unladylike manner her mind squeezed out an odd thought what was a giant snowball doing here the snow had just started and it was covering the ground with a level layer it couldnt form itself into a snowball was there an invisible giant doing it but there was no depression where the snow would have been taken from and there was no smell of giant that snowballthats no ball she muttered making temporary tracks toward it then she realized that she had made a pun that snowball had become thats no ball spoken the same way and that gave her the cue she marched up to the ball and touched it her hands passed through its seeming surface she stepped forward and found herself within the entrance to a tunnel it looked like a snowball from outside but it was warm and dry inside this was the way past fractos storm all she had had to do was figure out the secret and she was on her way her mild little mind had prevailed over the clouds fury and she had mastered the first challenge but there would be two more and they wouldnt be any easier than the first she had gotten through as much by luck as by wit and might have used up her supply of both should she give up her quest but then she would never find her perfect mate and true love and would have to endure unhappily forever and ever alone which was a fate worse than marriage she wasnt ready to face that dreary prospect after all she had so much to offer the right man she hoped she glanced down at her fancy little figure just to be sure so she proceeded resolutely down the passage she would at least make an efficient little effort and if she failed then she would go somewhere and cry the passage opened out into a goodsized lighted cave along the sides were darkened alcoves and at the far end was a monster uhohshe suspected that the next challenge was upon her instead of a cantankerous cloud she would have to get by an aggressive animal but there had to be a way to do it without getting eaten she merely had to figure out that way again somehow maybe if she proceeded very carefully it would happen so she took a tour of the chamber looking in the alcoves this turned out to be a slightly baffling tour the first alcove held a fat bird with a beautiful fanshaped tail gloha cudgeled her balky little brain and managed to remember news of a bird like this perhaps confined to mundania it was a turkey she looked at it and it looked at her and that was it the bird wasnt confined but didnt seem inclined to depart its alcove it was just there you certainly are a beautiful bird gloha said politely the turkey gobbled appreciatively she moved on to the next alcove there was a rather unprepossessing young human man because he was human he was about twice as tall as she was goblins were twice as tall as elves and half as tall as humans she wasnt sure how either other species could stand being so pitifully small or so dangerously large but it wouldnt be polite to call attention to such failings so she didnt i say can you talk she asked the youth who seemed to be no older than she was though it was hard to tell with humans sure the youth replied what is your name mine is gloha sam he did not seem to be much for conversation what are you doing here sam if i may ask im part of your challenge that was certainly direct and what is your role in this challenge im a flunky a flunky i dont think i know that position he didnt respond she realized that he merely answered questions and as briefly as possible naturally the challenge creatures didnt volunteer much information what does a flunky do she asked then she was afraid he would just say that he flunked but sam did give a meaningful response fortunately he does stupid errands for other folk what errand will you do for me none so much for that that time she might almost have preferred a less straight answer she moved on the next alcove held a tub of dirty water that didnt seem to be of much interest so she went to the following one that alcove held a large fourfooted animal like a unicorn without a horn with long ears hello creature she said heehaw it brayed back that gave her the cue it was a mundane donkey the next alcove held a sort of springlike metal thing sitting on a step there were several steps but it wasnt using them but when she came to stand before it it leaned over and its top end toppled to land on the next step below the rest of it followed smoothly making a turn from the upper pile of itself to the lower pile until all of it was down immediately it bent again and started sinuously transferring itself to the next step when it reached the bottom of the little stairway it stopped that was all the next alcove held a vaguely humanoid creature with a most versatile tail it jumped from bar to bar swinging with its hands feet or tail it moved very cleverly never missing a bar never falling it chittered at her from its furry face she pondered and realized that this was another odd creature a monkey so it went each alcove held a creature or thing they were all part of her challenge but how did they relate she could see nothing similar about them this was like a little zoo with assorted displays at the far end was the monster it stood taller than she was on all fours with a huge powerful foresection and a rather small hind section it was in no alcove it was in the exit from the chamber she realized that she had to get by it but the moment she approached it it rose up and snarled with such ferocity that she had to step quickly back it wasnt confined or chained but it didnt pursue her she realized that this was the one she would have to deal with so she stiffened her knocking little knees and came to stand just beyond the monsters snarl range if i may inquire she said in her most timidly civil little voice what are you the monster eyed her appraisingly he licked his formidable chops hi i am the yena she said gloha blinked she had drought the monster was male she looked again trying not to blush because of the impolite nature of the act and saw that it was indeed male she must have misheard the yena thats what i said goblin girl she replied gloha looked yet again the monster was female how could she have thought otherwise thank you she said faintly youre welcome you tasty little tart he said gloha found herself getting confused and embarrassed once she had passed the magical age of eighteen she had sought information about the secrets hidden by the dread adult conspiracy and had been somewhat disappointed when she learned their nature she had almost wished she hadnt bothered but she had gotten it straight she thought now she wasnt sure how could she be sure when the creatures unmentionable region kept changing when it might not be exactly the way a male goblins region would be not that she had ever seen such a region anyway of course the creatures voice was changing too being now gruff and then dulcet what a confusing situation youyou must be part of my challenge she said after a moment iim supposed to get past you so i can go on to the next and if you fail to find the key i will get to crunch up your bonnie little bones the yena agreed gloha had been afraid of that but now irrelevantly she realized that there was something odd about the creatures mane it was severely knotted in fact it seemed to be twisted with balls of metal she pondered and decided that it was better to inquire than to ignore your mane she started after a pale little pause would you tell me why it has metal in it the yena smiled showing his distressingly big sharp teeth ah you are admiring my locks she said urn yes they areunusual indeed he agreed id give anything to be able to comb them out but each one is locked in place gloha picked up on a subtlety there was something the yena wanted anything she asked hesitantly he considered well anything within my power of course im not exactly a wealthy monster eveneven letting a minor little morsel get through without being eaten she peered closely at gloha youre catching on morsel he agreed but of course you would have to deliver gloha realized that she had found only half the key to mis riddle she had to find a way to comb out the yenas locks but what could that be they were solidly metal and surely would not respond to her cute little comb yet somewhere in this chamber must be the answer because that was the way it was with challenged everyone knew that what everyone didnt know was how to get safely through a particular challenge that tended to discourage querents from bothering the good magician which was of course the point humfrey didnt like to be bothered by folk who werent serious his time seemed to be impossibly precious so he prevented it from being wasted she gazed around the chamber what would comb out a metal lock surely not a donkey or a turkey the flunky she didnt see how the metal would still be too hard to abolish the same went for the monkey and how that murky water could help was beyond her water made iron rust which would be worse than ever because it would make the locks impossible to work something began to percolate through her meticulous little mind these things herethere was something similar about them they were all keys donkey monkeyseven the murkey water and a key should do for a lock to unlock it one of these keys must unlock yenas locks but which one and how would it work she couldnt bring the donkey to comb yenas locks it just wouldnt work there was something she still hadnt figured out she didnt want to make a mistake because that would get her eaten which she probably wouldnt enjoy she went back to look at yena now she saw that each lock of the monsters mane was different some were big padlocks others were little keyhole locks some were several types togethercombination locksand one was weird what lock is that she inquired pointing yena craned her head about to look that is the lock ness he said it is a monster indeed it was it was a huge tangle of serpentine cables of metal knotted into a lock that seemed impossible ever to unlock i suppose that if you could unlock that one the others would be easy gloha said surely so but if anyone tried to unlock it and failed making it even worse i would be most annoyed id probably have to pulverize that person gloha had suspected as much she returned to the alcove exhibits one of these had to be the key to that awful lockif she could only figure it out if she guessed wrong she was doomed she looked at the donkey she just didnt see how its hooves could do anything as intricate as unlocking a lock the same went for the turkeys claws the flunkey was a man who might have the necessary dexterity but he had no tools to work on that horrendous lock ness in fact none of these creatures and things seemed like likely prospects maybe she had not yet fathomed the proper pun which of these keys was punnishly designed to open such a lock not the don tur flun mon mur orwhat was that slinky spring that marched down the steps called the question brought the answer it was a slinkey that was no good either then another theatrical little thought percolated through her petite little perception slinkythat was the way the yena would like to have hisher locks all combed out and slinky smooth and the slinkey was metal showing that metal could be prettily flowing so maybe it could lend its attributes to the metal lock messuh nessand make it similarly smooth she wasnt at all sure that her reasoning was right but since everything else seemed wrong she gathered up her cornered little courage and made her move she reached into the alcove and picked up the slinkey it flexed iridescently in her hands but did not protest she carried it to the yena i think maybe this slinkey will smooth out your lock ness she said with an adorable little adlib the yena swelled up hugely oh you do do you he inquired ominously are you sure she added iim not ssure she confessed in a dainty little dither but it sseems the best chance remember ill chomp you if it doesnt work yyes i realize that she said shaking but i must try it well then whats keeping you nnnothing she said with a successful little stutter she lifted the slinkey and put it to the lock ness the tangled cables twisted like snakes they slithered around and through each other forming a pattern like that of the slinkey then they flowed down and became slinky smooth exactly as she had hoped after that all the other locks smoothed out similarly making the fearsome yena look positively handsome or beautiful as the case might be the entire hide glistened like polished water showing her real little reflection gloha almost went into a sweet little swoon well you did it the yena said standing aside you may pass on to the next challenge gloha stiffened her nice little knees and prepared to walk on im just glad i got the right key oh there was no danger of getting the wrong one no danger you mean you were only bluffing about chomping me no i wasnt bluffing about that but any of the keys would have worked she was aghast any but then wheres the challenge it was a challenge of courage just as the first was a challenge of nature you rose to it so you pass courage but i was terrified thats the nature of courage to do what you have to do without yielding to fear every sensible person feels fear on occasion but only cowards let it govern them i never realized well it wouldnt have been as good a challenge if you had the yena said sensibly i wonder what the third challenge will test gloha said musingly understanding of course the yena curled up and went into a snooze his tail twitching contentedly across her fur gloha walked down the passage she hardly cared to admit it but her understanding had already been strained to the limit of her broadened little brain she wasnt at all sure she could evoke any more understanding than she had already but what was there to do but go on the passage was getting warmer in fact it was getting hot gloha would have removed her bright little blouse but that would have been unseemly certainly she couldnt take off her snug little skirt so she spread her wings a bit and waved them slightly making a delicate little draft to cool herself this was certainly a change from fractos blizzard outside the heat increased the floor got so hot that her sunny little sandals started smoking she had to practically dance to stop her feet from getting burned inside them even so she was soon surrounded by smoke then she spied a water fountain by the side of the hall she skipped to it and touched its magic button a fortunate little fountain of chill water spouted and she put her longing little lips to it and drank deeply that cooled her and the smoke dissipated what a relief she proceeded on down the hall no longer bothered by the heat now she didnt have to jump and flap her wings to cool her feet but she was so glad to be safely by that region that she jumped anyway dancing along this hall was large enough so that she could stay in the air longer than a regular jump by flapping her wings she couldnt actually fly here but at least it made walking fun this was more like a frolic all too soon she knew it would get serious so she enjoyed herself while she had the chance the passage widened into another chamber in the center was a small plant she couldnt make out its details but appreciated its presence plants always improved places especially if they had nice flowers she walked toward the plant but something funny occurred she seemed to be slowing though she was walking at the same pace as before she just was making slower progress realizing that this could be a problem she hurried but though she ran she still moved more slowly she saw now that her lazy little limbs were not going at therate she thought she was running but they were molasses slow she jumped and she rose slowly into the air then slowly fell something was definitely amiss she felt fine but she wasnt getting anywhere what could account for this what else but the challenge it was upon her and she had to figure it out the yena had said it would be a challenge of understanding so she would have to understand she had a bright little bit of feminine intuition she lifted her purse and let it go it fell slowly toward the floor so slowly it would take several times as long as it should to get there she reached for it but her hand moved almost as slowly as it did making it hard to catch meanwhile she herself was still in the air from her slow jump she paused she settled slowly to the floor and looked at the plant now she recognized it thyme the herb that affected time that was why she was slowing she was in its field of effect she would have to figure out how to get around it that was indeed a challenge she really did not know much about thyme except that the closer a person got to it the more powerful was its effect so if its effect was to slow her down she needed to get away from it because by the time she reached it she would be moving at no speed at all but now she saw that there was no way out of the chamber except the passage on the far sidebeyond the plant she would not be able to reach that passage without going closer to the plant than she was now that would take literally almost forever there was certainly plenty to understand how could she pass a plant she couldnt pass in her lifetime well the first thing she had to do was back off so as to be able to operate at normal velocity she was afraid she was even thinking slowly at the moment in fact it might be a longer moment than it seemed she backed away slowly her feet moved and her body nudged backward like a small river barge but as it moved it gained speed and soon she was back to normal she stopped at the edge of the chamber she knew it was pointless to go back up the passage she had come down because that didnt lead to the good magicians castle she had to go forwardpast the plant somehow there had to be a way that faith had gotten her through the first two challenges there must be something here that she just had to understand as before she looked around now she spied seven glass cups on the floor at the edge of the chamber each was on its own builtin pedestal or maybe it was just a twoway container the same either way up so that it looked like an hourglass they seemed to contain assorted seeds each was labeled one said sec and the next said min and the next hr farther along one said dy and another wk then mnth and finally yr what could they be she started to reach into the first cup to take up some of the seeds and see what kind they were but she hesitated because she didnt yet understand the nature of either cups or seeds and if understanding would enable her to get safely through a lack of understanding might wash her out in a hurry she should figure out the meanings of the labels before she took any action another thought percolated through her meandering little mind a thyme planthourglass cupsthese must be the seeds of thyme of time some of them might enable her to pass the mother plant if she just figured out the right ones and how to use them now the labels started making sense secthat would stand for second the briefest measure of time min would be minute and so on through hour day week month and year the sec seeds were tiny while the others were respectively larger until the year seed was so big that just one of it filled the cup what would happen if she lifted out that huge year seed since the thyme plant itself slowed her down that would probably speed her up and a year would pass in maybe an instant that wouldnt do her much good but if she took a second that would hardly be worth it because even an ordinary second passed pretty quickly which kind of seed could she use and how could she use it she decided that if she took some seeds and walked toward the thyme plant they should cancel out the slow effect and enable her to maintain her speed so she could get through on something like a normal schedule if the seeds worked the way she was guessing they did she returned to the sec glass and picked up one seed the chamber blinked and the seed was gone what had happened she thought about it and decided that the blink had been time jumping forward one second she was now one second ahead of herself as it were she tried her pursedropping trick again but this time as she let it go she scooped several sees from the cup there was a triple blink and suddenly the purse was on the floor much faster than it should have been now she was sure to touch a seed of thyme was to feel its effect which was opposite to that of the thyme plant but how could she use any of these seeds she needed to get them to the slow vicinity of the plant before touching them she couldnt keep dashing back to the cup for more silly me she exclaimed as a dim bulb flashed just over her honeyed little head she picked up the sec cup itself seconds were all she cared to use they were more manageable and she could use them in handfuls if she had to she carried the seconds glass as far as she could before the slowdown was bothersome then she picked out one sec this time there was no blink instead she speeded up for an instant the seed had canceled out a moment of the thymes slowdown it was working she moved ahead dipping out more sees her progress was somewhat jerky being either fast or slow but mat was to be expected she had to use two seeds at a time as she got near the plant and then three when she was closest to it she had a small handful of sees at a time she didnt want to use them all up before she completed her journey across the chamber but once she was beyond it she was able to get by with fewer sees and finally she made it to the far hall and she still had some sees left that was a relief she set down the cup and started down the hall she had made it through the third challenge but as she turned a corner she came up to a broad desk set to block it a woman sat behind the desk writing on a pad of paper gloha stopped surprised who are you she inquired i am the sb the woman replied pointing to a nameplate that said sb im here to handle the sin tax syntax you must be a writer sin tax the woman repeated sintax youmust pay i am the sin bursar its my business to see that you pay but i havent sinned gloha protested innocently you were smoking drinking gamboling and having sees sb said evenly those are all taxable smoking but my shoes were burning up and it was just one drink of water i took to cool off and then i was so happy to be cool again that i did dance a little but i never thought she paused what was that last you had most of the seconds available you used them up now you have to pay the tax gloha realized that she was stuck for it ignorance was no excuse whether a person stuck her finger in a beehive or used the contents of a seed cup how do i pay the tax sb toted up the total on her pad thats four counts you will have to perform four tasks you will have to wash her dry her sock her and box her washer dryer soccer and boxer gloha repeated baffled i dont but she stopped herself before saying understand after all she had to understand in order to get through this challenge which she now realized wasnt yet done could you explain that a bit more sb touched a button on her desk a panel in the wall opened beyond it gloha saw a strange yet rather nice creature it had the head and front legs of a horse and the hind section of a winged dragon so it was a winged monster and therefore a creature gloha could relate to as she was a winged monster herself there is the glyph clean her up and pack her for shipment sb said and returned to her writing gloha entered the glyphs pen now she saw that the poor creature was quite dirty her wing feathers were soiled her fur was grimy her scales did not glisten and her hooves were caked with mud the poor creature needed attention gloha would have been glad to help her even if it wasnt to pay the sin tax there was a trough and bucket beside the stall and brushes too gloha dipped the bucket full of water and approached the glyph the creature shied nervously away from her hey take it easy glyph gloha said soothingly you dont have to be afraid of me see im a winged monster too she spread her wings and pumped them a couple of times the glyph settled down gloha washed her getting the fur and scales and hooves clean so that they glistened and shone as they should then she brushed off the wings so that the feathers turned light and bright she fetched towels and dried her but she wasnt sure how to sock her she wasnt about to hit this nice creature then she saw a plant with odd dangly foliage it looked like a blanket bush only smaller she brought it to the glyph and the plant immediately reached around the glyphs feet and legs tendrils stretched material in a moment and a half both legs had socks the socks sank in and seemed just like nice black fur decorating the legs from the knees down now it was time to box her gloha saw wood panels to the side of the stall she could use these to make a big enough box around the animal she went to fetch the first panel but as she put her hands on it she paused something was nagging her she turned the glyph was looking at her their gazes met she had reassured the animal and now the glyph trusted her but gloha didnt trust the situation she left the panel and returned to the hall why does she need to be boxed she demanded sb looked up from her writing pad its on the bill of lading one boxed glyph thats not good enough why does she have to be boxed when shes tame why cant she just be led to where shes going its cruel to put an animal in a box sb checked her pad shes going to be a sculpted figure on a fancy building she has to be crated for shipping i dont understand gloha said using the word she had tried to avoid but she was upset it was too late to take it back anyway why dont you this glyph is a fine sensitive animal shes been badly treated before she should never have been left so dirty boxing her will be more bad treatment i will never understand why that should be what never sb asked no never what never sb repeated gloha hesitated she knew she was throwing away her chance to pass the third challenge and get in to see the good magician but she liked the glyph and couldnt bear to see the creature mistreated who wanted to be stuck on a building anyway no never she said in a tone that was neither cut nor little then you must share her fate sb said go mount her you mean ride her im sure shes a fine steed but whats the point if shes not going anywhere wherever she is going or not going you will go or not go too thats the rule im here to enforce the rule a realistic little realization came to gloha youre doing your service for the good magician of course thats the rule what was your question if i may ask i asked him how i could be a writer he said i should work on my syntax only it turned out to be the sin tax im confined to this desk for this boring job but i must say it concentrates the imagination beautifully i have written several chapters of my novel between taxes so youre getting to be a writer after all gloha said while youre doing your service yes i think ill have a chapter about a crossbreed winged goblin girl and her friendship for a crossbreed winged animal do you think my readers will like that i hope so it seems interesting to me now go ride the glyph it was evident that sbs affability did not extend to neglecting her duty gloha didnt argue she was satisfied to share the glyphs fate if she couldnt improve the animals lot she went to the stall and climbed on the glyphs back between the wings im sorry i couldnt save you she said patting the neck under the nowbeautiful mane but i just couldnt box you no matter what the ceiling disappeared open sky appeared the glyph spread her giant wings and launched into the air she was through the hole in the roof and into the sky almost before gloha knew it butbut youre free gloha said amazed the glyph neighed happily gloha could have let go and flown herself but preferred to stay with her new friend where were they going a castle came into sight below the glyph angled down toward it there was a nice solid flat roof with a pile of hay on it the glyph landed on this but where are we gloha asked not yet over her amazement the good magicians castle of course a voice answered gloha saw a pretty young woman standing by a stair leading up to the roof but i shouldnt be here she protested i messed up on the third challenge oh i dont think so the woman said coming forward i am wira the good magicians daughterinlaw i came here to lead you to him im gloha gloha said disgruntled ii told the sb woman i didnt understand and it was a challenge of understanding so she said i would share the glyphs fate and she broke off realizing that something else was odd wira was petting the glyph the glyph was nuzzling her face it was evident that the two knew each other wira brought out a sugar cube and the glyph ate it then wira petted the animal again and stepped away come on in she said to gloha the challenge of understandingit wasnt about riddles or directions gloha said it was about decency the girl smiled of course gloha joined her and they walked to the stairs the glyph began eating the hay contentedly second son the interior of the castle was pleasant and surprisingly light considering the thickness of its walls probably magic accounted for that after all humfrey was the magician of information so he would know how to have a nice residence wira led her to the kitchen where a woman was seated at a table facing away from them mother put on your veil if you havent already wira said thats all right dear i heard you coming the woman said she turned and her face was covered by a full thick veil tiny serpents framed the region of her face they seemed to be in lieu of hair the effect was fairly attractive they were pretty little snakes this is the gorgon wira said to gloha then to the other this is gloha who just passed the challenges she has come to see father gloha was amazed anew she knew of the gorgon of course but hadnt expected to meet her the womans mere glance could turn a person to stone that was why she was veiled she was magician humfreys fifth but perhaps not quite final wife it was a complicated situation but what was also confusing gloha was an oddness about wira suddenly she remembered wira was blind she had moved around the castle with such assurance that gloha hadnt been reminded so wira alone of people had no fear of the gorgons gaze because it was mostly the sight of the gorgons face that petrified others it was for glohas safety that wira had reminded the gorgon about the veil so nice to meet you dear the gorgon said politely the good magician is ready to see you now she returned to her business which seemed to be the slow petrifying of a wedge of cheese gorgonzola of course gloha had heard that it was one of her specialties because she merely had to stare at it long enough now it occurred to gloha that the cheese must be able to see at least a little in order to be affected by the gorgons stare one never could tell what things could do she knew that when king dor was around inanimate things were highly responsive if a girl stepped over a stone the stone might make a remark about her legs and possibly even blab the color of her panties to her great embarrassment so maybe it did make sense that cheese could see wira led the way to another winding stairway it was so gloomy dark that gloha hesitated for fear of misstepping oh im sorry wira said contritely i forgot that you are sighted she moved a hand and the walls glowed showing the stairs thank you gloha said i normally dont use stairs anyway the harpy hive doesnt have them oh it must be fun to fly wira said of course i would never have been able to do it even when i was young when you were young the woman was twice glohas height because she was full human but she looked no older than gloha herself when i was a child i mean im technically fortyone but ive been awake for only nineteen years so the good magician used youth elixir to youthen me back to my subjective age so i think of myself as nineteen and i am physically but my youth was a long time ago you slept for twentytwo years one amazement was piling on another yes my family couldnt afford to keep me because i wasnt very useful so they had me put to sleep when i was sixteen then i met hugo in the dream realm and he was sixteen too and we knew each other for ten years asleep then we all woke together when magician humfrey returned here and got our ages set and started living normally for the past three years the good magician likes to keep his age at about a hundred though hes really a hundred and sixty the same as his half wife mareann shes physically a hundred too wira laughed oh no she prefers to be somewhat younger she says that now that shes lost her innocence she might as well be of an age to get some fun from life it seems that old women arent as appealing as old men and of course they cant afford to get worn or dirty she wont say how old she is now life certainly seems complicated here gloha said not sure she would be able to keep all these ages straight even if some werent known oh no life is pleasantly simple here wira demurred its only the background that is complicated just forget it and youll have no trouble that seemed like good advice they reached a small chamber buried somewhere in the deep interior of the castle it was filled to overflowing with books scrolls and stoppered little bottles in the midst of it was an ancient gnomelike little man hardly larger than gloha herself good magician here is gloha wira said to ask her question the gnome pulled his gaze from his tome with such difficulty that gloha almost thought she heard a tearing sound go see my second son he said grumpily his gaze plopped back to the tome but i havent even asked my question gloha protested wira nudged her its better not to try to argue with him he doesnt pay attention but i came all this way and went through all those challenges and i want to get what i came for please dont annoy him wira guided her away with such concern that gloha had to go with her hes already grumpy enough but when they were safely away from the magician gloha voiced her protest more firmly i dont think its fair to make me go through all the challenges to get here and not even let me ask my question whats the matter with him the good magician always has good reason for whatever he does we just dont always understand it when mela merwoman okra ogress and ida human came two years ago with their questions he listened to them and refused to answer them mela was so annoyed she threatened to show him her panty and freak him out but later they learned that their answers would have been a lot less satisfying if he had given them then because there were other things they had to do first i dont understand well for example mela wanted to know how to find a good husband he told her to ask nada naga that didnt make any sense to her but when she asked nada nada sent her to her brother naldo who was then xanths most eligible bachelor prince and he married mela because he saw her freakout panties which he wouldnt have seen if there hadnt been complications on the way so she might have lost him if the good magician had told her to go after him gloha said i see the point and maybe my case is similar because im looking for a good husband too but my problem is worse because i fear there is no male harpygoblin crossbreed for me certainly the magicians second son isnt one she paused suffering another unpleasant thought in fact he only has one son doesnt he hugo whom you married wira was surprised oh i hadnt thought of that im sure he hasnt had any more children since hugo one of the wives would have mentioned it then she brightened but he does have five and a half wives and maybe some of them had children before he went to hell so hugo may not be the first son suppose hes the second then you can ask him i can quickly find him for you you can like mis wira paused then whispered hugo dear there was a scrambling on the stairway a disheveled young human man appeared you called dear isnt love wonderful wira asked gloha im so glad i met him then to hugo father told gloha to see his second son is that you i dont think so hugo said uncertainly father had several children before me i think so i must be the third or fourth but im not sure do you know where i can find a good husband gloha asked preferably a flying goblin about my age hugo shook his head i dont think there are any other flying goblins the goblins and harpies were at war for a thousand years or so before your parents got together so i dont mink any of them youknow he had to stop because he was starting to blush hes so sweet wira murmured sometimes i wonder whether he ever really joined the adult conspiracy she winked to indicate mat she wasnt quite serious then again to him do you have any idea who would know about all humfreys sons maybe lacuna she recorded his whole history yes thats a good idea wira agreed and hugo smiled with pleasure at the compliment gloha had to agree love was wonderful if only she could find it for herself meanwhile they went downstairs to see if the gorgon knew i should think that would be the business of his prior wives she remarked they will all show up here in due course she considered briefly and a wisp of smoke rose from the spot on the cheese where her masked gaze rested too long i believe dara had a son however who hugo asked dara demoness his first wife oh you mean dana demoness wira said no i mean dara do you think i dont know her name after meeting her in hell but humfrey calls her dana humfrey never did pay much attention to details she never bothered to correct him for fear hed be grumpy names arent as important to demons as they are to us i dont think i can wait five months to check with all the other wives gloha said im getting constantly older and my young little youth is fleeting the gorgon laughed believe me dear your youth will last long enough if you keep your fine little figure do you really think so gloha asked beginning to hope assuredly you can keep your youth for several years merely by hiding your blase little birthdays from men all smart women know this and hide your intelligence too wira added i never knew about such things gloha said impressed which is part of your charm dear maybe you should go home wira suggested and ill ask the wives as they appear then ill send you a message when we learn who his second son was thank you gloha said gratefully she realized that this was her best and only chance to pursue her quest the gorgon served them a snack of funny punwheel cookies and candystriped milk to fortify gloha for her flight home the gorgon seemed slightly uncomfortableher ringlet snakes were panting the castle was warm and it looked hot under the thick veil if i may ask gloha inquired with a halting little hesitation by all means dear the gorgon said wiping her brow we arent as fussy about questions as the good magician is why dont you get some vanishing cream from the good magician to make your face invisible i did that once but it was awkward going about faceless so i still had to wear a veil and then mask it with the illusion of your face gloha finished so that you would look just like you snakelets and all but wouldnt stone anyone the gorgon paused her veil flexing into an attitude of astonishment why i believe that would do it when im xanthside she said then i could have the spells nullified when i returned to my job as a horror actress in the dream realm thank you dear i shall see humfrey about it immediately she got up and headed for the stairway hes grumpy today wira called warningly he wouldnt dare grump at me the gorgon replied not until after he provides those spells wira giggled and gloha joined her if there was one person who wasnt intimidated by the good magician it was the gorgon and not merely because she was his wife they finished the cookies and milk then wira opened a window and gloha bid her adieu spread her wings and took off do visit again sometime wira called after her there wont be any challenges if you dont come with a question maybe i will gloha called back it had been nice visiting with a young woman her own age then she mounted up up into the sky flying for home it was good to be airborne again but in a moment she suffered a change of mind that was one of the privileges of being feminine she had been for a while at the happy hive it was time to visit her goblin relatives which included her mother glory goblin so she changed course and headed for the gap chasm where the gap goblins lived soon she was there that was just as well because the day was getting tired and the sun seemed hardly able to keep itself in the sky any moment it would singe the trees to the west and dunk itself in the ocean and go out leaving xanth in darkness she glided over the gloomy deep chasm and down to the village perched at its brink the goblins didnt worry about falling into the chasm if one did well there were plenty more goblins who didnt in a moment she was hugging her mother who was still one of the prettiest of goblin women despite being an ancient thirtyseven years old then gloha explained about how she had gone to see the good magician humfrey and failed to get a good answer to her question but the good magician always knows what hes doing glory said i remember when your aunt goldy met the ogre who was doing his service for his answer that was a funny thingthe ogre was so stupid that he had forgotten the question by the time he reached the castle but he did the service anyway his service was to protect the half nymph tandy and by the time he was done with that he married her and was happy and that was his answer and along the way goldy got her magic wand and found a husband of her own all because of her association with the ogre and she was the mother of cousin godiva goblin gloha agreed having heard the story before and grandmother of gwenny goblin whos only three years younger than me and has already had adventures galore and become the first lady goblin chief and im not even married yet she finished in a wail well youre special dear her mother reminded her the only one of my land how can i ever find a suitable man maybe humfreys second son will know and maybe he wont and maybe it will take five more months to find out who the second son is and ill be pushing ttwenty for now she was suffering a delicate little doubt about the efficacy of extending youth by hiding birthdays suppose it didnt work shed be sadly stuck glory saw how serious the matter was maybe your aunt goldy will have a notion why dont you go ask her thanks i will gloha spread her wings i didnt mean right this instant dont you want to stay and see your grandfather gorbage not if i can avoid it glory nodded understandingly goblin men just werent the most pleasant folk however she had a more persuasive point are you sure you want to fly in the night when the other winged monsters might not recognize you gloha folded her wings maybe i will visit with you tonight she decided its the family way how nice of you dear mothers had a special talent for getting their way but in the morning before her grandfather could show up gloha gobbled her breakfast and bid her mother a modestly tearful parting there were forms to be followed after all gloha took off and flew north toward goblin mountain where her aunt goldy lived it was nice to have an excuse to visit there now that her cousinonceremoved gwenny was chiefess if only the other goblin tribes could be governed by women too then the whole of goblindom would be so much nicer but anything like that was a long way away if ever the sun had dried itself off and recovered enough strength to climb the eastern sky gloha had never been quite certain how it managed to find its way to the east after drowning in the water to the west but assumed that there was some kind of magic to handle it because the suns course was fairly reliable the clouds which had gotten somewhat damp and drippy in the night were drying off and turning white and fluffy again there was no sign of fracto fortunately she passed the region of the flies and the dragons and the elves until she spied goblin mountain or was it she hadnt been there in months and what she saw below was distinctly odd odds goblins she murmured instead of a structure resembling an enormous anthill with the pox she saw a prettily tiered network of gardens with flowers that couldnt be it then she remembered the male goblins no longer governed goblin mountain a female was in charge so flower gardens made sense reassured she dropped down toward it as she got close she saw more detail the flowers grew in patches of color and the color spelled peace that was gwennys work all right she landed by a prettily manicured front gate there was a goblin guard neatly uniformed he snapped to attention as she approached a courteous greeting lady gloha he said politely whom do you wish to see gloha was taken aback what was the matter with this goblin he should have greeted her with an insult or a threat or at least a sexist innuendo that was the way male goblins were it was expected she didnt trust this then the goblin flashed a surreptitious scowl dont look so surprised wingback this isnt my idea at least i got half a look up under your sexy little skirt as you came down gloha smiled as she smoothed down her skirt so this was just a veneer over normalcy goblin nature had not been repealed i want to see goldy very good he turned to his talktube gloha to see goldy presently then he turned to gloha get your galoshes going goodygams gloha nodded appreciating the goblinstyle compliment she walked on into the tunnel soon she found aunt goldys apartment she knocked on the portal it opened there stood the gobliness even ancienter than glory because she was ten years older but she looked better than she had probably because she now had more status than before all females did why how nice to see you dear she said giving gloha a hug do come in the apartment was nicely finished with flowers and pleasant pictures all around gloha sat gracefully on a cushion resting her gams uh limbs and especially her wings i went to see the good magician about a husband and he told me to see his second son but i dont know who that is mother thought you might know aunt goldy pondered i remember when i traveled with the ogrehis girl tandythere was something about her i never did quite figure it out but maybe the ogre did maybe you should go ask him ask the ogre you know ogres and goblins dont get along well this ones different hes half human hes a decent creature and not nearly as ugly or stupid as he should be he figured out how to work the magic wand after all then gave it to me so i could win a goblin chief he has a way with these things talk to him and maybe hell help you find that second son gloha shook her bemused little brain this is pretty farfetched are you sure you arent getting senile not at all sure dear goldy said cheerfully maybe you should ask someone else but she did seem oddly sure of herself she surely knew or suspected something but wasnt about to say exactly what it was lest she seem truly foolish at least gloha could check with the ogre then maybe she could find lacuna and ask her someone somewhere was bound to know whats the name of this ogre smash hes esks father i believe oh esk i know of him esk ogre he married bria brassie and they have three children they do i knew only of one the stork brought them two more i think twins how curious there seerns to have been a rash of twins recently maybe the storks are up to something maybe its a conspiracy gloha said smiling an adult conspiracy that must be it her aunt agreed before she left gloha went to see her cousinonceremoved gwenny who at sixteen was more like a straight cousin she was the chiefess of goblin mountain but perhaps would have half a moment to spare gwenny was at a meeting negotiating a treaty with the naga folk but her companion che centaur came out to see gloha he was a winged monster too and they were friends they hugged each other he was only eight years old but already he was substantially larger than gloha because he was of a larger species he was also more intelligent because that was the nature of centaurs til tell gwenny you were here he said i know she would want to see you but this treaty is so important that she just cant break away the goblins and naga have long been enemies and now they will be friends or at least allies the details are critical prince naldo naga is attending though hed rather be playing water games with his buxom wife mela merwoman so you can appreciate how important it is yes of course there it was again married folk having fun mela had a daughter two years older than gloha yet mela had no trouble finding her man but its nice to see you too i understand you are looking for the good magicians second son yes but i dont know who he is do you know no but im sure the muse of history would know i dont want to struggle with mount parnassus to see her aunt goldy thinks smash ogre may know something che cocked his head that is possible at worst he wont know anything and then you can ask the muse gloha thanked him and went her way each person had a different idea whom she should ask maybe one of those people really would know yet once she found the second son she would still be at the mere beginning of her quest because the good magician hadnt said that his second son had the answer who knew what convolutions remained she really wasnt very pleased with humfreys offhand dismissal of her question who cared about all the other folk whose good magician answers had turned out in retrospect to be good she didnt even have his answer just a stupid referral she emerged from the mountain and took off before the goblin guard could make any more smartfaced remarks but she couldnt stop him from getting another peek under her skirt before she got out of range she really did have to change her outfit the moment she got home but first she would see the ogre because his home in the jungle was closer than the harpy hutch she flew south crossing the gap chasm again she saw a dark cloud and quickly flew lower before it could see her in case it should be fracto then she spied the ogres twistedironwoodtree house and descended a really ancient woman of fifty or so met her at the door this was tandy the ogres wife no smash is out searching for stones from which to squeeze juice for stone soup tandy reported hes half ogre you know and every so often he likes to exercise his ogre nature you may have noticed how all small dragons have vacated the area for now but perhaps i can help you with your concern im looking for the good magicians second son do you know who that is no but i know someone who might be able to point him out thats my father crombie thats his talent to point to anything gloha considered that might do it but isnt your father pretty old considering how aged you are tandy smiled in a way that reminded gloha oddly of aunt goldy who was of that general generation exceedingly old i think he recently had his ninetyfirst birthday but he was once a major character in xanth and old characters never die they just fade away we just have to talk to him before he fades too far that makes sense gloha agreed do you know where he is now oh yes he lives down in the underworld with my mother jewel the nymph she must be horribly old too yes and no nymphs are ageless really remaining young and sexy forever or until they turn mortal jewel turned mortal when she married crombie and sent off to the stork for me so if we figure she was an apparent age of twenty then she would be an apparent age of seventy now thats probably manageable i suppose so gloha agreed doubtfully but im not sure i could find my way through the underworld unfortunately im only half nymph i look my age but im still spry enough to show you the way to my fathers home oh wonderful gloha exclaimed with guileless little glee clapping her happy little hands first we have to get to lake ogrechobee tandy said scribbling a note the entrance to the underworld is there fortunately thats not too far from here i cant fly of course so it will be slow but well get there gloha hoped it wouldnt be too slow she did want to get there before the five months it would take to check with humfreys other wives was done but of course she didnt say that because it might upset tandy and make her even slower tandy pinned the note to a chair gloha saw that it said smashvisiting folksback soon tandy then tandy went out to her kitchen garden where she dug out a plant ohto eat along the way gloha asked no this is a light bulb to make my poor old body light in my youth i rode a night mare but i am beyond that now tandy tucked the bulb into a pocket and indeed she did seem to step lighter now i dont suppose you also grow heavy bulbs gloha said oh yes i do but smash uses them when hes feeling lightheaded they bring more gravity to his thoughts they set off through the jungle gloha was concerned about encountering land monsters here who might try to eat them but then saw that tandys shirt said ogres wife across the back that probably protected her from most creatures who among mem would care to risk the wrath of an ogre the light bulb did seem to make tandy faster on her feet she was quite spritely she fairly bounded along while gloha flew low they followed a path marked by saplings twisted into pretzel knots and boulders cracked open by powerful blows an ogre path obviously then they heard something it was a weird sort of squishy noise smelling of fresh mud it seemed to be moving on a course that would intercept their path somewhere ahead what is that gloha asked nervously im sure i dont know tandy replied lets go see gloha had an opposite notion but did not want to be negative so she agreed they hurried forward toward the place the noise would soon be in a moment gloha was flying ahead outdistancing tandy it turned out to be a mud slide rich brown mud was coursing through the forest the only problem was that there was no slope from which it was sliding it was moving along the level ground or even uphill the mud slewed to a stop ho someone called from beyond gloha flew up to see who it was there to her special amazement was an old old man sitting on a huge dinner plate set on the mud behind him was a prettily decorated cabin with little white curtains in the windows gloha hovered before the man perplexed he looked vaguely familiar hello she said with a timid little tremor did you call why hello winsome little winged goblin vgirl you must be gloha he said yes i called i thoughryou might be able to help us im king emeritus trent then perhaps assuming that she wouldnt recognize the name ivys grandfather oh gloha said with a squeamish little squeak i thought you had faded away not quite trent said we four grandparents are going to visit esks grandparents for a fadeout party but we seem to have lost our way you four where are the others trent turned his face back hey sorceress lift the veil he called we have a visitor gloha goblinharpy immediately the cabin vanished there sat three other old folk on plates two women and a man uh hello gloha said again with a certain awed little awkwardness my wife the sorceress iris trent said one of the old women became a beautiful young woman with a shining silver crown and buttonbursting bodice except that it was laced not buttoned so she was a lacelashing lady so nice to meet you gloha the sorceress said dulcetly with a grand nod of her head my friend bink ivys other grandfather trent said the other old man became a handsome mediumyoung man in halfway casual clothing he nodded and last and least his wife chameleon in her stupid phase trent concluded the other woman did not change gloha saw now that she was old but amazingly lovely she needed no magical enhancement despite being in ordinary garb for now gloha remembered from her history lessons that the sorceress iris talent was illusion she could make anyone or anything look any way she wanted but chameleon didnt seem to need illusion gloha hadnt believed mat anyone that old could look that good we hope you can help us gloha chameleon said we seem to have lost our way that was so obvious that it needed no restatement then gloha remembered the thing about chameleon she changed with the moon becoming beautiful and stupid then ugly and smart so she couldnt be counted on to speak intelligently something trent had said registered youre going to see esks grandparents why so are we im with tandy who knows the way what a fortunate coincidence queen iris said she sent a curiously significant side glance at bink you and tandy must join us and show us the route oh im sure well be glad to gloha agreed let me go tell tandy she darted away before belatedly realizing that this might be impolite after all if she remembered her history lessons correctly all of them had been kings of xandi at one time or another but it was too late to correct her lamentable little lapse so she just flew on in a moment she found tandy who had continued walking there are fourthey want tosame place were goingits a coincidence she said breathlessly or perhaps witlessly tandy questioned her on the several pieces of her statement and managed to fathom the general little gist that is a coincidence she agreed for such a party to get lost right where we were goingthere must be magic involved oh yes the sorceress iris is spreading illusion all around gloha agreed they reached the mud slide the cabin was back on top of it hiding the three but king trent remained in his handsome younger form and to what do we owe the honor of your presence here in the wilderness he inquired of tandy gloha is looking for the good magicians second son and i thought my father crombie might point out the direction tandy replied oh humfrey is involved in this trent said as if that had great significance well if you will show us the route we shall give you a ride on swiftmud here he indicated the bank of mud on which his plate sat i would rather ride than walk tandy agreed and perhaps gloha would rather ride than fly we shall be happy to make the deal so trent set out two more plates and tandy managed to scramble up to one without getting too muddy while gloha flew to the other then the cabin expanded to enclose them all including trent and they were in what looked like a luxurious palace chamber but dont stray from your plate chameleon cautioned with a smile gloha extended a cautious finger to the cushioned floor beside her and felt mud everything was illusion except the mud and the plate but it was pleasant in this seeming cabin if i may ask she started we are not quite as young as we once were trent said so now we prefer to travel in comfort i transformed a mud grub into swiftmud and iris provided plates from her kitchen this seems to be an adequate mode of travel except that swiftmud is not particularly bright and strayed from the assigned route when we werent watching and now we arent entirely sure where we are but we suspected that there would be a fortunate coincidence and now it has occurred show us the way tandy and we shall slide there forthwith tandy looked around i think ill need to be outside for that abruptly the cabin wall contracted and trent and tandy were outside while gloha remained inside in a moment swiftmud started to move again sliding smoothly and probably swiftly along yesgloha saw trees whizzing by outside the curtained porthole they were on their way have some anthony and tell us your story iris suggested extending a smaller plate on which several brushes and combs were piled anthony gloha asked blankly anthoney iris said more carefully honey from ants sometimes in my age i slur out the hyphen some like it better than beehoney or seahoney thank you gloha took a honey comb from the plate and took a naughty little nibble it was very good the others took honey brushes and chewed on them then gloha explained about her quest to find a good winged goblin man for a husband and the frustration of her visit to the good magicians castle yes humfrey is like that now more than ever iris said licking spilled honey off her fingers age hasnt sweetened him but he always has reason bink said i remember when he said he couldnt fathom my talent what is your talent gloha asked i mean i know youre a magician because my centaur history book said so but i dont think it said what your talent is well thats an odd thing bink replied i think i have a notion of its nature but every time i try to tell someone about it somehow i dont i dont understand gloha said iris and chameleon smiled and looked away bink sighed i suppose i could make a demonstration he took a breath my talent is the swiftmud lurched to a halt almost pitching them from their plates onto the icky surface of itself whose fault is that trents voice called from outside the cabin oh it must be mine gloha cried with a chaotic little chagrin nonsense trent said this is bigger than all of us the cabin vanished so they could all see what was outside swiftmud perched at the edge of a huge cleft in the ground trent had halted it just in time to prevent them from plunging into the chasm and getting horribly muddied it must be an extension of the gap chasm tandy said but i dont remember any such fault in this region probably the original forget spell hasnt yet worn off all the tributaries trent said but i must admit it came as a surprise im not sure how well get past it if we could identify it we might know more about it tandy said all the offshoots of the gap chasm have names right trent agreed so we must answer my question whose fault is this gloha realized that he hadnt been accusing her before still she felt somehow guilty she struggled with her minor little memory of geography and managed to evoke a name could it be san andreas fault she asked the one that cracks on into mundania yes it must be san andreas fault iris agreed i never thought much of san aridrea anyway the question is iris said tartly how are we going to proceed this fault appears to extend right across our route if we detour after losing time by getting lost we shall be late for our engagement we dont want the others to fade out without us i can fly across gloha said but im too small to carry anyone else i might haul a rope across though if that would help i dont think we have time to make a rope bridge that would hold swiftmuds weight bink said i wish we had thought to get nofault insurance then we wouldnt have encountered any fault we never think of what were going to need ahead of time chameleon said otherwise you and i would never have adventured in the gap chasm the first time bink bink smiled you were almost as lovely then as you are now dear she returned the smile and lovelier than i will be next week save those reminiscences for the fadeout party iris snapped ill make us all beautiful then how do we get there in time we can proceed but it may not be entirely comfortable trent said swiftmud is a fairly versatile creature he can slide along any surface without losing his grip but we might prefer to walk at our age iris asked you forget youre ninetysix years old and im not a great deal younger if we try to walk any distance we shall both fade out sooner than planned then we had better ride trent agreed but we shall need to use some of your magic glue glue for our bottoms what are you thinking of so we wont fall off our plates when swiftmud slides down the face of the fault iris considered then she dug into her purse and brought out a tube of glue she had evidently harvested from a glue plant they took turns applying it to their plates having to stand on an extra plate iris provided from somewhere while doing it then they sat down again and their legs and posteriors fastened firmly to each plate gloha was nervous about it and decided not to use the glue maybe i can help find the way through the fault that seems sensible chameleon agreed gloha felt a thankful little flash of gratitude not only was the woman lovely she was nice gloha had been afraid that someone would find fault with her suggestion about the fault after all it was the nature of faults to be found trent gave a command and swiftmud started forward he slid to the edge of the fault and over it making a square angle turn down one by one the plates made that awesome turn the others remained on their plates but gloha couldnt she had to fly free she looped around and hovered near swiftmud as he slid at an even pace straight down the wall of the fault the five passengers remained firmly glued to their plates but they did not look inordinately comfortable gloha suspected that under the illusion their hair and perhaps other parts of their bodies were sagging somewhat then the cabin reappeared hiding them that made gloha feel better at least she flew down to investigate the depths of the fault it narrowed steadily until it disappeared in a dark crevice too small for swiftmud to enter but it was also too wide for the creature to cross she thought unless it was capable of making a uturn across nothing what now she flew to one side and then to the other she found a section with a ushaped connection of stone that should do in fact it looked ideal she flew back to swiftmud follow me she said swiftmud obligingly followed her to the side she landed on the ustone cross here she said swiftmud did then it proceeded up the other wall in due course it returned to the surface and got level again the cabin vanished very good iris said now we must go full speed ahead to make up for lost time as soon as we get unstuck from our plates chameleon said trying to fidget without being able to move her shapely posterior of course ms produced a tube of unglue and they became unglued gloha settled back to her plate as swiftmud accelerated now the scenery fairly whizzed by glohas hair flowed back in the wind and so did chameleons the others seemed unaffected perhaps because their appearances were now illusory confirming her prior suspicion gloha was glad of that because in their natural states they did look stomachirkingly aged she had not realized that it was possible for a person to be older than fifty or so but understood that some folk just didnt have much choice in the matter soon they reached the great wide broad expanse of lake ogrechobee we had better pause for refreshment iris said before getting into the labyrinth of the underworld so trent guided swiftmud around the edge of the lake looking for a campsite with pie trees and pillow bushes instead they found a village whose houses were all black sure enough a sign said black village i dont remember a village here trent said it must have formed within the decade since our last visit here iris said i can clothe us with the illusion of invisibility if you wish dont bother just make us young and anonymous for now im sure the natives are friendly indeed there was a sign a bit farther along saying friendly natives all six of them became young except for gloha who didnt change she was impressed by iris powers of illusion swiftmud proceeded slowly down the center street soon a man came out he looked ordinary except that he was black what can i do for you tourists he inquired in friendly fashion he wore a nameplate saying sherlock safecourteousreliable we were just looking for refreshment trent said were on our way to the underworld you have come to the right place sherlocksaid we settled here last year and are promoting tourism we have all manner of refreshments and entertainments including regular presentations at the curse friend playhouse or you can simply sun yourselves on the ogrechobee beach and feed the tame ogres and chobees tame ogres iris asked dubiously it happens tandy reminded her oh yes sherlock agreed we have okra the ogre tamer who can make an ogre named smithereen perform ogre feats of strength for just a smile nobody believes it until they see it and the chobees will allow themselves to be petted for just a few marsh mallows and maybe a toe or two he smiled a bit of safe courteous reliable humor there just fetch us some fresh pies to take along iris said sherlock turned his head pie assortment to go he called then to trent and what do you have in trade do you need any illusion iris inquired we prefer to have no illusions sherlock said we like things here as they are do you need to have any person or creature transformed to something else trent asked sherlock considered actually there is someone wed like to transform but its his nature that needs transforming not his appearance what is his nature hes always trying to organize things into a state so he can run it we have no need of this but he just wont stop his names nator we even call the way he acts natorial its really bothersome trent pondered i seem to remember a type of creature that enjoys that sort of organization there are a number of them but none of them want to be the leader so they are usually in a state of confusion or a state of frustration nator would love to solve their problems sherlock said but are they human not really does it matter sherlock considered again perhaps not he turned his head again hey nator would you like to be a goober another man came out whats a goober creatures who exist in a state with no leader because no one wants to do it id certainly like to shape them up nator said trent gestured nator became a creature vaguely resembling a cross between a peanut and a pink jellybean with multiple legs and long antennae the antennae quivered then the goober ran away wait sherlock called we dont know whether you like it yet but then they saw a green jellybean emerge from the jungle to meet the pink one and a purple one arriving from another direction they are very quick to locate each other trent said im sure nator will be all right they are highly social creatures and they wont mind his being natorial they should love it hell be goober natorial a young black woman arrived with an armful of fresh pies i hope these are all right she said they are black berry which is our favorite and green berry purple berry gray berry and blue berry and one goose berry be careful of that one its very fresh those are fine trent said fair exchange thank you they took the pies gloha got the goose berry it honked as she took a bite but she avoided its other effect by flying up geese were flying creatures and their food tended to make others try to fly except those who were already doing so so the pies freshness didnt bother her she knew how to handle it they bid parting to sherlock and the young woman and swiftmud resumed sliding a number of the black folk had come out during the dialogue and exchange and were looking curiously at the mud gloha didnt blame them it was a most curious creature we shall have to tell dor about this new village trent remarked it does seem like a nice place to visit this region has been cleaned up bink remarked it used to be primitive country but now it is parklike that must be the work of the black villagers chameleon said now i remember i did hear something about a black wave that arrived from mundania but i never heard where they settled now we know as they ate their pies swiftmud slid out across the surface of the lake having no more trouble with it than with the vertical walls of the fault soon they were surrounded by flat water gloha was impressed because she had never seen so much water in one place not when she was actually on it this was an interesting journey but was it getting her any closer to the achievement of her desire she still had no idea how to find the man of whatever dreams she might want to have assuming he existed if only the good magician had answered her question instead of dismissing her without even listening instead of sending her on this wild goose pie chase for his second son who might not exist either reconciliations they had hardly finished their pies before they reached the domecity of the curse friends sherlock curiously had called them curse friends maybe he had misspoken actually the city didnt show on the surface there was only a whirlpool there a big one swiftmud floated right toward it we arent going into that are we gloha asked with a feeble little fright oh thats right you havent been here before tandy said this is the way to the underworld one of the ways anyway but goblins lurk along the others dont be concerned gloha tried her best to be unconcerned as swiftmud got caught by the vortex and floated around it in a diminishing spiral the central hole loomed up hugely then they tilted into it and whirled around and around going down after that it was a blur gloha squeezed her expressive little eyes tightshut closed there was a bump and splash and the awful spinning stopped glohas eyes peeked open just a tiny slit they were in a dark cavern floating on a somber lake gloha pried loose her jammed little jaw what happened she asked doubtfully we landed at the bottom of the vortex tandy answered from here its mostly smooth sailing to my mothers apartment that was a relief if gloha had had any idea what this trip would be like she would have hesitated to make it but no one else seemed concerned so she crammed her startled little stomach back into place and pretended to be satisfied after a somewhat timeless time because there was no sun here to mark it just a faint glow in the water and on the stone walls they came to a landing an unusual woman came out from a doorway she wore a gown set with so many bright gems that it made the whole region three and a half times as bright oh youre here she exclaimed but who is this mother this is gloha who has come to see crombie tandy said gloha this is jewel the nymph indeed she looked like a nymph being of exquisitely crafted figure except for one thing she was old gloha had never heard of an old nymph jewel was timeless until she loved and married crombie bink reminded her there was a certain diffidence about the way he related to the nymph that gloha would have found perplexing if she had thought of it but at the moment she was meeting too many people to have time for extra thoughts about the only one who was really clear in her mind was magician trent because she remembered him best from her history lessons then she began aging from her apparent age of twenty just as mortals do we still call her jewel the nymph but shes really no longer a nymph and she will join our fadeout party oh that did not seem horribly clear but gloha was in no mental shape to be confused so she just smiled and accepted things as they seemed to be though she was halfway sure that things werent exactly as they seemed to be what was there about sinks attitude toward jewel that bothered her jewel was tandys mother that was enough you are barely in time jewel said crombie has almost faded we were delayed while traveling ms said somewhat sourly gloha felt guilty again remembering that the last delay had happened when bink tried to tell her about his talent the fault had shown up right then without warning of course that couldnt have been her fault yet somehow it seemed so gloha must talk to my father before he fades any further tandy said she is still young most of her life is ahead of her how nice jewel said she led the way to a bedroom chamber there amidst piled blankets and cushions was a horribly wizened ancient old man gloha wasnt sure just what fading out entailed but if this was it she didnt much like it crombie seemed to be on the far side of sleep lying on his back his eyes staring up at the ceiling without focusing she remembered how wiras eyes had never quite focused on things his were somewhat like that but she had to talk to him and hope he could help her sir mister crombie the good magician humfrey told me to talk to his second son but i dont know where he is or even who he is and my aunt goldy thought maybe smash ogre would know but he was out and tandy thought maybe you would know or at least be able to point the direction then she took a breath the decrepit figure stirred weakly the withered old mouth opened cant he breathed gloha didnt know what to say this had become her almost only hope and now it was dashed so she burst into tears the figure stirred again askelse it breathed a thought found its way through her misery ask something else if he could point out anythingor almost anythingwhy not ask him where her ideal man was if he could point the way to that one she wouldnt need to talk to humfreys second son anyway where is my ideal man she asked one arm moved it fell off the bed but it was pointing a definite direction gloha made careful note she had a kind of answer but she needed more is there anything that can help me in my search she asked the arm moved again this time it pointed at king emeritus trent magician trent can help me gloha asked startled but hes she caught herself before uttering the trite little truth that he was far too anciently old to be able to do anything much more than make it through his share of the fadeout party and might have trouble even with that hes otherwise committed she concluded trent himself seemed startled he must be pointing to something beyond me he said such as the wall ms said with half a smile im sure that will be a great help to her something beyond the wall trent said with the other half of the smile just as was the case when he pointed toward her ideal man perhaps he got the questions reversed and meant that you are her ideal man iris said with a quarter of a new smile trent laughed how nice it would be to think so but i think she is looking for one about seventysix years younger here ill get out of the way and crombie can point again he eased himself down and to the side sitting on a cushion near crombies head gloha was relieved to get the chance to clear up the confusion mister crombie sir could you point again to whoever or whatever might be able to help me in my quest for my ideal man the withered arm shuddered and moved again the gnarled forefinger pointed up beyond the decrepit head directly at trent again gloha was both chagrined and intrigued it did seem that crombies talent was working because the man wasnt even looking and couldnt have known exactly where trent had moved but how could ancient aged old king emeritus trent help her there had to be some confusion she had asked directions four times for humfreys second son for her ideal man and for something to help her twice crombie had been unable to point for the first but had seemed pretty sure about the other two the confusion was more likely to be in the first than in the last odd that he had failed there did it mean the second son was dead then why had humfrey told her to ask him was she supposed to find his ghost that didnt seem quite reasonable ghosts seldom answered questions then gloha suffered another astonishing little intuition but she would have to verify it because there was something confusing about it icould i talk to crombie alone she asked timorously why not jewel said we can organize for our party the others left the chamber gloha emboldened herself enough to take crombies weathered and almost crumbling hand some of her young little vitality seemed to cross over and mend his old gross senility we are alone mister crombie she said i promise not to repeat what you tell me if you want it that way will you tell me why you couldnt tell me where humfreys second son is the wrinkled ashgray head rolled from side to side the worn lips quivered no he shuddered i have a suspicion gloha continued relentlessly i think the good magician had a reason to send me to his second son and i think you do know where he is no crombie creaked again i think that maybe just possibly perhaps you are that second son that i found my way to you despite not knowing he rolled his head some more but didnt say no again what i dont understand is why you dont want it known maybe if you told me i would understand he was still reluctant but in the face of her accurate little assessment he managed to recover enough to tell her the story he was the son of humfrey and the mundane woman sofia whom humfrey had married because she was the finest living sock sorter humfrey had had a son with his first wife the demoness dara and a daughter with his third wife rose of roogna but humfrey had been more interested in his work than in his family and more interested in training magicianlevel children like trent and iris than in his own child so crombie had been pretty well ignored and alienated oh im so sorry to hear that gloha said with more than a slight little surge of sympathy no wonder you werent happy but still i dont understand why you dont want to be known as his son so crombie told her about his experience with the demoness metria how he had met her when looking for a better mother and how she had helped him fight off the spooks of the night bedroom and stayed with him until he turned thirteen and became aware of the female of the species then she dissolved into smoke and drifted away he realized that she had stayed with him only in order to get into humfreys castle and spy out his secrets he had looked for a girlfriend and thought he found one but when he wanted to see her panties she had puffed into smoke and he realized that the demoness was having more fun with him he knew it was metria because she had a thing with words she seldom could remember precisely the right one and had to hunt through her vocabulary for it that made her unique among demons and always gave her away but more important she was female and her mischief was always of a female nature so he had sworn off women forever i can see why gloha said she shouldnt have teased you like that everyone knows that all any man wants of a young woman is to see her panties thats how mela merwoman nabbed prince naldo naga and she wasnt even very young thats how ill nab my ideal man if i ever find him but why did that make you not want to be known as humfreys son so he told her how he had grown up and left home and gone out on his own becoming a soldier he had been supremely embittered by the disinterest of his father and of course his mother was a woman so there was nothing there for him later he had discovered a nice nymph and she was all right because nymphs werent women they were innocent creatures so he had married her and been satisfied though she had loved someone else gloha got a giddy little glimmer of something that surely was none of her business whom else did she love bink he drank love elixir without realizing it and saw her and loved her though he was already married in time she came to love him back but by then his love had been nulled by the time of no magic so she was left hurting but i liked her and i brought her a love potion and then she loved me too of course it still took a while for her other love for him to fade if it ever did because it was natural that explained binks odd attitude toward jewel he had once loved her and she had once loved him that was the sad memory of what might have been between them how romantic didnt it bother you that her love for him was natural while her love for you was magic no i knew the situation all i asked of her was that she be a good wife to me and that she was so crombie had made his own life and that was all right fortunately his daughter tandy was half nymph so he could stand her but he never saw reason to let his connection to the good magician be known humfrey had never given any indication of caring after all gloha got an intriguing little insight of another intuition but suppose humfrey did show he cared about you she asked i mean everyone knows that hed rather grump than breathe and would never admit to any human passion but just suppose he let slip a hint that he remembered you and wanted to know how you were doing would that make it all right for you to be known as his second son crombie thought about it and seemed to be trying to fight off the notion but its allure was too much for his frail old resistance and he finally had to admit that that might make it barely all right but he knew that humfrey would never let slip anything like that so it didnt matter now he would fade out in peace with his friends and all would be forgotten but you said trent and iris were the ones who took your fathers attention from you gloha said why should you be friends with them they didnt know how it was crombie said his voice growing stronger they think there was some other reason such as the demoness so they let it be and havent told anyone and indeed i worked for them for years when trent was king and he was a good employer no fault in him so now i dont want to embarrass them by having it known and your daughter tandy doesnt know she doesnt know neither does jewel so lets leave it that way after the fadeout party it wont matter well that party may have to be postponed the decrepit figure developed some semblance of animation postponed i cant make it beyond the day but you pointed to trent as the one to help jne find my ideal man so hell have to help me look so he wont be able to join your party now wouldnt you rather wait until he can you are making typically female mischief he exclaimed his insecurely fastened bones rattling with the effort well thats my nature she said with a golden little grin i think humfrey misses you and wants to be recognized as your father but cant do it if you dont agree he cant even admit that he wants it for fear of your rejection so he sent me to see you hoping id jog something loose ill bet that if you gave even one nod of agreement hed be here to make amends never crombie said with what might well pass for emphasis what never of course never the good magician is incapable of admitting to making any mistake ever in his long life gloha had a tiny little tinge of doubt so she suppressed it before it could grow well we can test it nod your head gloha hoped she was right it would make halfway sense of half the confusion she had been experiencing i dont have the strength maybe i can help you sit up she leaned over him all right ill nod then will you leave me alone of course she said with sweet little sweetness she put her hands on his bony old shoulders and hauled and he managed to lurch into situp position then he nodded his head once and fell back exhausted there was a silence nothing happened gloha realized that she had misfigured it well i guess youre right she said ill go away and let you be thanks he breathed he seemed almost disappointed she got up and went out of the doorway good magician humfrey met her there are you through he inquired grumpily yes i must be she agreed sadly she went on by him letting him go in alone then she paused her mouth dropped into an open little o the others laughed you did it trent said looking even younger than before the sorceress of illusion was overdoing it a bit making him seem to be in his twenties he now wore a bright shirt and trousers with shiny boots and even a bold sword in its sheath he looked utterly dashing i was hoping you would i think i owe you a favor oh you dont have to humfrey brought some fountain of youth elixir hell give some of it to crombie so he can survive the postponement of the fadeaway party and he gave some to me so now i am in shape to help you on your quest gloha looked at him again you mean this isnt illusion any more this is my physical age of course ill take some more elixir with reverse wood to neutralize the effect after this is done then we ancients of xanth can fade out in style oh gloha said feeling maidenly faint however iris said sharply in that tone which suggested that there was a formidable caveat coming to the surface the rest of us should not be expected to twiddle our tired thumbs while you two enjoy yourselves gallivanting around the country slaying dragons and such what are we going to doplay tag with monsters trent considered for a good three quarters of a moment maybe you could rest in the brain corals pool chameleon laughed but jewel was serious why not jewel asked with nymphly innocence iris answered her the brain coral likes to collect things in its pool but it doesnt like to let them go so unless we want to give up our freedom immediately it is best to remain well clear of it thats not so jewel protested i have been there many times on my errands placing gemstones for mortals to find sometimes when ive been tired the brain coral has let me rest in its pool and then released me much refreshed it honors any deal it makes trent reconsidered perhaps my humor was ill advised may vae misjudged fine fttam corar anyone does he could say did someone speak my name the good magician asked appearing in the doorway beside him stood crombie looking about ten years younger and forty years happier my son and i could not help overhearing your son jewel asked surprised its a long story crombie said whats this about the brain coral jewel says that the brain coral will honor a deal bink said when i was young i regarded it as an enemy but that was some time ago the brain coral does what it feels proper humfrey said when you sought to free the demon x and thereby bring on the time of no magic it fought you knowing better than you did but when you are not bent on mortal folly it is not your enemy so if we made a deal to rest in its pool until trent returns for our fadeout party it would let us go at the right time assuredly humfrey agreed but it would ask a price for such a service bink turned to the others then maybe we do have something to do while we wait i understand that a sleep in the brain corals pool is like an instant you go in and come out immediately yet centuries may have passed that will do iris agreed but you can take time out from that sleep jewel said you can be conscious if you want to and talk with other folk there there are some really interesting creatures in storage with fascinating histories then lets go and inquire trent said see if we can make a deal you go jewel said i want to learn this long story about who is whose son gloha and i will go trent said its our mission the others exchanged a shrug not objecting it did seem that the rapprochement between magician humfrey and crombie had excited their greater interest now just where is the brain corals pool trent asked crombie pointed a direction it seemed to be downstream so they went to swiftmud who was muddily snoozing on the dark underworld river sip the water there humfrey said that will enable you to communicate with it they set off through the caves now gloha was able to admire the glowing colors of the walls and ceiling and the convolutions of stone under the clear surface of the water this was really a rather pretty place in its somber way they came to a cavern that seemed to be half filled with water but when gloha peered down through the water she saw that it was much deeper than she had thought so that she could not see the bottom the sides were shallower and there on slopes and ledges were all manner of things and creatures all were still none were swimming or showing signs of life it was an eerie display this must be the place trent said brightly gloha had not yet gotten used to his youth and vigor she would hardly have recognized him if she hadnt known about the youthening he was a handsome and selfassured man not at all doddering youth elixir was wonderful stuff they dipped their hands and brought sips of the water to their mouths it tasted faintly of medicine what do you want of me king trent i am about to start a quest with gloha goblinharpy and my friends need a place to park for the duration what do you offer in exchange trent smiled what do you want what is your quest to find my ideal man gloha said then she had a halfway bright notion i dont suppose you have a nice winged goblin male in storage no i have a winged centaur filly however gloha shook her head i cant marry her but perhaps this is our avenue of exchange i understand that there is now a winged centaur male che centaurchexs foal gloha said the only one of his kind but hes still very young just eight years old cynthia is not too much older it is time for her to emerge and learn the ways of contemporary xanth by the time she does che may be grown cynthia trent said that name seems familiar it should magician you transformed her back in i did im not sure i remember i transformed so many in those wicked days was that about the time i transformed justin tree about she came to me and has been here seventytwo years in suspension xanth has changed somewhat in that period she will need time to adjust and it will be better if another winged monster assists her and if she is protected from harm until she is competent i begin to get your gist trent said you want us to see to that chore in exchange for parking our friends here oh lets do it gloha cried im sure shes a nice person trent glanced at her obliquely it would be better to verify that before making the commitment she realized that it was barely possible that his extra seventyfive years or so of experience counted for something i suppose she agreed cautiously then enter the pool and listen to cynthias story trent looked at gloha and gloha looked at trent this was safe but if it wasnt the good magician would come to see what had happened so they shrugged almost together and prepared to enter the pool but there was a complication their clothing it wouldnt be good to get it soaked but it also wouldnt be good for the two of them to be unclothed in each others presence the adult conspiracy had firm things to say about that even when no children were involved trent was a mature male man and gloha a fully formed approximately human crossbreed woman it would not be appropriate for him to see her panties dont be silly leave your clothing on just jump in they exchanged another glance and shrug then they held their noses and jumped off either side of swiftmud gloha was afraid she would choke but she had no trouble she didnt seem to be breathing but felt no discomfort she just slowly sank down into the depth which no longer seemed unpleasant she saw trent descending nearby this is an interesting experience he remarked without opening his mouth very gloha agreed without opening hers in addition her clothing didnt seem to be wet it neither clung to her nor floated out from her it remained about the same as it was in the air i think we must be communicating in thoughts rather than sound trent remarked but our ears think it is sound that sounds right to me she agreed with a small little smile they landed on a pleasant ledge set with pretty shells there was a winged centaur filly with brown hair and mane white wings and a blouse and jacket covering her human section of torso that was unusual in a centaur for that species was normally completely open about bodily appearance and function cynthia i presume trent said you remember magician trent the filly replied it isnt often i transform such a lovely person you havent changed at all but i suppose some time has passed above some has he agreed this is gloha goblinharpy who would like to get to know you cynthia looked at gloha for the first time oh youre a winged monster too yes and the only one of my kind perhaps i would like to know your story if you care to tell it im happy to tell it if you care to listen make yourself comfortable they found nice boulders and sat on them they were so light down here under the pool that even the rough stone was comfortable cynthia began to talk gloha soon not only heard her voiceless voice but saw her sightless scene as the ambience of the brain corals pool made the scene come alive cynthia was in most respects a regular runofthemill human maiden whom the stork had delivered to a nice family in the north village barely sixteen years before her magic talent was moderate but convenient she interacted remarkably well with children she used this magic to make others happy with her babysitting when the childrens parents were away cynthia was as a centaur put it in loco parentis that was his way of saying that she was like a substitute parent or as the children put it crazy seesee which was their way of saying that she was fun and apparent but all was not well in xanth the storm king was not paying proper attention to the weather so that on some days the local pillow bushes got so dry that their feather stuffing leaked out and floated away while on other days it rained so heavily that the pillows got all sodden and squishy meanwhile there was news that evil magician trent was making mischief trying to shake up the current monarchy though cynthia didnt care much for the way the storm king was handling the kingdom she was almost certain that a hostile takeover wasnt the way to improve things cynthia went to the edge of a placid lake to admire her brownhaired and browneyed reflection as was expected of pretty girls her age she saw a grapevine growing near the water so she approached it grapevines were gossipy plants notorious for their news about things that shouldnt concern rightthinking folk so naturally no one listened to them but cynthia happened to be alone and no one would know so she yielded to temptation and put her ear to a grape the horrendous evil magician is nearing the north village terrifying the denizens it gushed splattering purple prose on her delicate shellpink ear who can stop this monstrous incursion before it is too late oh this was bad news indeed she was firmly against the evil magician invading her peaceful village with his nasty transformations she would have to try to stop him unfortunately she had not the least idea how to do it all she could mink of was to intercept him and try to persuade him to leave this village alone she was a resourceful maiden with a talent for dealing with children she would think of something to stop his childish behavior she hoped one day while she was picking rambling roses she saw him approaching she knew it was him because she happened to see him change a butterfly into a pink elephant the elephant seemed none too pleased with the transformation it trumpeted a brassy melody and galumped off flapping its ears like wings that was definitely a sign of magic so she moved to intercept the man before he could pass her by suddenly she was facetoface with him she opened her mouth to utter a paragraph of remonstration as her eyes met his and stopped stunned not by his magic by his attractive face and general good looks she had assumed he would be ugly or at least somewhat crude and rough around the edges maybe stooped with a limp and a sneer instead he was somewhere in the vicinity of divine being tall and upright and evenfeatured a greeting pretty maid he said accurately enough have we met before i uh um er not exactly she said luxuriating in the warmth of his handsome gaze the roses fell from her flaccid fingers and rambled rapidly away as was their nature her wits landed amidst them he bent down to help her collect her scattered wits then allow me to introduce myself he said as he handed them back to her i am magician trent cynthia wanted to crank up her persuasive powers and ask him to go away instead she said im cynthia how may i help you magician he smiled roguishly and she realized that her present leanedover posture was giving him rather too much of a glimpse down her bodice she was after all not all that far from the innocence of childhood and could almost feel the censorious eyes of the adult conspiracy following his eyes to exactly the same place she nearly dropped her wits again this time down into her nice new cleavage fortunately she managed to straighten up without too much of a blush i would appreciate it if you would give me directions to the nearest good river he said cynthia being naturally sweet and innocent clung to her recovered wits and sweetly and innocently misdirected him if he followed her directions he would wind up on the rail that rode strangers right out of town magician trent gazed at her are you sure he inquired gently well maybe i got it confused she confessed fearing that he was suspicious so she gave him directions to the nearest love spring instead if he drank from that he would fall hopelessly in love with the next female creature he encountered like maybe a warty hog are you sure he inquired again quite sure she said stifling her impulse to confess all and maybe kiss him for good measure i am sorry for that he said you see i happen to know this region you have just directed me to a hostile rail and to a toofriendly love spring i fear i shall have to deal with you for such betrayal irks me but i shall not interfere with your youthful beauty then before she could attempt to protest he gestured with one manly hand cynthia knew she was in trouble she tried to flee but already her body was changing her squeezable torso unsqueezed stretched expanded and distorted she became grotesquely huge her rump pushed out behind monstrously and sprouted a long hair tail from somewhere in the center of her body four new appendages grew two were legs but they didnt have feet they had heavy black horny terminations the other two were behind and were white feathery and grotesquely convoluted her body turned mostly brown and hairy with knobby knees and a belly as big as a barrel only her scant surviving bit of human torso remained clothed her nether section had burst out of her skirt and was now devastatingly naked oh utter horrors she had become a complete monster and the evil magician had tortured her further by claiming not to interfere with her beauty properly appalled cynthia cried out in despair and humiliation and ran off as fast as her four cowlike legs could carry her she knew she could never return to her home like this but where could she go what could she do no use to ask the evil magician who had transformed her he would just say frankly my dear i dont give a dam as if anyone could give or take anything as massive and watery as a dam she would just have to hide until she could make her way out of xanth and never be heard from again she was getting breathless so had to slow to a trot but she kept going as far as she could hoping to get far enough away so that no one would know of her but she couldnt go forever the day was getting late she found a barn maybe she could hide there for the night then sneak off early in the morning when few people were up and about maybe she could find a burlap bag to put over her head so she could not be recognized because she could tell by the feel of her face that it had not been changed the magician had done her the ultimate indignity of leaving her most recognizable aspects untouched so that everyone would know her shame there just seemed to be no end to the exquisite refinement of his vengeance on her she went to the back door opened it and wedged her ungainly body in she was thirsty maybe she could find some water here she was also tired maybe she could find some hay to lie in assuming she could lie down with this clumsy contraption of a body whos there oh she had thought this barn was empty cynthia tried to back out but her huge hairy rump banged into the doorpost making a crash that could be heard throughout she tried to turn around so she could flee headfirst but there wasnt room in this narrow passage she was stuck as the farmer tramped toward her from elsewhere in the barn he appeared around a corner speak up or ill jab you with my pitchfork he said gruffly squinting into the gloom of her corner oh please sir dont hurt me she pleaded im trying to get out of your barn why its a girl he said surprised no its a monster please just let me go and ill never bother you again you sure sound like a girl let me get a look at you no please dont look at me im all hairy and awful she tried to hide her face though that wasnt the hairy part the farmer appeared before her he stared why youre a centaur filly whats your kind doing here cynthia paused a what a centaur dont you know your own kind what do you want in my old barn a centaur suddenly she realized it was so the four furred legs with their hoofed feet the hairy tail the massive belly the human head and upper torso i didnt realize she said the evil magician transformed me into a centaur exceptwhat are these she spread the folded white feathery appendages on her backside they promptly banged into the walls and she had to stop why those are wings the farmer said youre a flying centaur so even the centaurs wont accept me she said realizing how completely the magician had punished her she would be an outcast from both human and centaur folk because there was no other creature of this kind in all of xanth the evil magician did this to you why i tried to deceive him because i didnt want him taking over our land but he wasnt fooled and he transformed me ill never be able to live it down the fanner nodded i guess id feel the same way very well you can spend the night here ive got a stall im not using ill bring you some food theres water in the stall he showed the way to the central part of the barn she found a bucket of fresh cool water and used her hands to dip some out to drink it was wonderfully refreshing then the farmer returned with some wry bread the chunk was warped with a twisted expression but that was the nature of this variety she bit eagerly into it and it was very good oh sir how can i ever thank you she asked gratefully belatedly remembering her manners what are you good at i used to be good with children i was apparent children saw me as a parent so i could babysit well i have a little boy but hes such a handful that no one wants to take care of him his talent is making things go awry i think its because he ate too much wry bread this is a wry farm its what we grow so we use it all children get into mischief cynthia said im used to that i have to go into town tomorrow for supplies the wifes away visiting her endless relatives if you could watch him tomorrow id be glad to so she slept on the soft hay getting the hang of her new body the horse section had no trouble but it took her a while to get her human portion comfortable because it couldnt lie flat the way it had before she finally propped it against a wall resting her head against her braced forearms in the morning she combed some of the tangles out of her hair and washed her face she wished she could change her shirt but it was the only one she had she knew that centaurs normally went barebreasted but she couldnt bring herself to be so exposive the nice farmer brought her a bowl of wry pudding then he brought out die boy who seemed to be about six years old and toeheaded that was not a concern children normally grew out of the toes as they matured this is wryly the farmer said wryly this is cynthia centaur who will watch you while im gone gee a centaur the boy said pleased ill ride her all around cynthia hadnt thought of that the notion did not especially appeal maybe later she said see if you can manage him the farmer said cynthia tried her talent on the boy but she realized almost immediately that something was wrong wryly didnt change he looked just as mischievous as ever but the farmer seemed to go into a trance his jaw went slack and his eyes stared fixedly she waved a hand before his face nothing happened cynthia worked herself into a worry she put her hands on his shoulders and shook him snap out of it the farmer blinked once then again to be certain he had the motion right whwhere am i youre here in your barn about to go into town cynthia reminded him he looked around in bafflement then wandered off in the rough direction of his house the boy bored wim such activities reached into his pocket and pulled out what appeared to be the rest of his last nights supper of chicken and wrys he chewed on that while pondering what new mischief he could get into cynthia was not stupid as girls went though she wasnt sure that was also true as filly centaurs went she assessed the situation when she had tried to use her talent on the lad his father had gone into a daze a dim bulb flashed over her head oh no she exclaimed laying a hand on her fair cheek my talentits gone tranceparent i send parents into trances she realized that the boys mischievous talent had affected her it had gone awry she ran after the farmer who was slowly recovering his common sense i cant use my talent on your son she said it just messes up but i think i can watch him while you go into town then ill have to be on my own way he nodded he was used to this theres wrys pudding in the kitchen for lunch he said ill be back as soon as i can it turned out to be a real chore keeping wryly out of mischief but somehow she managed without invoking her useless talent she was able to clean up most of the pudding the boy had thrown before the farmer got back and had found enough water to put out the fire before it burned up the barn but it was definitely time to be on her way the boy was too eager to live the life of wryly which could be the death of cynthia you know if youre looking for a place to be out of circulation the farmer said what about the brain corals pool the what he explained how deep in the underworld there was supposed to be this really intelligent coral that lived in a pool and collected things i hear its not a bad creature he concluded it just likes to keep things a while and let them go later maybe you could stay there until folk have forgotten about you the notion appealed so cynthia went in search of the brain coral but that was a separate adventure along with how she learned to use her new wings to fly the odd thing was that when that happened she lost her babysitting talent she realized when she thought about it that a creature could have only one magic talent and hers was now flying maybe she would get back her old talent if she ever got back into full human form meanwhile she had to confess flying was rather fun and really handy when there was a rushing river or nickelpedeinfested chasm to cross and now i guess a couple of years have passed and youve been exiled to the brain corals pool too evil magician she concluded brightly i guess i cant really blame you for transforming me because i did try to deceive you and you have transformed another girl to another winged form but this time you got caught so it must be all even trent exchanged a rather wary glance with gloha cynthia had the wrong idea its not quite that way gloha said maybe i can explain im natural that is im the product of the first goblinharpy romance in several centuries im looking for a man of my kind that is a winged goblin my brother harglo doesnt count and magician trent is helping me we came to take you back to xanth if you want to go goblinharpy romance i never heard of that cynthia said i thought they were enemies well it happened after you came here theyre still enemies mostly but thats changing because theres a lady goblin chief now my cousin gwendolyn but you must be as old as i am there hasnt been time toto notify the stork and grow up i am nineteen gloha said cynthia was amazed you mean its been twenty years i had no idea even longer trent murmured impossible you dont look any older than you were when you transformed me youre still as evilly handsome as ever trent looked somewhat helplessly at gloha gloha realized that she was better equipped to handle this particular revelation do you know how winged monsters never lie to each other she asked cynthia yes thats in the big book of rules i encountered a winged dragon in that part of my adventure i didnt cover and he told me that winged monsters might fight among themselves but that they had to unite against ground creatures and they never deceived each other he also told me that i was a winged monster and that was a compliment not an insult because he thought i was luscious she switched her tail thoughtfully i believed him because he didnt chomp me maybe he just wasnt hungry at the time gloha wasnt quite sure of the logic but let it pass then im telling you as one winged monster to another that seventytwo years have passed since your transformation cynthias pretty mouth dropped open in astonishment and evil magician trent was exiled to mundania and later returned and was king of xanth and now his daughter is queen of xanth and hes not called evil any more he is now ninetysix and just took youth elixir to restore his youth so he could help me in my quest xanth has changed a lot since you left it and i apologize for transforming you trent said i will be glad to transform you back to your original form but your family is gone and your friends will be gone or very old so i am afraid i have done you a greater evil than i ever intended and i wish i could make it up to you cynthia looked at gloha gloha nodded it is the truth winged monster honor ii cant go back cynthia asked plaintively then what will become of me trent looked as if he were about to say frankly my dear and go on about dams but he stifled it iwe thought you might prefer to remain a winged centaur gloha said as the only one of my kind id rather stay in the pool there is another now a family of winged centaurs in fact cheiron and chex centaur and their foal che he youwe thought maybe a male winged centaur cynthia said how old is he well hes young yet but how old eight but he gets older every year you expect a sixteenyearold girl to go with an eightyearold boy gloha saw how foolish it was i guess it was a bad idea im not interested in any eightyearold goblin boy there is an answer trent said both girls looked at him as you can see the elixir of the fountain of youth can reduce a persons physical age there is some available so if you i dont want to be eight years old again then maybe if che were made older he would still be a child in a grown body then i can transform you back to your original form trent said you are a pretty girl with an appealing age im sure youll be able to make your way in the human realm but cynthia was having a second thought this centaur boywhats he like oh hes very special gloha said all the winged monsters are sworn to protect him because he is destined to change xanth we dont know exactly how but already he has helped gwenny goblin be the first female goblin chief and thats changing xanth for the better he is her official companion which means hes away from home a lot and his folksbut of course they understand about that his folks miss having a child at home cynthia said i can guess how that must be yes gwenny and jenny elf lived with them for two years but then gwenny had to be chief so maybe i will take that youth elixir cynthia said i have a whole lot to learn about xanth and ill just stumble around and get in trouble on my own but if i could stay with a family of my own kind for a few years oh im sure theyd welcome you gloha said then maybe if you are willing to see me safely there and get me that youth elixir certainly trent said it is the least i can do to make up for what i did come with us now and this is the way it will be agreed cynthia centaur extended her dainty hand magician trent took it gloha thought she might be mistaken but she had the innocent little impression that cynthia was rather taken with magician trent whom she had never known as an old man then the three of them walked up out of the brain corals pool they were about to be on their way escape in due course the four of them set out gloha trent cynthia and swiftmud whom trent had transformed into a lightning bug to help light their way this wasnt ideal country for a creature of swiftmuds natural size the other human folk were comfortably ensconced in the brain corals pool awaiting that seemingly timeless interval when trent would return for the fadeaway party tandy had decided to wait with the elders because this might be her last chance to visit her parents before they faded out gloha had promised to deliver a message to smash ogre so he would know what was keeping tandy if he noticed they had tandys pass which had been duly authenticated by the demons goblins water monsters and such because she was related to legitimate underworld denizens in times past there had been strife between the various factions but in recent decades they had settled into their own regions and left each other mostly alone so there shouldnt be a problem not too many folk wanted war to break out because of a silly border incident the passage was marked by green glow as long as they stayed on that they would be left alone it was like an enchanted path on the surface there would be camping sites with food and potable water gloha had been a bit distressed by the description of the water until trent explained that this meant a clean drinking pot not the other kind of pot the first checkpoint they came to was in demon country there was a demon at a desk he had a broadbrimmed blue hat and huge flat feet whatcha business he demanded from the side of his mouth were going to the surface trent replied the demon surveyed them there was barely room for his gaze to get out from under his visor oh yeah manface trent gave the correct answer according to the protocol yeah i havent seen any of you before we havent seen you before either the demon considered that you wouldnt know me because id have been in a different form he puffed into a swirl of smoke to illustrate the point but youd have known us if youd seen us the demon reformed hat and all right he did not seem to be the smartest of his kind pass then just keep your noses clean my nose isnt dirty gloha protested the demon merely looked at her as if she had said something stupid that made her suspect she had they went on through the demon settlement demons didnt need houses because they had no set mortal forms and didnt need food because they didnt eat but they did have a culture of a sort gloha understood that there was even a demon university where magic was taught and of course the demons operated the companions game which allowed selected mundanes to visit xanth if they didnt bother regular folk but exactly what their culture was no one could be sure maybe it was all pretense to deceive observers demons sometimes amused themselves by fooling mortals so when colored balloons floated by and popped into smoke that formed into faces with glistening tongues and teeth that then threatened to bite the heads off the travelers gloha knew to ignore them when the path ahead became a writhing mass of serpent coils with dirty noses on each loop gloha walked on without hesitation though conscious of the tease when giant eyes opened on the floor looking up and winking she hesitated she was still wearing her skirt suppose a demon announced the color of her panties oh are you concerned about the footing on the stareway trent inquired thats readily taken care of he picked up a handful of sand and threw it across the floor the eyes blinked madly turned red teared and finally had to close and fade out now im sure the footing is better it is thank you she replied with a smile there was a swirl of vapor it formed into a rather pretty nude human female figure why id almost think that was magician trent except for the age the demoness said but it couldnt be because trent is mortal and just about ready to kick the cask the what gloha asked basin tub pail vessel can receptacle bucket trent offered helpfully whatever the demoness said crossly what are you several mortal creatures doing here in the demon realm you must be metria gloha exclaimed ive heard of you of course im metria the demoness replied i always have been and always will be except when im not how did you hear of me crombie told me how he knew you when he was young he said you wouldnt show him your panties well of course i wouldnt metria said indignantly do you think im a perverse youre a what contrary obstinate balky willfull disagreeable intractable i think you mean youre not abusive of family conventions trent said whatever she agreed crossly would you show a child your panty i would not trent said with a remarkably uncurved complexion or an antlery teenage male by no means so there a matching skirt and blouse outfit appeared on her body and sure enough no panty ever showed so who are you really why do you want to know he asked in return im chronically curious why else i am magician trent but i explained why you arent him didnt i i took youth elixir but only the good magician humfrey and some unicorns know where the fountain of youth is and theyll never tell humfrey gave me some elixir i dont believe it hes too grumpy transform somebody trent gestured the demoness became a blue toad with green warts the toad puffed into smoke i didnt mean me the smoke protested in a moment the nude human figure was back without panties but i suppose i can take your identity on faith who are these winged monsters i am gloha harpygoblin and i am cynthia centaur the demoness squinted at them i dont think ive seen many of your kind before just che centaurs family is it a nice family cynthia asked you dont know thats interesting the demoness faded out shes somewhat of a nuisance trent remarked but theres nothing to be done about her she seldom does actual harm at least i thought she had been locked into the companions game gloha said remembering something she had once heard a puff of smoke reappeared i served my time and got out on parole it disappeared gloha made a mental note one could never be quite certain that a demon wasnt still around they walked on out of the demon realm there were no more odd events evidently the demons had gotten bored with them that was a relief the fungus along the marked route turned brownish the air became chill gloha closed her wings closely around her body insulating it with the feathers cynthia suffered less because she had more furry mass but she did take a jacket out of her backpack and put it on over her shirt to protect her maidenly human torso evidently she had never adopted the centaur mode of undress after gaining some experience with the form and had retained some of her clothing in case of need trent already competently garbed seemed to have no problem the air proceeded from chill to frigid patches of frost appeared the three stepped up the pace so as to warm themselves by the vigor of their exertion gloha would have been concerned if she didnt see that the trailmarking fungus continued though now dark and dormant they turned a corner entered a moderately large chamberand came facttosnoot with a dragon the creature had antennae instead of eyes which made sense down here but in other respects seemed formidable enough it had dragonly form and mass metallic overlapping dark graygreen scales stoutly taloned feet one and a half squintillion teeth and an attitude it moved forward inhaling growling inwardly wait trent cried advancing to meet it we have a pass for this path too late the dragon exhaled a surge of snowy vapor blew him back ice crystallized on his body he fell back into the girls completely iced its a snow dragon gloha exclaimed appalled as the two of them automatically caught him before he hit the floor and shattered i thought all of them were white and in the winter mountains dont worry about that cynthia said just get him back to safety and get him thawed she was right they dragged the ice man back the way they had come away from the dragon cynthia did most of the work being much larger than gloha when they were around the corner and in a section of the tunnel too small for the bulk of the dragon they laid him carefully on the floor is he gloha asked appalled not if we act promptly cynthia said the ice is on the outside if we chip it off immediately he shouldnt freeze inside they chipped at his body and chunks of ice fell to the floor with tinkling sounds but his facewe must clear that so he can breathe gloha said but we cant just pound off the ice wed chip off his nose and lips too youre right we need to apply fast gentle warmth i think this means i have a pretext to do what i would have liked to do a yeari mean seventyone or two years ago gloha was bemused you meant yes she said with naughty determination im going to kiss him its hi a decent cause even if its not completely nice cynthia suited action to word she reached down put her hands on the magicians shoulders and hauled him up with the kind of strength a centaur could muster he rose boardstiff his feet still on the floor then she put her head down aligned her face with his and planted her lips very firmly on his for a wild wet kiss after a moment she lifted her head hy hips are hrozen she gasped in a quarter of a moment gloha made sense of this your lips are frozen she repeated id better take over while you recover hyes the layer of ice was flaking off cynthias face but her lips remained attractively blue gloha stood ontiptoe to reach the magicians angled face and planted her warm lips against his slightly thawed ones she kissed him as firmly as she could the cold struck through but as her lips congealed she felt his softening it was working when she felt she had no more warmth in that region to give she withdrew and was gratified to see a thin trace of vapor issue from his mouth he was starting to breathe again meanwhile cynthia had been breathing hard and smacking her lips together to get them warmed she couldnt use her hands because they were holding trent up for the kissing i think i can go another round now she said bravely she put her mouth to his mouth again glohas hands were free and she used them to waggle her lips and flake the ice off them then she flexed them and breathed rapidly using the warm air to complete the job by the time her mouth had recovered cynthias had iced up again but now trents mouth was clear of ice and his breath was pluming nicely so gloha tackled his right eye instead which was frozen shut she kissed it and as the warmth loosened the ice she licked it off when it finally opened and blinked she knew it was thawed but her mouth had congealed again and her tongue wasnt speaking to her good idea cynthia said his mouth is done and part of his tongue but he needs his eyes too she kissed the left eye his tongue gloha didnt inquire after that they worked on his nose and his ears and finally his face was done then they worked on the remainder of his body taking turns hugging him close and chipping away the rest of the ice as it thawed his clothing was hardly even wet they had managed to get most of the ice off before it did more man melt around the edges trent moved hthank you hladies he said somewhat coldly but the coldness was of the body not of the heart there are whorse things than being khissed and hugged to ihife by two ihovely young lhadies gloha and cynthia exchanged a solid glance and a half then they exchanged a halfbody flush that was a significant achievement for each of them because the centaurs clothing and fur normally concealed any such expression and glohas skin was goblin dark but in a moment steam was rising from both their faces dont waste that heat trent cried im still cold indeed he was shivering in for a nickel in for a dime cynthia said through her burning chagrin she was referring to archaic mundane coins reported to have the magic properties of getting things started or suddenly stopped they hauled the magician up again and hugged him from either side giving him the heat of their embarrassment soon enough he had been warmed i thank you both for saving my life he said but perhaps we wont speak of this elsewhere others migrlt not properly understand they emphatically agreed it would be their secret but even more secret was glohas private feeling she had never actually kissed a man of any kind before not directly on the mouth like that and certainly had never done anything like licking off his face trent rejuvenated as he was had the body of a handsome young man now she realized that she had on some suitably hidden level rather liked the experience she suspected that cynthia had also for she had admitted to being flustered by the magicians aspect when she had first encountered him she might be a centaur now but she retained her origin and upper front section as a human maiden so perhaps she had had her revenge on trent if that was what it was this had perhaps given each of them a taste of what it would be like to get really friendly with males of their own kind but now trent continued evincing the quality of leadership that made him a man not to mention a former magicianking we need to deal with that dragon yes they agreed together evincing the quality of agreeability that made them innocent maidens however much that innocence had been stained by the recent event i can of course transform it into something harmless being now warned about its nature but i dont want to do mischief by acting hastily i did enough of that when i was as young as i now look he glanced significantly at cynthia who then demonstrated that she had not expended quite all of her color before do you think it was a misunderstanding and the dragon iced me before realizing that we had a pass gloha considered i think the dragon could have sent another cold draft down this tunnel and frozen us all if it had wanted to so maybe it was a misunderstanding yes that makes sense cynthia agreed maybe we should give it another chance but if it inhales ill transform it trent said grimly they advanced tentatively around the corner again the dragon was there i say old chapwe have a pass you know the magician said the dragon nodded its snoot was not crafted for apology but it was evidently making the effort so if you will just let us pass without molestation well just forget this little misunderstanding trent continued the dragon nodded again so the three of them approached it but gloha noted that the magicians hand was ready to gesture just in case she doubted that it was the gesture that did it probably the motion was just to get his hand within transformation range of the target but it was clear that trent was not one to be caught twice the same way he might look yomig but he had the better part of a centurys experience which might be the reason crombies magic had pointed him out to help on this quest gloha was a trifle short on experience and this more than made up the difference the dragon did not try to frost them again so trent did not transform it they passed it and entered a new network of tunnels but the dormant green glow fungus still marked the trail and the farther they got beyond the snow dragons lair the warmer the air got and the healthier the fungus became in fact the environment went from chill to warm to sweaty cynthia removed her jacket and packed it away retaining the shirt true centaurs were of course completely unselfconscious about their bodies and showed things and did things openly that the adult conspiracy forbade to straight humans but as a transformee cynthia had more of the human foibles than did most centaurs or she would not have been embarrassed about having to kiss the magician back to life gloha as a firstgeneration crossbreed was uncertain exactly what social hangups she was expected to have so followed the human ones until she had reason otherwise the air got downright hot both cynthia and gloha flapped their wings to keep their bodies cool and trent looked as if he would have liked to remove some clothing if this got any worse they would have to have a discussion about whether there were special cases where nudity was tolerable were they walking into the lair of a firedrake dragon no it turned out to be a fire pit without a dragon dark liquid bubbled up from nether crevices and formed burning pools the marked path skirted it by digging a small ledge into the side of the wall but there was room in the cavern for gloha and cynthia to fly so they had no trouble trent was the one who had to navigate the inadequate trail if only you could transform yourself the way dolph can gloha told him dolph cynthia inquired his grandson prince dolph who can change to any living form he wishes gloha explained hes the same age i am but hes already married and they have twins she tried to keep the envy out of her voice without a whole lot of success so magician trent is a greatgrandfather yes but i dont think anyone we meet will believe that they both laughed as they hovered it was good to be flying again however briefly that was another thing that cynthia had clearly learned to do before she retired to the brain corals pool maybe that was why she had decided to remain in this form it did have an ability that her original form had lacked gloha could not imagine life without flight she would rather die than lose her wings meanwhile the man was trying to stay on the tiny path with diminishing success there just wasnt enough room for his shoes he was too likely to fall off it and roll down the steep slope of the wall right into the fire he paused how do you fly cynthia he called you transformed me and you dont know i just flap my wings and take off the reason i inquire is that i have heard that the other winged centaur family has the magic of making things light by flicking them with their tails when they flick flies the flies become too light to stay perched and fly away when they flick themselves they become light enough for their relatively small wings to lift when they flick a person that person becomes light enough to be carried if you can do that with me you can carry me across his hot cavern no i dont flick myself except to tag flies and thats not to make them light but to knock them off cynthia said i never get light and cant make anything else light i just fly perhaps we should verify this he got down off the path and quickly retreated to the end of the cavern before his feet got too burningly hot from the stone cynthia flicked him with her tail he did not get light then he tried holding on to her as she tried to fly but she couldnt get aloft her wings sent a powerful draft of air down enough to lift her but not enough to lift very much else it was evident that her magic was different from that of the other winged centaurs her magic was in the power of the downdraft she made to lift her up thats interesting gloha remarked he transformed you and must have given you the magic to fly yet he didnt know how it worked that is the case trent agreed i dont understand my talent i just invoke it but this leaves me with a problem i just dont see how i can use that little walkway maybe if you flew alongside him and pushed him against the wall gloha suggested so he couldnt fall they tried it but it was problematical because cynthia needed room for her wings she tried facing away from the wall so that her rump could brace trent and that worked but then she couldnt fly sideways to pace him across the cavern gloha was too small to help at all could you transform one of us into a form that would be able to help gloha asked would you want to be transformed he countered you know you could find your ideal man quite readily if i transformed you to a suitable form oh no i like the way i am she protested i dont want to change i want to succeed in life my way but for just a temporary time i maybe could stand it a cloud of smoke appeared before her a mouth opened on its vague surface you fool i didnt ask you metria gloha retorted beginning to understand how a person could become annoyed with the demoness then i wont tell you how to get him safely by the smoke said and dissipated how about a vine trent asked you could take root at one end and cynthia could hold the tip of the vine at the other end and i could use it as a rail to hold a plant gloha asked dismayed she hadnt thought of that and probably never would have the rocks too hot cynthia pointed out the plant would wilt a flame vine wouldnt thats right cynthia agreed surprised both of them looked at gloha she really didnt care for the notion but saw no polite way out she was about to say a grudging yes when a realization saved her you cant transform me when im out of your reach right but i have to be all the way across the cavern no you could be this side and i could fly you to the other side cynthia said helpfully or you could carry her to the other side to take root trent said make sure there is a suitable place first the centaur flew across yes theres even some nice warm dirt here she reported it looks quite rich maybe bats have enhanced it bats gloha exclaimed indignantly but she realized that she was stuck for it all right she murmured hoping she wouldnt be heard no such luck trent reached toward her and suddenly she was a thing of flames and tentacles and leaves she felt very insecure because her roots didnt have much purchase she was indeed a flame vine she wasnt actually burning she was merely firecolored with the capacity to generate small flames at the tips of her leaves if she chose then cynthia picked her up and carried her across the cavern it was pleasantly warm in the center then cool again at the edge the centaur set her down on a patch of what her roots tasted as volcanic soil that was ideal she sank her roots deep and proceeded to grow she focused on one long vine sending it along the wall above the path wherever she found a crevice she ran a tendril in anchoring it she put out regularly spaced leaves to take in the radiation of the fire along the cavern floor it tasted almost as good as the soil this was fun soon she was all the way across solidly anchored all the way she didnt need cynthia to hold her end no one was going to pull her off that wall until she let go of it herself for one tiling there were tasty minerals in that wall she waved a tendril at the magician get on with it he set out again along the path he put a hand on her vineand quickly removed it he dug into his own pack and fetched out a pair of heavy gloves then wearing these he tried again and this time was able to maintain a grip on her hot vine toward the center where the ledge got thinnest he had to hold on quite firmly but she strengthened her tendril anchors and stayed firm then he reached the near side thank you gloha he said now i will change you back but first we must get you all together because otherwise parts of you may be stuck to the wall gloha saw the logic cynthia flew back and carefully pulled the long vine out as gloha released her tendril grip stage by stage cynthia collected the vine in a bundle and flew slowly back with it as more was released gloha hated to do it because there was still plenty of nutritious mineral there but she suspected that her winged goblin form would be annoyed if she didnt of course why anyone would want to be a goblin when she could be a flame vine then she was herself again complete with her blouse and skirt in place she quailed at the thought of remaining a flame vine obviously a winged goblin was better yet now she could appreciate the differing perspective of the plant each form of life found itself marvelously compatible and distrusted all others perhaps she should try to remember that lesson of life if she didnt get distracted by more important things they moved on following the passage generally down it didnt seem to be in any great hurry to reach the surface now they entered a region of stalagstalacthose pointed pillarlike things that lived in caves stalagmites and stalactites trent said my these are very thickand look where the path goes how can you remember the difference cynthia asked him i mean between the ones that cling to the ceiling and the ones that grow up from the ground the magician laughed you have solved the riddle already the ceilingclinging ones are spelled with a c for ceiling and the groundgrowing ones with a g for ground stalactite and stalagmite i think the other distinguishing letters t and m also indicate it t is for top but i forget what m is for the ball of smoke appeared moron it inquired he batted a hand through it and it dissipated leaving a dirty smell it seemed that the demoness had not quite lost interest in them and naturally she couldnt get the word mound cynthia suggested whatever gloha agreed trying to look cross but the effect was spoiled when they both giggled but they had a more serious problem to concern them the c tites and g mites were so thickly spread that it was impossible to squeeze between them the fungus path went across the points coating the upwardand downwardpointing tips there was room between them for the girls to fly but trent was out of luck again i am beginning to wonder what the advantage is to being human he remarked the problem is not in being human gloha said it is in being wingless if you had wings youd be all right thank you he said she realized that there was more than one way her statement could be taken and she felt another faint flush trying to form fortunately she hadnt enough left to embarrass her maybe i can clear a path through these cynthia said she faced away from the wall of g mites then let fly with a wellplaced kick the nearest mite broke off and toppled crashing down between the others but almost immediately there was a shower of spearlike c tites from above the three mortal creatures barely got out of the way in time to avoid getting skewered i think we would never be able to clear that path trent said this cave protects its own maybe we can find another way gloha said she flew up and between the needlelike tips of the upper and lower fields of stalacs and stalags careful not to touch any of them but all she found beyond was a passage angling up to a mediumsmall river going merrily about its own business there was no other exit the passage continued along the river she flew back and reported i am beginning to wonder whether we are on the right trail she concluded this one seems entirely too difficult for human folk to manage its hard to believe that tandy traveled this way alone i suspect she had her ogre husband along before trent said these hazards would not have dared to interfere with an ogre that seemed to make sense but meanwhile what were they going to do this cave seemed to be even less passable than the others you say theres a river cynthia asked do you suppose it could be diverted it seemed pretty selfabsorbed oh you mean to change its channel i suppose thats possible one bank was sandy but that would just make it flow into this cave and fill it up yes then maybe trent could swim between the tites and mites without disturbing any of them trent considered do you know you may be almost as smart as you are pretty i think it could be done cynthias powers of coloration had evidently regenerated without impairment she might once have been the magicians enemy but that was a long time ago now it was clear that she found him rather intriguing gloha found it easy to appreciate the feeling trent was handsome intelligent experienced disciplined and had one of the strongest magic talents in xanth there wasnt a lot more required of a man gloha flew back to the river she landed on its bank and used her fine little feet to scuff a channel in the sand the water flowed eagerly through it and plunged down into the cave it widened the channel as it went so that more water could follow soon the entire river was headed for this interesting new region forming an expanding pool around the base of the g mites she flew back i have diverted the river and it seems to be quite entertained she reported we suspected as much trent said dryly which was a good trick because he was standing kneedeep in the pool the river disported itself mightily and the level of the pool steadily rose gloha and cynthia hovered over it are you going to be all right gloha asked the magician oh certainly i can swim you girls go ahead and wait on dry land ill be along in due course they did as bid for hovering soon enough became tiring hes a brave man cynthia said as they flew and a marvelous magician gloha agreed its hard to imagine that they ever called him evil oh that was because he was trying to take over xanth before the storm king was ready to fade out and he was transforming a lot of people but i gather he was a good king when he finally got the office yes xanth has prospered binks son dor and trents daughter irene have done well too i guess it shows that you never can tell how things will turn out you never can tell cynthia agreed wistfully they landed on the dry part of the bank then watched the water rise around the g mites every so often one of them flew back to check on the magician who was doing what he called treading water though it looked exactly like swimming in place at last the water covered the tiptops of the g mites so that only the descending points of the c cites showed above it now the cave looked like a dragons mouth half full of saliva but gloha wasnt entirely comfortable with that image so let it go trent came swimming along having no trouble only at the end did one of his feet accidentally kick a hidden g mite the pool shook and several c tites dropped into the water with menacing splashes but trent had already gotten clear they moved on again the river path deserted the river having no loyalty and wended its way up to another large cave this one was domeshaped with a single massive stalagmite in the center there was neither dragon nor fire here the floor was bare but there was also no exit the glowfungus path went to the center and stopped they looked all around but the wall was solid the only hole in it was the one through which they had entered the circular wall was painted with pictures of assorted creatures dragons griffins chimerae sea serpents sphinxes and the like nothing really unusual here and there were even some men with spears do you know this must be an ancient cave trent said these are the creatures the early men of xanth hunted they painted pictures of them to be sure of the magic necessary to bring them down or perhaps it was opposite they were working magic to protect themselves from such predators either way this is a historic artifact how could they hunt such creatures down here gloha asked all weve seen are dragons perhaps they hunted all the others to extinction or perhaps the dragons hunted the humans to extinction cynthia said because no men seem to live here now you have a sobering point he agreed but how are we going to get out of here before were extinct gloha asked plaintively trent grimaced that is a somewhat better question than i feel competent to address at the moment then cynthia noticed something the glowfungus path doesnt stop here it circles up the stalagmite they looked and found it was so the fungus spiraled right up toward the distant ceiling and there at the very top was a hole the g mite poked a short way into it and theres our exit the magician said and once again i feel inadequate to the need i dont believe i can climb that smooth column and this time there is no water to float me up but this time you can use your talent cynthia said simply transform me into something huge enough to lift you up there then transform me back to this form i can if you wish this he agreed you have been most generous in your attitude toward me considering our prior experience and i have not wished to impose on you by transforming you again well a lot has happened since then and were not on opposite sides any more she said with a smile that might in some other circumstance have seemed ingratiating now we have to work together to get through we do at that he agreed very well ill transform you to a roc which should be strong enough to carry me thete but we shall need to calculate this carefully for if i then transform you back before you are through the hole you could fall and such a fall could kill her gloha realized then she realized that she had fallen into a mental trap a flying centaur wouldnt fall she would just fly away but the hole looked way too small for such a creature to squeeze through so there was still a problem but she had an answer then you transform her to a little bird who can fly on up through the hole then back to centaur form when she is safe you too are uncommonly clever trent told her gloha discovered that she had not after all used up her own store of blush then the magician gestured and the centaur became a truly monstrous bird the roc took the suddenly tinyseeming man in its ferociously huge beak spread its giant pinions and launched into the air now there was an act of trust gloha realized the bird could cut the man in half simply by closing its beak it flew up circling the stalagmite until it reached the top then it flipped its head opened its beak and the man sailed up through the hole he didnt fall out again so he must have landed somewhere now the roc flew as close to the hole in the ceiling as possible without colliding with the stalagmite the tip of one wing brushed past the holeand the big bird vanished in its place was a tiny hummingbird gloha had been halfway keeping pace staying clear of the immense downdraft from the rocs wings now she flew up through the hole herself there were trent and cynthia waiting for her see it was routine the centaur filly said nonchalantly as she let go of the man he must have held her steady as he transformed her or perhaps she had clung to him for balance as she adjusted trent smiled obliquely routine he agreed but gloha was seriously wondering how many more such tricky transitions they would be able to make this did not strike her as a safe or easy route it was more like trying to gain entry to the good magicians castle but she didnt want to alarm the others so she kept her meek little mouth shut about that and whatever else she might conjecture about that wasnt her business they moved on again this time the passage led to a snoozing goblin ahem trent said the goblin rolled over on his mat go away dunderhead he muttered without opening his eyes i presume this is the goblin checkpoint trent said we want you to be sure you know that we have a safe conduct pass the goblins forced open an eye then suddenly both eyes wedged wide what are you creatures doing here we are on our way out of the underworld trent said evenly we are following the established exit route for which we have a pass he showed the pass but thats impossible we changed the route so nobody could get through trent gloha and cynthia shared three halves of a glance suddenly something was making sense goblin mischief the magician turned back to the goblin and why would you change the path he inquired with truly deceptive mildness because we dont honor any deals made by the crappy saps who ran this region before we got here but we didnt want to say so outright before we got really well established so we could claim that travelers just got lost or something in case the demons snooped and the regular path is easier to travel of course it is yokel it just winds straight up past the checkpoints to the surface but now well erase that and eat any more travelers who come pass or not that could plunge the underworld into war after decades of peace yeah the goblin said zestfully so now get ready for the pot because were going to stew you three for supper better take off your packs and clothes they dont boil well he squinted at them one dumb human man one stupid winged goblin girloh well have fun with you before we cut off those wingsand one idiotic winged centaur filly then the goblin did a double take a winged centaur we hate winged centaurs ever since that little snoop came to goblin mountain and made it possible for a girl to be chief what a pain we real heman goblins just had to get the hades out of there and find a place to regroup oh well pull out your feathers one by one and make you hurt worse and worse until youre just begging to be dumped into the boiling pot what a treat we have coming gloha felt an awful chill and she could tell that cynthia was experiencing the same ugly draft but the magician seemed oddly unconcerned gloha was pretty sure that was misleading she hoped and this path now goes straight on up to the surface trent inquired conversationally no more hazards sure but you wont be taking it manpuss because were closing the gate you might as well eat that pass before we feed it to you and you are the only goblin guarding this path right the goblin paused except for the other hundred that moved in while we were talking he waved and suddenly the passage beyond was crammed with goblins carrying spears and clubs you thought maybe youd just run over me and be gone meatman youre even dumber than you look gloha felt a worse chill suddenly they were faced with bad faithbecause of bad goblins who had fled the enlightened female chiefship of cousinonceremoved gwenny and come here to establish their evil order she knew the three could expect no mercy because she knew what goblin men were like in their natural state this was doom i take it that you dont know who i am trent said seeming unperturbed human scum i am proud to tell you i have no idea who you are and dont care to soil my mind learning youll taste just as good as anyone else once we add the spices now get those clothes off before we hack them off i am magician trent perhaps you have heard of me of course i never heard of you crapbrain and even if i had i he paused who the magician of transformation the goblin began to sidle away it dont mean nothing to me youre probably lying anyway trent strode forward gesturing the goblin became a large purple snake with venom dripping from its fangs now go greet your comrades trent said but the snake did not flee instead it slithered toward the magician gloha realized that the change of form did not stop it from being an enemy any more than her change of form had stopped her from being a friend trents magic could not change personality the purple snake became a pink elephant the kind of monster that drunks dreamed of but the passage was not large enough for it so it filled the space completely blocking off the other goblins but it also blocked off the easy escape route to the singlegmite chamber we need another exit the magician said mildly gloha can you find your way through goblin tunnels yes but there will be enemy goblins in them theyll attack us from ambush before you can transform them theyll throw stones from beyond your range i dont think we can get through them what about some passage they wont use they can go anywhere we can because you cant fly she hated to bring that liability up to him again but it was unfortunately true then find a passage you two can use and they cant ill keep them from following if they make the attempt he was offering to sacrifice himself so that the two of them could escape gloha knew she wouldnt accept that and she thought cynthia wouldnt either in fact she was pretty almost certainly sure cynthia wouldnt but there was no point in arguing about that right now she peered down the passages that debouched from this region already she heard the sounds of goblins running through passages closing in on this one by devious routes then she spied a goblin sign i see a forbidden tunnel she cried this way she ran toward it why is it forbidden cynthia asked as she trotted after her i dont know but it means that goblins wont use it and thats what we want they entered the tunnel as goblins appeared in the one behind them this one was well lighted by fungus and big enough for them all to use comfortably which made gloha wonder because both the man and the centaur were twice the height of any goblin why should such a large tunnel be forbidden if they were afraid to use it why hadnt they blocked it off it led fairly directly to another large cavern whose base was filled with water that was all there was no offshoot passages just the quiet pool the goblins are afraid of this cynthia asked perplexed yes gloha said i dont understand why if there were any really bad monster here they would have blocked off the tunnel so that it couldnt come out after them instead they merely marked it forbidden this is distinctly odd but it doesnt mean that its safe for us or that it is any way out just that they wont be coming in here cynthia peered across the dark water i think i see something they all peered it looks furry gloha said the thing came toward them indeed it was furry in fact it seemed tobe a big ball of fur but when it got close it opened a furry mouth that seemed somewhat bigger than it was and snapped with large furry teeth sparks flew as the teeth clashed together this is not a place to swim trent said i gather the fur monster does not leave the water that means that the goblins dont need to fear it coming after them they just have to stay clear of its pool yes that would explain the simple warning sign gloha agreed goblins are lazy they dont do anything they dont have to if theres no need to block off a tunnel they wont bother so they just posted the warning and let it be but this doesnt look like enough to back off a whole goblin tribe cynthia said the creature is hardly half as massive as i am thats enough to gobble up any goblin that might fall in the water or be thrown in trent suggested but the tribe could gather and throw a barrage of spears at it from the edge gloha finished youre right goblins are lazy but in a case like this their meanness should make up for it they should take pleasure in attacking it from the safety of the shore just because its there there must be something more and we had better find out what it is trent said his mildness fading now that there was no one close by who needed deceiving now i can transform this creature into something innocuous but i dont know whether its the only one or what else may be lurking near i am not comfortable with this the man was a master of understatement i suppose you could transform me into something that shouldnt fear the furball gloha said like maybe an allegory then i could explore the depths of the pool to see if theres any exit from it there doesnt seem to be any above or around it lets not act too quickly if we dont have to trent said i have learned to be careful about what i dont understand there is a mystery about this pool that the presence of a monster doesnt satisfactorily explain cynthia leaned forward over the water and dipped the tip of a finger immediately the furball shot through the water and snapped at her hand oh she cried whipping it away that thing is fast gloha said its not that that water stings she brought her finger to her mouth dont do that trent snapped startling her that water may be poison oh she repeated staring at her hurting finger gloha brought out a handkerchief there is a bit of healing elixir in this she said she used it to wipe off the finger which she saw was already blistering poison indeed oh thank you cynthia said that feels so much better so now we know another reason why the goblins avoid this pool trent said it is poison water the fur monster must be specially adapted to it still im not sure we have fathomed the whole of this unpleasant mysteryand i think we shall have to if we want to pass through this pool to escape this region how can we know there is any way out under the pool gloha asked there might be underwater caves that dont go anywhere i see no water dripping down from the dome above it yet the pool is not brackish or cloudy it seems to be fresh water such as it is that suggests that there is a wellspring somewhere below the surface if we find that inlet it may be our outlet i suppose gloha said dubiously we certainly dont seem to have any other way out but we canf go through poisoned water cynthia protested i wonder trent said thoughtfully it seems unlikely that it would be poisoned by contact with the local rock because then other waters in the region should suffer a similar effect and we have not noted this that river we diverted was quite pure i think the goblins would not have poisoned it because that just makes it useless to them that suggests that this pool is magically poisoned magically poisoned gloha exclaimed you mean like some pools are love springs and some are hate springs and some are youth springs or healing springs and so onthis one is a poison spring something like that he agreed if it did not wish to be molested by goblins this device would be effective it certainly would gloha agreed but that stops us from molesting it too but perhaps we can make a deal with it sometimes the inanimate has special desires you mean things that arent alive like pools want things cynthia asked my soninlaw dor has the ability to talk with the inanimate it is clear from his experience that inanimate things have concerns just as animate ones do we lack the ability to communicate as he does unfortunately but maybe we can handle it we can talk to water gloha asked as doubtful as cynthia stones might be considered individual entities but water was just fluid perhaps i suspect that the fur monster understands the pool and perhaps it will tell us what the pool desires that we might provide both girls looked at him not trusting this suppose i transform one of you into a similar furball also immune to the poison he said i can do this despite not really knowing its nature because my talent takes care of the details then you could communicate with it get some answers and perhaps make a deal you transformed cynthia last time gloha said its my turn she hardly believed that this would work but what other hope was there the magician approached her and gestured suddenly she was a hairy furball she rolled into the pool with a satisfying splash the water felt wonderful the other furball charged aggressively across its teeth leading the way wait furface she cried in its language which wasnt exactly verbal but which came naturally to her im your kind lets talk youre female the other said amazed im male lets talk first she insisted she hadnt expected this particular complication what about he demanded impatiently about this pool is it magically poisoned of course isnt it great no one else bothers me of course i do get lonely so lets can the magic be nullified so regular creatures could pass through it without getting dissolved sure if aqui wants but whats the point now lets thats the pool aqui sure and im fur we get along great but we get bored with just each others company you know so lets gloha realized that fur had a onetrack mind she probably wouldnt get much help from him until she got his concern settled well she was of age it was more of a sacrifice than she had anticipated but they did have to find a way out of the underworld exactly what is it you want to do she asked guardedly i want to play of course i havent had a playmate in years neither has aqui were getting bored with each other play just how do you mean you know racing around the pool splashing each other playing hideandpeek down below all that fun stuff gloha realized that though she was of age fur wasnt he was still a child and wanted childish play she could readily oblige him in that catch me if you can she cried and took off through the water at a zoom she didnt know exactly how she did it as she had no arms or legs or tail she just moved great he responded and zoomed after her she dived immediately she saw that there was an exit water was flowing in from a hole well below the surface and filtering out through a lattice on the opposite side this was indeed fresh water that surely was as fresh and pure as ever the moment it left the magic ambience of the pool trent had been right about it he seemed to be right about most things but she should make sure so as fur was about to catch up with her she dodged to the side and shot into the spring hey no fair he cried she paused in the current why because that doesnt go anywhere fun just straight up to the outside world i dont want to go there im sorry she said apologetically i didnt realize she shot back down with the current so swiftly that fur wasnt able to tag her before she was past him pokey fur pokey fur she cried am not am not he retorted anyway youre worse how because youre a gurl the term was neither written nor verbal but he managed to misspell it anyway she paused as if stricken oh my youre right how can i ever live it down he was immediately contrite aw i didnt mean it you cant help it im sorry thats okay she said generously then seizing the moment if you two had a nice new playmate to stay here would you let three funny creatures go by a playmate to stay gee yes then check with aqui while i check with my folks she said she realized that it was best to be positive and assertive when dealing with children and the inanimate okay fur zoomed somewhere down in the depths of the pool while she zoomed for the surface she went to the edge transform me back she cried but she saw the magician hesitate then she realized why he didnt know which fur monster she was so she moved in a pattern across the water gloha she spelled then zoomed back this time there was no hesitation the magician gestured and she was the winged goblin girl again we can make a deal she gasped theres a river out right to the surface but we need to give them a playmate to keep i was thinking maybe you could transform an ant or something into another furball and we may not need to do that trent said we have with us a creature who loves fresh water in what he wishes to be his natural form we do she asked blankly swiftmud cynthia exclaimed i had almost forgotten him but hes not the same species gloha said trent looked around we three are of different species or even five or six species depending how we count it yet we get along swiftmud is quite a character in his natural form when you get to know him lets inquire he brought out the lightning bug set it carefully on the floor and suddenly the giant mud bank was there taking up the tunnel behind them swiftie we have a lonely aqui pool and a lonely kid furball he said if you can get along with aqui and fur you may stay here your service to us done swiftmud promptly slid into the pool without making a splash he seemed to have no trouble with the poison fur appeared the two would have sniffed noses if either had a nose then they began frolicking in the water swiftmud no longer constrained by having to stay on the surface carrying other folk dived and swirled became a cloud of dirty water then formed back into a mud bank fur circled around him then rolled over him and splashed back into the water on the other side the ball was having a ball i think we have our answer the magician said of course well have to make our way by foot and wing when we reach the surface but i had told swiftmud that if he served us loyally i would see that he found a compatible situation he really does like fresh water hed take all of it if he could how will we get through the lake and the underground river cynthia asked our wings wont be effective and we wont be able to breathe you two will have no trouble ill change you to fish it is myself i am worried about maybe we could help you if we were the right kind of fish gloha said lungfish maybe for breathing lungfish heagreed that would do it he leaned down and touched his finger to the water it is safe now aqui is satisfied with the deal gloha and cynthia verified that the water was no longer poisonous then trent transformed them both to lungfish and they flopped into the water gloha discovered that she liked this form too each form that she assumed had its own virtues and there was much to be said for being a fish in water cynthia seemed similarly satisfied then trent dived into the pool he swam down to the river hole and into it the two fish showing the way then cynthia swam up to his face and put her mouth to his it looked like a very solid kiss and maybe cynthia thought of it that way but it was more she used her lungs to breathe some fresh air into him her gills were enough for herself they swam on upstream gloha took her turn planting her mouth on the mans mouth and giving him another lungful of air she found it was fun thinking of it as a deep kiss of course she would never admit to enjoying such illicit contact with a male of another species any more than cynthia would but its secret nature added to its appeal in this manner they continued until the light of day showed ahead and the magician reached the surface he clambered out then reached over the water to transform them to their regular forms they came out shaking their wings dry their clothing would take longer they were by a small river that tunneled into a gully now they knew where it was going meanwhile they were back on the surface of xanth it was wonderful xxxxxxx ive lost my direction gloha said dismayed as they dried in the sun they had agreed that technically they were of three different species so need have no concern about each others exposure nevertheless they studiously avoided looking glohas sneak peeks indicated that trent at least was honoring that tacit agreement i got all turned around on the way out of the underworld and dont know which way crombie pointed it was southeast trent said back toward lake ogrechobee ohmaybe thats why he pointed you out to help me she said because you would remember that must be it he agreed with part of a smile then this must be where we part company cynthia said seeming not completely pleased because i must go find the winged centaur family not yet the magician said i undertook to get you safely to a compatible situation since i know where that is i believe i should complete that task before seeing to glohas more mysterious quest yes gloha said quickly she liked cynthia and wanted to be sure she was all right also she was a bit wary of her quest and not as eager to get on with it as she thought she should be she wasnt quite sure she should travel alone with trent and this wasnt because she thought he would do anything untoward not at all so this was an excellent pretext for delay you are very kind cynthia said she would have been clearly relieved but her eyes were tearing a bit so she was cloudily relieved it is the least i can do for someone who has kissed me as often and firmly as you have cynthia seemed to be learning how to handle his teasing because her flush progressed to no more than pale pink this time and no farther down than her bare breasts gloha was glad the remark hadnt been directed at her so she didnt have to flush similarly despite being as guilty of such kissing as cynthia the winged centaur family is north of the gap chasm gloha said the two of us could fly there but that wont work for you magician i regret being such a drag on this party trent said it reminds me of when i traveled with bink and chameleon when they were young i rather interfered with their progress too for a while well you were evil then werent you cynthia inquired so i was called but i think i dont need to hold you folk back i can transform one of you into a roc again and you can carry me there he glanced at the sky its about noon now i lost track of time below but we can make better progress now and be there before the day is out cynthia sent a wavering glance out gloha intercepted it and sent it back suddenly she realized that neither one of them was quite ready to end this segment of their journey it wasnt exactly uncertainty about their respective futures though that helped and not exactly that the youthened magician trent was pleasant company though that also helped they just werent yet ready to end this interlude for reasons that were surely best left unfathomed lets just remain with our own forms for a while gloha said cynthia needs practice in todays xanth as you wish he agreed i merely did not wish to delay either of you we can proceed north at my limited pace in due course rneir clothing was mostly dry and they took turns dressing while the others tried not to peek too much their packs remained damp but would probably survive they set off following the stream which moved generally north and northwest cynthia and gloha remained on the ground since they were the ones who had declined the chance to become big enough to carry the magician through the air there turned out to be interesting things down here such as colored stones in the streambed and pretty flowers along the bank each of mem picked a pink flower to put in her hair then they picked two blue flowers for trents hair so no one will confuse you with a girl gloha explained lightly kissing his left ear to make the flower stay in place or a winged monster cynthia added kissing his right ear for a similar reason if i did not know better id suspect one of you of flirting with me he responded unfortunately i cant tell which one well never tell they said together not even bothering to blush the stream climbed a hill then relaxed by filling in a pool there by a ledgelike bank in the pool were three young female human heads one was blond with her long fair tresses artfully obliterating her right eye on their way down one was red with her hair spreading out across the ledge in front the third was dark graybrown with hanks of hair swirling tantalizingly across her heaving bosom all three had eyes as deep and blue as the very freshest water eeeek people the blond screamed cutely not sounding frightened then as gloha and cynthia crested the hill the redhead clarified it two half people female i can tell by theif pink flowers she sounded disappointed and one straight human man the brunette said i can tell by his blue flowers she sounded interested and who are you trent inquired in friendly fashion but gloha saw that he was casually moving to within transformation range he was not the most trusting person which was just as well merely three beautifully bored mermaids the blonde said as the three lifted their tails behind them ash cedar and mahogany im ash of course who are you who come to us with your ears kissed trent gloha and cynthia the magician said im trent you are named for trees gloha asked for colors cedar said making an appealing moue the local wood nymphs got all the water colors so we had to take wood colors we would love to give you a wonderful time trent man but you seem to be already well attended mahogany said we see that your mourn has been rather soundly kissed too however should you too be bored with overly familiar things we are just rapidly passing through cynthia said just possibly not quite pleased by the presence of three more pretty crossbreeds still diversions are seldom and slow ash said can we not persuade you to dally a moment she gave trent a wonderfully liquid look as she lowered her tail and lifted her marvelously full bare breasts from the water only if you have something interesting or useful to offer gloha said somewhat disparagingly her tone was sheer bluff because she knew that never in her wildest fantasy dreams would she have a bosom as globular as that water folk were able to wear more flesh than air folk because it helped them float and didnt help them fly that was one of the unfairness of reality well we do have one talent between the three of us cedar said performing a similar maneuver with slightly better exposure as your brightly kissed eyes may see if you wish she inhaled but do you have a magic talent cynthia inquired knowing that crossbreeds often did not and if they did it was likely to be related to their survival as crossbreeds such as flying for the winged ones why yes mahogany said taking her turn at the maneuver and managing a truly doublebarreled display all three of them were distressingly well endowed in that particular respect we read tides titles trent asked he had perhaps diplomatically stayed clear of much of the prior dialogue though he had kept a firm eye on the proceedings most of the firmness had been elsewhere however whatever tide is written we can read ash explained the three of us have to do it together and we cant read any more than the title but it can nevertheless be interesting trent shook his head we are more interested in making progress toward our destination than in reading tides but now gloha perversely was intrigued what kind of adventures are we in for she inquired trent considered its hard to know since none of us happen to have a talent for seeing the future but sometimes you can get a hint by checking the chapter title of the muse of historys ongoing series on the history of xanth cant you if we could glimpse the current chapter it might save us some complications the magician seemed bemused in theory yes but that presumes that she has already written the chapter i suspect she waits until the action has been finished before describing it but maybe she describes it and then the action happens gloha said doesnt an event have to be scripted before it can happen he shrugged we can try he faced the three mermaids who inhaled in unison at that moment perhaps coincidentally can you read the title of the current chapter of the current volume of history we can try one or more of them echoed with a winning smile they swam together linked hands closed their eyes and concentrated with perfect coordination their three flukes lifted and slapped the water as one in a moment they separated they swam back to their ledge bank and resumed their former display they fixed the magician with three welltempered gazes did you find the right volume he asked after a moment yes ash breathed fetchingly gloha sent half a glance of disgust to cynthia and did you read the right title yes cedar agreed as the surface of the water formed a marvelously rounded decolletage cynthias returning glance was tinged with envy and will you tell us what it is that depends mahogany murmured as innocent little currents in the water managed to carry her decorative tresses away from her heaving bosom so that nothing obscured the view neither glohas nor cynthias glance was able to nudge those tresses back into place and on what does it depend trent asked hardly seeming to be bothered by such irrelevancies as breathing or tresses on hpw long you care to stay to hear it ash said propping her chin on her right hand without interfering half a whit with the view of her left upper quarter that certainly sounds like fun the magician said but i feel i should advise you that i am somewhat older than i may appear we like mature males cedar said her pupils alluringly large in fact i am an old man recently youthened by youth elixir mahogany began to grow cautious how old the wayward currents were now carrying her hair back into place ninetysix all three heads descended into the water before the mermaids recovered equilibrium they emerged with their lustrous hair somewhat matted and their expressions somewhat dissolved true ash asked true gloha and cynthia said together the mermaids torsos seemed to deflate the title is meaningless cedar said how so trent asked seeming as oblivious of their deflation as he was of their prior inflation its just xxxxxxx no words mahogany explained trent shook his head i was afraid of this its like trying to inquire about binks talent something always interferes the muse evidently knew we would look at the title so left it blank we are so sorry you have to go so soon ash said yes so sorry cedar agreed why couldnt you have been younger mahogany asked rhetorically i didnt realize i would be meeting three such intriguing females trent said walking on past the pool just as well cynthia muttered gloha could only agree they followed the stream onward it wound around as if trying to lose them but wasnt successful then a small mean dragon emerged from the brush it eyed them hungrily breathing rapidly to stoke up its fires dragon allow me to show you something the magician said he gestured at a small burrweed that was about to stick a burr in his sock it became a cacklebird the bird almost as astonished as it was dismayed took flight without even remembering to cackle now your turn if you wish trent said he strode purposefully toward the dragon the dragon reversed course so suddenly it almost left its tail behind in only part of a fraction of a moment it was gone but that dragon could have given you an awful hotfoot before you got within transformation range gloha said the aspect of confidence can be deceptive the magician remarked mildly after a time the stream changed its mind about running in gullies or valleys and diverged up into a mountain pass but there was a suitable path through the forest which seemed interested in getting somewhere as evening thought about setting in they found a pleasant glade i think we should camp for the night here trent said perhaps tomorrow we shall reach an enchanted path and make better progress then they saw a crude shelter under a nut and bolt tree with a fire by it someone else is here gloha said alarmed its a centaur cynthia exclaimed quickly touching up her hair it turned out to be two people a male centaur and a female human they were glad to share their accommodations in return for some pie from the pie tree trent made by transformation they ate pies by the fire and agreed to exchange stories i am braille the centaur asserted i have a forbidden love i am jana the young woman confided i am that love you met at a love spring gloha asked surprised no we just happened to get to know each other living nearby jana said his magic talent is transcribing documents so that those who cant read can sense their meaning he did some work for us and i got to know him and i realized that no man i know was half the creature of this centaur of course intellectually i knew this was folly braille said but emotionally i found no centaur to match the qualities of jana the situation is distinctly awkward he glanced at cynthia i gather you are in a similar situation cynthia blushed halfway between pink and red oh this man and i are not a couple we are merely traveling together same for me gloha said quickly i am looking for a male of my kind and magician trent is helping me search cynthia is going to join a winged centaur family youre a magician jana asked awed whats your talent i transform living things trent said didnt you see me change the weed into the pie tree oh i thought that was all of it she said embarrassed i mean that you made pie trees nothing else by no means i can if you wish transform you into a centaur filly or braille into a human man the two looked at each other but im not interested in a human man jana protested i love your centaurly qualities and i love your humanly aspects braille said we are going to ask the good magician for a solution to our problem jana said that did seem best in the morning jana got on brailles back and they moved smartly west trent cynthia and gloha proceeded north you know cynthia remarked i could probably carry you magician in similar manner on the ground that might speed our progress i could transform a fly to a horse and require it to carry me trent replied i havent felt the need unless you are in a hurry my rationale is that you need to learn the current ways of xanth by slow experience and i can protect you from most hazards as long as we travel together so time is not of the essence i must admit however that i am enjoying this experience myself as a reminder of what ordinary life is like for the young once i am done with my missions i will return to my wife and friends resume my actual age and we shall fade away as planned somehow i feel less urgency about that than i did before i feel similarly little urgency about settling in with strangers cynthia agreed but of course this is just a diversion from glohas mission so we shouldnt delay her lets face it gloha said im looking for a male of my own crossbreed species when as far as i know there isnt one that suggests that the faster i complete my mission the sooner i will be disappointed im not in any great rush for that i could transform some other male into a male of your kind the magician said that may be why crombie pointed to me in which case no gloha cried more sharply than her caring little concern warranted it wouldnt be the same just the way braille and jana didnt want each other transformed some other creature wouldnt have grown up as a product of the harpy and goblin cultures and wouldnt understand what it feels like i dont want an artificial man yet there was a tiny little trace of doubt for she remembered how comfortable she had felt being a flame vine or a furball or a lungfish the sentiments of the species had come with the form did she really have a case so it seems that none of us have much motive to hurry trent said for reasons that are sufficient for ourselves so we might as well proceed as we have been doing until we have reason to change yes cynthia said i feel easier about that so do i gloha agreed they continued roughly north because that was the way the best path insisted on going when anything threatened them trent discourage it either by drawing his sword or by transforming it to something harmless then they came to a severalway fork in the path there was a sign draw well steppes pier com pewter i am getting thirsty trent said i would be happy to pause for fresh well water cynthia and gloha agreed the magician had conjured watermelons along the way but they were ready for straight natural water they took that path it led to a round stone structure whose top was a large flat panel as they approached a jointed stick unfolded before the panel and made rapid movements trent put his hand on his sword but the weird thing did not seem threatening it was just doing its own thing whatever that was there was no sign of water then gloha realized what was happening its drawing a picture she exclaimed indeed the thing was sketching a picture of the three of them a human man a winged centaur filly and a winged goblin girl it was an excellent group portrait done in black and white its a draw well cynthia said just as represented the appendage caught the edge of the panel and tore off a sheet of paper it threw it aside then commenced drawing cynthia alone apparently it oriented on whoever moved or spoke and drew a picture of that person it didnt care what happened to its pictures it was just interested in drawing them well trent shook his head i would have settled for nice cold water the appendage ripped off the centaur picture and drew one of trent drinking a beaded goblet of water gloha laughed so naturally it drew one of her laughing she salvaged that drawing as it got ripped off there was nothing to do but retrace their steps as the path ended here they returned to the fork and went along the steppes path steppes are broad grassy plains with few trees easy to travel across trent remarked but instead the path fed into an isolated mountain completely covered with stairs some of them were dainty small others gigantic huge and still others were ornate and decorated whats this cynthia asked again gloha figured it out the steppes many steps xanth is made mostly of puns trent said we seem to have walked into a zone of them i dont remember encountering this sort of thing in the north village cynthia said gloha glanced at her paper she discovered to her surprise that it had changed it was now a picture of a sleepy dull village this is because the north village has always been the staidest place in xanth trent explained that is why we retired there it is very conservative with little humor and not a great amount of imagination the wild effects are mostly elsewhere even fracto finds it too boring for a storm fracto cynthia asked xanms meanest cloud gloha explained wherever folk are having fun cumulo fracto nimbus goes to drown it out you dont want to run afoul of him hes not bright but hes all wet meanwhile the paper was a picture of a meanspirited cloud gleefully raining out a picnic i dont suppose that well knew what kind of adventure were going to be having next gloha said the picture was of an assemblage of junk in a cave with a piece of glass projecting from its center across the glass was printed the word curses trent and gloha laughed while cynthia looked blank thats com pewter trent told her formerly xanths second worst scourge until lacuna tricked him into reprogramming as a nice machine he has the power to change reality in his vicinity but i really wasnt thinking of going there so well have to try the pier next gloha said they returned down the path as the picture was of a lake with a dock they returned to the fork and took the path labeled pier this led to a small lake where there was indeed a dock but there was something odd about it it didnt actually enter the water instead it was along the bank it was made of boards and the boards did not lie still they moved one would jump over the others laying itself down at the head of the line then another would jump getting ahead of the first in fact they were walking by themselves making their way around the lake thats the first time ive seen a board walk trent said wryly they watched the boards walk until they came to a small river entering the lake there was a rickety little bridge across it the boards laid themselves down on this starting across get off there someone cried shoo shoo it turned out to be an ugly greenish troll trents hand hovered near his sword again we mean no harm he said we are merely looking for a fair way northwest the trolls head turned i wasnt talking to you he said its these confounded walking boards they think they can walk all over everything im trying to protect the bridge from their traffic they dont seem to be doing any harm cynthia said well they dont actually harm it but its my job to keep this bridge clear suppose someone came to use it and it was all cluttered with moving boards this would make a very bad impression where does the bridge lead gloha asked nowhere its just there this is a useless sinecure but what am i to do im a troll trolls guard bridges and this is mine perhaps we should introduce ourselves trent said i am magician trent and these are cynthia centaur and gloha goblinharpy we are on a quest or two to find compatible situations i am tristan troll i was banished to the sticks after betraying my village but the sticks turned out to be boards and now im bored stiff bored with boards cynthia said i can appreciate that how did you betray your village gloha asked we had a raid on a human village and i let a little human girl go instead of bringing her in to be boiled for dinner i was supposed to have a really bad dream for that but grace ossein the walking skeleton messed it up and got in trouble herself it was a bad scene oh you are that troll trent said my grandson dolph defended gracel in her trial she was found to be too nice for bad dreams and she married marrow bones who cynthia asked another walking skeleton from the realm of bad dreams gloha said its a long story hes a nice person but he must be a dead person as i said its a long story this is a troll we know of hes decent for a troll things certainly have changed in my days trolls were all horrible they still are gloha said except for tristan who was punished for his unbad deed trent reminded her and the troll tribe was not wrong in doing so by the standards of its culture why dont you just walk away from this boring job gloha asked the troll several reasons for one thing the other trolls would catch me and bring me back or give me an even worse assignment for another it isnt easy for a troll to find a job bridges are about it i would expire of boredom if i didnt have something useful to do gloha got a glancing little glimmer of a notion if this path went nowhere they would have to take the next one and fulfill the wells prediction of an encounter with com pewter meanwhile here was a decent troll widi a problem this might not be coincidence what would you do if you had your choice she asked tristan id like to get into one of the forwardlooking bridge jobs like information processing tristan said a bridge to knowledge but who would pay attention to the mind of a troll so its your mind you wish to exercise rather than your body who would remain with a trolls body if he had a choice tristan asked rhetorically but of course im stuck with the way i am im surprised that you handsome folk are even talking to me well were sort of having an adventure without being in a hurry to conclude it gloha said i think we just might be able to do something nice for you dont risk it he said alarmed favors can become expensive but sometimes worthwhile even in their expense trent said glancing briefly at the two females what was that glib little glimmer of a notion i saw flickering through your head gloha that maybe tristan could work with com pewter pewters supposed to be a clean machine now and maybe he could use an assistant someone interested in his sort of business and we are going to have to take pewters path after all he agreed that machine may no longer be evil but he could still be mischievous we just might be able to trade favors with him wed have to do him a favor so he would take tristan trent smiled pewter would have to do us a favor if we gave him tristan gloha felt her mouth forming an orotund little o oh she said trent turned back to the troll i am a transformer i can render you into a different shape then we can take you to com pewter and inquire whether he can use an assistant what form would you like to assume oh anything would do even a bug very well i shall transform you into a humbug for now and we can decide on a final form later he reached toward the troll and tristan abruptly became a small bug now find a suitable place to ride on one of us trent said and dont fly away because if we lose you i will be unable to transform you again the bug considered then it hummed and flew up and perched on glohas hair hhhummmm it inquired thats all right gloha said i dont mind if you ride there as long as you dont she hesitated not wishing to speak of anything as dirty as bug excretion nnnummmm the bug hummed negatively it wouldnt do anything like that on such nice hair they left the walking boards and returned once more to the fork this time they took the path leading to com pewter it turned out to be an enchanted path leading them almost immediately to the machines den though it was supposedly some distance but as they approached the entrance to the cave there was a terrible shaking of the ground eeek cynthia screamed a ground quake no i think its the invisible giant trent said he works for the machine sure enough a monstrous footprint appeared in the ground nearby squishing two trees and a boulder into two toothpicks and a grain of sand were going to get squished into mites gloha cried alarmed i dont think so trent said his purpose is to herd clients into pewters cave in case any should be hesitant fly up to the region of his head and tell him were coming voluntarily but i cant see his head you dont need to fly up until you smell his breath his head will be in that vicinity gloha flew up so did cynthia who was just about as nervous about the ground near those footprints as gloha was way up above treetop range they encountered an awful wind not only did it blow them off course it smelled like a wagonload of cabbage that had sickened and died before managing to rot the humbug on glohas head coughed and choked i think weve found his breath cynthia gasped her hair blowing out sideways from her head as if trying to flee the odor im losing control she glided erratically away fortunately she was able to recover somewhat as she got out of the wind gloha saw her gliding safely back down toward the forest gloha nerved herself held her neat little nose and flew into the putrid breeze she had a smaller nose than cynthia did so it didnt take in as much of the stench when she banged into an invisible cable she grabbed onto it this was a strand of the giants hair she worked her way down to an ear hey dont step on us she shouted were coming to see com pewter anyway oooogaa the giant responded deafeningly pump down the volume gloha screamed what did you say the giant whispered i said that were coming to see com pewter anyway she shouted so you shouldnt step on us okay there was a stir as something huge moved he was turning his head say youre a pretty little creature thank you she gasped but your nose is swollen thats because i can barely breathe why is that are you ill gloha pondered perhaps five of her moments but only a quarter of a giant moment she decided to tell the truth its your breath she shouted its awful thats nothing you should smell my cousins breath it can knock over an ogre at fifty paces well ill go away now so i can recover gloha said but then so as not to be impolite she introduced herself im gloha goblinharpy im greatbow he replied nice to meet you gloha couldnt honestly express pleasure at encountering the giant so she evaded the issue by asking a question why is your cousins breath so bad my cousin graeboe hes ailing he has some sickness hes even turned visible which means hes not much longer for happy stomping how horrible gloha said well i must be gone she let herself drop which wasnt at all difficult at this point only when she got down near the trees did her breathing begin to clear surely a person could not blame the giants for being as big in odor as they were in person but the dialogue had been a strain she had at least accomplished her purpose the giant was no longer stomping they should now be able to enter the cave safely cynthia had reached the ground and joined trent at the mouth of the cave im so sorry i couldnt stay up there cynthia called as gloha glided in i just couldnt i understand gloha said maybe my experience with goblins and harpies gave me strength to endure it or maybe my smallness enabled me to take smaller breaths trent and cynthia exchanged a generous glance or perhaps your spirit is larger than your body trent said shall we tackle the next incidental challenge gloha felt a chill though she had been in a sweat when bathed in the giants breath just how safe was this venture i suppose if there is no other path they entered the dark cave there was just enough light for them to see the one route forward into the mountain com pewter was supposed to be a nice machine now but his record as an evil machine was much longer and gloha had if not a doubt certainly a qualm they came to a chamber with a collection of junk on the floor one pane of glass was propped up in the center welcome users appeared on that surface trent strode forward to stand over it i am magician trent perhaps you know of me you cant transform inanimate creatures the screen said flickering worriedly trent smiled i have not come to quarrel with you commie the only viable path led here so i thought i would pay you a call if you dont attempt to change my reality unpleasantly i wont transform this creature to a sphinx who will sit on you he indicated gloha agreed the screen brightened with surprise you look young magician youth elixir subtracted seventy years i will return to my real age when this mission is done who else is with you gloha goblinharpy whom i am helping to find her ideal man cynthia centaur whom i transformed some time ago and am now escorting to the single winged centaur family of xanth and tristan troll whom i have transformed to a bug a bug the screen printed alarmed dont let it near my program trent nodded as i remember you have been known to have a problem with a virus i can appreciate your caution but i come not to bury you but to do you a favor i dont believe in favors gloha was impressed it was evident that the machine was quite wary of the magician and there were surely very few people or creatures in xanth who commanded such respect naturally i expect a return favor trent continued smoothly oh now you are making sense what do you want nothing difficult merely a clear pleasant and safe path from here to the residence of cheiron centaur the screen dimmed a moment as com pewter pondered there is one to which i can direct you it crosses the gap chasm via the invisible bridge and pauses at the residence of grundy golem will this be satisfactory certainly grundy isnt much but his wife rapunzel is delightful what return favor do you offer it happens that tristan troll is a thoughtful and decent creature unlike many of his kind who seeks employment as an information processor it occurred to me that you could use an assistant i dont want a troll the last one i encountered took my wheatstone bridge well perhaps if he had another form such as a cat no or perhaps a mouse the screen blinked a mouse trent shrugged of course if youre not interested he could be a spring chicken the mouse will do gloha stifled a laugh spring chickens were notorious for aging rapidly and ceasing to be attractive they were almost like harpies in that respect but what would pewter want with a mouse trent reached toward gloha the humbug jumped from her aead to his hand then it became a cute mouse trent set the mouse down before the screen it ran around and the path of its motion was traced by a line on the screen ah yes perfect yes no now if you care to show us the path trent suggested watch the mouse and the mouse ran to the wallwhere there was an opening gloha had not seen before she could almost have sworn it hadnt been there a moment ago but of course she was a nice girl who would never swear they entered the new passage the mouse sat up and squeaked gloha squatted down thank you tristan she said i hope you are happy here she extended one finger to stroke his head just exactly what does a mouse have to do with a funny machine cynthia inquired as they moved on i understand it is very useful in helping people relate to the machine perhaps because they prefer to have a living interface trent said with a mouse much more information can be processed in a simpler way its a special kind of magic that few in xanth understand but i knew that pewter would of course there are those who dont like mice with or without a machine that wont bother pewter hell be happy to have his mouse spook them while remaining nominally nice now gloha understood better pewter surely wasnt happy having to be nice all the time now he could be nasty while seeming nice the tunnel led directly out of the mountainand there before them was the great gulf of the gap chasm so soon gloha asked astonished as they peered down on the top of a small cloud that happened to be slumming com pewter changes reality in his vicinity trent reminded her he gave us a direct path he certainly did she was almost disappointed because she was rather enjoying this journey with cynthia and wasnt eager for it to end quickly trent followed the path to the brink and put one foot cautiously over the edge yes its here he said and walked out into air eeeek cynthia screamed jamming a good four es into her ek its the invisible bridge gloha reminded her i thought that was a joke i believe it was built after your time trent said cheerily from midair cynthia flew near him and reached out to touch the invisible structure its there she exclaimed its really there all the same ill fly across gloha said the trolls bridge and invisible giant were bad enough i dont need to trust an invisible bridge me too cynthia agreed im glad for my wings then suffering a second thought she added thanks to you magician i would no longer be comfortable as a human maiden or even a regular centaur what made you choose this form for me you were so pretty i didnt want to spoil it but i didnt want you joining the centaurs who can be as difficult as straight human folk it was a spurofthemoment compromise he glanced up at her as she hovered close by i think it was a good decision given the exigencies of the moment i would not do such a thing today but i believe you remain as pretty as you were then cynthia blushed again she flew on ahead so as to hide her face gloha knew why cynthia still found the magician insidiously attractive gloha understood the feeling because she felt that attraction herself she had been trying to deny it but it would not be denied but like cynthia she would not care to be transformed to a full human woman even if the magician were interested in her or unmarried or actually as young as he looked she liked her own form too well but it didnt stop her halfwitted little heart from having naughty little jiotions trent completed his crossing gloha was relieved she knew the invisible bridge was sturdy but it was still easy to imagine him plummeting into the chasm perhaps if she had gotten on me bridge herself and kept her hands on the handrails she would have had more confidence that was another reason she never wanted to be without wings the groundbound human form was so limited by mountains and chasms the way led north through the forest now that they had crossed the bridge she knew it was an enchanted path free from menace by dragons griffins basilisks mean men and other ilk that was a relief she hoped never to meet an ilk but she had to admit that their small encounters along the other route had been interesting maybe they would have been less so if there hadnt been a magician along to protect the innocent maidens yet they wouldnt have had to stay down on the ground if he hadnt been along so wouldnt have needed protection so her impressions were sort of mixed up soon they came to a giant club stuck endwise in the ground the thorny business end up as they came close it quivered as if about to lift itself up and take a swing at mem the thing was so massive that a single blow would crush any of them does the enchantment still hold gloha asked in a nervous whisper it should trent said but sometimes there are flaws in the magic and something gets through it is best not to take any threat for granted let me fly by it first i dont think it could move fast enough to hit me she said if it comes out of the ground and chases me then well know ill agree only if you fly along the path the club may be dangerous to anything that strays off the path and merely threaten whoever passes on it that would make sense cynthia said it might make a feint scaring someone off the path then it could smash that poor person because the enchantment doesnt extend beyond the path the enchantment cant protect someone from foolishness trent nodded thats probably its ploy so if we simply refuse to react well be safe nevertheless i think you had better test it if it actually strikes in the pathway ill transform cynthia into a giantess who can grab it by the handle and tame it gloha flew swiftly by the club while the magician and centaur waited behind the club quivered working its way out of the ground about to take off gloha someone cried gloha spun around in the air looking back there was a tiny man standing on top of the club grundy she called back what are you doing here im home this is my clubhouse dont worry it doesnt bother friends i came out the moment it started to shake he tapped his foot on the wood at ease house glohas okay the club stopped moving you had better introduce it to my friends too gloha said indicating trent and cynthia grundy turned to look a winged centaur he exclaimed but shes too young to be chex actually shes older than chex gloha said remember chex is only a year older than i am she matured rapidly grundy squinted still this one looks only about sixteen she was delivered in the year shes eightyeight years old youre pulling my little leg harpywings next youre going to tell me that young man beside her is ninetysix right hes magician trent sure and lets see him transform something trent squatted and pointed to an ant on the path suddenly it became a giant a humongous creature the size of a unicorn it looked around as if startled to see the world become so much smaller vibrated its antennae and made ready to chomp someone with its mandibles trent transformed it to a pink bunny the bunny hopped toward the forest thats not nice someone called change it back to its natural form before it gets lost and hurt trent went after the bunny and transformed it back into a small ant thats magician trent all right grundy agreed but whats he doing so young and with you folk hes helping me find my ideal man gloha explained and the centaur is cynthia whom he transformed long ago shes been hi the brain corals pool until now so shes not really all that old grundy said she was in suspended animation yes now were taking her to join the winged centaur family the golem nodded but shes a bit old for che magician trent has some more youth elixir gotcha grundy looked around i heard my wife a moment agoah there she is come on out dear and meet these folk the tiny woman came out of the tiny door in the clubhouse suddenly she was full human size with a head of dark hair that reached to the ground and then some turning brown red blond and eventually white on the way despite being braided and bound she was lovely in a dress covered with ads for places and things grundy jumped down to her extended hand my wife rapunzel wearing her address he introduced i call her the hairy monster rapunzel lifted him to her face made as if to bite his tiny head off and kissed his face insteadhis whole face at once one of these days shes going to be inhaling when she does that and ill be gone grundy said ruefully rapunzel shook hands with them all then she reached to the clubhouse again let me introduce our daughter surprise she said a figure even smaller dian grundy came to the doorway and stepped into rapunzels hand joining grundy here she is he said proudly delivered by surprise six months ago he turned to the child say hi to the nice folk kid hi nice folk the girl said glohas jarred little jaw dropped so did cynthias i thought you said she was six months old gloha said that isnt what he said rapunzel said smiling he said she was delivered six months ago but shes talking yes she talks a lot rapunzel agreed shes five years old even trent looked startled at this how can she be that old only half a year after being delivered it was a surprise grundy admitted so we named her that i think i understand trent said still we think the stork got lost on the way rapunzel explained we had ordered her some time ago and kept expecting her but somehow she never arrived then when we least expected it there she was the stork didnt speak to us he just flew quickly away as if greatly relieved trent shook his head acting for all of them i thought i had seen some unusual things in my day but this does surprise me does she have a talent grundy and rapunzel exchanged several fragments of a glance not exactly grundy said looking uncomfortable talent the tiny child exclaimed suddenly she was full human child sized with a sweet smile and a headful of curly black hair rapunzel had to set her quickly on the ground almost spilling grundy in the process size changing gloha exclaimed how nice but of course it must run in the family not exactly rapunzel said with the same uncomfortable look grundy had had a moment before we dont like to mention it because not mention a fine talent like that gloha asked but why not talent surprise repeated suddenly her hair was growing it curled down around her shoulders turning dark brown it extended to her waist becoming light brown then it reached to her knees becoming red finally it touched her feet blond rapunzel quickly gathered it up before it could drag in the dirt she borrowed several pins from her own tresses to fasten it in place while the child played idly with a pebble she found on the ground two gloha asked i thought no one in xanth had that well one may not be ai mean both these things take after her mother sort of grundy said but thats still amazing maybe she does have two talents talent surprise said a third time evidently picking it up from their discussion she held up the pebbleand it became a dragons tooth this time trents jaw dropped as far as the others did shapechanging of objects he said a third he cut himself off as both parents looked about to faint this is a surprise gloha said how manywhateversdoes she have just one we think grundy said one at a time that is we never know ahead of time which one it will be or whether weve seen it before rapunzel added its very unnerving gloha appreciated the situation i can see why you named her surprise surprise the child cried and vanished this time the jaws of grundy and rapunzel dropped oops he said this is a new one she said is she invisible or elsewhere he asked rapunzel reached out to where the little girl had been standing invisible she said with relief she never acted up in company before grundy said looking wary perhaps we are a disruptive influence trent said diplomatically we have to move on anyway yes we should reach the winged centaur family by nightfall gloha said actually they had no schedule and werent rushing it but if they were inciting surprise to mischief they needed to depart quickly before anything really bad happened nightfall the childish voice cried happily suddenly it was night not blackness but actual night the stars were shining down farewell trent said somewhat hollowly well just shoot on out of here along the path the stars give us enough light shoot star one of the stars moved from its place in the sky it came swiftly toward them leaving a trail of light behind did somebody say my name it demanded ill plug him dead a bolt of thin lightning zapped out all we needed trent muttered a shooting star with an attitude gloha agreed i think its cute cynthia said the star paused brightening you do well now it shot back to its place pleased before long the region turned reddishdawncolored and then the light of the day returned they paused and looked back they were still on the path having felt its smooth surface underfoot and nothing was threatening them but behind was the black blob of night covering the clubhouse and its neighborhood that child will be a handful trent muttered thats at least five talents shes shown and some border on magician class i wish we could help them but i think theyll just have to work things out themselves yes gloha agreed it hadnt occurred to her that a strong talent could be a problem but that child had too much talent at too young an age she had learned how to invoke it erratically but lacked the responsibility that went with such magic they followed the path north and in a surprisingly short time came to a pleasant glade with a large thatch cottage in the shape of a stall before it was an anvil where horseshoes might be hammered com pewter had been true to his part of the bargain giving them a direct route to the centaur residence it probably would have taken a lot longer and been much more difficult otherwise trent paused turning to cynthia i think now is the tune to use the fountain of youth elixir magician humfrey gave me cynthia looked doubtful i dont want to deceive anyone especially centaurs im really not a child youre really not sixteen either he pointed out in xanth appearance counts for most of reality we are not going to deceive anyone well simply adjust your age as appropriate to the situation still she hesitated my body may be young but my mind will still be almost seventeen i wouldnt blame them for objecting to that my mind is ninetysix he said evenly has that bothered you oh no you have been marvelously knowledgeable and helpful were i really twentysix i doubt i would have acted always with propriety especially when you uncovered your upper torso or when you were kissing me back to warmth there are advantages of age and experience i suppose she agreed uncertainly too bad you werent really that age i might have given you man thoughts to match my woman thoughts trents lips pursed but he managed to ignore the remark he turned to gloha we seem to have a difference here what do you say i think you should youthen her and let the centaurs decide if they dont want her she can stay with us but ill be nine years old cynthia protested your mind will be sixteen its not the same trent shrugged then lets meet the family now and use the elixir later if it seems warranted yes cynthia said relieved they went to the house trent knocked on the door which was double opening in the middle and hinged at the outsides as with a barn a womans face appeared in die window panel looking surprised then the door opened a mature winged centaur filly stood there magnificently barebreasted i recognize gloha she said but not the man or theoh my for now she had seen cynthias wings chex i am magician trent youthened for the time being i am accompanying gloha on her quest to find her ideal man this is cynthia whom i transformed to this form in my youth she has been in the brain corals pool since she she wanted to meet the only other winged centaurs in xanth chex said oh im so sorry she isnt younger then she put her hand to her mouth embarrassed i shouldnt have said that its just that why would you want her younger trent inquired as if merely curious i had this foolish notionour foal cheit was a wild presumption for which i apologize i was just so startled to see another winged centaur trent didnt even need to swap glances with cynthia we have some youth elixir she can readily become a decade younger physically but why shes already been through her childhood she would hardly want to do it again she might if she could be with her own kind chex looked at cynthia you were human before you were transformed yes cynthia said i was sixteen ive been a centaur less than a year in living time i learned to fly but i was the only one of my kind the real centaursthey she clouded up evidently suffering an unpleasant memory chex stepped quickly forward she put an arm about cynthias shoulders i know the feeling they reject crossbreeds even my own grandsire and granddam refused to associate with me at first if you would like to join us yes do you know centaur lore im afraid i really dont cynthia said abashed would you be willing to learn it it would take several years you see a human being of your age is the equivalent of a centaur of eight or nine intellectually our foal che is eight i want very much to learn it che isnt here now hes at goblin mountain we chex looked momentarily pensive we miss the children cynthia looked at trent he held out the tiny vial of elixir she took it opened it and gulped down its few drops of liquid suddenly she was a physical eight year old the dose had halved her age in a unicorn that would have been full grown but centaurs paralleled humans and she was half grown her jacket hung baggily on her oh she exclaimed faintly i didnt realize it would be so quick first centaur lesson chex said you dont need clothing unless the weather requires it as you see i have no concern about exposing my body she helped the filly remove the material in a moment cynthia stood bare her formerly ample breasts had vanished leaving her human section boylike but they would grow again in due course her hair had dwindled into a ponytail i think our business here is done trent said i guess it is gloha agreed she flew up to give cynthia a parting hug for the centaur child was now just about the height of a grown goblin girl maybe well meet again soon oh i hope so the young cynthia agreed we have known each other for half of my life gloha had to laugh through her tears the statement was perhaps technically correct in a way that most others would not understand cynthia had lost half the age she had been during their acquaintance then they separated cynthia looked at trent there was something in her demeanor that suggested that she had not entirely forgotten her adult feelings but she did not speak gloha remembered jana and braille centaur for some irrelevant reason the magician pretended to be oblivious farewell centaur filly he said thank youfor whatever she replied chex led cynthia into the house the door closed gloha knew that this clean break was best she turned resolutely away there would be other times meanwhile she had her own quest to fulfill marrow they walked back the way they had come away from the house gloha saw cynthias hoofprints and blinked back tears of nostalgia it had been only an interim episode but she liked the winged centaur filly and missed her already this isnt the same path trent remarked but it has to be because were retracing our steps the scenerys different were no longer on com pewters magically direct route see theres a volcano a what a mountain that magically catches fire and dumps its ashes all around he gestured indicating the oddity she looked and saw it the thing was coneshaped with smoke issuing from its narrow tip as she watched it belched out a cloud and the cloud spread out and settled across the landscape gray particles drifted down like snow she put out a hand to catch one sure enough it was a bit of ash marvelous she said that depends on the volcanos attitude if it doesnt like us passing too close well have to find another path but we dont want to leave the enchanted path we wouldnt be safe then we may not be safe now he said this may no longer be an enchanted path that seemed odd to her lets follow it anyway if it gets dangerous then we can look for another i cant transform an inanimate threat he reminded her i would be helpless against that mountain if it got angry then well just have to hope it doesnt get angry she said hardly concerned imagine a mountain with a temper the mountain rumbled warningly more smoke plumed from its top but gloha still couldnt take it seriously mountains were inanimate after all they couldnt have feelings they couldnt resent anyone passing close to them maybe stones had personalities when king dor talked to them but a mountain was a feature of the landscape so the rumble was coincidence i think this is mount pinatuba trent said i heard of it once when it gets mad it breathes out so much ash and vapor that it shades the whole of xanth so the sun cant get through and the land cools what a weird name for a mountain she remarked the path was headed right to the base of the volcano trent was right this wasnt the way they had come cynthias hoofprints no longer showed the way had magically changed with magic anything could happen but this was slightly strange she must have spent too much time in the air so had never become properly familiar with the routes of the land of course she could fly away at any time but trent couldnt so it was easiest just to stay aground there was another rumble and more smoke this time the ground itself shook it did seem as if the mountain were reacting like an irritable sphinx yet that had to be her imagination i dont like this trent muttered could you transform a creature into something that could carry us swiftly past it he looked around there dont seem to be any living creatures or plants within range indeed the region was covered by a layer of gray ash like offcolor snow then maybe transform me into a roc bird and ill carry you over it that would be even more dangerous i believe that mountain dislikes big birds and fires hot boulders at them with unpleasant accuracy there was a larger rumble a boulder shot out of the mountains mouth it arced high through the sky and landed with a thunk to the side more and thicker smoke poured out blotting out much of the sky the ashfall became stronger ash was getting in her hair and coating her wings she was increasingly uncomfortable i guess youre right she said wed better go back and find another path it may be too late for that it was unusual to see him so gloomy lets hurry she said as yet another rumble built up inside the mountain getting ready to come out they turned and started away from the volcano but the rumble only built up power and vigor and burst forth in a cloud of swirling black smoke the day darkened and ash descended so thickly it was hard to see and breathe they tried to run but the ground shook so violently that it was hard to keep their footing gloha spread her wings to fly but hot ash came down to bum them speck by speck and feather by feather and gusts of hot wind threatened to blow her away she quickly folded them again so as to minimize exposure she was stuck on the ground for now then a boulder crashed into the path ahead gouging out a crater its got our range trent said oh im sorry i didnt listen to you before she cried with a certain dismal little dismay i didnt think it would be this bad well have to change our course erratically so it cant catch us he dodged off the path to the side running through the thickening layer of ash his forming tracks were almost immediately covered by newly falling ash gloha followed the swirling winds buffeted her and the gloom and ash almost made her lose sight of him then he ducked back and caught her by the wrist i can transform you to something safe at least he said but that wont help you she protested maybe i dont deserve help what she demanded appalled never mind just keep clear of falling boulders she didnt need to worry about that as he was hauling her along preventing her from getting lost in the terrible ash storm why dont you deserve it because i was reacting in a manner unbecoming for my age and marital status what are you talking about another shower of ash came down but most of it missed them the volcano couldnt catch them as long as they kept moving erratically you have behaved perfectly throughout i wanted to transform cynthia back into a human woman so he had not been impervious to her interest gloha half human herself though without a human parent had understood enough of cynthias feelings to perhaps comprehend trents more than enough handsome and pretty people find each other attractive she yelled over the ash wind its what they do that counts not what they feel she found she couldnt debate that maybe there is some guilt but you did the right thing you maybe wronged her when you transformed her to a winged centaur but you righted her when you didnt change her back shell be happy now with her new kind and i just know che centaur will like her when he meets her maybe you are helping him to achieve his destiny which is to change the history of xanth perhaps he said seeming slightly more positive she had reassured him but it was odd because he had surely had many times her total experience with male female interest in his life that was five times as long as hers he had been married twice and had at least one child he had to know volumes about love and passion how could her limited perspective help him in any way there was a series of boomings behind them mount pinatuba was sounding off almost musically but it wasnt musical business gloha knew that it was spitting out more boulders and ash if they didnt get out of its range quickly one of those rocks might score well now gloha looked there was a swirl of smoke that wasnt quite like that of the mountain metria you mortals have a funny idea of entertainment the demoness observed we are not amused trent said were trying to get out of range of the volcano you cant metria said confidently youd do better to get under cover if i thought you knew of any close cover id ask you trent said contemptuously his urbane manner was deteriorating under the pressure of this threat that was beyond his ability to handle for the first time she was seeing him unguarded for what obscure reason she couldnt fathom she found she liked him better for it i do too know of it the demoness retorted becoming smoky and getting her vapors riled i dont believe it he said gloha was appalled why was he vexing the demoness right when they needed her help right in the next unclean metria said suddenly gloha caught on the demoness meant to tease them but trent was making her give them the information the next what she asked dirty smirch sully violate reputation character assassination defile trent asked whatever metria said crossly fading into the swirling ash we must find that sully trent said i mean gully he forged on still hauling gloha along she felt his male man strength as she practically flew behind him but his grip on her arm was not painful he was being careful not to hurt her despite his aggravation this too impressed her but a gully will just fill up faster with ash gloha protested and boulders will roll down into it metria always speaks the truth in her fashion he replied theres shelter of some sort nearby we just have to find it i hope so she agreed weakly they crossed a rise but the depression beyond seemed to be filled only with more choking smoke and the sound of falling rocks then she saw something she blinked trying to get her aching little eyes clear of ash dust i think i saw a house made of bones she said must be the remains of an animal who perished here trent said must be maybe im hallucinating where did you see it over mere she pointed blindly he leaned into the awful wind and tramped in that direction suddenly he stopped youre right a bone house please dont tease me she begged im already miserable enough he moved forward again abruptly the bones loomed close there really was such a house anybody home trent called a door opened a skeleton stood there flesh folk it exclaimed marrow bones trent said it must be you im magician trent and this is gloha goblinharpy we need shelter then come in marrow said he extended a bonehand to help in a moment they were both inside and the tumult of the flying ash cut off as the door closed gradually glohas eyes watered clear and she got a good look at the interior of the house it really was made of bones they were so cunningly fitted together and so securely bound with tendon that the walls and roof were ashtight the demoness had been right this was the cover they had needed thank you marrow trent said it is fortunate for us that your dwelling was here what are you two fleshy creatures doing in a fleshless region like this the skeleton inquired gloha is on a quest to find her ideal man and im helping her that is nice of you the skull angled the eye sockets peering at him i must say you look younger than i expected arent you prince dolphs grandfather i am i am old but under the influence of youth elixir at the moment i appreciated the way you helped him on his quest to find the good magician even if he succeeded only hi getting himself betrothed to two girls at once he was young marrow said the young can have maladjustments of emotion so can the rejuvenated trent murmured but he had excellent magic the skeleton continued similar in respect to yours i believe yes i am proud of my grandson and of my granddaughter the sorceress ivy what are you doing here marrow gloha asked i thought you had a family now i do i do the skeleton agreed i married grace ossein and we have two little bonebuckets joynt and picka bone but i do not have a soul and without it i shall shortly fade away for i am a creature of the dream realm so i agreed to participate in the demons game of companions if they would give me some indication how i could acquire a soul i was not selected to be a companion but for my service the demon professor grossclout told me that though my head lacked even mush i might acquire half a soul if i camped beside the volcano long enough so while i waited here i foraged for animal bones and made this house because i didnt like being constantly pelted with pieces of ash do you happen to know how i might acquire half a soul trent considered i have heard of the demon grossclout hes so arrogantly intelligent that not even many demons can stand him but he always knows what hes talking about i suspect he meant that you could get half a soul from some mortal passerby i would offer you half of mine as they normally regenerate if properly treated but it is so old and withered that i fear the halves would fall apart and do neither of us any good i suppose you could have half of mine gloha said doubtfully does it hurt to lose half your soul it does not marrow said but i couldnt take yours it would serve only briefly because you are female i need half a young vital male soul if it is to be healthy then we do not seem to be the ones you have been waiting for trent said yet your presence here has helped us and we appreciate it and would like to repay the favor is there any way to do that i dont think so your kind and mine do not have a great deal in common but i thank you for the offer maybe there is a way gloha said maybe what the demon professor meant is that if you were here and you helped someone that person would then help you to find a soul somewhere else this is possible marrow agreed surprised certainly this region seemsinhospitable to souled folk so maybe you should come with us and along the way there will be a chance for your own quest she said at least its worth a try perhaps it is the skeleton said if you do not object to my company any friend of my grandsons a friend of mine trent said and you are a friend of chex centaur too arent you gloha asked it seems to me i heard something like that we have interacted compatibly on occasion marrow agreed with gaunt conservatism then lets travel together at least until you find a suitable lead on getting halfsouled gloha was a small little wee bit surprised at herself for making the offer because she had never before associated with a walking skeleton but she was still in the early pangs of loneliness after losing cynthia centaur as a companion and she knew that marrow had not merely been a companion for prince dolph he had been a truly good and dedicated adult at a time when a nineyearold boy really needed guidance gloha had encountered prince dolph often enough in the interim being the same age and had had the story from him it should even be fun because the skeletons had unusual powers that could be quite helpful at times especially to an already groundbound companion is there any living thing here trent inquired combing the last ash out of his hair only a bone flea which i have been unable to eject marrow said i try to let living things be but i must confess that bone fleas make me nervous how could a flea hurt you when you have no flesh gloha inquired a bone flea eats bone marrow explained it tries to drill into the center where my marrowessence is and gorge on that without my marrow i would fade immediately away from this realm i find the prospect uncomfortable then you wont mind if i transform that flea to something else trent inquired i should be most satisfied to see it transformed where is it marrow pointed a bonefinger to a slightly chewed section of the bone wall there was a tiny creature chomping blithely away trent moved his hand close to the flea suddenly there was a fairsized pot pie bush growing from a pot bearing a steamingly ripe pie oh wonderful gloha exclaimed realizing how hungry she had become but it looks too hot for us to touch i have utensils marrow said he produced several long thin bone slivers i chopped these up to use to sea crevices but they may also be serviceable for your purpose ah chopsticks trent agreed he took two and held them with the fingers of one hand you can eat with those gloha asked perplexed with a little practice so can you trent said marrow if you will be so kind as to harvest that pot pie and set it on your table for us we shall dine marrow plucked the hot pot pie with his bare fingerbones and set it on his bone table trent drew up a bone chair and gloha being much smaller and lighter perched on the edge of the table the other side of the pie thus trent said demonstrating with his chopsticks he poked into the pie and brought out a chunk of something that looked and smelled good pinned between the two ends he lifted it to his mouth gloha took up two suitably sized bone slivers and tried to hold them the way he did when she moved them they flipped out of her less than gainly little grasp she tried again and began to get part of the hang of it in due course she was able to spear a chunk of vegetable so they shared the pie trent ate most of it because he was far more massive but gloha had all she wanted it had gotten dark marrow started a bone fire with some otherwise useless bone fragments its light and warmth were small but the need was similarly small they were comfortable i think we had best rest here the night trent said perhaps by morning the volcano will have forgotten us why should it matter marrow asked when i go out i merely make myself resemble a clog of ashes and it doesnt recognize me why didnt we think of that gloha exclaimed you have less space in your skull marrow said diplomatically all that living meat gets in the way of thought that must be it trent agreed before gloha could organize her reaction we living folk are at a disadvantage compared to you fantasy folk i am surprised that you wish to join our number by acquiring a soul dont you know it will make you mortal half a soul should not go that far marrow said a living person can regenerate a full soul from half a soul but that will not be the case with my kind my half soul will merely endure enabling me to reside permanently in exterior xanth that is all i want from it you may discover that it provides you more than you want trent remarked then i shall politely decline what else it offers marrow said i need only permanence in this realm trents gaze crossed glohas gaze briefly not really establishing a glance she knew what he was thinking the skeleton never having had any part of a soul did not understand the consequence of being souled perhaps it would not be possible to explain but something else occurred to her what about your family she asked will they survive without souls by no means but it is my hope that i will be able to share my half soul with them so that each of us has a fragment and then grace joynt and picka bone will endure with me satisfactorily ever after in xanth proper gloha nodded it was a good answer trent transformed the pot pie plant into a blanket bush and each of them harvested a nice warm blanket they lay down in separate corners gloha found the blanket on bones cushioned by her sturdy wings to be surprisingly comfortable but something was lacking she focused her minute little mind which tried to hide its thought from her and finally ran it down she was dissatisfied because she was sleeping alone she wished she could be snug beside a winged goblin man so she tried to picture one the odd thing was that he seemed to have the face and form of magician trent she knew that was foolish but didnt quite get around to changing the image she relaxed and slept so quickly that it was as if the morning came before the evening ended in that morning she got up stretched her wings and tried the kneeknob on the bone door the door swung open on smooth joints and she looked out across the ashy vista it was lovely in its fashion all the irregularities of the landscape had been smoothed over it was like a gently surging sea frozen in place the mountain itself was quiet with only some scatters of white cloud drifting near its peak it looked peaceful i made you hats marrow said from within gloha turned startled she had forgotten that he didnt sleep thank you she accepted the broad woven bone hat he proffered and put it on her head it was decorated with ash on top so that from above it should look like a piece of ash she stepped outside the ash was kneedeep on her so she spread her wings and flew above it the mountain did not react so either the hat was still effective or pinatuba was asleep she found a suitable gully landed and caught up on a function or two that was best done privately then she flew back to the bone cabin trents tracks led around to the back of the house she would not be so uncouth as to conjecture of course but it was possible that he was in quest of a similar gully she entered the bone house there was a sugarplum bush how thoughtful of the magician she plucked the sweetest plum and ate it for breakfast they set out wearing their ash hats marrow looked funny in his because of the incongruity of a skeleton wearing anything the volcano did not seem to be too smart because it didnt notice them they crossed to the original path and followed it on toward the mountain because that was really about the only way to go pinatuba blew a few resounding bass notes as they came close and puffed up some smoke but this was a mere turning over in its sleep their ash hats concealed them well enough so that the mountain was not roused from its slumber they skirted its basethe skirt was made of fallen ash of courseand proceeded on south phew gloha said i was afraid old punatub would catch on and dump more ash on us the ground shuddered an awakening rumble traveled up the cone of the mountain an irate column of smoke shot up oops gloha said it heard me lets move trent said they hurried along the path but they were not far enough away from the mountain the rumbling became horrendous and a great ugly crack of a vent opened along the side of the cone roiling purple gas rose out of it and rolled down toward them i think you living folk would do well to avoid that vapor marrow said politely on occasion i have seen it encompass creatures oh what happened gloha inquired that is where i got the fresh bones for my house after the vapor passed point made trent said breaking into a run but the path was bearing downhill and the ball of gas was rolling faster than he could run it would soon catch them gloha spread her wings and flew she could rise above the gas but she knew that wouldnt do trent much good it will not harm me of course marrow said keeping the pace but if you have any emergency procedures this would seem to be the time to invoke them ill have to transform you trent puffed to gloha then you can carry us both away from here all right if you wish she said flying down close to him to get within his range what kind of creature do yousquawk squawk squawkt she concluded from her big birds beak she had become a roc the gasball was almost upon them she reached down with two feet and caught both man and skeleton she closed her talons carefully so that they formed a kind of round barred cage instead of transfixing or crushing anyone then she pumped her wings and heaved into the sky the ball rolled underneath her the draft from her wings beat at it battering it apart it lost cohesion and became a sinking pool of ughcolored ick served it right as far as she was concerned the mountain balked shot out a furious blast of ash the fragments were so hot they glowed as they arced toward glohas wings they would set her on fire if they caught her but she was at the fringe of the volcanos immediate range and was able to fly clear before the burning bits reached her now she truly appreciated the magicians prior caution indeed no big bird was safe near that deadly cone she looked for a good place to land but the terrain was too rough for a bird this size she needed a reasonably level region clear of trees so she flew on southand in a surprisingly brief time she spied the yawning gape of the gap chasm she realized two or maybe three things she had reached it so rapidly because big strong rocs flew with much bigger wingstrokes than did little weakwinged goblin girls it was yawning because this was still morning and it hadnt had time to wake properly up yet and if she could travel this readily and swiftly she might as well continue until they reached their starting point above crombies cave then they could head southeast the direction he had indicated as she flew she had a daydream in it she was turning the pages of a big book the pages were filled with text but she was unable to read it then she came to one that said chapter xxxxxxx she recognized that title it was her story so she turned more pages until in the middle of the following chapter the pages turned blank the chapters were numbered through but there was nothing written in the last six which meant of course that her story was as yet unfinished then there was the flick of an invisible tail and mare imbri the bringer of daydreams galloped off to her next assignment gloha was surprised to realize that almost half her story had been told and she hadnt yet started the main part of her quest it was high time to get on with it so a little velocity here wouldnt hurt at all but where exactly was crombies cave she had come to it mostly by water before and underground she had returned to the surface through a convoluted system of caves that left her with no idea where she had been she didnt know how to identify its location from here well maybe she should return to the place where they had emerged that should be somewhere in the right vicinity maybe magician trent or marrow bones would have a notion how to proceed from there she found that in this form she had a fine eye for details on the ground she saw where com pewters cave was and the board walk and the pool of the three mermaids well maybe that was close enough and would do for a landing place there were no trees hi the middle of the pool she glided down she swooped low and slow over the pool and let the two figures go they dropped into the pool with two splashes she knew that the mermaids would rescue trent if he had any trouble and the skeleton could simply sink to the bottom and walk out as he didnt need to breathe she climbed again and saw that it was as she had surmised trent was surrounded by the three lovelies then one of them went to rescue marrow bonesand changed her mind maybe she hadnt seen him clearly before it must have been a shock to recognize his nature gloha somehow wasnt too sorry she descended again and this time splashed into the water herself it had a wonderfully cushioning effect but wasnt as deep as she had thought her feet touched bottom then she realized that it had been deep but was so no longer her entry had splashed most of the water out the three mermaids were stranded by the suddenly dry shoreline their oncelovely hairdos matted glaring in perfect harmony gloha waded out when she reached trent she returned to her natural form sorry about that she said with as much apology as she could muster quite all right ash said through gritted teeth it will fill again any week now we shall surely flounder through in sufficient style perhaps sooner trent said he gestured and a stranded fish near him became a very large watermelon vine with a number of huge fruits he poked a melon and it burst its water flowing into the pool oho cedar exclaimed catching on she poked another fruit adding its water to the pool trent slogged on around the depression turning fish and weeds into more watermelon plants the others followed poking the fruits all this water added to what was flowing back from the higher slopes soon had the poibl about half full again there was enough for the mermaidens to swim in and for marrow and gloha to wash in trent thoroughly splashed by the bursting melons was pretty well clean anyway thank you mahogany said i suppose if you wanted to put your clothes out to dry and dally a bit in the water magician we just might manage to forget exactly how old you claim to be she smiled reasonably winningly from amidst her bedraggled dark tresses i fear we have to move on the magician said but i thank you for the consideration the mermaids did not press the issue evidently being not completely forgiving of the splash the encounter was less man ideal for that gloha was privately thankful they followed the stream down to where it entered the mountain then they looked for some way southeast from there beyond the rivers gully was a mountain there was a path that seemed to lead around the obstruction but it did not look entirely healthy there were bits of bone and feather strewn along it and it smelled of dragons breath i could become the roc bird again and carry you over to the other side gloha suggested were not sure exactly where crombies residence is trent reminded her it might be under this very mountain if we skip the mountain we might already be beyond it and the farther we went the less likely we would be to fulfill your quest she nodded but i hope it has nothing to do with the dragon who maybe lives near this path ill transform the beast if necessary they set off afoot gloha couldnt have flown ahead to check but the path wound under such a dense canopy of foliage that it was impossible to see from above so she kept her wings ready but remained low there was indeed a dragon a big one it was snoozing with its head across the path its dragon ears perked up at their approach and wafts of smoke surged from its nostrils a smoker trent said grimly we wont be able to get close enough to it for me to transform it gloha understood why the most feared dragons were fire breathers but smokers could be devastating too in close quarters their smoke surrounded and suffocated the prey and when it cleared the dragon could chomp victims at leisure here under the close canopy the travelers would have no chance well have to go back and look for another path she said i see no reason for that marrow said striding forward but the smoke she cried warningly he walked on straight at the dragon the dragon was as surprised as they were it huffed and it puffed and it shot twin jets of smoke from its nostrils that looked almost thick enough to walk on the smoke bathed the skeletonwho plowed on through it unaffected he doesnt breathe gloha murmured remembering he cant choke he has no eyes trent agreed he cant be blinded and hes immune to any heat that isnt high enough to burn bone but what can he do to stop the dragon from simply chomping him into bonemeal that i am not sure but he seems confident the dragons big eyes grew larger as he saw the skeleton emerge from the bath of smoke he inhaled again getting ready to send out a worse blast but marrow jumped forward and grabbed onto the dragons nose hell get himself chomped to splinters gloha cried appalled for the dragons head was larger than marrows whole body maybe not trent said appraisingly he has changed his form thats rightthey can do that she agreed they can disassemble their bones and put them together in strings or other combinations he looks like one big clamp now indeed the long bones of what were marrows legs had become mansized pincers clamping the dragons nose closed the dragon tried to paw marrow off but immediately the clamp tightened painfully forcing the creature to desist the skull perched at the top looked around and spied them you may pass safely marrow called he cant breathe smoke through his mouth only his nose hes right trent said appreciatively that dragon is largely helpless certainly i can now approach near enough to transform it but i think i dont need to they walked by almost close enough to touch the dragons huge nose the creature looked as if he really wanted to chomp them but that clamp tightened warningly and he had to relax but wont he chomp you the moment you let go gloha asked it will take him a moment to get reoriented the skull said in any event i dont taste very good theres no meat on me so they went on by once they were safely out of smoke range they called and heard a muffled whomp as the clamp let go and the dragon resumed stoking smoke in a moment marrow appeared striding nonchalantly as if this were routine this is a creature to be respected trent murmured not referring to the dragon gloha could only agree the path continued on around the mountain there were no other dragons or other dangerous creatures this was not surprising because no smaller predator would dare to encroach on the territory of the big one the path finally left the deep forest and debouched into a halfway open valley a village nestled within it and there seemed to be a fair amount of activity therein from the far side a cloud of dust or smoke wafted up into the sky what are they doing gloha asked i believe this is the magic dust village marrow said they mine the magic dust and blow it into the air so that it will circulate throughout xanth enhancing the magic everywhere the magic dust village she exclaimed of course i have heard of it the most magical place in xanth why thats right trent agreed i should have realized this is indeed the area i shall have to be extremely careful about performing transformations because the extra potency of magic in this region can be dangerous they walked on down to the village an elderly troll moved to intercept them as far as i know the natives are friendly trent murmured they have members of many crossbreed humanoid species living and working in harmony including goblins and trolls but perhaps you gloha should stay behind me until we are sure gloha was glad to agree they had encountered one friendly troll but that was a rarity another would be pulling on their luck hail man goblin skeleton the troll cried do you come in peace we do if left in peace trent agreed then i must warn you that our village is about to become inhospitable you must move on lest you be exposed to hazard we have had a moderately arduous days journey and were looking forward to a relaxed night trent said we are also on a quest and it is possible that the object of that quest is to be found here let us exchange introductions and see whether it is possible for us to do each other any good by all means i am pa the eldest troll of magic dust village i am too old to work well so i walk around and warn away strangers glad to meet you pa troll i am magician trent formerly the transformer king of xanth this is marrow bones formerly of the dream realm and this is gloha goblinharpy whose quest we are supporting magician trent pa exclaimed perhaps you are the one we are waiting for he paused waityou are far too young you must be an impostor i have been temporarily youthened trent explained i will demonstrate he pointed to a tiny flowering plant beside the path it became a monstrous spreading acorn tree whose trunk obliterated that path shoving them into the surrounding brush oopsi forgot the intensity of magic that was supposed to be a mediumsmall acorn tree pa troll touched the massive trunk so its not illusion i apologize for doubting you magician he glanced at gloha and a crossbreed harpythis is most interesting come to the village and we shall see i am most excited indeed he was quivering in a manner trolls normally reserved for the anticipation of some truly dastardly deed gloha didnt need trents additional caution to remain on guard trent restored the tree to its original state this time getting it right they came to the village square a throng of crossbreeds of every description quickly gathered there not merely trolls but elves fairies ogres a small giant or two goblins gnomes centaurs griffins masked basilisks and other creatures too numerous or confusing to mention ho you rabble of low degree pa troll cried maybe we have our salvation and maybe not this is magician trent in the company of a walking skeleton and a honey of a harpy crossbreed he indicated the three there was a muted ooooh of appreciation gloha was surprised and discomfited to find most eyes focusing on her she realized that there were no harpies here oddly you see we have a problem pa troll continued now speaking to the three visitors we have been told to carry on until harpy time but no harpy has appeared and we have only a day or two left before disaster so if you are not able to help us the village and all xanth will be in deep dung exactly what is the nature of your problem trent inquired and how do you think a harpy could solve it first you must understand the nature of our village mission pa said this is the site where the magic rock wells up from the unknown depths of magic we pound it into dust and our roc bird flaps his wings to blow it high into the sky where it spreads and circulates and sifts down across all of xanth without this service we render the land of xanth would slowly lose its magic and revert to pardon the expressionmundane nature this is why we all work together despite having in our number creatures who otherwise would prefer to quarrel with each other and eat strangers he glanced at gloha again and licked his thin troll lips in a reminiscent manner that made half a shiver scramble up her back we use little magic preferring to do the job by hand and foot because the use of magic is dangerous in this vicinity he took a breath but recently a new vent opened in a nearby mountain from it issues not magic stone but poisonous thick fluid that slowly courses down toward the village destroying all life in its path we can not remove or divert it because the fumes of its surface are also lethal our only resort is to remain well away from it but soon it will ooze into the village itself and begin to pool here and then we shall have to flee our labor will no longer be accomplished the magic of xanth will begin to fade and in time our entire land will be as dreary as the drear region beyond there was another ooooh from the villagers gloha had to agree the prospect was appalling so we sent a representative to the good magician humfrey to inquire how we can prevent this disaster she is now serving her years service with him but we cant say that we are entirely satisfied with his response whom did you send gloha asked unable to restrain her irrelevant curiosity a winged monster of another type than yourself a glyph i met her gloha cried with dear little delight a nice horsedragon crossbreed she was one of my challenges on the way in i hope they are treating her well pa said in paternal fashion oh yes at first i thought they werent but that was part of the challenge shes really quite happy there what was your answer trent inquired more relevantly to carry on until harpy time precisely i must say that the good magicians answers leave something to be desired considering their expense but they are always accurate and relevant trent reminded him pa glanced at gloha this time refraining from licking his lips were you satisfied with your own answer well no actually he didnt give me an answer exactly so i didnt have to do any service so you can no doubt appreciate our dissatisfaction yes i think i can and i have to say that i dont think im the harpy youre looking for about my only harpy aspect is my wings apart from that i mostly resemble a goblin unlike my brother harglo i have no idea how to stop that poisonous flow because it would affect me too and it is not something i can transform trent said but why didnt you make a dam to stop its advance we did but it oozes between the stones and dissolves them seeping on along its destined course the only way we can stop it is to plug its sourceif any of us could only get close enough could a roc bird drop a boulder on it no it issues from a fissure in the steep slope it should be fairly easy to plug if only any of us could approach it but our every effort has led only to disaster then something occurred to gloha marrow you were immune to the dragons choking smoke would you be able to approach a poison vent why i see no reason why not the skeleton said then you are the ones we have waited for pa troll cried you signal the harpy time perhaps trent said however it should be clarified that marrow bones is also on a quest he needs half a soul so that he can remain indefinitely here in xanth proper if anyone here cares to it was amazing how quickly the crowd dissipated it seemed that the dedication of none of the villagers extended quite that far even pa troll had somehow found elsewhere to be the three of them were left standing in the center of an apparently deserted village these creatures have too much human nature trent remarked sourly yet their need is genuine marrow said xanth will profit i will plug that vent he set off in the direction pa troll had looked when he spoke of the encroaching poison trent shook his head watching the departing skeleton i could almost swear he already has at least half a soul certainly he doesnt seem to need more than he has gloha agreed i had a lesson in decency not too long ago this reminds me of it it may be that souls arent what they used to be maybe id better see if i can help him she spread her wings not too close he warned if you smell anything at all get away from wherever you are i will she assured him she pumped her wings and lifted into the air it was good to be flying again in her own form her limber little legs had gotten worn with all that walking while she was afraid her wings would dissolve with disuse so maybe her decision to try to help marrow was as much selfish as unselfish in a moment she saw the poison flow it was like a messy black river flowing from a nearby mountain right toward the village every so often it jogged and she realized that those were the places they had put up rock dams that hadnt quite done the job no plants grew near it everything within smelling distance was barren it seemed to be aiming for the village as if guided by some malignant will she would have dismissed that notion except for her memory of how the inanimate things reacted when king dor talked to them they tended to be shallow but they did have opinions and feelings and of course marrow bones was not alive being animated by magic and he had an objective and a code of behavior then there was pinatuba the angry volcano who tried to stop folk from approaching it closely so why shouldnt a poisonous flow have an objective too in fact she realized now that poison was from pinatuba that was the volcanos other slope they had circled around it without catching on that it could have nasty vents on both sides or that these could issue either noxious gas or nasty fluid so they hadnt finished with this evil mountain meanwhile marrow was walking up the ruined slope toward the vent but gloha saw that he wasnt going to be able to reach it because there was a small cliff in the way the black poison goo had no trouble dribbling slowly down it but there was no way for a person to climb up it however there was an indirect route clear only from above she flew down to tell marrow but he was walking right beside the poison flow supremely unaffected the moment she started to think of getting faintly close her breath began to choke and her vision blurred and her wings got shaky and weak she plunged away to the side so she wasnt directly above the flow and recovered her equilibrium no she couldnt go and tell nun directly but maybe she could signal him from afar she flew back and forth before him waving her arms marrow she called sure he couldnt hear her from this distance but in a moment he noticed her he waved a bony arm go that way she cried zooming to the mountains right side theres a path but he couldnt understand he moved on beside the flow was there any other way to get through to him she racked her blank little brain but dredged up nothing so she just followed along hoping to be able to help when there was a chance he finally trekked to the cliff and stood looking up it was obvious that he couldnt climb it he looked around now was the time she flew to the right again and hovered there beckoning him this time he caught on he walked that way away from the flow she led him to the place where a ledge angled erratically up the steep slope from there it moved back across to the top of the cliff and the way was followable marrow found it and made his way up he was carrying something and she realized that it was a piece of stone he hoped to use as a plug it seemed to be an old stalactite that some cave had discarded she watched from afar as he went all the way to the vent he studied the situation then lifted his stalactite and rammed it straight down into the center of the vent where the poison started flowing it went partway in then he lifted off his skullgloha did a double take at about that pointand used it to pound in the spike that was it he replaced his skull and walked away gloha saw that the flow was clearing near the top it remained below but there was no more coming out of the vent he had plugged it gloha thought of something else marrow had been too close to the poison he probably reeked of it now so that it wouldnt be safe for anybody else to get near him he would have to get clean before he returned to the village she flew back and forth signaling him as she had before then she headed for the nearest stream that didnt originate on mount pinatuba he followed the foliage on either side of his route wilted as he passed the stream was far enough away so that she was able to land beside it but when marrow approached sure enough he reeked of poison and she had to fly away before she fainted wash wash she cried pointing at the water then afraid he couldnt hear her she made vigorous scrubbing motions along her body he caught on and waded into the water he disappeared in it the plants downstream began to wilt gloha was sorry for them but at least it showed that the water was carrying the poison away from his body before too long it should get so diluted that it wouldnt hurt anyone anymore she hovered at a safe distance until he emerged he walked downstream and when he got beyond the wilted region there seemed to be no further wilting in his vicinity so she risked a closer approach there were no deadly fumes finally she landed before him youre clean she announced thank you for advising me he said it had not occurred to me that i might have become unsanitary but when you signaled i realized that life in my vicinity was perishing yes that poison is very strong they returned to the village trent had evidently been at work mere because there was now a large pile of fresh food from plants and creatures he must have transformed the villagers were aware that the poison was no longer flowing that meant that the existing stream should slowly dry up or sink into the ground leaving the village clear they would be able to continue their business i have talked with the villagers and ascertained that there are no winged goblins here nor have they even seen any before you trent advised her as far as they know you are unique im afraid i am she agreed but crombie wouldnt have pointed a direction if there werent an answer it just means it isnt here true we can rest here the night and continue southeast in the morning he hesitated i wouldnt judge the villagers too harshly with respect to their unwillingness to yield half a soul many are female making them imperfect for this purpose or old others are simply frightened there are a number of misconceptions about souls that are hard to eradicate i know gloha agreed remembering her own concern about losing half of hers i would not care to take half a soul from someone who did not freely wish to give it marrow said well keep looking gloha said they had a good meal really a feast and the villagers were very appreciative of the service marrow had done forthem you have benefited all xanth pa troll said with an emphasis that hinted that maybe it was all xanth who owed marrow the half soul not the local village there was a nice house for them to use for the night left by a family that had moved out recently in anticipation of a complete evacuation gloha had the pleasure of a private room with a nice soft bed she slept well despite still wishing that she had a perfect man with warm feet to share it with she realized that the good magician had been right about a harpy helping to save the village at the last moment maybe his son was right about the direction of the solution to her own quest meanwhile she did feel slightly useful madness in the morning they resumed their travel to the southeast however pa troll had a warning for them the wind currents carry the magic dust everywhere but they are thickest immediately downwind from the village usually this is to our southwest but at the moment it is to our southeast your route may take you through the fringe of it you would be well advised to avoid that direction at least until the wind changes and some of the dust can clear trent looked at gloha this is good advice she knew it was she had heard stories about the effects of magic madness but is it possible that my perfect man and marrows halfsoul donor will be found within the region of madness it is possible he agreed i suppose if such quests seem unlikely to succeed in normal xanth the abnormal should be tried but im not sure you appreciate just how weird the region of madness is likely to be oh pooh it cant be worse than mount punatub was which threat you also doubted at first he reminded her evenly she knew he was making sense and that she was being an unreasonable teen crossbreed female somehow that didnt cause her to become more reasonable it didnt help that she wished she could make an impression on him as an intriguing adult female for no legitimate reason and didnt know how so her fouledup little feelings just made things difficult anyway im curious to see just whats so weird about it his gaze remained straight yet somehow she had the impression he was rolling his eyes as you wish marrow bones tilted his skull his nonexistent eyes were rolling too they proceeded southeast downwind there was no problem the country consisted of rolling hills covered by forest and fields with an occasional river wandering through trent was about to wade through the first river but the skeleton stopped him kick me he said thank you trent said gloha thought they were joking though neither creature had been much for humor before but marrow bent over and trent delivered a fine kick to the skeletons hipbone marrow flew apart the bones landed in a pilein the shape of a small boat trent pushed the boat into the water where it floated despite not seeming to be watertight then stepped into it and sat down the craft then moved across the water under its own power trent got out on the far bank then kicked the boat and the bones flew apart and landed back in marrows natural form gloha finally got her gape hinged she had known that the walking skeletons could change the arrangement of their bones but hadnt realize how neat and useful this could be after all marrow had changed to clamp the dragons nose trents kicks had merely facilitated the effort she flew across the river herself they resumed walking we seem to be skirting the region of madness trent remarked perhaps the folk of the magic dust village were operating at reduced efficiency the past few days as the poison flow approached so the dust level is not high but now they are likely to be back at full efficiency and we are apt to encounter more of the effect i believe you are correct marrow agreed his skull turning there may be a waft of it approaching now well i dont see any madness yet gloha remarked impertinently she shouldnt have gloha sucked and licked at the sticky ends of her fingers she was too old for aunt grobigatails honey flummery but a taste of honey always whetted her appetite for more she sighed her joy mixed with a little bit of sadness she was at the age of eighteen getting more than a bit long in the tooth too old for sweettreats but she was still too young for goblin garbage rituals now she was too bored doing her usual good job of babysitting her obnoxious little brother harglo he might be her sibling but he wasnt her kind he had the head and legs of a goblin but the fullfeathered body of a harpy complete with tail and no hands he was a stronger flyer than she was and a stronger runner too but couldnt do much delicate handling of things with just his wings he made up for that by having an excellent command of harpy vocabulary already at age nine he could make some foliage wilt when he swore and he was still confined to nonadult conspiracy words but today she was free of him having a day off while he took flying lessons from aunt fowlmouth so she could relax and enjoy herself so why wasnt she happy she tasted her fingers again but this time her scaldinghot salty tears caused her fingers to hurt like the singing stinging threads of sea wasps the problem was that today she had time to appreciate just how much it hurt being a halfandhalf crossbreed never quite fitting in with either the goblins or the harpies so now she was caught up in her selfpity party she had stopped grooming herself her wing feathers were droopy and creased her hooded blue bioluminescent eyes were dull and her glorious blueblack glossy hair hung in salty honeysticky twisted loops harpies flew overhead hooting and hurling a golden coprolite about this was a goldplated fossilized ball of dragon dung that they caught in their claws and tossed up again whoever could get out the longest and foulest string of cussing before the next harpy touched the flying ball was winner for the moment harglo loved that game and longed for the day he could play it gloha had never even tried as she could not even begin to understand the implications of its most basic terms without going into a terminal bhish these were good days in xanth in the harpy caves and goblin dens when things went medium to bad instead of bad to worse but from time to thyme a demonic shotfowl rogueawful day sneaked in and this seemed to be one of them so instead of enjoying her rest from spite her respite she was having xanths most miserable little mood it had started with dawn which had lifted its brooding mists to reveal a bleary redeyed sun surrounded by bruised purple clouds whose only desire was to make an acid rain and wet on someones head then had come the snarling whining grunting screaming rush to the breakfast cave aptly termed the mess hall where her dozens of aunts fought for the juiciest dripping raw bleeding morsels gloha had found herself wedged between aunt hoary harributtes and the grand harridan queenchief of this branch of the family clan each of whom could screech more piercingly than the other gloha managed to plead difficulty clinging to the perch so she took her quivering chunk of whatever to a separate bench where she could sit in what was disparagingly termed human style then someone had accidentally dropped a splash of hot coffee down her back never mind that harpies never dropped anything they had ever snatched up unless they meant to gloha had had to flee to her personal nest to change clothes and put salve on her burn she had tried to cheer herself by dressing up she donned her festival outfit mockleather jerkin thongs of molten golden color trimmed in a musical pattern with mellow golden bells brazen hells bells and icy crystal stars a really nice outfit always made her feel so good but then her tutor magpie had told her not to wear it because harpies didnt wear clothing and she would be a laughingstock but im a laughingstock anyway she protested nonsense you just havent found your place yet what do you know about it gloha flared rebelliously you arent really a harpy at all youre just an unlikely kindly demoness but i have worked with quite a number of mortals magpie said with an evenness impossible to mortals okra ogress thought her life was hopeless and now shes a major character rose of roogna thought shed never find a good husband and then she married the good magician and had a lovely daughter i could list others gloha knew she could at length so she didnt ask instead she went into routine a terrible little tantrum dont tell me what to do she screamed with a great deal of hair tossing and foot stomping her show frightened several nearby birds who flew under the bed to hide disturbing the snoozing monster there but magpie had seen it all before and was unmoved in the end gloha had to remove her finery and return to her dull ordinary state her dreary life continued unabated gloha shook her heavy little head she was back in the forest with magician trent and marrow bones what had happened i had supposed your life was happy trent said surprised but i realize now that no one living among harpies could be satisfied you saw my flashback gloha asked amazed it appeared before us trent said i am not expert in the ways of living folk marrow said but it seems to me that it was not nice of that harpy to spill hot black liquid down your back you really did see it in wild living color even when i threw my i averted my gaze when you changed clothing the magician said i thought you might consider that private she had been going to say tantrum but now she realized that she had more to be concerned about she had relived an episode of her past life and they had seen it unfold exactly as she had including her temporarily bared body what madness was this then she realized the rest of it this was the region of madness with the intense magic of the concentrated magic dust making even memories become visible she hadnt realized that it would be like this she wasnt at all sure she liked it lets get quickly out of here she suggested what when the fun is just beginning a voice demanded who is that gloha asked alarmed smoke swirled nothing to concern you antiseptic goblin girl what kind of goblin girl unpolluted sanitary unadulterated immaculate faultless innocent trent suggested whatever the smoke said crossly what are you doing here metria gloha asked a brief little bit crossly herself i poke around wherever anything interesting is happening anyone fool enough to blunder into the region of madness is bound to be interesting well my past life is about as uninteresting as anything can get so you might as well go away oh i dont know about that magpie always takes the interesting characters to work with you know magpie shes a demoness isnt she she knows when somethings going to happen and shes always there to nursemaid it through well nothings going to happen right now so thats what you think here comes another waft of madness i dont believe it gloha said youre just saying it to tease and long lonely hours had been spent conducting endless imagined conversations with her adversary that harpy flying tiger her aunt hoary chaos and coffee hoary harpy screeched as she used one soiled wing to sweep strands of slop glop and flop out of the mess hall and into the fire pits she clutched a teaming mug of brew in one claw while standing on the other scrawny leg she vaguely resembled a blackfeathered desultory stork her red eyes glowing like soiled coals in the dusky purple shadows of the messy hall she swept long dirty strands of feathery black hair back from her stony alabaster brow and glowered at her niece glohas sensitive little stomach knotted and burned her heart cramped and her hair wanted to wriggle out of sight how had she gotten into this dill picklement i said what game are you playing a low whispery voice repeated which was somehow worse than the usual screech with an icy start gloha realized that the subject of her worries was now focusing her formidable annoyance at her she blushed which of course only made things worse making her seem even more guilty that she probably was auntie you politely requested this early morning interview which showed how unharpyish you are the harpy said you should have demanded it in the foulest vernacular now what in the name of idiocy do you want gloha somehow nerved herself enough to speak her muted little mind auntie hoary ive been made sick and tired by living a dull and middleoftheroad life amidst creatures who arent exactly like me we all know what happens when you stay in the middle of anything you get run over auntie i want to be an alchemist a geoalchemist on a wizards team i think a person without a dream becomes mired in our stst she faltered unable to get the ugly word out stinking hoary screeched stinking wheres your harpy vocabulary girl you need to learn to swear if youre going to get along now try it again gloha made an effete little effort mmired in our ststinking pig pit she managed to eke out over and over i dream a bad dream brought by a night mare that i can no longer flythat i am a crippled brokenwinged bird let me leave the nest what kind of nest hoary screeched the ststinking nest and go to seek what in the hell is the hurry hoary demanded leave the safety of the flock when you still dont know how to swear youd really break your wings then the nest is best for chicks but im eighteen auntie gloha reminded her and have the vocabulary of a dirty bird half your age hoary pointed out cleaning gore from her teeth with a dagger like claw if a monster came to eat you you wouldnt even be able to give it a toothache with either your voice or your hygiene youd be one mouthwatering little morsel all too true but gloha knowing that shed never get up the courage to broach this subject again tried to see it through couldnt you let me fly with a proper escort to pay a professional visit to the castle of the good magician humfrey there to ask my one question and give my years service for his answer oh please auntie hoary i would do anything if only i could harpies never plead hoary snapped disgusted by this weakness show me that you can let out one incendiary oath and ill let you go gloha tried darn she cried help ship hoary sighed youre improving at least you are taking aim at the words but youre off by one letter in each case that nullifies it theres not even a stir of fire in the air now pay attention this is the proper mode of harpy expression she took a breath gloha managed to cover her ears just in time even so she felt the heat of the terrible blast the air shimmered and burned and scorch marks appeared on the table a fiery smell wafted outward as fresh air moved in making it possible to breathe again hoary resumed normal screeching now can you do that chick mmaybe in time gloha said knowing it was impossible in harpy thyme maybe hoary said with resignation gloha you are still wet behind the ear feathers it would be folly to let you go out alone or in incompetent company do you even know where the seeds of destruction are kept can you do an aerial survey and map or organize things according to the harpy thyme line we the horrid harpies the stinking untouchables the ultimate fowlmouths we have that knowledge and keep the temple of hope for xanth until the time we choose to assume the mantie of dominance for ourselves our time is not yet but drawing nigh once we have the harpy thyme she broke off realizing that she was saying too much anyway you must at least learn to swear effectively before you can safely go out on your own when you can do that perhaps i will let you go that was it the discussion was at an end aunt hoary had made what was by harpy definition a reasonable and moderate requirement but how would gloha ever be able to learn to swear like that her mild little mouth couldnt even begin to form the awful configurations necessary gloha blinked she was back in the forest the waft of madness had passed now thats a sensible harridan metria said approvingly you sawheard aunt hoary harpy gloha asked embarrassed saw her i was her the demoness said look at the foliage gloha looked the leaves nearby were wilted and some even burned as if blasted by a truly ferocious oath but how could that be those arent mere memories trent explained the rest of us get caught up in the parts the magic governs us then we must get away from here before something awful happens gloha cried appalled some of my memories are not nice i dont think we can escape until your memories are resolved he replied something is bothering you and until that is brought out and alleviated we shall be locked hi oh i never wanted to get into this gloha wailed you were an arrogant little snit metria said you thought the madness wouldnt take you i was wrong gloha cried in anguish ill flee it she started running but already she saw a slight wavering of the landscape as if its level of reality were shifting the effect was coming right toward her there was a rushing sound as of swiftly flowing water oh no behind the kitchen herb garden gloha could hear chrysalis crystal creek before she could see it hugely swollen by the weird weather with consecutive drenchpours the creek waters had taken the bit in their wet teeth and were in a dangerous mood they were surging at boulders trying to rip them out of the soil and rushing at any living thing that dared approach whatever they caught they were carrying away tossing about and finally pounding to quivering bits this was no safe place for an antiseptic uh innocent winged goblin girl almost blinded by her rampaging feelings and tears gloha half ran half flew down the very muddy irregular treacherous path to the very edge of the stream nearby monsters woke and stirred sniffing the air aware of the lingering odor of juicy tender young winged girl slowly they rose and moved toward her blocking off her escape affrighted gloha spread her wings about to take flight but the violent water signaled the air and the air stirred whirling itself into a deadly cone that reached for glohas winsome little wings she did not dare take flight now lest her feathers be plucked leaving her truly helpless she had to stay grounded but now she saw something even worse silvery slithering slinky nickelpedes going for her tender little tootsies tendrils were reaching out of the ground casting about to catch her feet and hold her there while they burrowed into the flesh she had blundered into a truly awful trap how was she ever to escape she tried to run along the only path she saw not knowing where it led but a tendril caught a foot sending her into a headlong fall to the ground her knocked little knee twisted on the way down making her scream with pain help she cried but the roar of the water drowned her out and she knew that no one would hear or come to her rescue the tendrils found her body and curled over it anchoring her so that they could drill into her succulent little shape the nickelpedes scuttled to arrive hi time to gouge out their coinsized chunks before the plants shriveled her body too far the hungry shadow of a larger monster loomed close gloha screamed this time it was no meek little mock effort it was a doublethroated piercing ululation at ultrasonic and ultraviolet levels containing a suggestion of the vocabulary aunt hoary had been trying to teach her the tendrils momentarily stunned writhed back away from her the nickelpedes clicked their pincers briefly disoriented the looming monster hesitated a third of a moment or perhaps nine tenths of an instant then all three threats recovered and converged but hi that meager instant gloha made an exhausted little effort to fight for what hopeless little hope remained to save her lost little life she heaved herself somewhere else she fell down a long sandy shaft of dirt wings over heels she was aware of wild glowing molds bugs and many intriguing shades of dirt touching barely mentionable parts of her body along the way then she fetched up against the ragged cobwebcovered gape of a hidden hole she plunged heedlessly into it and discovered a dark tunnel leading she knewnot and hesitatedtoinquire where it just had to be less unsafe than what was behind the tunnel twisted around as if trying to dislodge her but she followed it through every convolution not daring to delay finally it gave up and let her into a faintly flowing small forgotten longunused set of carved stone caves hiding under the harpy hutch caves against all odds she had found a secret place that almost seemed to be safe she stumbled under rocky crevices holding poisonouslooking twining clumps of vines glowing in brilliant vegetable green ultraviolet luna white and bloodred growing among broken sculptures of gargoyles through rotting logs and across the faces of prehistoric rocky ruins she crawled over a perilous crumbling narrow rotting wooden bridge across a gaping dark chasm filled with a horrible deep menacing rustling as she passed it it gave way and collapsed behind her into the depths she listened but never heard the sound of its landing below at long last the magic path ended in a pool of sinister mist she didnt quite trust this so she grasped a tough root growing from a crevice in a ruin after several timid little tries she managed to haul herself through muck and mud up to a higher level she was she hoped safe for a while how i wish i could fly fly fly up to the stars once more she breathed but she was too tired to fly even if she hadnt been caught in a deep dank gloomy cave unimaginably far below anywhere she cared to be so she did the sensible thing and let herself collapse into sleep after a tune she had no idea when she woke the demiluna moons silvery beams were streaming in through a network of cracks in the caves ceiling she lay quietly beneath her spread cape barely breathing as she sought answers to the questions that squeezed into her helpless little head at too rapid a pace where am i she murmured momentarily disoriented in a longforgotten cave came a whisper perhaps from a stony face somehow this did not seem unusual she was probably imagining it anyway am i alone she asked yes and no came the cold whisper the stone face didnt move so that wasnt it in any event she knew stone didnt speak whence came the windy voice since there seemed to be no one else in the cave maybe this was sleep and this was a dream a night mare brought so all she had to do was wake up she pinched herself cruelly on the arm but though it hurt nothing else changed except that now she became aware of her feet something was nibbling on her tasty little toes she moved her head looking about she lay with her head in a nest of eggshaped stones and her feet in a circulating pool of chill water there were indeed cute little fish tasting her toes though they werent actually biting maybe they were just trying to alert her to her situation she sat up wrapped her cape around her and climbed to her feet she shouldnt have she screamed with pain her right knee was swollen as big as a globular little gourd and it hurt twice as large she quickly sat down again she was hungry she was thirsty and she missed her mother glory goblin and her father hardy harpy and her tutor magpie ever so much why had she ever come to a place like this she took sober little stock well she could do something for the thirst carefully she lowered her face to the cold crystalpure pool of water and touched it with her lips she sucked in several greedy little gulps and her raging thirst eased now with her face close to the pool she paid attention to the gold and scarlet shapes in it they were three tame coy fish she knew from her occasional swims on the surface she recognized their distinctive patterns they werent trying to eat her they just wanted company she reached down with one hand i wont hurt you she said im in the same position you are come let me tickle you and ill share my lifeanddeath struggle with you they wiggled appreciatively and played faint music on their scales suddenly the presence of the fish unnerved her they gave her hope and that frightened her maybe she could give them a message to take to the harpies to come and rescue her so she couldnt just give up and peacefully expire go friends and tell my folk where i am she said especially magpie if you can find her because magpie as one of the few caring demonesses would surely have the will and ability to help the fish played another little melody and scooted away gloha lay down again trying to return to sleep as there wasnt much else to do except suffer it took her only eight long minutes and two or three short ones to realize that sleep was unlikely to come she just lay there cold hungry wretched and rigid on the bed of egg stones wishing it were made of ruffled feathers though she had never been exactly comfortable on those either the stones glowed in pretty colors but remained uncomfortable so she got up putting her weight on her swollen knee very carefully so that the pain was almost bearable she walked to the largest crack in the cave wall she looked at each stony detail with a reasonably clear and open little orb or two if this were harpy thyme for her so be it she would make it as pensively little pleasant as she could she made her way to the center of the ruins in the cave hummed to herself and thought about magpie if the fish found her she would come if not gloha tapped a column it rang with a somber note she tapped another its note was different she found several other notes she organized them into a tune and sang along with it setting the golden motes to dancing in the shards of sunlight which now fell through the jagged cave cracks the rays of light vibrated like the strings of a harp changing color touching different places on the sandstone slab the effort warmed her body and perhaps the stone too each ruined runic surface seemed to resonate to her music becoming friendlier the spirits of die stones whispered counterpoint to her song and clustered around a breach hi the wall she hadnt seen before she went there and lo it was a window to another world that might be part of the surface of xanth or might lead to it this could be her way home if she could just somehow wedge her battered little body through the crack and follow the new chamber up and out her awareness of the surroundings increased and she heard the whispering voices of the stoned gathering of gargoyles now she knew their identity and what had happened to them some day your story will be known o gargoyles she said then their faint voices increased becoming an incoherent babble as if the air were being sucked out of the cave the cavern began to shake and stone fragments flaked off the ruins the crevice before her yawned wider afraid that the cavern was collapsing on her gloha screamed and with a dreadful little determination jammed herself through the crack out of the cave and into the next she fell down slippery shale and slid to the base of the scene was she truly free or was this but a tantalizing dream she would soon enough find out she half ran half flew taking as much weight off her bad knee as she could without rising up to bang into the rough ceiling she followed the steep trail up and aroundand it opened on the surface in sight of the harpy caves she ran out and the scene changed she tripped almost falling and turned around there were no ruins behind her no caves just xanthly forest so had it all been a bad dream she wasnt sure gloha blinked realizing that another wave of madness had passed leaving her damp but no longer immersed she had relived the time she got lost in die nether cavesthe ones the harpies claimed didnt exist she knew better and perhaps some day she would be able to prove it so there are ancient ruins with gargoyles trent remarked someone should excavate them and restore diem to their original grandeur you could see to that gloha reminded him if you decided not to fade away yet he smiled there will be others after me it would be no good for us old folk to remain too long cluttering the later history of xanth thats one reason the good magician keeps the secret of the fountain of youth she thought of something else why is it my madness that keeps being explored doesnt anyone else have any bad memories not i the demoness metria said im infernal i have no soul therefore no conscience my past doesnt bother me so i would not have any bad memories or dreams even if i cared i have no soul either marrow said but i would like to have one then perhaps i could suffer sieges of madness too which leaves me trent said i suppose if i stood upwind of you i would feel the next wave of madness first and perhaps then it would be my bad memories that animated gloha hastily moved downwind from him be my guest magician metria formed her smoky features into a huge sneer twentyfive years of kingshipthat must be a horrible memory from to when magician dor assumed the throne trent agreed however the twenty years before that i spent in mundania you might consider that a terrible memory ugh yes gloha agreed what is so bad about mundania marrow asked everybody knows its the dreariest place imaginable gloha said because it has no magic no wonder magician trent was desperate to return to xanth not necessarily trent demurred mundania just needs understanding here comes another wave metria said with relish gloha found herself on the bank of a river a solid stone bridge with a wooden drawbridge crossed it and a group of women were washing clothing nearby in the shallow edge of the water a twowheeled covered cart drawn by a single unicornno a horse because it had no hornwas just crossing the bridge she looked down at herself she was a child of five or six wingless in a human skirt and jacket sitting on the bank above the women she looked to the other side and saw a man standing not far off he was sort of thinhaired looking almost bald with a short reddish beard and brown eyes he had a funny little stand with a board on it and he was facing it and looking every so often at the women and the bridge then she realized that he was painting the scene so she got up and started toward him to see what his painting looked like child one of the women screamed it was the girls mother she just knew that without remembering it stay away from that man hes mad so gloha had to reverse course regretfully she went toward the bridge the cart had gone on but now a single man was walking across it he was oddly dressed and seemed to be somewhat confused but he was somehow familiar he was magician trent looking much the way he did now in his youthened state but she knew that this was the original young trentand this must be mundania because it certainly wasnt xanth she was sharing his madness vision of his past she tried to call to him but could not the child she animated just watched he crossed the bridge then looked around he saw gloha but seemed not to recognize her this wasnt surprising because she wasnt herself at the moment then his eye fixed on the painter he left the road and walked across to approach the man gloha wanted to listen to their conversation but knew her mundane mother would forbid her getting close so she busied herself on the bank chasing down a bug going one way and another just sort of coincidentally getting closer to the painter finally she sat on the bank and managed to scoot a bit nearer yet but she was disappointed trent tried to talk to the painter but the man seemed not to understand him at all gloha realized what the problem was trent was speaking xanthian which came naturally to all residents while the painter was speaking mundanian with different languages they could not communicate with each other very well finally trent gave up and went on gloha wanted to follow but couldnt the girl just was not going that way she wrenched herself trying to prevail to her surprise it worked maybe something happened then she was in an orchard the fruit trees were flowering beautifully they seemed to have hardly any leaves but were completely covered with flowers the painter was out there painting the scene she was unable to approach him again because the woman she occupied was just walking by but at least she could tell that this was a different day and different place however it was trent she wanted to see not the painter she wrenched again and this time found herself in another body watching him he was somewhat ragged now time must have passed and he had had a hard time foraging for food in this strange country but now he had found work at a farmstead doing menial work and seemed to be learning the language food and shelter seemed to be part of the deal he might have to sleep in the loft of the barn with the chickens but right now he was being served a wooden bowl of gruel by a plain young woman who must be the farmers daughter there was something familiar about her metria gloha tried to exclaim but of course nothing came out she was just another farm child snooping on others business she was alsooopsmale a farm boy part of his body was weird so she wrenched out of there and went to watch the mad painter well he wasnt mad of course she just thought of him that way because this was a scene in the wave of madness and he was the first man she had seen here still the way her body glanced glancingly at him suggested that this native considered the painter highly eccentric if not outright crazy but his painting was nice enough it was of a wheat field with a city in the background and there was a sort of soft rounded quality to the wheat plants andhe was animated by marrow bones he didnt look like marrow but there was just something about the way he moved and the shape of his skull that made her certain so he was a significant character of some sort and it behooved her to keepan eye on him until she discovered how this sequence played out she found that she could control her wrenches better with practice each one took her approximately where she wanted to go but always forward in time she could see the season advancing with each jump she had started in early spring now it was summer trents relationship with the farmers daughter improved she evidently liked him but was shy because she wasnt pretty she was lean and homely but of good character something was definitely developing there meanwhile the mad painter was everywhere each day he tramped out to establish his position and then he just stood there and painted on rainy days he did still lifestables with fruit and pottery but most days he was out painting the town in all its aspects trees flowers fields clouds houses the sea boats and people all of them had his rounded sometimes slightly fuzzy flair but all were pretty and realistic in their mad way it was amazing how much variety he could find in what had seemed to gloha like a pretty dull mundane town he never seemed to do anything with the paintings they just got stacked up and forgotten no one else seemed to want them trent married the farmers daughter gloha was gradually learning how to understand the weird mundane language and writing seeing it through the eyes of those she occupied so now she was able to understand the information on the wedding paper this was a place called aries in a region called france at a time called all of that was meaningless to gloha but since she was here now she might as well know it the mad painter kept right on painting as the season progressed sometimes he painted at night and slept in the day sometimes he went inside and painted piles of books or a pair of shoes or chairs or people eating at tables but mostly he painted fields and houses and people going among them often he made sketches and then completed the painting later as winter came he painted flowers in pots he seemed to be satisfied only when he was actually in the process of painting the rest of his life was blah but he really was mad because he got into a fight with another painterfriend then cut off part of his own ear and took it to a house where a number of women lived their profession was something gloha was not competent to fathom it seemed to relate to making men happy for short periods they werent bad women in fact they understood the mad painter about as well as anyone did and showed him some sympathy they had him taken to a place where folk got repaired and bandaged so that he wouldnt bleed to death that slowed down his painting trent was doing better he came to know the painter perhaps because both of them were considered mad in their ways and now they were able to talk if trent told the man of the wonders of his homeland no one would believe it if the painter spoke of it elsewhere maybe he did and that only increased his seeming madness because in the spring the painter went to a special place for the mad folk he kept on painting and when he couldnt go out he painted pictures of himself and others there or even invented figures gloha was startled to see him paint a picture of her with her wings though she had none here either trent had toldno he couldnt have because this was before gloha had ever existedor the mad painter somehow saw without seeing trents wife ordered a baby the mundane way which gloha found so weird that she didnt watch there was no stork insteadnever mind in the mundane year it arrived a boy and on occasion gloha animated it but she also wrenched out to watch the mad painter who was really more interesting right now he finally left the madhouse and went to another town where a mundane healer called a doctor tried to take care of him that didnt seem to help much but the painter did like the healers slender sweet daughter suddenly gloha was animating the girl who was exactly her age of nineteen and the painter painted her in a garden and as she was playing a music machine called a piano then suddenly he killed himself gloha shocked returned to trents family this was proceeding normally she watched the little boy grow older but this lacked flair she had become distracted by the mad painter and now that he was gone she just wanted to get out of this scene so she jumped ahead as fast as she could seeing the boy become a teenager almost a manand suddenly a bad illness came and trents wife and son died oh gloha cried that was awful yes trent agreed she was the only woman i ever loved and the only son there was nothing to do but to return to xanth where i had more power but that was a separate story the mad painter she said i liked him too he was named he paused working to remember it after all this time go van go something like that i think people got interested in his paintings after he died but they all thought him mad while he lived he wasnt he merely had strong artistic passions he understood about xanth he was the only one who believed me thats why i liked him he sighed and the girl he painted near the end who played the music the doctors daughter marguerite a nice girl like you this is odd marrow said i have never been a mad mundane painter before if i were capable of such emotion i would have considerable sympathy for the man he warranted sympathy trent agreed had he lived in xanth magic could have helped him he might have been successful and happy here instead he had to face life in mundania and he couldnt face it marrow said i dont know how anyone faces drear mundania metria said no magicmy kind doesnt even exist there she hesitated yet there was a certain ambiguity of feeling a certain what gloha asked doubt uncertainty indefiniteness vagueness equivocation i believe she had the right word the first time marrow said whatever the demoness agreed crossly trent glanced at her you animated my wife for a summarized period of fifteen years he said i must say that if you did not feel emotion you emulated it well enough to fool me i felt it metria said looking unusually pensive understand in real life i think youre an impossibly rejuvenated overthehill mortal human man a fit object for endless scorn but in that mad vision ishe something very like a tear glistened in her eye she did love you didnt she gloha understood how that could be and i loved her and my son trent agreed others called her unlovely but in her spirit she was beautiful and i think as time passed that came to be reflected in her physical aspect she did not understand me as the painter did but she treated me well from the outset and taught me the language and ways of that land and when we came to love each other i learned responsibility in a way i had never known before she made me what i was when i returned to xanth and you made her lovely metria said and she got you a fine son then that evil magic came a plague he agreed an illness that swept across that land of france and other lands taking its toll of folk each time i dont know why it spared me i sold the farm we had inherited to finance an expedition to xanth which i happened to know how to reach and recruited soldiers of fortune trained them prepared them to face magic and then had the irony of achieving the kingship of xanth without conquering it but i would never have returned if i had not lost those i loved there seemed to be a tear in his own eye the mad scene had shaken him that too gloha understood meanwhile she was also amazed she was learning aspects of the magicians history she had never suspected didnt you love queen iris she asked no that was a marriage of convenience we both understood the necessity and your daughter the sorceress irene her yes and my grandchildren which is why i am ready to fade out of the picture and leave xanth to them my day is past still metria was unusually hesitant now she assumed the form of the woman she had animated in the vision of mature age with her hah tied back in a bun she was not laughing at them or dissolving into smoke she just gazed at trent without speaking again please dont tease me with that form trent said mildly but gloha remembered how deceptive his mildness could be his true emotion was not far from expression ii know it is the madness metria said but i never felt feeling before would you the magician evidently didnt trust this would i what the demoness actually fidgeted would youkiss me trent stared at her then exchanged glances with marrow and gloha who were just about as surprised then gloha looked at marrow and decided go ahead i dont think shes teasing you agreed the skeleton said this is madness trent murmured then he took the image of his first wife in his arms and kissed her it turned out to be a long and feeling kiss thank you metria said when he released her there was definitely a tear on her face i wish it could have been real then she slowly faded out magician trent stood where he was thinking his own thoughts then he spoke in a whisper thank you demoness even if it was only a game to you i think she meant it gloha said the madness touched her as it touched all of us marrow agreed more than ever now i want a soul nevertheless i think we had better get out of this region trent said shaking off the mood i understand that the madness can strike in many ways and many are not pleasant the others were glad to agree they started walking at a swift pace with gloha flying ahead every so often to spy out the path but several more waves of madness caught them anyway though not as intense as the first ones they were getting out of the worst of it during one siege gloha returned to her harpy home and resumed her normal lifebut somehow after her experience in the secret cave that life was less satisfying than ever in another siege the focus was on marrow bones who got spooked in the boneyard by a rampaging monstergloha recognized smash ogreand fled only to get lost on the lost path he was finally found by esk ogre son of the ogre who had spooked him fortunately esk was only quarter ogre so they got along well enough they even found another lost denizen of the gourd bria brassie who was so pleased to be found that she married esk and set about living happily ever after but marrow never returned to the original boneyard which was why he was now looking for half a soul in that sequence trent animated esks image and gloha animated brias image at one point bria inadvertently embarrassed esk so she apologized in the gourd realm manner by kissing him passionately that was probably what led to their later marriage but this time it was trent and gloha kissing oh well gloha thought as the madness faded it wasnt as if it were the first time she had infringed on matters best left to the adult conspiracy in another siege gloha was farmed out to harpy relatives on the gold coast there she caught a rare illness they were afraid it was the purplehulled pink eye whose cure would have required her to be dipped into a snakepit filled with a mixture of poultry poop and peanut hulls fortunately magpie learned that it was something else and all that was required was a foultasting potion what a relief even if the potion did taste like the contents of that snakepit marrow played the doctor who had made the misdiagnosis and metria returned to play magpie that was an easy role for another demoness to assume at last they won free of it and came to the shore of lake ogrechobee there were ordinary houses and gardens not the creations of memory or horror the madness was over gloha was glad they had passed through only the fringe where it came in waves rather than solidly more of a dose would have been troublesome indeed now all they had to face were the curse fiends lets go say hello to the neighbors gloha said just to be sure theyre real trent and marrow nodded play they approached the first house it was a neat cottage set amidst a yard with clusters of pretty mushrooms with a little box on a post outside on the box was neatly printed the words richard c white whats that gloha asked trents lips pursed we may not be clear of the madness after all he murmured that is a mundane mailbox see the mans name is on it they commonly use two or three names there they keep men in little boxes in mundania marrow inquired trent smiled no only letters which are delivered each day delivered gloha asked you mean the storks carry letters there no there is a somewhat more cumbersome mechanism which varies from place to place and time to time my concern is not about that but because of the mundane nature of it my madness memories concerned mundania do you remember a house like this no so perhaps the similarity is mere coincidence the door of the house opened and a man emerged he seemed to be in his midforties hello he called are you folks lost we hope not trent answered we have just passed through a region of madness and we hope this is not more of the same are you richard white yes and i understand about the madness i came through it myself last year on the way here it was an awful experience yet tinged with longing i had my house built right at the edge so i could return through it if i ever decide to usually the madness stays within bounds though it has spread somewhat the past few days he paused but im being insensitive you folk are surely tired and confused after your experience come in and relax did you pass through the worst of it only the fringe trent said fortunately i am magician trent and this is gloha goblinharpy and this is marrow bones none of us are hostile folk they followed richard into the house i have read of you magician trent richard said but i thought you had faded out and if i may say so you look remarkably young i have been temporarily youthened for this adventure trent explained when it is done i will fade out richard brought out a bowl of oddly thin slices of something gloha wasnt sure what they were for trent took one smiling i believe these are potato chips a mundane delicacy in some regions he put one to his mouth and it crackled as he chewed it youare recently from mundania he asked richard yes i arrived about a year ago though of course that may not relate well to mundane time the folk of the black wave and the curse friends helped me build my house now i put in septic tanks for them he smiled at glohas blank expression those are big containers i install underground they take the refuse from the families privies and turn it into soil for their plants oh magic gloha said understanding we could use some of those for the harpy dung heaps perhaps i shall be able to do business with them when i catch up here richard said i like making xanth cleaner and healthier though it is really much better than mundania gloha finally got up courage to bite into a potato chip it crunched for her too its good she exclaimed surprised i am not yet fully acclimatized richard said i like it in xanth and im glad to be here but there were some mundane things i missed so i tried to have them duplicated here these arent the best potato chips but my technique is improving marrow was looking at a picture on the wall is that your home richard laughed no mats my effort to show jenny elfs home in the world of two moons i hope to meet her some day we have something in common in the way we but he broke off evidently suffering a painful memory you seem to know a lot about xanth for a mundane trent remarked how did you come here i always liked xanth richard said when things soured at home iwell its a story id prefer to leave in the region of madness im just glad that i managed to find my way here instead of getting lost few mundanes are able to get here trent agreed he looked around we thank you for the food and dialogue we have to go on about our quest now gloha and marrow are looking for things we hope to find somewhere along this route i understand some day perhaps i will travel hoping to find a good companion he showed them out how did you get such pretty mushrooms gloha asked admiring the many clumps i had some mundane paper money with me when i arrived richard explained i knew it was useless here so i buried it in jars for safekeeping in case i should ever go back to visit my sister but my hiding place turned out to be no good because the mushrooms sprouted over each jar leave them there gloha said its xanths way of keeping you here it must be he agreed he glanced in the direction they were going ive never been down that way ive heard theres a giant there and i dont want to ran afoul of him giants arent necessarily hostile trent said but we appreciate the warning well be careful they walked on refreshed waving goodbye to the nice man they found a convenient path around a small hill there was a tree house someone had cut a door and windows into an old beerbarrel tree and made it into a house there was no longer any smell of beer so the tree must have drained some time before it was surrounded by fancy iris flowers nearby were assorted fruit trees and one spreading nut bolt and washer tree a woman of about thirtythree was just fetching in some edible washers as their party passed she had harvested those that were in reach and was trying to get her fingers on one diat was just beyond she was standing on tiptoes somewhat unsteadily let me help you marrow said stepping close she turned and saw him eeeeek she screamed putting a good five es into it death gloha hurried forward understanding the confusion no merely a friendly walking skeleton she said quickly he means you no harm the woman took heart a sweet little goblin girl she said then her eyes went beyond and a young man im gloha gloha said she introduced the others giving only their first names were on a private quest im janet the woman said janet hines i havent been here long im sorry i screamed i have been told there is a giant in the vicinity so im a bit nervous marrow reached up and brought down the washer he handed it to janet in the realm of bad dreams where i originated it was my job to frighten folk he said i apologize for coming upon you so suddenly no thats all right janet said i have heard of your kind i shouldnt have reacted thank you for helping how did you come here gloha asked it is a dull story i wouldnt want to bore you we recently emerged from the region of madness trent said we are relieved to find ourselves among ordinary folk well it started when i was fourteen in mundania janet said i got sick i was a pretty girl some said but this wasting disease you are still a handsome woman trent said accurately enough gloha wasnt sure that anyone over the age of twenty could actually be pretty but he hadnt used that word it took away my ability to move and blinded me so that all i could do was listen and blink my eyes to respond but my mother read books to me and wrote letters for me i even had a nice new his named after meand i found it growing here so i knew this was where i belonged when i left mundania that explained the irises but what do you do most of the time gloha asked ive just been learning how to use my body again it was a shock when i began to see and i still dont see very well but its a little better each day i had to get used to all the sights at first i had to crawl out to pick up fruits and nuts and bolts that dropped from the trees but later i learned to walk again i think im almost normal now but dont you get lonely living alone gloha asked and was sorry the moment she said it realizing that it wasnt a proper question i do miss my mother who took care of me all those years janet admitted but i dont think i can go back im a little afraid to meet any other people i havent had the courage to go far from this house i found how long were you ill trent asked nineteen years she said sadly then you never had an adult life gloha said no friends no she stopped herself realizing that she was going wrong again i had friends janet said they came in and read to me but i suppose it was rather limited maybe you should take a walk around the hill gloha said theres a nice man there you might like to meet hes from mundania too oh i didnt realize perhaps i will they left janet and went on to the southeast but soon they came up against die shore of the lake but are the curse fiends directly on the line crombie pointed trent inquired my impression is that it transects the lake but not the center where the fiends live perhaps we can avoid them they are not known for their friendliness to strangers oh pooh a voice exclaimed i was hoping you wouldnt realize that you didnt have to brace the curse fiends it would have been so much more interesting trent exchanged a threeway glance with gloha and marrow the demoness had just confirmed his suspicion in that case we might as well walk around the lake gloha said relieved which end does the line cross the south end i think so we can walk south around it curses foiled again metrias voice came gloha wondered about that she was afraid that there was something they were about to encounter that the demoness would find interesting so metria was trying to make them think the opposite but that was only a suspicion and in any event they had to circle the lake one way or the other or make a boat walking around seemed less likely to trigger an encounter with the curse fiends however they encountered something else an ant engagement there seemed to be an ant war on for an army of combatants were laying siege to a giant hill each ant was huge and most looked formidable i think we had best detour around this trent murmured it seems that the warnings about the presence of a giant were well taken we just didnt understand what kind i could transform those ants that come close but they could overwhelm us if they charged in from all sides an antenna quivered the head turned toward them that looks like a defendant marrow remarked see the antagonistic mandibles lets get out of here gloha said we dont have an antidote to getting chomped up they retreated but then they heard the ants anthem carrying to the distant wings of the formation they were summoning their throng for an anticipated attack the sound was triumphant i think we had better hurry marrow said they may see us as cliants i think we need an inherant defense trent said they are already surrounding us gloha saw that they were im not conversant with their tactics she said whats relevant a roc bird if you transform me so i can carry you away no they have antiaircraft artillery he pointed to where several antis had great long snoots suitable for blowing rocks out with great force it is important to select the right creature then what she asked becoming alarmed an antelope he said reaching toward her suddenly she was a huge fourlegged creature with big antlers trent and marrow got on her back the ants stopped closing in gloha wondered why because she did not seem to be a really unusual creature you are now the antithesis of the ants trent explained the equivalant of something they cant handle just walk on by them gloha nervously did so soon she saw that the ants gave way before her magician trent had known what type of creature to use o nly one ant remained close she saw that it had a clipboard on whose paper it was making a note merely an accountant trent said tallying the ones that got away i suspect good riddance she thought once they were safely past the ant activity trent transformed her back to her natural form they continued skirting the lake a cloud passed it peered down at them then it huffed and puffed making itself bigger and darker thats fracto gloha cried what ill luck a nebulous mouth formed on the cloud ho ho ho it breathed its breath forming new cloudlets wed better find a dry place to camp trent said i think we wont be getting much farther today they hurried on looking for a place the cloud continued to build eager to catch them in the open you think youve gotten past the curse fiends without trouble a smokefilled voice said but you havent look there a dusky arm appeared pointing oh no gloha muttered metrias back but there is something there marrow said ahead of them was a huge building it seemed to be made of stone and brick below with a domeshaped roof above it was right across the general region of their line to the southeast a prominent sign before it said thunderdome but there was no thunder all was quiet except for fractos rising winds could there be a winged goblin male in there marrow inquired i doubt it trent replied as far as i know there are still no such males but we shall have to investigate at least maybe it will be dry inside gloha said the cloud was just about ready to rain on them then a nagging thought nagged her do you think fractos trying to drive us into that building because he knows theres something nasty in there close metria said her top half appearing its curse fiend property they had it built recently hoping to catch something in it the building nevertheless seemed to be deserted halooo trent called anybody home there was no reply they entered as the door was open they passed through a cavelike labyrinth of passages and emerged in a great central chamber that seemed to take up most of the building extending right up to the dome there were tiers of benches all around making the chamber resemble a monstrous covered bowl and there lying curled on the floor was a giant asleep so the rumors had been true after all how did he get in here gloha asked hes way too big for the passage we used he must have lifted up the lid and stepped in marrow conjectured perhaps he was looking for a dry place to sleep as we are trent agreed lets hope he is friendly i suppose we had better find out gloha said maybe we should wake him and if he tries to eat us you can transform him into something harmless agreed trent said they advanced cautiously on the sleeping creature they stood by his ear the air near him was foul and gloha realized that it was his putrid breath but maybe they could stay clear of the giant once they ascertained his nature giant she said carefully into the ear please wake up and tell us whether you are friendly to regular folk the giant snorted the air grew even worse his eyes opened he turned his head on the ground and peered at them oh hello he said his breath nearly knocking them over both by its physical force and its stench i am graeboe giant graeboe gloha gasped i met your brother i dont have a brother he protested greatbow she said trying her brave little best not to choke impolitely he said you were ailing ah my cousin yes i have an unconscionable malady and can no longer maintain my invisibility i did not realize you were here or i would not have intruded upon you my apology i shall depart for i know my presence is uncomfortable for normal folk no we intruded on you she protested you were here first we should be the ones to go as you wish he said stand back please for i shall now lift my head they retreated as the giant lifted his head and propped it with a hand he was too big to sit up in the building it was obvious that graeboe was not unfriendly but his breath marrow met them at the edge of the passage out i have just checked the exterior he announced it is raining canines and felines and lightning is striking every available target i think it will not be convenient to depart these premises for the nonce but theres a foulsmelling giant in there gloha said perhaps we can do something about that trent said metria why should i help you deal with the stink the demoness inquired appearing i enjoy seeing you mortals sweat because we shall be unable to remain here unless we can breathe he responded evenly so we shall have to go elsewhere and you will not have the dubious pleasure of snooping on our otherwise surely interesting dialogue with the giant you cant go elsewhere its raining bovines and equines dogs and cats gloha said whatever youre stuck here not if i transform gloha to a creature that likes water such as a gargoyle metria considered um you could do that very well what do you want a sprig of parsley she vanished and reappeared a moment later with the sprig i wouldnt let you manage me like this if you hadnt kissed me she said surely true he agreed taking the parsley i wouldnt have asked you if i hadnt kissed you metria looked stunned that too gloha was coming to understand trent had that effect on women who came to know him even demon women it seemed he walked to graeboe here is a sprig of parsley it has the magic property of purifying breath if you will eat it it may solve a problem i didnt know that graeboe exclaimed pleased he moved a huge hand and tried to take the sprig but it was much too small i shall stick it under your fingernail trent said he fitted the sprig into the massive crevice the giant lifted his hand and sucked the sprig from the finger the air cleared thank you graeboe said even i can smell the difference well it wasnt really your fault gloha said you cant be blamed for your illness it is kind of you to say that the giant said now his breath smelled like newmown hay i really dont like being objectionable so i have tried to stay away from other creatures exactly what is your ailment marrow asked i am not entirely clear about that graeboe said it came on me gradually i went to ask the good magician but he refused to talk to me understandably he merely sent word that help would come if i remained in this region long enough gloha took note that was the word marrow had received what are the symptoms of your malady apart from the breath trent asked increasing general weakness and susceptibility to illnesses i sleep much more than i used to yet remain tired i fear i will not be able to remain in xanth much longer oh where will you go gloha asked before she thought the giant smiled sadly to fertilize the trees i think lovely little lass at least i shall then be able to do something some good he glanced around i can hear thunder outside this dome seems to attract it i think you will not want to go out soon i have food do you care to share it yes gloha said she liked the giant now that she could breathe freely near him possibly his compliment had something to do with it graeboe brought out a snack from his purse a gross of pickle pies and a keg of green wine they acceptedliny portions which were all they could eat and settled down on the floor beside him it remained light in the dome though it was dark outside perhaps we could play a game or something to pass the time gloha suggested politely graeboe brightened do you like angry word puzzles i love them gloha said so they drew lines in the dust and alternated filling them in with words and it was fun the giant was ill and weak and somewhat homely but not stupid he had a good vocabulary and a fair sense of humor gloha realized that just because a person was different did not mean he was necessarily unpleasant then they settled down to sleep hoping that the storm would be through by morning trent spied a flea and transformed it into a pillow bush so they had plenty of pillows including a huge pile of them for the giants head gloha woke to the sound of a general stirring or rustling as of an enormous throng of people getting ready to witness some rare event or maybe just a flock of birds cleaning bugs from a spreading acorn tree she opened her eyes and saw that her first impression was the correct one the tiered benches of the bowl chamber were filling with people startled she looked at her companions magician trent and the giant graeboe were still asleep but marrow who didnt need sleep was alert whats happening she whispered to the skeleton the curse fiends are assembling he replied oh they must be getting ready to put on a play we must depart before we get in their way adipose chance a ball of smoke said what kind of chance metria the smoke expanded into the nether portion of an extremely well endowed woman corpulent obese fleshy potbellied rotund blubbery fat the top half of the figure formed whatever the face said crossly as the overall figure slimmed down they have latched down the dome and magically sealed the premises so we cant get out they can trap a demon gloha asked surprised i dont quite understand about that metria said disgruntled ive been having weird effects since associating with you folk her eye fell on trent since the madness gloha got another glimmer she remembered how intrigued cynthia had become with the handsome magician and had felt the attraction herself metria had played the part of the one woman trent had loved and it had affected her maybe she didnt really want to depart just yet but of course she wouldnt admit to having anything that could be seriously mistaken for human feeling so containing magic that ordinarily might not restrain her now had greater force at least it was a pretext to stay near trent but that was an incidental concern gloha addressed the major one what do they want of us i suspect we shall discover that in one and a half moments marrow said one of them is approaching sure enough in one and a half moments the man reached them trent and graeboe woke to the sound of his footsteps neither spoke evidently realizing that they needed more information before reacting who is responsible for this intrusion of our premises the man demanded metria huffed into harridan form listen oinkface she started gloha realized that this would never do cumulo fracto nimbus she said quickly realizing why the nasty cloud had chosen to harass them he blew up a storm last night and we had to hurry to cover this building seemed to be unoccupied so we camped here for the night well be glad to get on our way chubby chance he said sourly you have intruded on our demesnes and must pay the penalty gloha felt like huffing into harridan form herself penalty just because we came in out of the rain perhaps we should exchange introductions marrow said diplomatically certainly i am contumelo curse friend playmaster for the thunderdome i am gloha goblinharpy and these are marrow bones the demoness metria graeboe giant and magician trent she had thought that the last name would faze the man but it didnt maybe the curse fiends were too insular to be aware of who was who in the rest of xanth well strangers you have usurped our stage for a play disrupting our scheduled event you must therefore provide us with equal measure before departing the premises gloha looked around but none of the others seemed inclined to argue this case they were leaving it to her probably marrow was too polite to argue with anyone and trent was biding his time in case he should have to transform someone what kind of measure a play of course the people have made the arduous journey across the lake to come to our new theater and they must be entertained if you ilk hadnt occupied our stage preventing our scheduled company from setting up its props ilk metria said she was all too ready to argue but would probably just get them all into more trouble ill show you ilk you oerweening wretch she began to huff into a truly awful configuration what kind of wretch contumelo inquired the smoky shape paused in midhuff pompous insolent swaggering presumptuous haughty oerbearing arrogant whatever the half shape agreed crossly oh now look what youve done ive forgotten what i was huffing into perhaps a frog contumelo suggested almost smiling thank you a huge green frog formed hey wait half a moment the frog exclaimed that wasnt it i have three quarters of a mind to really i would have taken it for half a wit the frog seemed about to explode into a mushroomshaped cloud what kind of play did you have in mind gloha asked quickly something we just might find useful in our repertoire contumelo replied of course we would have to rewrite any abysmal effort that such poor players as you might essay but after you strut and fret your hour upon the stage you will be heard no more sometimes we glean inspiration from the unlikeliest sources a sneer hovered somewhere in his vicinity without quite getting established even marrow was beginning to look annoyed which was an unusual effect considering the bony blankness of his countenance graeboe who had been completely amiable hitherto was starting to frown only trent continued to look mildwhich might be the worst sign of all so if we put on a play for yousomething that maybe makes you laughthen youll let us go in peace gloha asked hoping to avert what was threatening to be an ugly scene your mere attempt will surely make us laugh what we require is something useful as i just informed you gloha sent a somewhat disheveled gaze across the others then maybe we should try to do that she said uncertainly now trent spoke we shall need props and scenery you should have thought of that before you intruded bumpkin contumelo said trent started to gesture toward the man but graeboe spoke i think some folk are not aware of the impression they make on others it was some time before i realized why folk were avoiding me as my illness developed the magician glanced at him and nodded gloha relaxed contumelo had just been spared a transformation he surely wouldnt have liked perhaps we can provide our own props trent said i should hope so the curse fiend said we shall give you half an hour to prepare then we shall expect you to perform of course all five of you must have significant parts we dont tolerate slackards he spun neatly about on heel and toe and stalked away half an hour gloha exclaimed she would have snorted but she didnt have the nose for it how can they expect iis to get a play ready when we have no chance to make up scenery to write a play to rehearsewhen weve never done anything like this before they dont marrow said they expect us to fail and be their laughingstock yes i remember now metria said they hired the black wave to complete this stadium and they like to lure strangers in and make them perform then they punish the strangers when they dont do well enough its how they relieve the dullness of their routine lives and fracto is hi on it gloha said realizing of course how do they punish the failures marrow asked they hit them with one of their massed curses it so dazes the victims that they can barely wander away and it may be a long time before they are able to function normally again trent frowned i think the curse fiends are about due for a reckoning yet it is no worse than what dragons or goblins do to those they catch graeboe pointed out he glanced at gloha present company excepted trent nodded again your tolerance becomes you yet it we are unable to put on a play that satisfies them given what i deem to be unfairly short notice i shall not sit still for a curse i shall have to take action such as turning one of them into a sphinx who will then tromp the rest of them to pulp metria said enthusiastically oh no that would not be kind graeboe protested we must simply avoid the issue by putting on a suitable play i never saw a giant as peaceful as you the demoness said not meaning it as a compliment that is because the other giants are invisible you have seen none of them he pointed out reasonably enough most of us do not wish to cause small folk any inconvenience that is why we do not tread on their villages or fields we wish only to exist in mutual harmony the more gloha learned about the giants the more respect she had for them however there was no time for incidental dialogue what kind of play can we do in a hurry that puts all five of us into significant roles i have no idea something simple i think trent said perhaps we should adapt a wellknown fable or story there should be one that provides suitable roles for all of us for a giant graeboe asked interested jack and the beanstalk gloha cried except that its a mean giant well perhaps i could portray such a giant as long as it is only in a play but theres no demoness in that story metria protested then maybe aladdin and the magic lamp gloha said you could be the genie trent could play aladdin or the genie in the bottle the demoness agreed with relish with a female genie every time he uncorks the bottle she smokes out and kisses him she formed into smoke with a huge pair of lips but theres no giant in those ones graeboe said and no goblin girls in any of them gloha added and no walking skeletons marrow said trent scratched his head can anyone think of a tale that includes a giant a demon a man a skeleton and a winged goblin none of them could i suppose i could be some other kind of girl gloha said a fairy perhaps or even a human girl if i pretended my wings were a white cloak or a princess graeboe said many tales have princesses and the demoness could assume some other form such as a frog for the frog prince say yes metria agreed maybe the frog princess who marries the little prince she looked at trent again but what form can i assume marrow asked somewhat plaintively death graeboe suggested say yes gloha agreed the same role your kind plays in dreams to the frog prince we keep running into that problem gloha said no single tale works but a medley might graeboe said a medley a mixture of tales trent explained we can put them together so as to have all the characters we need but what about the scenery gloha asked the costumes and things well just have to play ourselves as it were graeboe said im dressed as a giant youre dressed as a girl marrows a skeleton and trent is a man metria can assume any form wed better concentrate on the story line and the scenery marrow said that will be difficult to make in the small time remaining i can transform local bugs into things like wallflowers and paintbrush flowers trent said we can make scenes from them contumelo approached you have five minutes to curtain call he said with evident satisfaction we had better get organized trent said i suggest that we separate into committees metria and i can devise scenery and gloha and graeboe can organize the plot but what of me marrow asked you are perhaps our most objective member you can coordinate the two committees and make the announcements but they wont pay attention to a skeleton yes they will if youre in costume trent spied a bug on the ground and reached toward it suddenly it was hat tree pick a suitable hat and wear it for announcements marrow selected a tall stovepipe hat and donned it suddenly he looked very official gloha flew up to perch on graeboes lifted hand so she could talk to him conveniently we must assemble several tales into one in a hurry she said i hope your imagination is bigger than mine right now my head is larger at any rate he considered briefly perhaps if we start with jack and the beanstalk to get the man and giant and then bring in a captive princess yes he wants to eat her graeboe winced oh i hope not that wouldnt be nice but this is only a play the giant has to be mean or it wont be exciting but in the real tale the giant valued precious things like a hen to lay golden eggs and a magic harp how about a magic harpy she asked laughing and the giant doesnt want to kill her he wants to marry her but of course shed rather be eaten so marrow approached what scenery and props will be needed a magic bean to grow into a beanstalk gloha said a land up on a cloud a castle for the giant thats enough to start the skeleton said and went to the other committee in a moment he was back perhaps if i knew the story i could narrate the interstices wonderful idea she agreed she described what they were working out two more minutes of hectic coordination brought them to curtain time trent had transformed bugs to various things several large wallflowers a giant bedbug pillow and blanket bushes a big box elder tree with red black and yellow slats and assorted other things stored within that box they were perched around graeboes curled body which actually took up most of the stage glohas confused little cranium was spinning could they possibly make this work are you ready to perform contumelo inquired with grim relish marrow stepped up donning his tall hat indeed please get out of our way functionary gloha would have laughed at the expression on the curse fiends face if she hadnt been so nervous about whether their scatterbrained assemblage would work she retreated to hide in the box elder until her turn came to be onstage in a round theater like this there really was no way to go offstage but the box served well enough a hush descended across the audience which now pretty well filled the theater gloha was surprised by the number of curse fiends there were then she saw that a number of faces were black the black wavers were attending too they looked more friendly marrow bones stepped to the center of the arena greetings or should i say curses to you he said grandly doffing his impressive hat for a moment there was a murmur gloha wasnt sure whether it was of approval mystery or outrage we the haphazard players are pleased to present the princess and the giant he turned making a grand sweep of one bony arm once upon a thyme and a thyme plant appeared beside him gloha was startled until she realized mat it wasnt real metria had assumed the form she saw with satisfaction that the audience was surprised too marrow waited for the reaction to fade out then he resumed there was a handsome young man named jack trent walked out from the box and stood in the center of the stage which was defined by the giants curled body he looked exactly as described jack was poor but honest marrow said his family had fallen on hard thymes here jack tripped over the thyme plant there was a squeak from the depths of the audience someone almost thought the joke was funny but had managed to stifle the laugh so jack had to take the family bovine to town to sell for coins to live on marrow continued suddenly the thyme plant was a holy cow seemingly none the worse for the huge holes through her body metria had changed form again jack took hold of the cows ear and led her in a circle around the field which was that portion of the arena outside the giants body mooooo she complained loudly but on theway to town jack encountered a suspicious character marrow continued he removed his announcer hat put on a sleazy hat and stepped up to meet jack this time there was a laugh it was from contumelo who just couldnt resist the description of marrow as suspicious and where are you going my fine innocent young mark the sleaze inquired i am taking our family cow to town to sell for coins so we can eat jack replied innocently ah i have something better than coins the sleaze said i have this magic bean which i will sell you for your holy cow because i like your attitude gee thats nice of you jack said naively the play took them through the exchange and jack went home to the box carrying the bean which had appeared when the cow disappeared he entered the box mother dearest see what a good bargain i have made he called from the box a magic bean gloha screeched in her best emulation of harpy mode speaking for the unseen mother you h idiot she was rather proud of that word it wasnt of full harpy cussquality but it was within hailing distance of nasty she took the bean and threw it back out onto the main stage jacks mother was not entirely pleased the narrator said with fine understatement she threw the seed out the window and jack had to go to bed without his supper however it really was a magic bean and in the night it sprouted and grew somewhat the bean sprouted on the stage and grew rapidly into a giant green vine that was metria again changing her shape the vine grew up high becoming as large as a tree though somewhat more diffuse in fact it grew right up to the clouds marrow said the vine fogged becoming a cloud that obscured the stage giant and all and in the morning when jack saw that he decided to see what he might find up in that cloud so he climbed the beanstalk and emerged on top of the cloud the cloud onstage cleared in one section and there was jack just standing up as if he had come up from below he put up his hand to shade his eyes as if looking around and there on the cloud was a giant castle marrow narrated more of the cloud thinned to reveal an impromptu castle with walls made from wallflowers and a main turret formed by the box elder most of the structure was perched on graeboe as if he were the foundation it was really fairly impressive considering so jack went to the castle to see what he could find marrow said jack walked to it and pulled open a swinging wallflower to show the interior fortunately the giant was sleeping at the moment and there was graeboes face before him stretched out across several bedbug beds snoring hugely jack tiptoed around the sleeping face and there on a pile of twenty feather quilts on the giants hand sat gloha looking despondent there in the giant castle he found the giants captive a princess the narrator continued she was tied to her bed and not at all happy about it who are you jack asked i am a captive princess gloha replied as you can tell by my fancy feather robe she moved her wings a trifle whats a nice princess like you doing in a place like this the giant wants to marry me and of course i would rather be chopped up into little quivering pieces she replied so he has tied me to this fiendishly uncomfortable bed she gestured at the pile of quilts but those look very soft jack protested they are but under them he put a bean i might have tolerated half a pea with an effort but a whole magic bean was just too much see im all blackandblue there was a snigger from the audience because of course glohas natural body was goblin dark but i outsmarted him i think she continued i managed to bounce around enough so that the bean rolled out and fell to the ground below this cloud so now i can sleep more comfortably but of course i still groan every so often so that the mean giant will think im still being tortured so that was the bean i traded my holy cow for jack exclaimed shhh youll wake the giant indeed the giants face stirred and snorted both jack and princess were desperately quiet and after a moment the snoring resumed i must rescue you from this face uh fate jack said gallantly let me untie you and take you home with me oh you cant untie me the princess said this is a magic cord she lifted her wrist showing the cord looped loosely around it only the giant can untie it and of course he wont unless i agree to marry him then how can i rescue you jack asked perplexed you must get the frog to help you the frog the frog can fetch out a precious golden bottle that contains the only thing that the giant fears she explained thats why he threw it in the cistern thinking that nobody would ever find it there but the frog knows marrow stepped out again so jack went to the rear of the castle he announced while jack did that walking around to graeboes rear where the frog lived in a deep cistern and there was a huge green frog metria in another role croak the frog inquired i need a precious golden bottle that lies in the bottom of the cistern jack said because it contains the only thing that the giant fears can you fetch it out for me certainly i can manface the frog agreed there was a pause well jack asked after a bit well what will you fetch out the bottle for me oh you asked only whether i could not whether i would certainly i will peasant man there was another pause well you asked whether i would you did not say whether you wished this jack began to get impatient listen frogface then he thought the better of it yes i wish this that is good to know mammal creature there was a pause well why dont you jack asked you did not say please please fetch out the bottle for me whats in it for me toothmouth oh you mean you want something in return do i look like a charity outfit of course i want something in return what do you want i want you to take me to your leader huh youre not the brightest character are you the frog observed jack evidently somewhat nettled nevertheless managed to remain mild why do you want to go to my leader i mean i should think youd prefer to remain hi your nice chill puddle or something youre a peasant right so your leader is a prince or king right i need to be kissed by one of those kissed by a prince why because i am not an ordinary frog am an enchanted princess doomed to remain a frog until kissed by a prince or king if you were a prince id have you kiss me since youre just a peasant youre no good to me but if you take me to your prince he can kiss me then the enchantment will be broken and i will return to my glorious natural form and can go home to my fabulous kingdom okay oh i see okay ill take you with me but it may be a while before i reach the kings castle ill wait the frog said then she dived down to the bottom of the cistern and fetched up the golden bottle from where it sat at the edge of the stagey jack took it then he headed back to the castle hey wait for me the frog cried but he was already out of hearing he brought the bottle to the princess now what he asked her i dont see anything in there i dont know whats in it she said only that whatever it is is what the giant fears there was a thumping at the walldoor croak whats that the princess asked alarmed oh thats just the stupid frog wanting to come in why does it want to come in because i told it id take it with me so it could kiss a prince some day well then you made a deal and you must honor it the princess said sternly let the frog in besides it will wake the giant otherwise with all that thumping indeed one of the giants eyelids quivered so jack went out and let the frog in it hopped up on the twentyquilt bed oh this is comfy it said but theres a discontinuity there must have been a pea underneath not long ago there was a nasty old magic bean the princess said how did you know im a princess my skin is very sensitive i felt the ripple left by that erstwhile bean oh that explains it now what do we do with the bottle the peasant must take it to where the giant is sleeping and open it it contains a bad dream that will frighten him he fears nothing in the world but the dream realm is something else so jack took the bottle to the sleeping giant the narrator said as jack did so he opened the bottle and out poured a menacing vapor indeed the vapor swirled and thickened then thinned to revealthe narrator in a pointed horrorhat he did the danse macabre rattling his bones i am death the white skull said i have come to take you away with me giant who the giant inquired blankly death i was locked in that bottle but now the deadlock has been unlocked and i am free to resume my business when i take a dryad from her tree i leave only deadwood behind now i have come for you so make yourself ready for your dead end oooh the giant groaned then he burst into tears oh im glad my mother the queen of giants cant see me now bless her royal bones all i wanted to do was make her happy by not marrying below my station and now im going away with death instead oh woe is me hes a prince the princess and the frog asked together so it seems jack said but dont worry death is reducing him to a quivering nonentity and we shall soon be rid of him not so fast mack the frog said thats jack not so fast jack i want him to kiss me first and im sorry we made him cry the princess said i didnt know he was royal hey prince giant would it make you feel better if i agreed to marry you after all the giant woke oh yes he agreed immediately cheering up but first kiss me the frog said wait the princess said if he kisses you and you return to princessly format he might want to marry you instead of me are you kidding the frog demanded ive got a princely boyfriend back home my father doesnt like him so he enchanted me to keep me from marrying my boyfriend he figured my boyfriend would never find me and kiss me back to femininity before i got old an unattractive now well elope before my father catches on and itll be too late for any more enchantment but i wanted to marry the princess jack protested both princess and frog burst out laughing you a peasant marry a princess just what fantasy world do you live in mack the frog asked well i should have something for my trouble jack said out of sorts oh take a bag of money and get out of here the giant said tossing down a tiny bag that was nevertheless all jack could carry death doffed his hat and the narrator donned his hat and so the giant kissed the frog he said as the giant did so and the frog puffed into an extremely voluptuous princess with a remarkably low decolletage and then freed the other princess and she kissed the giant as gloha flew up to perch on graeboes lower lip so as to kiss his upper lip and they married and lived happily almost ever after jack took his bag of gold home to his mother who was fairly pleased considering that it wasnt a bigger bag and so were the village peasant girls who suddenly discovered qualities in jack they had somehow overlooked when he was poor and death freed from imprisonment in the bottle resumed business as usual as many of you will discover in due course he bowed to the audience we trust you have enjoyed our presentation he concluded with a lipless grin the cynical curse fiends tried to retain their aloofness then it cracked one of the members of the black contingent started applauding and then a few more gloha saw that the first one was sherlock whom she had met when riding on swiftmud with magician trents party others around him joined in and finally some of the curse fiends not a majority but a fair minority she wondered whether sherlock supported her because he recognized her and trent or because her goblin skin was as dark as his or because he simply liked the play she hoped it was the last reason contumelo grimaced the applause meter said your effort qualifies barely we should be able to rewrite your play and make it into something presentable to ignorant children you are free to go now about time curseface the frog princess said then graeboe slowly heaved himself to a hunched sitting position lifted up the edge of the dome stood and stepped out of the building gloha trent and marrow exited the arena in more conventional manner metria popped out of sight with a rude noise leaving only a foul waft of smoke behind to annoy the curse fiends they saw the giant standing outside he looked lonely whats the matter gloha called to him well i dont have anywhere to go he replied geographically or in life would you like to come along with us gloha asked before she thought why yes he agreed i enjoyed our brief association and would like to extend it perhaps i can be of some further service to you before i expire fool metrias voice came from the air beside her your soft girlish human heart is going to get you into trouble sometime gloha wasnt sure how they were going to manage with a sick giant along but graeboe was a nice person so she didnt really regret her impulse and it was possible that he would be able to help them out in some way such as if they had to cross a mighty river chasm or desert trent and marrow didnt comment nympho they walked on along the invisible line crombie had pointed out southeast of lake ogrechobee there were routine problems like rivers dragons cliffs and unfriendly bs but they were able to handle these with the giants big hand and a little imagination then as they were looking for a suitable place to camp for the night where there was room for the giant to sleep gloha spied a creature flying in for half an instant she was afraid it was a dragon or griffon but then she saw that it was a crossbreed it wasnt exactly a harpy because the body was wrong but it wasnt a griffon either hey she called startled the creature hesitated then it flew away wait gloha cried flying after it im not an enemy im a crossbreed a winged monster like you the other creature paused allowing gloha to catch up it turned out to be female oh so you are she said i was afraid you were a man with a bow and arrow or something gloha hovered near her no im a unique creature i think maybe you are too what are you im half girl half griffon my names amanda she blushed faintly she seemed to be somewhat younger than gloha her shoulderlength yellow hair was tied back with a blue ribbon that matched the hue of her wings my parents met at a love spring they dont speak of it often gloha appreciated that im gloha goblinharpy they shook hands hovering im looking for my species amanda said but i havent found any others quite like me i dont know what i should call myself you look like a girlfon to me gloha said a girlfon thats perfect well i had better get on home before mom misses me bye gloha called as the girlfon flew away she was somewhat sorry that it hadnt turned out to be a male winged goblin still if there were a love spring nearby there might be such a goblin that could be why crombies finger had pointed this way so maybe this was an encouraging sign she returned to their campsite it wasnt the one i was looking for she said regretfully perhaps next time graeboe said he was now sitting carefully beside their campsite youre such a nice girl there must be a boy for you somewhere thank you she said flattered trent had meanwhile transformed a small plant into a big tent caterpillar the tent had room for himself gloha marrow metria and the giants face the rest of graeboe was covered by several other tents cushions from a transformed pillow bush served for their beds and graeboes head they feasted on berry pies because pie plants were the easiest way for transformations to provide food there were also pods of milk from milkweeds and chocolate from a chocolate plant metria and marrow did not need to eat so contented themselves with exploring the surrounding region graeboe oddly did not eat any more than trent did are you sure its enough gloha asked him concerned my illness diminishes my hunger the giant replied have no concern but i am concerned you cant do giantly things if you dont eat like a giant true i am weak and worsening i know i am not the best of company i appreciate your willingness to have me with your party this gives me some valued solace dont you know anything about your malady maybe you could find a cure if you had a name for it i know only that it is a disease of the blood my body does not make blood quite the way it should as a result i have less and less of it and that makes me weaker each day i would have trouble keeping up were you folk not so much smaller than i am maybe magician trent could transform you to some other form that doesnt need as much blood she suggested that would not help trent said that form would have the same illness i can change folks forms but cant heal them maybe if we found a bloodroot no graeboe said gently my body can use only the blood it makes itself it comes from my bones but please do not dismay yourself on my account i have no wish to cause you any discomfort lovely little creature gloha was flattered again she wasnt at all sure she deserved the good opinion the giant had of her probably he was merely thankful for someone to talk to the good magician must have had reason to send you to this region just as he indirectly sent me here maybe there are answers for both of us just a little farther along it is nice to think so he agreed wanly then marrow and metria returned whats this the demoness exclaimed making out in a tent what passes for your mind is in a rut trent informed her graeboe and gloha have merely been talking then we were doing better than you metria retorted gloha knew that this was supposed to arouse her curiosity and force her to inquire she stifled it as long as she could but it was too much for her to contain what were you doing she asked the demoness looked at her triumphantly i thought youd never ask we were summoning the stork gloha trent and graeboe choked almost together but gloha managed to speak she kissed me marrow explained that is not quite the same its close enough metria said stoutly walking skeletons do not summon the stork marrow said we assemble our little ones from spare bones but in any event i would not choose to summon or construct with a demoness i am a married skeleton oh pooh metria said whats so special about marriage the stork listens regardless you are a demoness trent reminded her you have no soul and therefore no conscience you cant love you have no basis for understanding but id like to understand metria said frustrated why gloha asked curious in the madness region i was trents wife for a time the demoness said there was something there it seemed interesting i dont like missing out on anything interesting i want to know what love is graeboe shook his head slightly any greater motion would have knocked down the tent i would like to know what love is too possession of a soul does not guarantee love thats right gloha agreed i have never known storkvariety love because youre the only one of your type metria said when you find a winged goblin man youll get into stork language quickly enough to answer your question trent said marriage is to those with souls a sacred contract the parties to it agree to love only each other and to summon the stork with no other people it is possible to summon the stork outside of marriage but this is generally frowned on you as a demoness can assume any form you wish you can go through the motions of summoning the stork simply by showing some naive man your panties and encouraging him to proceed but that isnt marriage or love maybe if i married someone id find out about love she said i doubt it you could go through the ceremony but it wouldnt mean anything to you the only demoness i know of who was able to love was dara who married magician humfrey a long time ago but she had a soul as soon as she lost her soul she reverted to form and left him in the lurch but she came back metria said a hundred and thirtysix years later he reminded her because she was bored she doesnt actually love him now she merely emulates the mood however you might ask her what it was like when she did love him i have she said i would never understand so there you are maybe you should give it up metria and let us proceed on our various quests without your kibitzing no i want to know what love is youre my closest approach maybe if i watch you close enough ill learn not by trying to seduce married skeletons he said metria pondered briefly then her clothing began to fuzz away or married magicians trent added closing his eyes curses foiled again the demoness muttered dissolving into smoke gloha closed her own eyes she had a certain sympathy with metrias frustration it was not too far from her own in the morning they moved on gloha wasnt sure whether it was her imagination but she had the impression that graeboe giant was weaker it took him some time to get to his feet and then he seemed unsteady but it might simply be that he was always a bit fuzzy in the morning so she flew up to inquire graeboe are you all right she asked as she landed on his shoulder near his face i mean apart from your malady please do not concern yourself pretty thing he replied now stop that she said with an annoyed little irritation you did it last night you think that because im so small i must be childlike and youre patronizing me i am concerned oh no gloha he protested i dont see you as a child at all youre a lovely person in body and mind i merely do not wish to burden you with any problem of mine well tell me anyway she said mollified he sighed i am weaker each day i think i shall be able to keep on my feet only a few more days when i fear i will not be able to get up again i shall make my way to some desolate wilderness and there expire as i have said but youre supposed to find help here and it must be us who can help you somehow you cant just give up perhaps so he agreed not debating the matter it must be so she said firmly she walked along his shoulder came to his giant ear spread her wings and flew up to kiss his earlobe then she flew back down to ground level they proceeded southeast in their assorted fashions graeboe took huge slow steps setting his feet down carefully so as not to crush any nouses or trees metria smoked out at one place and smoked in again at another gloha made short flights trent and marrow simply walked no more monsters bothered them perhaps having caught on that a party including a giant and a magician made poor prospects for prey then they came to the faun nymph retreat they could tell because there was a sign by the path saying that it turned out to be a small mountain by a lake where the fauns and nymphs cavorted happily all day long the fauns were human in form except for their cute little horns and goats feet while the nymphs were completely human except for their attitude when chased they screamed fetchingly kicked their feet and flung their hair about when caught they gloha looked around nervous that children might be in the vicinity fortunately there were none so no violation of the adult conspiracy to keep children ignorant of interesting things was occurring she understood that princess ida had grown up in this generalvicinity but she had been too innocent to know that she wasnt supposed to see such activity because what they were doing was stork summoning constantly the odd thing was that the storks seldom if ever responded to these constant signals maybe they knew that fauns and nymphs could not raise children because they didnt have families they were unable to remember anything overnight so no enduring relationships existed i wonder where new fauns and nymphs come from gloha said musingly as they watched the activity of the retreat i mean if the storks dont come here they are immortal i believe trent replied at least until some few of them become mortal remember jewel the nymph didnt begin to age until she fell in love and married jewel was always a special nymph gloha said she put the gemstones in the ground for prospectors to find she had a soul i think she was able to remember things even before she married yes she was special she may have been on the way to womanhood which was why she was capable of love now that shes retiring a new nymph from this region is being trained to do the job and no doubt she is starting to remember things too but here they have no need for memory it may be that any who leave the retreat start to assume normal human qualities marrow was tilting his skull looking here and there metria noticed this you are interested in peeking at stork summoning she inquired snidery no i think for them that is mere entertainment the skeleton replied what concerns me is the apparent imbalance in the numbers now the others were curious imbalance gloha asked it looks to me as if they are doing it in the usual ratio one faun to one nymph at a time but see how many fauns are left over marrow said in fact lines of fauns are forming near each nymph i had understood that the numbers were supposed to be approximately equal that seems not to be the case he was right there were about three times as many fauns as nymphs as a result the nymphs were considerably busier than the fauns that did not seem to bother the nymphs but the fauns seemed to be somewhat unfaunly out of sorts it was evident that each would really have preferred to have one or more nymphs to himself perhaps we should inquire trent said with a third of a smile so gloha stepped up to the nearest faun why arent there as many nymphs as fauns here he looked at her a tiny winged clothed nymph he exclaimed i didnt know you existed come play with me he reached for her marrow extended a bonearm to block the faun this is not a nymph he said merely a foreign visitor answer her question oh the faun stifled his disappointment i dont know why there arent enough nymphs there just arent is all he ran off in pursuit of a nymph who was momentarily free harpy thyme that of course is the problem trent remarked they dont remember something must have happened to a number of the nymphs a dragon ate them gloha asked horrified dragons and other predators are impartial about the sex of their prey trent said thoughtfully they should take out about as many fauns as nymphs there must be some other explanation men maybe metria said human men really like nymphs i understand while human women dont care as much for fauns true trent agreed but human men are discouraged from raiding this retreat oh gloha asked how i dont see any discouragement do you see that bed in the center of the retreat trent asked her yes but no ones on it its whats under it that counts snortimer is there i believe who snortimer my granddaughter ivys monster under the bed he took the place of stanley steamer dragon protecting the fauns and nymphs he cant leave the bed by day of course but any intruding men soon try to lie on it with a nymph or two and thats when snortimer grabs their ankles and scares them away but adults dont believe in monsters under the bed gloha protested they do when snortimer grabs them he replied this region is special as the presence of the fauns and nymphs suggests they have no trouble believing in him being childlike with so many believing in him he has much more power than his kind usually does also ivy enhanced him before she left so hes unusual i understand he does an excellent job i find this hard to believe gloha said shaking her head naturally because youre an adult only children and old folk about to fade out recognize the validity of monsters under beds i recognize it marrow said so do i metria said you folk are from the dream and demon realms you dont count i recognize it graeboe said squatting down to join the conversation giants dont count either trent said with a good twothirds of a smile only normal runofthemill closetohuman folk count in this respect and i think you gloha will be able to believe if you make the effort because you arent exactly of that description gloha made the effort maybe around the edges i can believe she said but we must proceed to more serious concerns trent continued this retreat is on the line we are following which suggests that this could be where we shall find the solutions to one or more of our problems we should explore it carefully before going beyond i believe there are mainly the ever glades farther in the direction we are going which we would prefer not to face if we dont have to gloha had heard of the ever glades which went on forever and ever she hoped they would not have to go there i dont think im likely to find a suitable man here and i dont think the fauns and nymphs have souls to share with anyone i dont see anything to help graeboe either in fact she was feeling a tiny little tad discouraged the ways of magic can be strange trent said we shall just have to explore this until we are certain that our answers arent here he was making sense which was the problem gloha wasnt eager to remain in this region of constant dubious activity the male members of the party seemed to find it interesting which also bothered her on some hidden level lets camp out of sight of the retreat metria suggested at times gloha could almost think of beginning to start to like the demoness yes lets she agreed as you wish trent said with the suggestion of a significant fraction of a smile so they camped by a stream that was hurrying to find the lake and set up with tents and pies and such there was still time in the day so they explored the vicinity especially along the invisible line that crombie had pointed out graeboe stood and looked far in all directions but spied nothing special metria puffed in and out to all intermediate directions but also spied nothing special marrow walked fearlessly in all near directions spooking stray plants and creatures but he too spied nothing special trent lay back on a bedbug and pondered what are you pondering gloha inquired i am trying to decide whether the mystery of the missing nymphs bears any relation to our several quests how could it she asked listlessly that is a mystery in itself but suppose that whatever is causing the loss of nymphs also represents the solution to our problems what do you suppose that might be she focused her alert little attention on the question something with half a soul to give marrow and a cure to give graeboe and an ideal man to give me something about that last bothers me trent said suppose we do find a winged goblin male how can you be sure that he will be your ideal partner why she said flustered he would have to be wouldnt he the only other member of my crossbreed species yet i have encountered very few goblin males whom i would care to know a goblin male gloha felt a pang of apprehension the average goblin male was ugly brutish badtempered violent and somewhat stupid much like the average harpy female why should a winged one be any better and why should she ever want to marry such a man oh she said distraught ive been seeking a fantasy not necessarily the magician said it just may mean that the answer to your quest is not precisely what you have supposed perhaps it is not a winged goblin you seek but selfdiscovery i dont understand that at all she cried and ran out of the tent she knew that she couldnt actually run physically away from the truth but she needed time to figure things out for herself she found herself walking toward the retreat but as she did she couldnt stop herself from mulling it over what did she want a nice handsome intelligent thoughtful considerate loving winged goblin man and no goblin man was like that why should a winged one be any different she was a fool to suppose that such an ideal man existed or could ever exist yet crombie had pointed out a direction that suggested that there was such a man how could that be reconciled she shook her perplexed little perception wishing she could find an answer where she feared there was none so magician trent thought she needed selfdiscovery but she was satisfied with herself it was her prospects that needed fixing didnt trent know that what good was selfdiscovery if she had to spend the rest of her lamentable little life alone shed much rather spend it with someone like trent himself he answered all of the description except for his size and lack of wings she spied something ahead lying on the ground near the edge of the open region that was the retreat it looked like a piece of popcorn but it was the wrong color popcorn was supposed to be buttery yellow or caramel tan this was bright red she came up to it and picked it up it certainly looked like popped corn she put it to her nose it smelled like popcorn she tasted it it was popcorn she looked around she spied another piece right at the edge of the faunnymph glade this one was blue she picked it up and ate it too it was definitely popcorn and very good if she closed her eyes she would not be able to tell what color it was it tasted exactly like regularcolored popcorn freshly made now she stood at the edge of the retreat the fauns and nymphs were still at it chasing each other down and striving enthusiastically to summon every stork in xanth odd that they hadnt caught on that it wasnt working but of course it took time for the stork to make a delivery and these creatures remembered only the day they were in so never learned better that explained that but didnt explain why so many nymphs were missing trent tiiought that mystery might be related to glohas quest for the ideal man how could it maybe trents real age was making him senile despite his greatly youthened body there were no more colored popcorns too bad they had been delicious as well as diverting her briefly from her private concerns she turned about to go back to the camp then she saw another popcorn this time a green one and beyond it a purple one there was actually a trail of them she had intersected it at an angle so had seen only the last two she went to pick up and eat the green and purple pops finding them as delicious as the first two then she followed the trail along the divergent path through the forest how had these brightly colored morsels come here had someone been carrying a bag of them and some had spilled out leaving a trail if so she should catch up and tell that person to close up the hole before he lost the whole bagful she passed under a hugely spreading acorn tree intent on the continuing trail suddenly a net dropped over her she was so surprised she forgot even to scream she just stood there stupidly wondering what had happened then she tried to spread her wings to fly away but of course they were fouled in the net an ugly man dropped down beside her he reached for her his hands were huge and gnarled now she remembered to scream she inhaled opening her mouth ee he clapped a hand over her mouth stifling her scream before more than two es were out then he wrapped a bandanna around her face covering her mouth so she couldnt get out any more of her scream he picked her up still swathed in the net and carried her away belatedly gloha realized how stupid she had been she had wandered away from her companions and foolishly followed a trail of popcorns until she was well away from camp now she was the captive of some brutish man and whatever was to become of her meanwhile the man was tramping along a path of his own it led to a dirty pond and in the pond was a dusky island and on the island was a battered old castle the man got into a sodden boat dumped her down and paddled across to the castle when he reached the island he hefted her up again and carried her to the great dark wooden door he hauled out a big metal key put it in the keyhole turned it and then pulled the door open he entered then paused to close and lock the door behind him he carried her down a dark passage to a central chamber she heard a faint whimpering then she saw where it came from a small barred cell they were passing there was a nymph in it looking unnymphly unhappy no wonder nymphs lived to cavort in the open with the others of their kind they couldnt stand being alone in a closed cell now she realized that there were other cells along the way containing other nymphs she was beginning to understand where the nymphs had gone they had followed trails of colored popcorn and been netted and nymphnapped and brought here just as gloha herself had been he set her down before an altar and drew off the net gloha immediately spread her wings and flew up out of his reach hey you arent supposed to do that the man protested you abducted me against my will and hauled me in here and you say i cant fly away from you she demanded a taut little tinge of outrage coloring her fear that doesnt matter youre supposed to marry me gloha had been opening her maidenly little mouth for a paragraph of protests but his last two words sidetracked that marry you she squeaked yes lets get on with it stand before the altar and say i so and so hereby take you veleno to be my husband by the law of the notar republic i will say much the same taking you as my wife then well go to the bedroom for the consummation he glanced at her youre somewhat small but i can live with that glohas mouthful got sidetracked again just like that was all she could get out its very efficient he agreed im getting out of here she said she flew to the hall and down it to the front door but the door was still locked and it was far too massive for her to open even if it had been unlocked there seemed to be no windows on this level and the stairs were closed off by other locked doors she was trapped in the castle she looked at the cells along the hall most contained de jected nymphs she knew better than to ask any of them about anything they would have no memory of their abductions or of the layout of the castle but she was getting the picture on her own and it was so unpretty that her pretty little perspective could hardly compass it she flew back to the main chamber because there was more room there youre a nymphomaniac she cried accusingly at veleno youre obsessed with nymphs well sure he agreed thats all i can find here but i never saw a winged nymph before and youre smaller than the others and you have clothing why is that because im not a nymph she said im a winged goblinharpy crossbreed i have better things to do than run around naked all day screaming kicking my feet and flinging my hair around oh what things like searching for my ideal man to marry no problem youll marry me marry you you insufferable gloha discovered that she lacked the appropriate vocabulary she really should have heeded her aunts advice and learned to speak the burning word so she settled for a succinct substitute no no he asked surprised why not because i dont know you dont love you and dont think youre anyones ideal man certainly not mine even without proper harpy vocabulary that seemed to cover the situation meanwhile he was picking up on her prior statement youre not a nymph he said excited you can remember from day to day i certainly can she agreed angrily and i dont think ill ever forget how you kidnapped me so youre definitely the one i must marry this was getting to be a bit much for her huh she inquired intelligently i need to marry a girl who can remember shes married well im not the one she said with a certain firm little firmness now let me go before my friends come to rescue me or youll be in trouble you have friends he asked surprised again of course i do she said indignantly dont you no this put her offtrack yet again what none no none she couldnt believe it what none she repeated well once i had a pet poison toad but i dont think he counts because he hopped away once he got to know me she was beginning to realize that this was not an ordinary evil abductor there were complications how did you come here to this castle she inquired maybe some background would help thats a brief and dull story he said now why dont you come down here and marry me so we can get on with the consummation im not going to marry you let alone consum but her nervous little nature would not allow her to say such a suggestive word anyway what makes you think you can just grab a girl and marry her thats what ive been doing each day i net a new nymph and marry her and consummate it and next morning she doesnt remember then i have to start all over with another nymph its very frustrating well lets hear your brief dull story she said if he was willing to be distracted from his disastrous ambition she was willing to encourage him in that andbe sure to include how you got this castle and why you call it a republic and why youre marrying anyone meanwhile ill just stay well out of your reach if you dont mind i dont mind he said its nice to have some halfway intelligent dialogue for a change if all he had had to converse with was nymphs whose minds were pretty much mindless on the theory that no creature with a nymphly body needed a mind then he might indeed miss the dialogue of a real person gloha settled down to the floor behind a chair ready to fly instantly away if he tried to get near enough to grab her again meanwhile she listened to his history once upon a thyme in the mists of antiquitymaybe thirty years agothere lived an old crone she was a weaver and worked hard at her trade from morning till night to earn a living for herself and her innocent young daughter she scarcely gave herself and her child a chance to rest however as busy and industrious as this crone was she loved her daughter and took time one day to give her good advice heather my dear daughter when the time of rut comes over a young man there is a failure on his part to act in a timely and responsive manner do you understand no mother dear innocent heather replied exactly as a good girl should no look such a young man is so hot to trot that even the village sheep arent safe do you understand now no mother dear heather said embarrassed because she didnt like perplexing her mother no well do you have any notion of how to summon the stork no mother dear heather said thats in the adult conspiracy so naturally i never heard of the stork why are you telling me this because once i was as ignorant as you and thats how i came to summon the stork that brought you daughter dear i dont want you to make the same mistakes but how could you summon the stork if you didnt know how mother dear heather asked doubly perplexed i cant do anything i dont know how to do by the ogres and night mares of xanth heatherjust say no heather was really impressed because she had never heard a double exclamation point before she took the lesson to heart and saved up her very most positive no for the occasion when she should encounter a young man being untimely and unresponsive or mistreating sheep however as she became a teenager she became aware of certain social proprieties she saw that her mother wore work clothes all the time and labored with her hands which were callused and gnarled and she became ashamed of the old crone so she did what any teen in such an insufferable situation did she screamed at her mother called her vile names like hag witch and harridan in fact everything except the accurate term of crone and to really make her point she ran away with shadows the village idiot this man did not know the meaning of timely or responsive and he was unconscionably mean to sheep shearing them every spring so this really broke the old crones heart naturally the idiot knew nothing of stork summoning either so the two of them just had a good time but by some curious coincidence a stork got the notion that this couple deserved a baby this was obviously a confusion because heather who had once had a figure reminiscent of a minute glass seemed to be adding sand she got fatter daily and hardly seemed to be in shape to handle a baby in any event she didnt know about the storks notion for a long while she pretended that she had no appetite and she ate no food other than a few black and blue berries stolen from neighboring gardens and some cookies she said that these were nicer and tasted better than her mothers good soups and stews and homemade peasant bread shadows made her several gunky yellow banana slug stews but they just caused her to toss her cookies he resented this because he didnt like seeing the cookies get wasted that showed what an idiot he was she reminded him frequently finally there came a day when heather was as displeased with shadows as she had been with her cronish mother as she lay in the dark one night cold and hungry her impatience with her situation boiled over in a chilly way well ive done more than enough suffering for humanity in the last nine months i want my mother even if she is a crone if that idiot shadows doesnt like it he can go jump in the kissmee lake with some other damsel because she realized now that her health had started its reversal soon after the two of them had swum in lake kissmee and in consequence done a whole lot of kissing maybe the water was also fattening so one fine morning a notsofine heather left the idiots sandy driftwood hut and walked home leaving her accumulation of selfpity behind she found her mother the village midwife and the stork standing at the frontdoor wringing their hands or whatever they wept when they saw her why are you so sad to see me heather asked as she pushed impatiently over to her dear little clean lavendersmelling bed didnt you say id be back it turned out that they werent sad they were glad though their emotions seemed to be stuck in reverse the stork was especially relieved having feared it had come to the wrong address it dumped a baby boy in the cradle and took off in its haste it dropped a thyme seed that had been intended for another delivery the seed landed in the garden and from it grew a first plant which didnt do well and a second plant which in the course of sixty seconds became a minute plant and in sixty minutes became an hour plant and in a year it was an annual and it continued to age with the obvious intention of finally maturing into a century plant since that would take some time it had a brilliant crystal on top to mark its place in spacetime the crone ignored it being too busy thinking it didnt matter she probably shouldnt have done that after seven days the village elders came to participate in the babys naming ceremony heather named him veleno which she understood meant poisoned gift the elders sprinkled heather with rainbow rose water and declared that in the light of recent events she was no longer a child but an adult immediately the weight of adult responsibility descended on her she realized how she had summoned the stork during that time when she had done just a smidgen more than kissing she was properly appalled and resolved never to do that again heather joined her mother at the loom never to leave it for the rest of her life and concentrated on becoming a crone herself from then on the little stone dwelling was known as the house of two weavers seven or eight years crawled by and the baby boy man aged to become a boy child he was quiet a loner and he displayed his magic talent early he changed plain white popcorn into rainbowcolored popcorn this followed naturally from his mothers talent of changing plain white roses into rainbowcolored roses she didnt use her talent much because she seldom encountered a white rose but at least she had the magic no one ever found out what talent velenos father had other than idiocy veleno never met the man velenos small world embraced his mother grandmother and the nearer region of his village one day he woke from his midday summer nap under his favorite fringed umbrella tree took a dip in the conservative goldwater pool to the right of the village dressed himself in his cool white wellworn cotton clothes and headed for home but he found everybody in great disarray standing around the village fountain they were screaming tearing their hair wringing their hands and weeping bitterly whats the matter he asked in a faltering whisper fearing that something was amiss after all it wasnt comfortable to have ones hair torn and was painful to put ones hands through the wringer which tended to flatten them a dreadful fiery dragon is approaching the village a man with golden orange hair replied his name was menthol but that had no significance and probably shouldnt have been mentioned it seems that nothing can stop it from massacring everyone here but why are they so upset the boy asked perplexed the man studied the boy for a moment then he nodded as if coming to a private decision what is your name little boy veleno what a nice name what does it mean poisoned gift menthol nodded again as if he had just confirmed a suspicion ah does an eightyearyoung century plant grow in your yard by any chance helping your family keep thyme yes well veleno your mother doesnt want you right now in fact she wants you to take a walk with me do everything i tell you to do and i will give you a whole bowl full of boiled sweets great veleno agreed so menthol took veleno by the hand and led him away as it just coincidentally happened menthol was a child stealer he recognized veleno as a child marked by the demons for their eventual entertainment so he brought him to the demons for a reward and so the demons put me in this isolated castle veleno concluded and told me that i would have my every desire in life supplied except one love i can achieve that only by marrying a woman who will marry me and share her love with me what they didnt tell me was that the only humanseeming females in reach would be nymphs they are incapableof love and cant remember anything from one day to the next but the demons did mention that hidden among them might be one who could remember and love so from the time i grew old enough to join the adult conspiracy i have used my colored popcorn to lure one nymph at a time away from the mountain i have married her and tried to summon the stork with her hoping that she will remember in the morning but so far every nymph has forgotten though she has been enthusiastically cooperative in making the effort to signal the stork thus our marriage has been dissolved and i have had to try again but why do you keep them prisoner in the castle gloha asked they are naturally careless creatures but they can not be happy in confinement because i cant tell one nymph from another if i let them go after marrying them i might catch the same one again wasting my time the only way i can be sure each one is new is by holding the old ones out from the group it was starting to make sense but gloha still didnt like it well im not going to marry you and i shall be neither enthusiastic nor cooperative aboutabout whatever and i will never love you no not in the time it takes that century plant to mature so you might as well let me go oh no i have to marry you because you can remember you are the one who can love me and with whom i can at last experience love then i will be free of the demons enchantment and can live like a normal man veleno did not seem to be paying very close attention to her declaration was there some other way to discourage him gloha remembered something about demons are they watching this oh yes of course its how they entertain themselves but if i find love theyll know it immediately and their amusement will be over theyll dissolve this castle into smoke and i will return with my bride to my village where we can live ever after as peasants scrounging a mean living from the reluctant soil thats certainly a modest ambition gloha said and i wish you well with it but it isnt going to be with me i am not going to marry you and thats that then i shall have to lock you in a chamber until you change your mind veleno said because you may be my only chance for love and i would be a fool to let you escape gloha realized that the man was not going to be reasonable about this so she flew away seeking some other exit from the castle she found a stairway that wasnt closed off and flew upstairs but all the windows were barred and most of the chambers were locked with whimpering nude nymphs inside escape seemed to be hopeless then she spied one dark passage she had missed in her prior haste it was low and narrow so she had to come to the floor and walk along it it led to a winding stairway leading up a secret exit to the roof she came to a small door she tugged at its handle and because it was small she was able to move it beyond was a closed little chamber with several barred windows this must be the castles highest turret from which there was no exterior way down the kind used to imprison reluctant damsels but if she could get one of those windows open or pry out a bar she could leap from the window she wouldnt fall to her death she would merely fly away the builders of this castle hadnt reckoned with a winged goblin girl she entered the chamber crossed to the far window and peered out she was right this was way high up in the sky with glorious naked air all around she took hold of a bar it rattledand there was a curious little click behind her she turned nervously and saw that the door had swung itself closed alarmed she ran back to the door to make sure it hadnt lockedand found that it had it absolutely would not budge she was trapped and she heard velenos footsteps climbing the stair the nymphomaniac was coming for her and he thought her to be a satisfactory substitute nymph what could she do she did it she put her frantic little face to the window and let out xanths most strident little scream graeboe graeboes giant ears perked that was a faint distant scream could it be gloha he peered in that direction but all he saw was forested mountains if gloha was there she would have to scream repeatedly before he would be able to find her he squatted carefully so that in his weakness he wouldnt lose his balance fall over and crush a fair section of forest and maybe a friend or two he put his face near the tent i heard a scream the demoness metria popped into smoky solidity just under his nose you did where north of nymph mountain ah i saw was mountains and trees she faded out in a moment she was back i have told trent and marrow theyll hurry here can you carry them to that region yes i still have strength enough for that i think meanwhile stand up and show me exactly where it came from maybe i can investigate first graeboe stood unsteadily breathing deeply to ease the dizziness he felt as his body straightened he was a poor shadow of a giant then he pointed toward the mountains but it was faint and i cant be sure it was gloha he cautioned her all maidenly screams sound alike to me thats why im checking she said and with a zzzrrpp she was gone he slowly squatted again soon the magician and the skeleton arrived he repeated his news to them take us there trent said graeboe opened his left hand and laid it palmup on the ground trent and marrow climbed on graeboe lifted them up to head height then tramped delicately toward the mountains they had been at first perplexed then alarmed at glohas disappearance she had been right there walking on the path to the retreat and then she hadnt returned trent had been the first one to be concerned because it was his job to see that no harm came to the cute little creature she might have taken a side path to address a call of nature so they did not rush to seek her but when time passed they realized that something was wrong she was definitely gone she hadnt been caught by a tangle tree because they had zeroed in all such threats in the vicinity and gloha knew better than to go near any the same was true for dragons and other land monsters gloha didnt have to worry about winged monsters being one herself graeboe had to smile at that the girl was completely unconcerned about the term not considering it to be anything other than a description trent was a human man graeboe was a human giant marrow bones was a walking skeleton metria was a demoness and gloha was a winged monster such lack of affectation was one of her many endearing qualities she was also pretty nice sensible and caring the man she finally found would be extremely fortunate he remembered how she had kissed him in the play they had put on for the curse fiends the notion of a tiny princess marrying a giant was ludicrous but the play had been for entertainment rather than realism for the finale she had walked up to his face and planted a delicious little kiss somewhere on his upper lip there had been a laugh from the audience but he had really liked that kiss in fact he really liked gloha and would be devastated if anything untoward happened to her he would do everything he could to rescue her if she were in some dire strait but first they had to find her he tried to suppress the thought that it might be too late to help her he had to hope that that scant little scream was hers so that they could save her from whatever pit she had fallen into metria reappeared floating in front of him i assumed smoke form and drifted through the woods she reported i found a few straight goblins but no winged ones i dont think shes there well just have to hope she screams again trent said if that really was her scream the demoness said with demonly logic if the giant wasnt just imagining it it is our best lead at the moment trent replied seeming unconcerned but graeboe had come to realize that when the magician seemed least affected he was controlling his reactions if someone assumed that this mildmannered man was to be ignored or shoved aside that person was likely to find himself transformed into a stink horn the magician was actually a very old man youthened for this quest and he had the experience and control of age graeboe respected him graeboe came to stand beside the mountains they were only a bit taller than he was but they were more massive he looked down at the carpet of forest covering them it was quiet had he been mistaken about the direction of the scream had he imagined it could he have led glohas friends to the wrong place while she was in some awful trouble elsewhere he would never forgive himself if the scream came again this time they all heard it it was from beyond the mountains in the same direction they had been going score one for giantly imagination marrow remarked the skeleton too was a good person and graeboe hoped he was successful in his quest for half a soul graeboe had a notion about that because he knew of a soul that would before long become available but right now was not the time to discuss that gloha was the immediate concern he looked for bare sections on the mountains so he could climb over them slowly he stepped up his head rising above the peaks so that he could see beyond them and there in the valley beyond was a castle and from a window in its highest turret flew a colorful little pennant it looked like glohas blouse metria vanished so suddenly there was a pop she was going to investigate meanwhile graeboe told the man and skeleton what he had seen and lifted them up high enough to see it themselves his judgment about the scream had been vindicated he was relieved because now they could see about rescuing gloha from her evident captivity step by step he navigated the mountain range treading over the peaks and starting down the other side the castle loomed larger and clearer it was about as tall as graeboes shin sitting on an islet in a muddy pond a path led from it through a pass toward the faunnymph retreat graeboe began to get a glimmer of a suspicion metria reappeared glohas captive all right she reported along with a fraction of a squintillion sad nymphs seems this oafish mans a nymphomaniac hes obsessed with nymphs and keeps nymphnapping them for his onenight stands then he locks them into cells and goes for more he thought gloha was a nymph when he netted her trents expression became mildly grim gloha is not a nymph and he shall not hold her prisoner i am not at all sure that he should be holding any nymphs captive either there was that dangerous mildness again that nymphomaniac was surely in trouble graeboe wished he could speak with such deadly understatement but he knew himself to be no more than an ordinary giant even after allowing for his illness if he were trents size he would be of no consequence whatever perhaps we should rescue gloha then reason with the man about the nymphs marrow suggested yes i want to take no chances with gloha trent turned to graeboe which wasnt hard to do while standing on graeboes hand are you able to lift off the roof of that turret so she can fly out i will try graeboe agreed he stepped toward the castle kneeled beside it reached forth and put his thumb and forefinger on the conical tower roof he lifted but the roof was firmly secured i fear i lack the strength he said with regret there was once a time when this would have been no problem i might bash it back and forth to loosen it but that might harm gloha inside dont risk it trent said quickly he turned to metria who was hovering nearby can you form yourself into a key to unlock the door so that gloha can escape confinement and perhaps exit the castle by another route i thought youd never ask she puffed out of sight but in a moment she was back looking somewhat shamefaced for a demoness thats an enchanted castle i cant touch any part of it cant touch it trent asked surprised its as if its smoke to me she said when i try to touch it my hand and body pass right through it as if im not real though i am in solid form i recognize it now as being demonconstructed i can enter it and see whats happening and talk with folk but i cant actually touch the castle of any of its artifacts its frustrating trent considered i could transform some creature into a monster that would attack the castle but i have some cautions the monster might harm the nymphs and gloha too and i would not have control over it i deem this to be too risky since the monster would be out of my reach when it entered the castle i need to transform a friendly person or creature to be assured that no inadvertent harm would be done perhaps i could enter the castle marrow said the barred windows would not stop me if i could get my skull through and i could climb the wall to reach such a window the bars are set too close for your skull metria said i checked and you may find the walls to slippery to climb enchanted castles arent easy to handle by no coincidence the skeleton nodded true i fear that i too am defeated if i could get inside it someone might use one of my long bones to wedge the bars apart but if gloha can not get out i can not get in then it must be up to me trent said im not surprised until this point gloha has done as much to help me as i have to help her but crombies pointings are always accurate now i shall do what i am here to do shes a fine girl and certainly worth the effort graeboe if you would be so kind as to set me on the roof of the main castle i shall see about rescuing the princess graeboe smiled this endeavor did seem to be coming to resemble aspects of their beanstalk play he lifted trent and marrow to the castle roof and laid his hand flat so that trent could dismount marrow bones also slid off but you dont need to risk yourself this way trent protested to the skeleton yes i do marrow replied trent didnt argue graeboe withdrew his hand and watched from a reasonable distance he would never say so of course but he was tired from carrying the two small as they were and needed to rest what mischief this downwardspiraling ailment was trent cast about on the roof and found a tiny beetlebug he transformed this into a sawfish marrow picked up the fish for its serrated edges werent as hard on his hands as they were on flesh he carried it to the locked roof door he put the fishs sawtoothed nose to the edge of the door frame held it firmly and let it saw through the frame and into the door itself the fish sawed right around the locking mechanism and when that fell out the door could be opened then trent transformed the fish back to a bug and returned it to the place he had found it graeboe found that interesting the magician was taking pains to do no unnecessary mischief even to incidental bugs the two went into the castle graeboe traced their progress as they passed by the upper windows they were in an unused wing and there was another locked door between it and the main castle so marrow had to go back to fetch the beetlebug for transformation again because it seemed that there were no bugs inside the castle it appeared to be a sterile place hey get a load of veleno metria said in his ear startling him hes headed up to the high turret with a costume graeboe shifted position trying to orient on the man night was looming and lights were illuminating the castle no one turned them on they just did it glowing in every room in fact there seemed to be no servants or defenders in the castle it was empty except for veleno and the captive nymphs it seemed to run itself automatically since the demons had made it according to metria they didnt bother with human servitors there seemed to be a few pie trees growing in the central courtyard which probably provided veleno with his daily nourishment and that was about it it was a selfsufficient castle at least the lights made it easier to see what was going on inside while veleno couldnt see graeboe outside if he cared the castle wasnt made of glass but might as well have been in some sections because of the view through the upper windows only the bottom story was completely opaque veleno went on up to the turret chamber while trent and marrow were making their way past the second locked door the man didnt seem to be aware of the intrusion maybe he had lived so long in this secure castle that it didnt occur to him that any invasion was possible he came at last to the chamber graeboe put his ear down close so that he could overhear what was said i have brought you a wedding dress in your size so you can marry me in proper style veleno informed her i told you before im not marrying you gloha retorted my friends are about to rescue me from your fell clutches no one can rescue you here this castle is invincible to mortals now take this dress put it on and come down to the mam chamber so that we can be married what is it with you she demanded incredulously i just told you that i wont marry you arent you listening veleno frowned you are a real girl not a nymph he said therefore you can remember from day to day that means that our marriage will not automatically dissolve tomorrow at last i shall have fulfilled the requirement and i shall know love and be able to go home you said all that before she reminded him and i said before that i wouldnt do it i am no nymph and ill never marry you now take back your stupid dress and let me go and ill just forget about this and go my way graeboe shook his head what a lovely little spirited creature she was she wasnt taking any guff from her captor if you dont come down and marry me veleno said evenly i shall bring you no food since you are real you must eat i think that when you get hungry enough you will agree that it is better to be married and eat youre trying to starve me into marrying you she demanded aghast yes now are you ready no i regret this veleno said i had hoped to have a pleasant evening of consummation but i suppose i can wait he set down the dress between the bars of the door consummation gloha cried never she stamped her fine little foot for emphasis graeboe sighed with admiration gloha did not buckle under pressure and soon she would be rescued so her resistance would indeed save her the grief of an unkind marriage veleno went back down the stair metria appeared before him shell never marry you you clod of dragon dung she said triumphantly what are you a rogue demoness he demanded get out of my way and he walked right through her metrias face showed fury but she stifled her retort she couldnt affect veleno or the castle being unreal to them except in appearance so she popped up to glorias chamber you told him she said good for you goblin girl i am getting hungry gloha confessed i havent eaten anything since those colored popcorns youll be rescued soon trent and marrow are making their way into the castle oh thats such a relief to know gloha said im frightened of that man veleno im afraid he might afraid of what the demoness asked that he might try toto consummate even without marriage i hadnt thought of that metria said i suppose he might she faded thoughtfully out graeboe felt a surge of anger at the demoness instead of reassuring gloha she had made her feel worse demons had no human feelings and it showed meanwhile marrow and trent were sawing through the second door but by the time they succeeded veleno was downstairs again well out of hearing had he heard them and come to investigate trent could have transformed him making the rescue much easier well now they could go on in and up to the turret chamber where trent could transform gloha into something small enough to get out of her cell then he could transform her back to her normal nice form and she could fly away the two came to a third locked door blocking a passage that ran beside an outer wall marrow turned back to fetch the bug again but this time another door swung closed behind him preventing him from getting there the bars were too closely set to allow marrow to get his skull through just as metria had said uhoh trent murmured mildly graeboe echoed the sentiment in fact the two of them were trapped and couldnt get free because there was nothing to transform into a useful tool the castle had outsmarted them in its passive way you could kick me and i could assume another configuration marrow suggested but your skull still would not be able to get out and without it the rest of your body could not function independently trent pointed out true i regret being inadequate to the occasion metria appeared now what picklement have you boys gotten yourselves into she demanded we acted stupidly trent said mildly we are paying the price of our folly metria reached up and tore two hanks of her hair out how can a mere stupid castle defeat us all she demanded rhetorically im just a soulless demoness but i expected better of you magician she let go of the torn hanks and they dissolved into smoke and rejoined her body you are right to be annoyed trent said even more mildly graeboe knew it was time for him to act he leaned toward the justformed cell transform me magician he said make me be something small enough to get inside the castle and large enough to be of some help trent nodded i will render you into a mouse so as to get in here and then an elf so as to be able to search out a set of keys to unlock the doors graeboe reached for the cell his finger touching the bars outside magician trent reached through and touched him pinching his skin in tiny fashion then suddenly graeboe was a mouse dangling by one foot from trents pinched fingers trent brought him inside before he could fall and set him on the floor graeboe tried to walk and discovered that he had to coordinate four feet instead of two so he walked carefully on hands and feet and that worked he went somewhat awkwardly to the door that barred the way to the forward passage he slipped through then turned around to face the magician this was the first time he had been transformed and it was a weird experience worse it was a depleting experience graeboe felt weaker than ever he hadnt thought of this complication how weak could he get and still be able to function he wouldnt be any help if he couldnt move around sensibly the magicians huge hand came down was this the way that he the giant appeared to ordinary folk that hand could squish him in an instant then graeboe found himself in the body of an elf he was even dressed like an elf that was just as well he would not have wanted to appear naked that was powerful magic the magician had but he was also staggeringly weak the second transformation had taken another dollop of energy from his meager supply he had to grab onto the bars to keep from falling graeboe marrow said solicitously are you in discomfort no just very weak graeboe said weakly ii fear i am not up to another transformation i did not realize trent said i would not have transformed you had i known it would hurt you i apologize not hurtjust weakened graeboe gasped i will proceed in a moment but i may have taken days away from your remaining life trent said that was not a kind thing to do a few days hardly matter just so long as i am able to accomplish my purpose and get you and gloha free trent and marrow exchanged a glance but did not remark on the situation further rest trent suggested recover some strength then metria will show you where the castle keys are graeboe rested and after a bit he did feel slightly more stable or at least acclimatized to his new form and state of energy depletion i am ready he said metria appeared follow me she said and walked down the passage graeboe tried but with the first stride he fell against the wall he pushed himself upright and took a tottering step before falling against the wall again oh for pitys sake the demoness said disgusted cant you move any better than that well be all night he is weak from his ailment and the recent transformations trent called it behooves you to be more understanding why she asked beginning to fuzz into smoke because it would make you emulate the attitude of a person with a soul who is capable of love the smoke froze in midswirl understanding would help me grasp love then the smoke resumed swirling and the demoness reappeared say i heard myself just then i do need to practice understanding very well ill try what do i do now were i standing where you are trent said mildly i would try to help him to move by lending what physical and verbal support i could she considered that then she walked across to the elf let me help you she said im sure you can accomplish your task with a little encouragement and support graeboe remembered that he was the elf he had halfway disassociated listening to their dialogue it was strange being so small thank you he agreed she put one arm out to support him but she was normal human size while he was elf size onequarter her height so her hand barely reached down to his head hm she said then she swirled into smoke again and reappeared as an elf girl he was surprised at how pretty she was in that form but of course she could assume any form she chose and her demonly vanity encouraged her to be attractively packaged she reached out to put one arm around his waist and drew him in snug come on hold on to me she said weve got to get movingi mean im sure you will be more comfortable that way he put his arm around her lovely slim and supple waist this was certainly more comfortable but perhaps not in quite the way she intended they walked together down the passage and around a corner and when he faltered she drew him in yet more snugly he found his hand crossing a region it probably shouldnt oh this isnt working she said in a flash of impatience i apologize he said i did not mean to touch oh i dont care where you touch me she snapped youre of age arent you you can even see my panties if you want to her clothing fogged out leaving her nymphly naked except for a bright pink panty on which his hand now rested i mean this is too slow ill just carry you she smoked and his hand fell right through her naughty panty and whatever flesh might be beneath it then she reformed in full human size and his hand was resting on her shapely calf she reached down to pick him up in her arms now his body was wedged against her large soft bosom onward she said and marched swiftly down the passage graeboe decided not to protest the truth was that he had not had much experience with women whether of the giant human or demon persuasion and was somewhat at a loss about the protocol so he let his weak head rest against her pleasantly soft bosom and let her take him where she chose there were he concluded worse ways to travel and this was probably the only occasion he would have to experience this mode before he died metria carried him swiftly down to the ground floor evidently having familiarized herself with the castle she could walk firmly enough on its floors she just couldnt affect it in any way since he was not part of the castle she could affect him and that was fortunate he doubted that he could have walked this far alone along the way they passed many cells and in most of these were nymphs oh please kind folk let us out he nymphs cried to them we know not how we came here or what will become of us we live only to cavort and be happy but we are not happy here weve got to free these poor creatures graeboe said why the demoness asked she really didnt understand because shallow as they may be they do not deserve to be penned unhappily he said carefully every creature should be allowed to live its own life in its own way so long as it does not interfere with the lives of others well im looking for love and this doesnt reference doesnt what pertain associate connect attach belong apply relate whatever she agreed crossly yes it does relate he insisted love is not simply the feeling of one person for one of the opposite sex it is a generalized condition applying to the whole of existence only a person who is sensitive to the welfare of others in general is capable of truly loving any one other person but isnt that a whole lot of trouble sometimes it is but that is a liability of the condition of being a person who can love and be loved so if i cared what happens to those stupid nymphs i could love a man i think the two are linked yes because you are inhuman and lack love you care neither about the plight of others nor about any particular man she was silent evidently thinking it over they came to a small chamber just inside the main door where there was a hook and on the hook hung a ring with a single key the key to the castle veleno probably took it with him when he went out or when he went to lock up a nymph and kept it here betweentimes metria set graeboe down he reached for the key but it was too high metria reached for it impatiently but her hand passed right through it oh stink horns she swore i keep forgetting then she put her hands under graeboes shoulders and lifted him up so that he could get the key it was heavy but not too much for him to handle he got the key ring down now we must go free trent marrow and gloha he said pleased thank you metria why bother thanking me she asked im only helping you because trent told me to try to be understanding because i am a living feeling creature capable of love and i appreciate being helped he explained especially in my extremities of diminished size and strength you mean i have to act wimpish if i want to learn love she asked indignantly he smiled no just have feelings and show them on occasion i have feelings i get impatient with slow humans all the time and i think its funny when they mess up and i love tantalizing them with my body her torso became wrapped in a bright very tight red dress whose decolletage seemed to cover only the outer quadrants of her bulging breasts and whose short skirt had to struggle valiantly to keep her panties out of sight she took a breath see your eyes are bugging graeboe blinked getting his eyes back into shape true you craft a most impressive body i compliment you on that she paused how would a feeling person react to that remark she would turn just the mere suggestion of a shade of pink cast down her gaze demurely and say thank you as if it were a matter of little importance inside she would be pleased at the compliment at least such is my judgment based on my limited observation of the gender the demoness turned a faint shade of pink looked down demurely and said thank you then she looked up again like that exactly you learn very quickly she turned another faint shade of pink looked down again and repeated thank you letterperfectand still without true feeling graeboe decided not to make an issue of the matter we had better get moving he stepped out of the chamber having recovered a bit of strength the nymphs in the nearest cells spied them oh please let us out they chorused pitifully graeboe hesitated it would be unkind to leave them locked up but if he took time to free them the delay might prevent him from freeing his friends he compromised i will return for you as soon as i have accomplished my business he told them but you may never return they cried that was true he sighed and compromised i will free one of you and she can look for another key to free the rest of you he went to the nearest cell and reached for the lock metria had to lift him up he put the key in the keyhole and tried to turn it it was too stiff for him so metria held him up against her extremely plush front with one arm across his body and used her freed hand to brace his little hand adding considerable power to his effort the key turned and the lock clicked oh thank you kind sir the nymph exclaimed she pushed on the door and it swung open she stepped out in her pert nakedness leaned forward and kissed graeboe on the forehead he was still aloft because metria had not yet set him down is that a variant of a proper reaction the demoness inquired yes graeboe agreed yanking his gaze from the nymphly assets small size was having unexpected benefits i did her a favor so she thanked me in a nice way though she is a soulless creature well lets get moving metria said she adjusted her grip so as to carry him as she had before and started down the hall ho someone called it was veleno metria paused and the nymph screamed eeek she kicked her feet and her hair flung about as she sought some hiding placewhich turned out to be back in her cell well im not waiting for this metria said she strode right toward veleno whose eyes were glazing slightly as he took in her configuration and motion graeboe had a notion how the man felt the effect would have been even stronger had graeboe himself not been covering the most eyepopping section of her body by being carried against it you cant escape veleno said reaching out to grab the demoness there was a collision not with metria with graeboe the demoness unable to interact with the things of the castle passed right through velenos body and out the other side graeboe was left in velenos arms because he was a real creature and therefore solid to the castle the demoness must have lost cohesion with respect to his body when it collided with the mans body the two looked at each other ugh they said together veleno dropped graeboe who was able to land on his feet without too much of a jar he discovered that his small size made him light so that a fall that could have killed him in giant form didnt hurt him in elf form he staggered to the side where a nymph reached between the bars to catch him and help support him veleno turned and stared after metria who was well worth staring after youre a demoness he exclaimed disappointed so she demanded turning impressively so that her full display was functioning youre no prize yourself nympho if only youd been mortal he said youd be ten times as good to marry as that freaky little winged goblin metria turned a faint shade of pink she cast down her demure gaze thank you she breathed the top contours of her dress dipping slightly to facilitate the effort veleno seemed about to lose his balance that wasnt surprising as graeboe would have lost his own footing had the nymph not been steadying him whats she got that we havent got the nymph inquired evidently not impressed in quite the same manner clothing graeboe answered it adds mystery as well as support and uh uplift oh pooh we could don clothing if we wanted to she can also doff her clothing when she wants to he replied with no hands but their dialogue was merely incidental the main interest was in the center of the hall what are you doing carrying an elf in here veleno demanded of metria what are you doing immuring nymphs she retorted doing what to nymphs penning committing jailing impounding imprisoning incarcerating whatever she agreed crossly im looking for the one who will love me well youre a dung beetle and youd better she paused to do what to you to love me i thought you just wanted a body to maul she adjusted her position and inhaled more deeply her decolletage overmatched would have given up had it had any common sense that too he agreed when i find love ill be free of all this he gestured at the castle around them why dont you let the nymphs go once you know they dont love you i told you that before not me you didnt he sighed because i cant tell one from another so i have to save all the used ones metria shook herself remembering something her dress was definitely supernatural nothing less would have survived that motion then she walked back through veleno who seemed dazed she picked graeboe up again and headed down the passage hay wait veleno cried trying to recover some notion of initiative you cant take that elf hes got my key he sure has she agreed accelerating graeboe actually bounced against her bosom fortunately it was so soft that he suffered no harm no you dont veleno said starting after them yes i do metria retorted breaking into a full run she came to a stairway clambered up it turned at the landing and was ascending the second flight as veleno reached the first he glanced up and lost his stride graeboe realized that the man must have caught a glimpseof demonly panties from the angle and been suitably stunned metria was really using her assets but in a moment they heard the pursuit resuming veleno could no longer see what he should not be seeing so was able to remember what he was supposed to be doing however metria now had a good lead and she continued to move swiftly i wish i could be a souled creature just for an hour she said just long enough to find out what love is i wish you could too metria graeboe said for whatever reason you are really helping me and i appreciate it i wish there were some way to reward you me too but i think i just have to learn love by myself i think you do maybe you will find the way they came to the upper section this was the level where trent and marrow were confined but there was a problem metria in her haste had taken another route back and they were in another passage one that did not pass that cell metria cast about trying to find the way but there seemed to be none meanwhile veleno was catching up free us oh free us the confined nymphs there chanted in unison but the demoness ignored them searching for the connection where the funk is it metria demanded i didnt explore this floor carefully before i could pop right over there but only you can carry the key maybe this way leads on up to glohas cell graeboe said we can release her first then see about the others veleno came into sight ha he cried got you trapped never you creep metria cried she kicked her feet turning around and her hair flung out in almost nymphly fashion as she oriented on the passage ahead and got up velocity she found the circling stairway and zoomed up it bounce by bounce graeboe just hung on to the key they reached the top there was glohas cell weve got the key graeboe gasped as metria came to a sudden stop almost against the door oh wonderful gloha cried but who are you graeboe realized that she did not know about his transformation i am graeboe giant trent and marrow were captured trying to rescue you but i reached out to trent and he transformed me to this form so i could get the keys graeboe she echoed astonished how youve changed she peered at him more closely but you do have his features i mean your features homely he agreed without depreciation it usually doesnt matter how an invisible giant looks metria held him up while he put the key in the lock then she helped him turn it as before the lock clicked graeboe pulled on the door and metria pulled on him and it swung open oh thank you both of you gloha cried impulsively hugging graeboe she as a goblin was about twice his elf height instead of metrias quadruple she just sort of leaned down and picked him up in her embrace it was a delightful experience because she unlike metria was sincerely caring ha it was veleno he charged up to the cell and pushed the door shut the demoness tried to block him off but he ran right through her as before the key graeboe cried remembering as gloha set him down its still in the lock not any more veleno said with grim satisfaction he turned the key locking the door again and drew it out let go of it metria cried trying to grab the key from him but her hand passed through it and him she was completely ineffective oh fudge she swore what kind of confection veleno inquired snidely oh go fry an eyeball he faced the cell let me know when you are ready to marry me goblin girl i will check on you every few hours i suspect you will grow hungry and thirsty before too long as will your elf friend never gloha cried as he departed outraged the demoness puffed into smoke and dissipated wait metria graeboe cried desperately thinking of something she reappeared inside the cell i cant do anything for you she said i cant touch him or the key so i guess id better go amuse myself elsewhere that was what he had been afraid of metria you have really made progress in learning human emotion now perhaps you can make more you can do the generous thing and get help for us why should i bother she asked because its the kind of thing a feeling person would do you do have some feelings as you explained before maybe you can get the one you want if you just keep acting the way a person who had such feeling would she considered all right ill give it one more shot what do you want this time pop over to glohas relatives and tell diem where she is and how she is about to be married against her will then lead them here metria considered further that would be a feeling thing to do wouldnt it she mused very feeling gloha agreed catching on to the ploy maybe tell the winged centaurs too and the giants youre asking for a lot the demoness said bridling yes only a really generous and feeling person would consider it graeboe said oh all rightl metria agreed crossly she vanished there was a silence then gloha turned shy are you really graeboe she asked not just an elf in his image i really am i confess it is strange being this size but it is what seemed necessary he looked around do you mind if i sit down i am very weak id offer you a cushion if i had one she said im afraid the stone floor will have to do thank you he sat leaning against the wall im sorry i didnt succeed in rescuing you but it was nice of you to try i should have remembered to take the key out he said angry at himself what a stupid mistake no more so than my getting myself caught like this she said you really didnt have to risk yourself like that yes i did she smiled i think your decency is as big as you are in your natural size i mean no it wasnt that id have done it anyway why i suddenly he realized why and knew he couldnt say it what was the point when they existed on two different scales and he was so soon to die anyway it was just the right thing to do no i was foolish and should pay for it its not right to get you and trent and marrow in trouble because of me she paused angling her head in thought maybe i should agree to marry him if hell let the rest of you and the nymphs go no he cried stricken she looked at him in surprise at his vehemence then she changed the subject what is it like to be a giant big he said succinctly she laughed again he thrilled when she did that how true but i mean what do you do how did your breed come to be to be so big and invisible too thats not much of a story he said fidgeting are you uncomfortable about it im sorry i shouldnt pry i was just curious oh it isnt that he protested ill be happy to tell you our history im fidgeting because im very weak and the stone is very hard oh yes it is isnt it she agreed but maybe i can do something about that let me hold you he thought he had misheard ithink i dont understand i am larger than you now and softer i can handle the stone let me hold you and shield you from its hardness oh that wouldnt be right he protested why not because i again he had to stifle it because he would so very much like to be so close to her she cocked her head again are you going to give me a reason graeboe no then come on she said you have been a friend to me when you didnt have to be and i will be a friend to you it is little enough considering our situation he found that he wasnt able to demur when she phrased it that way he tried to get to his feet but had difficulty oh you really are weak she said solicitously i keep forgetting it carried right through from your other size here ill get you she got readily to her feet stepped across the cell to him sat beside him reached across and heaved him onto her lap in a sitting posture she put her arms around him holding him steady his head came up just to her petite bosom is that better i feel like a child he said she laughed once more rocking him with the expression thats the way i usually feel when dealing with regular human folk its about time i made somebody else feel that way she settled back against the wall now tell me about the giants centuries ago the ancestors of the giants were ordinary human folk they lived in a village in central xanth and harvested notholes from the local pining trees which they traded to other villages for other goods wherever there was an unwanted hole one of their special notholes would eliminate it without the necessity for any rebuilding so there was a fairly steady demand and the village got by trading the holes for what else they needed but there were problems there were a number of monsters in the vicinity such as dragons griffins river serpents ogres and trolls any villager who wasnt careful was apt to discover himself in the stomach of a monster this made them feel rather insecure they wished that they didnt have to worry about monsters meanwhile their numbers diminished because the monsters were eating them faster than they could grow new children at this rate the day would come when no village was left then one of them heard that a magician or at least a person with a very strong magic talent was in need of assistance it occurred to them that they might be able to make a deal with the magician if they helped him maybe he would help them so they sent a representative to negotiate it turned out that the magicians talent was making things very large huge in fact and suddenly they realized that if they were large they wouldnt have to worry about dragons and whatnot they would be big enough to throw the dragons away this notion had considerable appeal so they made the deal they would build the mountain the magician wanted if he would make them too big for any dragon to devour they packed up their things and traveled to the magicians place of residence he touched the first man and the man began to grow enormously he grew right out of his clothing which was embarrassing in fact his bare bottom was blushing do not be concerned the magician said your bodies will not show they will show across the length and depth of xanth a woman protested we must have giant clothing just watch and you will see the magician said unperturbed thats whats bothering us the woman said covering the curious eyes of her children we are seeing too much those arent exactly moons in the sky but as the man grew further something weird happened he began to become less visible his body seemed to be thinning in the manner of a demon turning to smoke hes fading away someone cried hes not mooning us anymore no he is merely becoming visually diffuse the magician said there is only so much to see in an ordinary person when his body expands that sight gets spread across a wider surface finally it expands so much that he cant be seen at all but he is still solidly there they watched amazed as the first man became a virtual shadow of himself a faintening outline and finally nothing but when they went up to where he had stood they discovered his monstrous bare feet he was indeed still there we didnt agree to this someone said consider this sensibly the magician responded as big as you will be you will have little if any need for clothing for warmth because of an aspect of magic called the square cube ratio and if you do need it you can make it of suitable size meanwhile no one will stare at you or be concerned when you walk near because no one will see you thus you have the ultimate privacy along with your size this combination should work very well for you they considered and the more they thought about it the more sense it made so they decided that it would be all right to be invisible and they would communicate with each other by calling back and forth they would make do so the magician made the rest of them large there was much blushing as they burst out of their clothes and some glances of admiration before they faded out and finally all of them even the children were huge and invisible they could see perfectly well they just couldnt be seen you are fortunate that you arent hi mundania the magician said because there your invisibility would make it impossible for you to see and you would be blind with the light passing right through your eyes and never stopping to give you the picture but here in xanth you dont have to be concerned about such confusions then they got to work and with their enormous bare hands they scraped up a big mound of earth and rock for the magician forming his mountain when he was satisfied they linked hands and walked away seeking a region where they could dwell without stepping on anyone because they were peaceful folk who did not like to make trouble they found an isolated region and there they settled they found that indeed they did not need clothing unless they wanted to become visible when they did wear clothing it tended to fade after a while becoming invisible too so there didnt seem to be much point in it anyway they found they liked being invisible it had a number of advantages after a time some giants left the community to find separate employment some just wandered around seeking good works to do taking care where to set their feet so as to do no harm sometimes one would find that a storm had blown a big tree down on a normal persons house he would quietly lift that tree away so as to free the people trapped beneath and the people would think that the wind had done it graeboes cousin greatbow found employment with com pewter scaring folk into the evil machines cave but greatbow himself was careful never to actually step on anyone or to do irreparable damage to the forest another cousin girard was so softhearted that he tried to water trees in a drought and to help injured animals he took dogooding to an extreme that became a fault when he tried to help a little human boy he wound up getting a bad dream that had been intended for the boy and in that dream saw gina giantess with whom he fell instantly in love but she was only a figment crafted for the dream making fulfillment of his love impossible but finally he was able to find her anyway in the dream realm of the hypnogourd graeboe himself had not even gotten around to seeking love his malady had come upon him and slowly wasted him so that his breath turned too bad for other giants to stand he lost his invisibility and he became increasingly weak yet the good magician seemed to think that there was an answer for him and he had sought that answer now he realized that there was no answer or he had lost it along the way so he was satisfied to try to do what bit of good he could before he expired oh but thats very sad gloha said trying to comfort him youre such a nice person you really deserve to live beyond your youth just how old are you graeboe counted on his fingers just about coming onto my majority he said i was found on a cabbage patch fortyeight years ago but thats old she exclaimed amazed not for a giant ordinarily we live to be two hundred or so so im not yet a quarter through my scheduled life in your terms i would be about he concentrated trying to do long division on his fingers but it wasnt working very well about nineteen she asked yes i think so he agreed that sounds right if i were to stay in this body and live out my term i would not live any longer than you would but of course thats academic there must be some way to save you she said i am more concerned with saving you he said it would be intolerable to let veleno have his way with you yes you are here now because you tried to help me she agreed well you rest for a while graeboe and i shall see if i can think of any way to help any of us maybe metria will get help maybe she will she held him and rocked him and he found himself fading into sleep her embrace was wonderfully comforting graeboe expected to die without revealing it but he could no longer hide the foolish truth from himself he was by nature a giant and she was a goblinharpy crossbreed but he loved her all he could do was hope that gloha escaped this prison and found her desire meanwhile he could not imagine a nicer way to fade out than this being rocked in her arms metria gloha held graeboe while he slept she felt so guilty for foolishly getting herself caught here and thus leading her friends into captivity too trent had accompanied her to protect her and he had tried to but there were limits and she had stretched them too far marrow had come along to see if perhaps his own quest for half a soul might be found and he had been helpful and now was also a prisoner but graeboe was the worst because he had nothing to gain from them yet had tried his best to help and now had no chance to pursue his quest for life it was interesting that in giant terms he was just about her own age that was way too young to die there was a tramping on the stairs veleno appeared carrying a lamp for it was now dark are you ready yet he inquired never she said quietly so as not to disturb graeboes sleep the poor giant had enough trouble without having his rest disturbed and she was glad to do this much for him you will change your mind eventually he said ill wait and if i dont youre mortal youll expire you wouldnt dare she exclaimed too vehemently for graeboe stirred she increased her rocking hoping he would not awaken of course i would dare he said i dont expect you to call my bluff the hungrier and thirstier you get the more reasonable my proposal will seem and i think that goes double for your mortal friends you wont want them to suffer unduly on your behalf gloha stiffened he was right how could she do this to trent and graeboe graeboe might be about to die anyway but trent wasnt she just couldnt let them pay such a horrible price for her defiance yet the idea of being married to this gross man veleno who was twice her height and not remotely like the one she was looking for forever ending what foolish dreams she might have hadthat was too appalling to contemplate if she had to marry a human man it should be someone more like magician trent that particular foolishness had considerable appeal but she did know better what was she to do she couldnt stand either alternative so all that was left was for her to hope that the demoness metria succeeded in summoning help so that she and her friends could be rescued from this fell man with his fell castle veleno waited a moment and when she didnt answer again he turned and tramped back down the stairs he was sure that time was on his side maybeperish the thoughthe was right unless metria a swirl of smoke appeared well im back the demoness said did you summon help not exactly i consented them you whatted them whatted what did you do to them oh agree enlighten apprise acquaint inform notify you advised them whatever the demoness agreed crossly gloha contained her temper still trying not to disturb graeboe whom did you advise oh everyone your goblins harpies winged centaurs giants giants graeboes a giant isnt he when hes himself gloha glanced down at the elf she held yes if the invisible giants come they can just lift off the roof and free us all good thinking metria the demoness turned faint pink averted her gaze and said thank you startled at this display of modesty gloha lost her chain of thought however it didnt fall far and she was able to recover it so is anyone going to come to help did you tell them where we are oh sure and i even told smash ogre that tandy will be delayed returning because you forgot to he said that was okay for now the others be here the day after tomorrow maybe the day after tomorrow gloha exclaimed then quickly rocked to lull graeboe back to sleep we could starve of thirst by then starve of what never mind i dont think graeboe can last that long without food and water were going to have to do something sooner such as what gloha stifled her groan such as marrying veleno what me marry him no me im the one he wants to marry i hate the notion but i see no alternative but the demoness had caught hold of an idea that intrigued her i wonder if i could marry him no way youre a demoness you cant love remember his enchantment wont be broken until someone loves him and you can love him gloha stiffened again oh youre right i may be capable of love but not with him i cant stand him so even if i married him i wouldnt break the enchantment it would be a wasted effort that realization was actually a relief suppose i married him and pretended to love him if i fooled him would that do it that was a difficult question i dont think you could fool him metria the demoness bridled i can fool just about anyone when i try anyone except grossclout who the demon professor grossclout hes so smart he thinks everyone elses head is filled with mush he proves it all the time i tried to fool him with woe betide but he saw right through her who metria disappeared in her place stood the most darling sweet cute innocent hugeeyed forlorn little waif of a girl imaginable dressed in rags hi she piped im woe betide buy a match she offered a tiny twig of wood gloha was impressed that would fool me she agreed the waifs face clouded tragically it didnt fool grossclout nothing fools him hes a terror graeboe woke whos that he asked startled the ragamuffin turned her great sad orbs on him im just downtrodden woe betide the poor little match girl everybody gaits on me everybody whats on you he asked paces struts tracks hobbles shambles steps he asked treads gloha asked at almost the same time whatever the waif said crossly graeboe laughed weakly hello metria woe betide puffed into smoke what gave me away the demoness inquired reforming in her full buxom edition it was just a lucky guess he said metria sent him a suspicious glance but didnt argue the case gloha remained intrigued by the prior subject i wonder if you could feel veleno she asked not that it would be ethical who cares whether its ethical so long as it works the demoness asked fool veleno graeboe asked he wants to marry someone who will love him gloha explained metria might marry him and pretend to love him why to get the rest of us free why he asked again because it would be a caring thing to do metria said shortly so i could learn to rapture to what gloha asked adoration esteem amour passion stork oh love gloha said oh whatever the demoness agreed crossly i think i understand graeboe said veleno wants to marry and love and metria wants to do something caring so she might help us by making him think he had found love so that he would release all the others might schmight metria said wed make a deal he releases them or he gets no nookie gloha wasnt familiar with the word but decided not to inquire lest the correct word be troublesome i dont think it would be ethical she repeated therefore we cant do it tempting as it is you havent said why ethics matters metria said it matters to feeling folk graeboe said oh why do you have to put it that way the demoness exclaimed more than crossly its just very hard to explain feeling things to one who doesnt feel gloha said somewhat at a loss let me get this straight its all right for him to capture folk and starve them to make them do what he wants but its not all right for them to fool him into letting his victims go oh my gloha said taken aback put that way veleno is being unethical graeboe said but that does not give us leave to be unethical too we prefer to be governed by the best standard not the worst yes gloha agreed appreciating his clarification okay lets get practical suppose i tell him im a demoness and cant really love him but ill pretend to for a couple of days so he can break his geis and break his what graeboe asked i got the right word metria said crossly geis pronounced gaysh plural geasa as in girl no thats not quite it forget the plural its a magical obligation he has to find love so he can get out of here thats his geis a geis gloha said musingly thats interesting i wonder if anyone else has such an obligation oh many do you should hear about the geis of the gargoyle but thats a whole nother story so anyway he wants something you want something i want something why cant we make a deal perhaps if the terms are clearly understood and honored it would be ethical graeboe agreed gloha was moved to something like wonder you would do this metria just to get the feeling of doing something generous sure you people seem to have all kinds of feelings i dont understand and they make you do funny things you seem to get a lot of fun out of love i want to try it once just so i know what it is but there is no guarantee that doing something nice for us will enable you to love gloha said the demoness shrugged theres no guarantee it wont gloha thought about the ugly alternatives she faced if this could free her of those perhaps it is worth trying graeboe said so long as you do speak truly and do follow through the followthrough is easy any demoness can make any man deliriously happy if she chooses i wouldnt say that he demurred oh wouldnt you how about when you were bouncing on my bosom didnt you like that and what about sleeping on her bosom dont you like that even better both gloha and graeboe stiffened he scrambledoff her lap i he started while gloha tried not to flush and you have to tell the truth right so tell me it isnt so i could assume goblin girl form too you know he was silent gloha managed to come to his rescue real folk can make real folk happy she said but thats not the same as a demoness doing it metria fogged out and reappeared as woe betide maybe someone your size she said to graeboe suppose i do a strip mine she began to dance pulling off her innocent bonnet what kind of graeboe began never mind gloha said well grant that a demoness cancan do what you said when she wants to how can we be sure youll tell veleno the truth so we arent ethically compromised suppose i do it right here so you can listen gloha exchanged exactly one glance with graeboe that seems fair she agreed done when he comes here to torment you again ill make the deal gloha was hardly sure how she felt if this was ethical and it worked the demoness popped out leaving them alone in the cell graeboe found a place to sit down against the wall you dont have to go there gloha said i think i do i never wished to cause you any embarrassment and you didnt it was the demoness who did that still i will not contribute to any problem for you in any way i can prevent something that had been hovering around the periphery of her thoughts came into focus you like me dont you well that isnt relevant to our situation anyone would have tried to help you no i mean you she hesitated you really like me he brightened ido but i have no wish to cause you any distress or to interfere in any way yes thats what you said and you are such a good man if only you werent a giant he finished wanly no for she was just now coming to understand something magician trent had said about knowing her own mind if only you werent dying i think i couldcould like you the same way to be a friend to you as you have been a friend to me but even if i get away from this castle you cant get away from your fate youll never be a happy giant again going your way marrying a nice giantess and living happily ever after graeboe seemed to reconsider something and to come to a painful conclusion friends yes he agreed that is true i am sorry i did not think far enough ahead to realize that it was not only pointless to make new friends at this time it was cruel to those friends i was so hungry for company that i did not question it in the way i should have i have done all of you a disservice she considered i see your logic graeboe but not your feeling i think i would not want never to have known you or magician trent whatever happens all this time i have been looking for a winged goblin when i should have been looking for truly good friends friends like you no i am not truly good i am ordinary in all but body and even that is fading and so am i ordinary i mean in spirit she shook her head at least i have learned to look beyond the body much good may it do me they lapsed into silence gloha hoped that trent and marrow werent feeling too despondent her guilt for their fate remained if only she hadnt stupidly followed that popcorn she had sidetracked their whole quest and gotten them all in trouble now their only hope was a demoness whose only reason for helping was infernal curiosity she heard the tramping of feet on the stairs was veleno returning so soon or was it soon it was hard to tell in the dark maybe she had snoozed in the interim this time the man had brought a tray with food are you ready to marry me he asked no but maybe someone else is gloha said the nymphs dont count none of them remember that they married me you will remember there is another who will remember who is willing as i am not he showed interest who metria who the demoness oh demons count even less than nymphs do because they cant interact with me or the castle metria appeared she was exquisitely garbed showing less of her voluptuous body than usual her dress was of silk and gauze and she wore a sparkling necklace and a tiara in her glossy hair i have learned something about this castle of the notar republic she said no demon can interact with you within it but any demon can outside it and anyone who marries you can interact with you in the castle because it will then accept that person as its mistress why thats true veleno said surprised i had forgotten i thought it didnt matter because no demoness had any interest are you saying that you do yes i will marry you for a price a price let all the captives go all the nymphs and the mortal folk and the walking skeleton too i told you before i cant let the nymphs go until i find the right one metria considered well when youre sure that im the right one the moment i find love none of them will matter theyll all be freed automatically and your friends too automatically gloha asked when this castle dissolves oh the geis metria said yes thats right so we dont have to worry about that still we must bargain i want you to feed everyone who needs it now these two here and trent in the other cell if you marry me tonight they shall eat tonight deal lets doit gloha cleared her throat but theres something else i have to tell you metria added you know im a demoness i cant really love anyone but i can pretend to and make it so good it will fool you maybe it will fool the castle too it was velenos turn to consider it seems worth a try if it doesnt work the castle wont dissolve all the captives will remain and the goblin girl will have to marry me next hey im not agreeing to that gloha protested you dont need to ill simply start starving you and your friends again until you change your mind your logic is inescapable gloha said cuttingly so lets get with it metria said come down to the nuptial chamber first feed my friends he sighed very well i have a tray here i will fetch another metria reconsidered i dont want a stupid simple chamber wedding i want a fullscale bash but that will take time i can wait if you can metrias dress shifted becoming a fancy wedding gown dont you want to do it right for once that would mean having witnesses and all that inconvenience there can be witnesses let my friends attend the nymphs too but id have to let them out of their cells so the castles still tight isnt it ones a magician he could change one of the others into a monster to devour me he has a point graeboe said he has no reason to trust us make them take oaths of nonhostility metria said in this castle all oaths are binding even if the people who make them arent honest you have learned about it veleno said sure the notar republic isnt really the castle its a situation anything it oversees has to be true wherever the castle is thats a piece of the republic and its law governs so the oaths will do it veleno looked at gloha and graeboe will you make the oath of nonhostility that means you cant do anything hostile to me such as trying to act against my interest such as trying to escape gloha felt a chill oh i dont like this she murmured you dont have to swear to marry him graeboe pointed out just not to hurt him it occurred to her that the freedom of the castle would be a lot more comfortable than confinement to this chamber for one thing she needed to get to the privy room all right then swear and ill give you the freedom of the castle veleno said gloha closed her eyes nerved herself and spoke i hereby svear the oath of nonhostility to the proprietor of this castle at that point she felt several loops of a silken cord settle around her and draw gently tight she opened her eyes surprised but there was nothing to see she realized that these were the ties of the binding oath it bound her invisibly but securely graeboe took the oath then veleno unlocked the door he handed gloha the key let your other friends outbut only after they make the oath ill go see about more food and arrangements for the wedding surprised again gloha took the key you have this tray she said to graeboe ill have the next after i release trent and marrow and ill make sure of those wedding arrangements metria said with enthusiasm oh ill make xanths most beautiful bride she vanished gloha followed veleno down the stairs things had happened so swiftly she felt dizzy but at least now there was a chance for things to work out better that way veleno said pointing to a side passage he continued straight ahead she followed the passage and came to the cell you got free trent cried gladly not exactly metria is marrying veleno so he is giving us the freedom of the castle provided we swear an oath of nonhostility we cant try to harm him or to escape until it is clear that the marriage is valid graeboe and i made the oath and you must make it now i am not ready to make that oath trent said mildly then i cant unlock your cell this is interesting have you learned honor i thought i always had it but it doesnt matter when i made the oath invisible bindings bound me and i must honor it its a geis an obligation of honor he agreed if metrias marriage doesnt work what becomes of you then i am back where i started i havent agreed to marry him but i would get locked up and starved until i did agree and so would you and graeboe yet you honor your agreement despite this risk yes now are you going to make the oath you will be fed anyway but i cant let you out without that oath she hesitated please magician i dont want to leave you confined in fact she didnt want to leave him at all she remembered how he had confessed his desire to transform cynthia centaur back to human form for a reason he didnt need to state considering cynthias interest in him gloha couldnt help wondering how it would be to be transformed to human woman form at least for a night with him of course the magician had no notion of her interest and she would not tell him she justwished i dont need to make the oath trent said neither does marrow yes you do because otherwise i cant let you out the binding oath held her firmly though she really wanted to free him so she wouldnt have to leave him here and go about her remaining business alone he smiled let me explain you meant well but you came within transformation range just now i could have changed you to a flea and picked up the key ring as it fell to the floor then we would have been free without the oath oh gloha said stepping hastily back she knew it was true why didnt you because part of what i learned during my exile from xanth was honor i have never since that time played false to any person or creature it would not have been honorable to use your naivete to trick you into violating your oath so though i am not entirely at ease with the compromise you made with the master of this castle i must adhere to the deal you made and may offer no hostility to him my continued incarceration thus becomes pointless he pushed on the door and it swung open gloha gaped how did that get unlocked marrow held up a crooked bone skeleton key he explained i have learned how to adapt i wish i had thought of this before graeboe got caught but my hollow head isnt always efficient with thoughts once i did think of it it seemed best to wait until we knew the full situation of the castle you mean you could have gotten out without making the oathif i hadnt made it gloha asked appalled true trent said but it was your decision to make as this is your quest we are on she shook her head she could only hope that metrias decision to marry veleno worked out otherwise the demoness might have made more mischief than she knew they went downstairs gloha located the castle privy then checked the rest of the main floor layout it seemed to be a welldesigned castle but very quiet because there were no servants there in the castle dining room veleno had laid out several more pies from his courtyard pie trees the fare here was limited but that couldnt be helped they were hungry ill take mine up to eat with graeboe gloha said she would rather have remained with trent but the giant needed her company more she laid the key ring on the table where veleno would find it and started off i shall wait here for veleno to reappear trent said sitting down to attack his pie i shall releasethe nymphs marrow said they dont need oaths either they are harmless he picked up the key ring and they surely appreciate weddings gloha wasnt sure about that each nymph had been married to veleno for one evening and then suffered what must have been by notar republic rules an automatic annulment when she didnt remember it next morning but she agreed that it wasnt right to leave them locked up gloha followed the route to the highest chamber graeboe had hardly started eating his pie it wasnt that he wasnt hungry but that he was too weak that was what she had been afraid of come on ill help you she sat on the floor beside him she didnt ask him if he wanted help because then he would have remembered his pride she just used the spoon that she had picked up with her pie she fed him one mouthful after another betweentimes she ate bites of her own pie thank you he said seeming to recover somewhat i regret putting you to this trouble i wish i could feed you something to make you strong again she said wistfully i am glad just to have known you thank you she leaned down and kissed him on the ear when he had eaten as much as he could she finished off her pie and his then lifted him and carried him carefully down to the main floor she wanted to be able to keep track of him though she had no idea what she could do if he got worse meanwhile things were changing every chamber was lighted nymphs were all over the place helping with the wedding preparations marrow bones was directing the construction of benches for a number of folk to sit on metria was fogging in and out giving spot instructions on decor the demoness could not do anything physical herself but seemed to enjoy directing all the others the nymphs did not seem to find it unusual for a demoness and a skeleton to be supervising things since their memory did not extend back to yesterday they probably thought that this was the way it always had been trent must have transformed one of the plants of the courtyard garden to a fabric tree because nymphs were tearing brightly colored lengths of cloth and hanging them up as decorations the castle was becoming festive in strange contrast to its normal atmosphere two more figures appeared magpie gloha exclaimed stepping up to hugher old tutor what are you doing here why i came for the wedding dear and so did dara gloha looked at the other woman she was elegantly formed and garbed looking much like a queen youre dara demoness humfreys first wife ive heard so much about you she said insincerely dara smiled not all of us are like metria as you should know from knowing magpie metria appeared trailing smoke i heard that you lost your soul and pzoopl you were gone thats just like me but i reformed dara said evenly now i act as if i have a soul though i dont that wont be a problem for you i suspect no problem at all metria agreed im only going to stay long enough to find out what love is then ill be out of here oh i dont think so dear magpie said well what do you know metria demanded youve spent too much time being a servant to mortals it was bad enough with that princess thorn princess who dara inquired prickle spur barb spine spike nettle cactus bloodred flower rose whatever metria agreed crossly princess rose but then you got into lesser ones even goblins and ogres like that gumbo okra magpie said okra ogress whatever youve lost your perspective i doubt it magpie said unperturbed i wouldnt miss this occasion for anything well you might as well make yourself useful then the weddings in only a time and a couple of moments i shall be glad to magpie said the job might as well be done right she vanished to reappear elsewhere in the room just in time to prevent three nymphs from hanging a festoon upside down and who is your young man dara inquired glancing at graeboe gloha realized that she was still carrying the elf hastily she set him down this is graeboe giant hes not my a giant dara said surprised she looked more closely why so he is is the magician trent in the vicinity by any chance yes he transformed graeboe its complicated it certainly is but it will soon simplify dramatically i wish you every happiness together she moved off to untangle several nymphs who had gotten themselves wrapped in material shapely arms and legs were waving at odd angles and screams were starting to emerge gloha turned to graeboe embarrassed she just assumed we were she just came on the scene he said she doesnt know another figure appeared before them this was a portly elder demon with a frighteningly certain face of course she knows he said are your heads full of mush you would have seen the outcome yourselves if you had any wit at all gloha made a wild guess hello professor grossclout she said politely i am surprised to see you here too i couldnt avoid it grossclout said i have to officiate he glanced sourly around i must say metria holds the dubious distinction of being the worst of all the nitwitted inattentive mushminded students ever to disgrace my classes metria reappeared i love you too professor she kissed him on the cheek with a resounding smack stop that you wretched creature he exclaimed seeming almost ready to detonate its really nice of you to take the trouble she said unconcerned by his ferocity i came only to make absolutely certain that you go through with it you irresponsible inamorata irresponsible what flame lover beloved sweetheart mistress paramour concubine fiancee she asked whatever he agreed crossly metria colored faintly pink and averted her gaze thank you she said modestly he poked a chubby finger at her nose you are about to get what is coming to you you infernal nuisance just so long as i learn love thats something you never taught in your classes professor i taught the love of knowledge but you were incapable of learning it he paused reconsidering but indubitably you will learn something now he added obscurely gratified metria vanished grossclout shook his head she is the most annoying female he grumbled she definitely does not think like a scholar but she is trying to do something decent gloha said for the wrong reason he focused disconcertingly on gloha whereas your case is far more positive you deserve the joy you are about to achieve joy gloha asked blankly but the demon professor was already turning away i really dont understand demons graeboe said metria says that hes the only one who cant be fooled gloha replied but if he thinks i face my prospects with joy hes way out of touch grossclout marched to the podium in front of the benches take your seats please he said in a voice so fraught with authority that the timbers of the castle trembled the ceremony is about to commence jjnmediately the nymphs scrambled to perch cutely on the benches magpie appeared before gloha you and graeboe must sit at the front as friends of the bride we arent exactly friends gloha said all the better dear this way she guided them to the place all the better graeboe whispered after they were seated i dont understand this at all gloha confessed magpie reappeared oh im sorryi forgot you are the maid of honor gloha me gloha exclaimed horrified i dont know anything about we demons cant interact with the castle directly and in any event there needs to be a mortal contribution to the ceremony its important but veleno has been marrying a nymph every day without any such fanfare yes and none of those marriages lasted this one will it will gloha asked beginning to hope if it is done correctly come so gloha got up to follow magpie whose judgment she trusted the demoness could not interact with veleno or the things of the castle but could touch gloha quickly she fashioned a suitable maidofhonor dress complete with a dainty little hennina long conical hat with a bit of material descending from it she guided gloha to a mirror there stood a pretty goblin girl whose wings blended nicely with the gown oh i wish i could always look like this gloha breathed you always do to others magpie assured her they think of you as an angelic little angel now you must get out there for the ceremony but i dont know what to do she protested just be there to witness the ceremony and to take the bouquet during the placing of the ring thats all thats enough magpie urged her onward the ceremony was already under way there was music from somewhere not exactly an organ it turned out to be marrow bones playing notes on his rib cage the notes were surprisingly accurate she recognized the wedding march and there was metria in a splendiferously stunning gown and veil marching down the center aisle with a phenomenal bouquet of flowers she almost floated which she certainly could do if she wished to the nude nymphs went ooooo almost in unison wishing they could dress like that veleno waited at the front he was almost handsome in his dark formal suit they came togetherand there was professor grossclout speaking words so solemn and full of import that gloha was to wish ever after that she could remember what they were there was a pause the ring trent stepped forward from the other side he too was handsomely suited he presented a little box gloha realized that the ring must also be of castle substance so could not behandled by demons so trent was playing the part of best man gloha wondered if that wasnt taking nonhostility to an extreme yet why not if the marriage actually worked they would all be free without violence or deceit veleno took out the ring metria looked for a place to put her bouquet gloha quickly stepped up to take it but as she did it puffed into smoke ohit wasnt real the demoness had formed it out of her own substance to add to the effect still to maintain appearances someone had needed to take it at this stage of the ceremony now came the critical part veleno lifted the ring and metria lifted her left hand would the ring fit on her or would it pass right through her substance the way all the other things of the castle did the ring stayed metria held her hand up triumphantly showing it off she had become real to the castle man and wife gloha heard the professor intone then veleno tookher in his arms and kissed her his hands did not pass through her and neither did his lips she was real to him too satisfied professor grossclout grandly faded out so did magpie and dara more petitely they had done what they had come to do the scene dissolved into the wedding feast the nymphs did not need to eat but they nibbled at the assorted pies anyway gloha trent and graeboe had already eaten but they also nibbled meanwhile the groom and bride disappeared into the nuptial chamber for the consummation where metria would make veleno deliriously happy for an hour or so gloha knew it didnt mean anything what counted was whether the bride remained solid and with her memory intact on the following morning until then nobody could be released that was the deal meanwhile it was left to the rest of them to clean up they all pitched in restoring the castle to its previous condition with one exception they left the decorations why not be festive another day at last it was done the nymphs retired to their cells to sleep feeling most comfortable there in the morning they would remember none of this but their cells would no longer be locked so they would be able to come out and deport or disport themselves as they wished there werent any fauns here but perhaps the nymphs could run around and scream a little anyway trent marrow graeboe and gloha sat at the kitchen table unwinding soon they too would return to their cells to sleep this time taking pillows with them to make it comfortable everything depended on the morrow do you think it will take trent asked oh i hope so gloha said fervently the demons seemed to think it would i understand that the professor demon is never wrong marrow remarked it is odd that he came to handle the service himself graeboe said considering that he has no respect for metria his attitude does seem odd marrow agreed it was almost as if he thought she wouldnt like being married he said that she was going to get what was coming to her gloha said remembering and when i said that we werent exactly metrias friends magpie said it was all the better trent shook his head strange i think we have not yet grasped the full import of this occasion they sat in silence for a while and a half not getting up the gumption to retire after their arduous day metria appeared wearing a gauzy nightdress which showed the pink halter and panty beneath oh are you folk still up she asked surprised by inertia trent said why are you here i made veleno so deliriously happy that he pooped out it will take him several moments to recover for the next bout so i sneaked down to fetch a nice pie but you dont need to eat metria gloha said not for me for him hell be hungry after air that effort even marrow seemed to be taken aback by this you are trying to do something nice for him that isnt what is strictly prescribed by the deal wellyes the demoness said defensively cant a wife do something for her husband if she wants to its almost as if you care graeboe remarked metria looked nonplussed that must be an illusion trent squinted at her evidently thinking of something say something mean about him he suggested mildly metria opened her mouth idont care to if i didnt know better id suspect you of having part of a soul trent said thats nonsense im just trying to make him diliribusly happy for a few hours its a matter of professional pride since when do you have that land of pride gloha asked sincei got married the demoness replied surprised that ceremonyit must have done more than marry you gloha said when i took the oath of nonhostility i felt invisible bonds close on me binding me to what i swore did you feel that why yes metria said similarly surprised i was so concerned with doing it exactly right that i didnt pay much attention it did make me start relating to the castle so i could pretend to summon the stork with him pretend graeboe asked we demons never summon storks unless we want to metria explained we just go through the motions deluding mortals but it isnt real who in her right mind would want to mess with a baby i would gloha said if i had the rightthe right family trent pursed his lips in the very mildest of expressions and you dont have the right family metria i didnt say that velenos not a bad man just isolated theres nothing wrong with him that a good loving woman cant fix and are you that woman of course not then she looked pained buttheres something i dont know is it wonderful yet painful leaving you so confused you hardly know what you feel graeboe asked thats it exactly the demoness agreed how did you know i think you are experiencing the first confused pangs of love he said i am butbut thats what i was looking for and it isnt what you expected gloha asked interested no i dont know what i expected but not this iti dont know if i like it love doesnt necessarily care whether you like it trent said sadly it can bring you enormous grief but you would never trade it for any other experience metria i believe that your wedding ceremony brought you half of velenos soul now you are able to experience the full range of human emotions and commitments not half of them gloha asked half a soul is still a soul he said it normally regenerates becoming complete you have a considerable experience ahead of you but i didnt want a soul metria protested i just wanted to see what love is like i think professor grossclout knew that graeboe said he knew you would be getting more than you wanted he came to make sure it happened grossclout metria exclaimed that infernal spook he wanted to get back at me for never taking his classes seriously id say he found a way trent said what am i going to do with a soul she expostulated you whatted gloha asked shouted yelled howled bellowed proclaimed argued earnestly exclaimed whatever she agreed crossly say waiti didnt say the word i still didnt understand it gloha said well anyway the demoness said tragically where will i go what will i do frankly my dear trent started with threefifths of a smile i dont suffer graeboe said instead youll suffer metria well ill have none of it im going to she paused distracted youre going to what marrow asked she sighed im going to get that pie for him she puffed out trent shook his head i think i wouldnt care to cross professor grossclout he remarked if that is his penalty for being crossed i would gladly do it marrow said i want half a soul gloha saw graeboe look thoughtful but he didnt comment well we had better sleep if were going to she said standing graeboe tried to stand but didnt make it perhaps i will remain here he said he was trying to be gracious about his weakness and not bother anyone else with it gloha didnt want to embarrass him by offering to carry him again maybe ill stay here too she said i should think it would be more comfortable in your private cell marrow said well it might but she started so i shall be glad to carry graeboe there the skeleton finished he carried me before that is kind of you graeboe agreed the skeleton picked him up and walked away ill fetch pillows gloha said quickly but when she had several pillows she realized that they were too big for her to carry she would have to make the long trip to the highest cell with one pillow at a time that promised to be tedious it would also use up more of the time she had hoped to have for sleeping metria reappeared got a problem she inquired none you need to concern yourself about gloha said shortly yes i do you are a nice person who never did anyone any harm and you deserve assistance ill carry those up gloha was taken aback then she remembered the soul the demoness had become a caring person thank you metria its weird having to be concerned how others feel metria remarked as she carried the pillows but this business of loveim so afraid ill do something wrong or that hell do something wrong though i know these concerns are foolish sometimes im happy and sometimes im terrified im just so mixed up i wish after a moment gloha realized that the demoness wanted to be asked this was definitely not the old metria what do you wish i wish i had asomeone toto listento understandto advisei dont know what this is all so new you wish you had a friend gloha said in a burst of realization that brightened the passage that must be it but there isntdemons dont have friends maybe they do if they want them gloha said who would ever want to be friends with a demon metria asked plaintively gloha saw that the demoness problem was her problem too she had gotten metria into this and it had saved gloha from a horrible fate maybe the demoness had done it for her own selfish reason without knowing the full consequence but gloha owed her a considerable favor i would maybe she said metria paused on an upper landing would what she asked cautiously i would be your friend the demoness froze oh i couldnt ask she said ioh thank you i feel so much better now she was smiling but tears were flowing from her eyes i havent experienced love myself exactly gloha said touched but i think your feelings are normal i hope they get untangled soon they reached the high chamber marrow and graeboe were there talking but they stopped as the others arrived metria set down the pillows i have to get back she said but pop in anytime gloha said the demoness nodded and faded out i will depart now marrow said and did so gloha arranged the pillows to make graeboe comfortable he seemed thoughtful as well as weak but she decided not to ask what he and marrow had been talking about in a moment he was asleep and in another so was she something was strange the floor seemed to be sagging that was impossible of course but gloha couldnt just dismiss it she sat up looking around dawn was brightening beyond the barred window a pink cloud was losing its color the window looked slightly skew she got up knowing that it was merely an effect of the magic of perspective but unable to restrain her curiosity she touched a barand it felt not quite hard not soft certainly but not metallic more like wood she looked upand saw a dip in the ceiling imagination she spread her wings and flew up to touch it and it was slightly soft and it gave a bit where her finger poked it it was sagging something was definitely amiss she dropped to the floor graeboei think wed better get out of here he woke i think not not i dont think i can get up i think my time is coming something seemed to tear inside her no graeboe she cried not yet you havent found youryour answer i found enough you must pry open the bars and fly out pry open the i cant do that the castle is dissolving it means that veleno has found someone who remembers her wedding the following morning the enchantment is dissipating you must escape before you are caught in the collapse gloha realized that he had correctly understood the situation that explained the sagging of the castle the bars would no longer be strong enough to hold her and that was the fastest exit she went to them and wedged them apart as if they were strands of rubber looking out the window and down she saw the entire castle leaning lopsidedly as its foundations lost their solidity she hurried back to graeboe ill take you too she said gloha it isnt worth your effort i will be gone before the morning is done anyway this is as good a way as any but if you would he paused somewhat as metria had what do you wish she asked her heart hurting if you would kiss me before you go im not going she cried not without you she got down about to pick him up but as she did so she realized that the flight down carrying him would be perilous she wasnt that strong a flyer so she didnt gamble she put her face down and kissed him on his little mouth something went through her like a gentle shock then the floor tilted and she had to act she hauled graeboe up in her arms scrambled to the window and jammed through it was slanting crazily and the bars stretched readily she lunged out fell spread her wings and flew as hard as she could but it wasnt enough graeboes weight bore her down and she was falling too fast to land safely she struggled to fly harder but was able only to slow her descent they were going to crash drop me graeboe cried no she cried back hanging on to him more tightly the ground rushed up gloha closed her eyes she struck something soft and springy she bounced she opened her eyes she had landed on a big resilient cushion it had enabled her to light harmlessly but how had it come there the cushion opened a mouth as gloha landed the second time dont look so surprised it said what are friends for anyway metria she cried gladly the cushion faded leaving them on the ground must see about magician trent the lingering words came why did she save us graeboe asked as she set him down on a nearby hummock were friends we agreed to be on the way up to the room last night she needs a friend gloha looked up at the melting castle and it seems i needed one too ah because she is new to conscience and love it must be difficult for her it is she has to sort it out all at once but she must be succeeding because the enchantment is ending ill help her all i can after all she saved me from something i very much didnt want she glanced at the ground twice which perhaps leads into my second question why didnt you drop me and save yourself when it was apparent that you couldnt save us both i just couldnt he did not pursue the matter they watched the castle fold in on itself as its substance lost cohesion meanwhile the front door opened and nymphs ran out across the drawbridge their hair streaming behind them they had been freed and were going home where they would surely be welcomed but where were trent and marrow then those two emerged as well they were the ones who had gotten the nymphs out what about veleno gloha asked metria appeared are you kidding i got him out first of course hes waiting over there they looked where she gestured veleno was lying on the ground which accounted for why gloha had overlooked him before he had a dreamy smile on his face gloha walked across to him are you all right never better he replied i had to ask her to let me be for a while theres only so much delirious happiness a man can stand all at once when hes not used to it i guess you did meet the demons requirement gloha said you found a woman to love you metrias no mere woman shes something else he closed his eyes and the dreamy smile returned evidently he was satisfied the castle continued to settle as if on a very hot surface smoke rose from it fuzzing into the sky it collapsed into a mound and the mound shrank into a pile and the pile bubbled into a molehill finally the last of it steamed away leaving only a bare island in a dirty pool well thats it dear metria said to veleno i was going to bug out after this point but somehow i no longer want to lets go home to your village werent you helping these folk to fulfill their own quests he asked in my fashion but now theyre free so they can go on about their business thats true gloha said metria has done her part and helped us a great deal we can handle things on our own now all right veleno said we might as well go but now metria demurred maybe i should see them through to the completion of their quests we can wait after all that village doesnt even know were coming or care veleno agreed maybe we should go somewhere else i really dont care as long as youre there you must be ready for some more delirious delight the demoness said advancing on him well perhaps we should find some food and resume our journey trent said briskly but graeboe cant travel gloha said we can surely help metria said but why should you take the trouble gloha asked her metria approached her please she said quietly i have a husband but im new at all this and i have only one friend im not ready to face it all alone oh gloha agreed quickly of course we may have another concern marrow said his skull facing the sky there were large creatures flying rapidly toward them love gloha recognized them the flying centaurs she cried happily in a moment four centaurs landed two were adult and two were juvenile gloha flew up to make introductions hello cheiron and chex and che and cynthia she said and gwenny goblinwhy did you come here metria said you needed help the goblin girl chief said jumping down from cheirons back to give gloha a hug so we arranged for a contingent of goblins to come here to rescue you naturally i had to come myself to make sure they behave and naturally i had to come with her as her companion che said and naturally we wouldnt let them go into an unknown and possibly dangerous situation alone chex said but the situation has been resolved gloha said metria married my captor and got half a soul and the castle dissolved down to nothing so we dont need rescue any more thats too bad gwenny said too bad gloha asked surprised because the goblin forces will be arriving at any moment and theyll be in a fighting mood oh gloha appreciated the problem goblin girls were always lovely sweet and nice but goblin men were not like that if there wasnt some enemy for them to fight they were all too apt to find something else to fight such as their friends i wonder how the harpies will react metria remarked theyre coming too gloha asked alarmed i tried to notify interested parties the demoness said its a good thing the giants didnt hear of this graeboe said with a weak laugh of course they heard metria said you were in trouble too werent you they said theyd gather a big force and tramp right over here gloha was aghast who else did you tell nobody except the skeletons of the gourd gloha was relieved at least they cant come out here theyre locked in the dream realm not if trojan deems the matter important enough to give them a pass to the waking realm marrow said trojan was the horse of a different color who ruled the dream realm he was a nononsense creature no danger of that gloha said relieved there was the sound of marching it grew louder not only that it seemed to be coming from several directions what was going on gloha and the winged centaurs flew up to investigate from a suitable height oh no gloha breathed for there were four groups converging from the north came a rabble of goblins armed with clubs spears and stones from the south came a screech of harpies armed with dungballs and explosive eggs from the east came a crunch of giants they were invisible but their footprints could be seen advancing by giant steps from the west came a skeleton stiff metria said smoking into view at the same altitude a skeleton what gloha asked remains cadaver stink decompose body corpse whatevno thats not quite it band force squad unit team crew troop corps ver the demoness agreed crossly and theyre all going to meet by the dirty pond cynthia said she was flying beside che centaur and they did make a nice couple though both were still children gloha was glad to see that aspect of her adventure working out well well just have to explain gloha said that will not be easy chex said the goblins will obey gwenny grudgingly but the others wont they will want to have a big battle and they are more or less natural enemies gloha said it was difficult to stop the goblins and harpies from going to war when my parents got together i almost wish our captivity had lasted a little longer maybe trent will know how to handle it cynthia said he was king for a while wasnt he yes gloha agreed he must have faced difficult situations before they flew down to rejoin the ground party there are goblins harpies giants and skeletons converging gloha reported to trent we need to stop them from quarreling the magician nodded a distraction would be good perhaps some temporary quest to take their attention yes but what he glanced over to graeboe i fear you are about to expire what is your last wish a horrible chill shuddered through gloha expire now i would like to be taken to some isolated region and transformed to my natural form graeboe said and i would like marrow bones to have my soul oh i would not take your soul die skeleton protested i would not care to have it be wasted when it expected a longer life graeboe said i can not think of a worthier creature to have it but you cant die gloha cried you were supposed to be saved that appears to have been a vain hope graeboe said sadly i want marrow to have my soul perhaps half of it trent said the sound of tramping was loud at any moment the converging forces would appear i do not wish to intrude on a sensitive moment marrow said but i think that dealing with the assorted contingents should have priority this is my notion trent said then inexplicably he addressed graeboe again did the good magician say anything else except that help would come if you waited in this vicinity no not that i recall graeboe said just that i might be transported transported gloha asked shipped hauled delivered moved carried conveyed metria said helpfully surely to the place suitable to my expiration graeboe agreed i must have misunderstood the message thats easy to do with humfreys words marrow said i may have similarly misunderstood professor grossclouts admonition to tarry near the volcano i am not sure of that in either case trent said humfreys answers are always relevant when understood so are grossclouts your fates may be linked along with glohas now the giant steps were so close the ground was quaking and the harpy flight was appearing on the horizon why wasnt trent paying attention that word trend said could it have been transplanted why yes i believe it was graeboe agreed surprised i misremembered it but that must be merely another way to suggest that i would be moved to another locale and you marrow trent said was there anything else however seemingly irrelevant that grossclout told you the skeleton tapped his skull only that it would be a fair trade since i have nothing to trade for a soul that does not seem to relate the goblin army appeared to the north and the skeleton crew to the west the timing seemed perfect all four groups would arrive together trent turned back to graeboe if you were to trade half your soul for something what would that be i am not seeking to trade my soul graeboe objected i seek only to give it to a worthy person speaking hypothetically what would be worth it graeboe made a wan smile my life of course but what kind of a transplant would give you life new blood since that is not possible where does your blood come from graeboe shook his head i dont understand i do cheiron centaur said the blood comes from the bones at least in part he would need a bone transplant the others laughed at the impossibility of that except for trent or perhaps a marrow transplant well yes of course cheiron agreed the center part of the bone i thought that was understood the skeletons jawbone dropped you mean i could trade someof my marrow to give him life i would gladly do that regardless of the soul but graeboes a giant gloha said marrow doesnt have enough in his whole body to provide more than one fingers worth not when graeboe is in his present form trent pointed out the others stared at him thats right marrow said he is small at the moment oh graeboe you can be saved gloha said once you get better you can be as you once were an invisible giant yet somehow her joy in that realization was tempered thus perhaps we see the nature of the trade trent concluded marrow for half a soul and both achieve their objects now the contingents from the four directions arrived they drew up and flew down to a stop forming a perfect square bounded by goblins giants harpies and skeletons the giants were indicated only by their imprints but those were huge i shall be happy to make that trade marrow said and so shall i graeboe agreed amazed there is just one problem trend said as i recall a marrow exchange has to be facilitated by bloodroot and a transplant does anyone know where such a plant grows there were blank looks all around no one knew i think we have a search to make trent said fortunately we have a competent search party assembled capable of checking land air and underground in one of those regions there should be a plant he looked around but we need to locate it before the day is out because i think graeboe will not survive until tomorrow what does the plant look like gloha asked it is fairly small with vinelike branches cheiron said its leaves are green and it has coiled projections terminating in spikes he took a stick and made a sketch in the dirt approximately this configuration then he drew an enlarged flower you can most readily identify it by its distinctive blossom lets see which contingent can find such a flower first trent said the word went out to the four groups immediately they scattered seeking the transplant the possible strife had been averted cynthia looked thoughtful i dimly remember something about such a plant she said of course that was when i was a child seventy years she caught herself seven years ago it may be gone now where did you hear it was che inquired she turned a surprisingly competent littlegirl smile on him che of course knew her origin and original age but seemed to like her very well regardless that was perhaps not surprising for not only was she the only other winged centaur child in xanth who was most eager to get along well she had more than a suggestion of her former and later prettiness id rather not say because if im wrong it will make me look even duller than i am i think ill just go look not alone chex said severely not at your age in this region oh cynthia said momentarily discommoded yes of course its probably not there anyway i will go with you chex said and you dont look dull she was of course speaking literally cynthias mind might be dull compared to that of a normal centaur but her appearance was bright oh cynthia repeated more cheerfully yes the two of them took off gloha realized that che wasnt going because he was staying with gwenny whose companion he was he never separated from her it was clear that the two were as close as any two could be but that this was friendship and not romance it was a significant distinction cheiron stayed also to give gwenny a ride because she couldnt fly thus gwenny was directing the goblins from the back of a winged centaur and no one seemed to find that remarkable soon the only ones remaining by the pond were gloha graeboe marrow trent metria and velenoand the last two disappeared into the forest theoretically to search but probably to have privacy for another dose of delirious happiness gloha remained amazed how that had worked out and a bit jealous the demoness and the nymphomaniac had turned out to be right for each other while gloha had found nothing right for her if only it had been someone like magician trent who had captured her in the castle but younger and singlebut her foolish little fancy was going offtrack again perhaps we should eat and rest now trent said because when that plant is located we shall likely have some traveling to do could it be brought here gloha asked it would be better if graeboe didnt have to travel the bloodroot yes we need only a sprig of that but i believe that the transplant itself cant be transplanted he said just as i cant transform myself some magic relates to oneself and some to others so we shall have to find a way to move graeboe comfortably perhaps i can transform a volunteer into a form suitable for such service transform me gloha said immediately please no graeboe said i would not have you trouble yourself further on my behalf but i want to help you i cant stand the thought of you she couldnt finish i have been already too much of a burden he said you have been more than kind to me already perhaps we should accomplish the exchange marrow said then there need be no further concern about burdens for graeboe will be healthy and able to be transformed to any form he wishes exactly gloha said he can be an invisible giant again and i can help that happen by being transformed to a suitable carrying form i think it will be better to get some other volunteer trent said why when i want to help its just an opinion he said mildly gloha decided not to argue further she and marrow went foraging for nuts and fruits and a blanket for graeboe because he seemed to be getting cold trent transformed a weed into a flame vine that provided heat they ate a belated breakfast and rested gloha discovered that she was tired the events of the morning had taken mental as well as physical toll so she settled down on a cushion beside graeboe and tried to relax she knew she wouldnt really be able to rest until there was news of the transplant she woke some time later somewhat refreshed it seemed to be near noon graeboe was asleep beside her wrapped in his blanket still looking cold others were talking some distance away metria popped in before her mixed reports she said the goblins are scouring the ground and underground the harpies are checking the mountains and treetops the giants and skeletons are checking far crannies together theyve found plenty of bloodroot in fact heres a sprig she showed a bloodred root but there seems to be no transplant growing anywhere to be found gloha didnt want to hear that so she inquired about a detail the giants and skeletons are working together yes the giants can travel far but arent much for detail work like peeking into beerbarrel tree knotholes so they are carrying handfuls of skeletons and the skeletons do the peeking the demoness smiled some ordinary folk have freaked out when they peeked into houses gloha could appreciate why i hope somebody finds it it would be really mean of the good magician to tell him hed find help if it cant be yes humfrey always amused me before now i would be sorry to learn of such a deception well you have a soul now gloha sat up i guess i havent been much of a friend to you ive been distracted its a funny thing metria said once you said you would be my friend i got much more confidence and it was easier to adjust i didnt need your advice thats the way friendship works sometimes she looked at graeboe if only i could be more of a friend to him youve done all you could havent you i havent saved his life i try to find ways to help but i cant do what really counts the demoness looked unusually thoughtful as if her recent experience had given her some insight im sure youll find a way then two centaurs appeared in the sky chex and cynthia it was there cynthia exclaimed her pigtails bobbing right where id heard it might be gloha leaped up you found the transplant oh wonderful dont be overjoyed just yet chex said it is by no means easy to reach well reach it anyway gloha said we have to where is it in a crevice on mount pinatuba thats not a nice mountain sudden dread surged through gloha i know oh this is awful how will we ever get to it without being buried in burning ashes magician trent strode up to join them he accepted metrias sprig of bloodroot and tucked it into a pocket i think the creatures who came to help us will have some real action after all we shall have to lay siege to the mountain but that wont get us safely into its crevice gloha protested it will if the distraction is sufficient gloha saw the logic the evil mountain wouldnt be able to keep track of every single goblin and harpy if they were careful and escaped its notice long enough the ploy might work the retreat sounded and the various parties began returning to the rendezvous as they did they got briefed there were hollers and screeches as the goblins and harpies learned that violent action would be required but abrupt silence when they found out the nature of the enemy this was more of a challenge than they really cared for but neither group could back down in the presence of the other the skeletons were not as concerned being less vulnerable to hot rocks the giants were neutral they could normally get away from something like that in two or three giant steps but they knew that they could be hurt by flying boulders and the closer they got to the mountain the worse it would be now we shall have to get moving trent said but the siege hasnt even started gloha said precisely we must seek a devious route that will take longer so mat the mountain never suspects the real object the siege will be in place by the time pinatuba might realize that an insignificant party is approachingand then it may assume that this is merely a distraction from the real object this is chancy i agree but seems to be the best course what is the real object gloha asked i mean the one that we hope the mountain will think is the real object the harpies discovered a marvelous lake on the other side of the volcano from the transplant they call it miracle lake the apparent object will be to capture and exploit that lake why would anybody want a lake beside a meanspirited volcano there are boats on that lake floating at anchor barnacles grow on the bottoms of those boats the surfaces of those barnacles are so highly glossy as to be reflective they can be harvested and assembled into fullsized mirrors thus they are mirrorbarnacles or miracles for short but mirrors can be made from glass or polished stone she said why go to the trouble of fashioning them from shiny barnacles they are magic barnacles they make magic mirrors oh gloha exclaimed suddenly understanding i never knew where magic mirrors came from there may be other origins trent said but i suspect that we have stumbled upon one of magician humfreys secret sources certainly the mountain will zealously guard its treasure so i think this is as good a diversion as any i should think so she agreed impressed i wouldnt mind having one of those mirrors myself he smiled you have other business i think oh of course i wasnt suggesting then she realized that he was teasing her his ways were sometimes so subtle that she had trouble interpreting them that was part of what she liked about him he was just soso manly he turned to other business metria and veleno are now scouting out a possible route to the transplant they seem to work well together but veleno cant go near that mountain he can in his present form his i transformed him he is a parrot legal one of the few creatures the volcano tolerates near its cone perhaps because they are very good at arguing their cases arguing cases she asked blankly parrots are talkative birds and these ones like to perform legal tasks though they are neither secretarybirds nor lawyerbirds they are merely paralegals they argue pinatubas case that he has a right to sound off in as great a volume as he chooses though he blows phenomenal amounts of gas and ash into the sky so he doesnt object to their presence veleno is flying through the region while metria makes spot detail checks on the terrain i think theyll get the job done but why should veleno help us he was holding us captive and he almost wanted toto make me be his he was doing what he thought he had to to achieve freedom from his enchantment trend said you caused metria to marry him he is grateful and perhaps suffering some tinge of guilt he believes that the guilt will not entirely dissipate until he has helped you achieve your quest just as you helped him achieve his gloha shook her head i suppose it does make sense but why couldnt metria explore the whole region herself because shes a demoness and the volcano doesnt much like demons it seems that they used to play pranks on him such as dropping stink bombs into his mouth so whenever a demon materializes close by pinatuba lets fly with vigor and blasts it out of there metria can remain close only so long as she never materializes but then she cant communicate with anyone can she she can communicate with veleno because she has half his soul so veleno is indeed proving to be useful to our cause gloha shook her head again it was amazing how things could turn out metria appeared we have a route she reported i didnt have time to investigate every nuance but i think its good it wont be fun but it should get you there wheres veleno he paused to argue a case with another parrot legal who didnt recognize him hell be along soon indeed in only four moments the parrot winged in he had bright purple plumage with orange stripes metria held out her hand and he landed on it she brought him in and kissed him on the beak i have been beakissed he exclaimed fluttering his wings there is no precedent are you ready for your next form trent inquired proceed with your case counselor the parrot said the magician put his hand close and the parrot became a glob of goo eeek metria screamed in almost nymphly fashion trying to hold the goo in her hands but it slipped through her fingers and landed with a splat on the ground metria turned to face trent what did you do to my love she demanded hes all icky no he isnt trend said mildly hes merely not yet quite firm he will shape up in a moment sure enough in exactly one moment the blob shaped itself into what appeared to be a reclining chair metria touched the surface oh hes like centaur hide she said appreciatively precisely he is ready to carry graeboe to the transplant but what kind of creature is he gloha asked a slowmud a smaller cousin of swiftmud large enough to carry one elf he can hear and understand us but can respond only with bubbles white for yes black for no and shades of gray for other responses carry an elf gloha asked you meant graeboe lacks the strength to make this trip trent reminded her we are fortunate that he was able to rest and recuperate enough to survive beyond noon that was certainly true graeboe remained asleep or gloha hastily checked him his eyes were open but his forehead was cool oh graeboe youre fading she said he gave her a reassuring smile but it was a weak one we need to reach that plant before the day is out trent said quietly does your route permit that metria yes if you move right along the demoness said ill lead the way i wont be able to solidify near the mountain but veleno will receive my communications you had better lead invisibly from the start trent said so that we can work out the miscues before we get within range of the mountain gotcha she smoked out he turned to gloha i think it will be best if you move graeboe to the chair gloha agreed she got down and slid her arms under the elf form and the blanket she heaved him up wincing as she saw him wince she set him carefully in the chair which adjusted to accommodate the body the surface of the slowmud was plush and did seem to be about as comfortable as it could be trent had chosen the transformation well lead on metria trent said the demoness did not appear but veleno started to move he just slid smoothly along the ground in the manner the larger swiftmud had evidently responding to metrias hidden touch or silent word snared souls were wonderful but we cant get there from here gloha said hurrying after the slowmud which was getting to respectable velocity its beyond the faun nymph retreat lake ogrechobee and the region of madness it took us days to come this far how can we do it in hours maybe we can go into ogredrive trent said unconcerned as they moved onto a slight hill or take giant steps but were not the hill rose into the air eek gloha cried exactly like a nymph she kicked her feet flung her hah about spread her wings and flew up alarmed trent and marrow sat down beside the chair on the other hand lets just relax trent said the group rising up beyond the tops of the trees chex and cynthia flew over to join gloha i see you are on your way to the nasty mountain the elder centaur said we cant go there so well return home now but please stop by when your quest is done yes please do cynthia said i really enjoyed traveling with you and magician trent there was just the suggestion of a flush as she mentioned the name as if she had some unchildish memory i would hate to lose touch i uh of course gloha said somewhat discombobulated if not actually disconcerted because she understood cynthias memory all too well also she was confused by the mysterious flying hill im so glad i was able to help cynthia said yes thank you the centaurs flew away looking somewhat like dam and filly or more properly dam and future fillyinlaw then gloha saw a giant footprint form in a field ohan invisible giant was carrying them one whose breath didnt smell now she realized that the hill the others rode on was in the general shape of a hand with a tarpaulin spread across it somehow she hadnt gotten the word about this detail she flew to the hand and landed there was no sense wearing herself out with a long flight then she remembered trents pun take giant steps on the other hand figures of speech to be taken literally darn the man in a surprisingly short time their flying island sank down to the land in the distance was the peak of a smoking mountain she saw other islands floating in and realized that the armies of goblins skeletons and harpies were being similarly transported the giants cant approach the volcano for the same reason the demons cant trent remarked it seems that once an absentminded giant trod on one of pinatubas ash gardens and now none of them are welcome a boulder of hot rock can make an uncomfortable bum but the giants are contributing to the effort in this manner before going home he patted the tarp and we certainly appreciate the transportation the flesh beneath gave a twitch of appreciation gloha knew why the giant did not speak it would give away the operation if the mountain overheard they dismounted from the hand and the tarp slid off and became limp the hand had departed they were at the edge of a dry plain spread with what looked like dishes veleno answering an invisible directive slid briskly into it trent and marrow paced it on either side gloha was left perplexed again unable to subdue her curiosity she went to inspect the closest of the dishes it turned out to contain what looked like vanilla ice cream what was that doing way out here in nowhere she checked another it contained several brownies smelling very chocolaty a third dish contained butterscotch pudding others had pie cake tarts sweets fruits sugared nuts and assorted other desserts suddenly it registered this wasnt a desert plainit was a dessert plain filled with plain desserts in fact it must be the region of just desserts she had heard about but never expected to visit well there was no sense in letting all this wonderful food go to waste she picked up a dish with a mouthwatering slice of meringue pie she was about to eat it when marrows skull turned to face her that may not be wise the skeleton said fumes from the volcano may have tainted these desserts good point she threw the pie away but it looped around and came back to her hand boo it said astonished she threw it away again harder it skated just above the ground in a big loop and came right back to her boo couldnt she get rid of it boomeringue pie i believe marrow observed oh the kind that always came back to a person so she held on to it for now shed find a way to get rid of it soon she was sure she flew ahead to see what other wonders might be along this route beyond the desserts was a low valley in it were hoods just assorted pointed or rounded headdresses sitting there for anyone to take she picked one up that was about right for her and put it on her head immediately it closed on her forehead and ears with such force it was painful she tried to take it off but it clung curling around her mouth trying to suffocate her choking she fell to the ground then the hood climbed off her face she gasped in a breath not moving for the moment the hood crawled to her hand and wrapped itself around the dish of pie then it rolled away with the pie gloha sat up staring after it that was a robbing hood a criminal type and she unsuspecting had let it waylay her what a fool she had been to trust a hood she got up dusted herself off and set forth again she hoped the others had not seen her stupidity with the hood beyond the hooded valley was a field with a single tree the tree had branches with spinning needlelike spikes leaves that radiated x rays and tendrils that squirted jets of water or made horrible sucking sounds the very sight of it made gloha shiver with horror that was a dentis tree the most feared of all trees her teeth ached with the mere thought of getting within range of that monster the party caught up as she hovered not daring to proceed no need to be concerned about that trent said reassuringly thats a dentis tree i knknow she agreed her teeth chattering such a tree can be very useful when theres a toothache i understand marrow said it doesnt bother folk with healthy teeth veleno proceeded right past the tree gloha nerved herself and followed she was relieved when the tree did not grab her now the route descended into a broad deep cleft this was good because it concealed them from the view of the mountain but there was something odd about it i dont like it she said like it it a voice replied with an annoying inflection who said that she asked not quite pleased said that that the voice said with a sneer are you making fun of me she demanded fun of me me it agreed ironically pay it no mind trent advised its obviously a sarchasm sar chasm chasm the voice agreed tauntingly gloha nodded not trusting herself to speak again because the chasm had a way of reversing and demeaning the import of whatever she said there was a remote clamor it sounded like goblins and harpies hurling insults at each other that was good news it meant that the siege was starting that should distract mount pinatuba from the real mission but soon there was another sound that of distant thunder trent cocked his head uhoh he said mildly could that be fracto marrow inquired it surely could gloha said he always shows up at the worst times malign beings do seem to congregate trent agreed the evil cloud may have a pact with the evil mountain our siege alerted it well as long as fracto doesnt realize what were up to the cloud moved in with dismaying speed the sky darkened thunder crashed and lightning jags taunted the land the rain started i think this chasm wont be suitable much longer trent said maybe if we hurry well get out of it soon marrow said they hurried veleno fairly whizzed along the rain came down more thickly and the runoff from higher slopes poured into the chasm hi assorted waterfalls the base began to fill with water maybe we had better get out of this chasm gloha suggested i mean by getting straight out now not trying to get out the far end of it metria is showing the route trent said she should know whether it is safe to leave the chasm now he glanced at veleno a black bubble came from a nozzle at the slowmuds front that meant no it wasnt safe to leave so they continued as rapidly as they could but the rainfall increased water sluiced into the chasm and the runoff poured more thickly into it evidently this was one of the mountains natural drainage clefts excellent for travel during dry weather but a disaster in a storm metria could not have known that fracto would get into the act the level not only rose in the chasm it developed a turbulent flow they had either to get out of the chasm or fight that flow it was getting more difficult still not safe to leave this depression trent inquired mildly another black bubble ill see for myself gloha said impatiently she spread her wings and hauled herself into the air despite the buffeting of the winds she got her head up above the level of the brink and peered out it was a hellish scene the chasm was winding through a landscape of jagged rocks surrounded by ash steam rose from hot spots and sinister smoke issued from meanlooking vents there seemed to be no clear path through it except the chasm metria had signaled truly not safe gloha said shortly as she dropped back to the bottom we have to continue here we shall have to float trent decided slowmud can do it and marrow can form a boat for me as he did before but each can support only one person we have one extra me gloha said i will have to go back so that the rest of you can make it no trent said firmly you must be along it is your quest but graeboe has to be along and so does marrow you dont mean that you will go back i fear for your safety if i am not with you i may need to transform you if there is an emergency then transform me now into a form that can handle this i dont think thats wise but we have to do something she cried despairingly see if you can hang on to the slowmud he said you can float without putting your weight on it she hadnt thought of that maybe it would work trent kicked marrow in the hipbone and the skeleton flew apart and formed into the small boat there was even a line of small bones extending across so that the slowmud could grab on that way they wouldnt get separated in the rapids trent found a long piece of driftwood he was able to beat into a crude paddlepole he got in the boat and jammed the pole down through the surging water as an anchor gloha saw now that the bone boat had flipperbones below that served to propel the craft meanwhile veleno stopped trying to glide through the shallows and set out to float on the deeps it did seem to work better except that the swirling current tended to turn him around gloha grabbed on behind and the current hauled her back so that she served as a stabilizer then the slowmud was able to forge forward they moved slowly on up the river gloha hoped it would end soon so that they could get back on land but it seemed interminable the rain kept pouring down preventing the river from drying up fracto probably didnt realize that they were there or he would have made it much worse this was just the fringe of his effort to wash out the goblins and harpies elsewhere a dark ugly shape flapped over the chasm gloha saw its silhouette against the bleary sky it looked like a vulture only worse it peered down with its beady eyes it plopped a smelly poop into the water that enabled gloha to recognize it the thing was a vulgar probably one of the mountains meanspirited creatures what would happen if it spied them and told pinatuba then two smaller ugly shapes appeared theres one the first screeched harpies part of the siege force gloha had seldom been happier to see her winged relatives well lets tear it to quivering bits the second harpy screeched enthusiastically the two dived for the vulgar all three shapes disappeared beyond the chasm brink there was a medley of screeching and a grimy feather drifted down the harpies had saved the little party from discovery they followed the chasm river around a turn and came to a filling pool here it was slightly quieter though the storm was still pounding overhead they pulled over to the side where it was shallow enough for them to get some temporary footing and rest briefly trent looked back trouble he said mildly gloha looked around expecting some new threat but there didnt seem to be anything what is it she noticed that the sarchasm effect was gone there was no longer a meanspirited echo graeboe is leaving us what but she knew what he meant she pulled herself around to the side and looked at the elfgiant his pallor was worse he was conscious but looked as if he expected not to be so at any moment the violence of the river travel had depleted his scant remaining strength gloha was stricken what good was this trip if the rigors of travel wiped graeboe out before the transplant could heal him what can we do she asked plaintively we can do nothing he said gravely you can do much i dont understand tell him the truth i havent lied to him or to anyone except to yourself perhaps the magician could be so irritating at times what was he talking about what havent i been truthful about she demanded how is it hurting graeboe your feeling my feeling i want him to be cured so he can live and be a giant then tell him that gloha shook her head unkindly bemused graeboe was dying and she was supposed to wish him a happy gianthood yet she had to say something i cant tell him the truth she said with difficulty it would only hurt him and diminish me and you i doubt it he said with that infuriating mildness then you hear it first she snapped i amam fascinated by you and if i had my choice i would become a human woman and do everything with you that you had in mind for cynthia there it was out for whatever mischief it was worth he seemed unfazed i think not because youre not interested she agreed dully oh but i am so you can just go on being amused by she paused what you are lovely innocent caring faithful and sincere you are the kind of woman any man could love you are a rare prize and i could readily transform you to a fully human woman she stared at him youyou return my interest i do i am as fascinated with you as you are with me and for similar reason you are to your gender what you see me to be in mine we could have a wonderful time together gloha shook her heady little head forgive me magi cian but i am having trouble believing this believe it but understand the whole of it it would not endure because my perspectives are not yours my friends are not yours and i am a magician while you are not i exist in a different realm and that would surely alienate us from each other after the first flush of fulfillment faded you will never be able to match me in magic and if you join me you will sacrifice the heritage you have you would come to resent your inability to fly and you would be ashamed that you gave up the quality that made you unique the unification in your person of the goblins and the harpies and so it would be a mistaken affair without a futureeven if i were not old and already married this is not your true desire or mine she reeled under his harsh and appallingly adult logic suddenly she saw her dream for what it was an utterly foolish fancy she had known it but never quite accepted it now she could no longer deny it she could not give up her heritage for any temporary tryst no matter how handsome intelligent or magical the man and he could not give up his though he had gone so far as to confess being attracted to both cynthia and gloha herself he was physically a young healthy man he noticed and responded to pretty women the difference between them was that he had experience enough to appreciate the truth and the discipline to be governed by his head rather than his passion thank you magician she said at last you have marvelously clarified my mind she wiped away her tears but more replaced them immediately now you must do the same for graeboe before he dies i should set him straight the way you set me straight i dont think i could be so cruel the truth is seldom cruel i think you owe it to him because hehe thinks he feels about me the way i thought i felt about you yes but there is a difference yes hes dying im not so there is very little time he was relentless but what else could she do she did owe a dying man the truth she returned to graeboe she reached out of the water and took his hand under the blanket it was as cold as hers but his wasnt wet the blanket seemed to have a waterrepellent quality so was protecting him from a soaking graeboe i wish you could hang on just enough longer so that you can be cured and live your life as an invisible giant thank you he breathed i wish you fulfillment in your quest he closed his eyes if you will ask marrow bones to come near she saw that he was about to die something burst inside her oh its not true she cried i dont want you to be a giant slowly his eyes opened he was faintly startled i dont want you to be any other creature she said amazed at herself i just want you to be mine i love you graeboe and i wish i could mmarry you and to hhell with my quest she fetched his hand in to her face and kissed it oh graeboe its impossible and im so selfish and youre such a good man and i have no right but please please dont die even if it cant be anything between us because i know i could never endure as a giantess any more than as a straight human woman i want you to be healthy and happy but i am not handsome or really smart and i have no magic talent a wonderful creature like you can do so much better youre just a really decent guy who needs me as trent does not she agreed and thats all i ever wanted my heart knew except his hand warmed id rather be a winged goblin with you than a giant without you he said i love you too gloha but did not want to impose a winged goblin she exclaimed that had never occurred to her of course thats possible you can be anything when trent transforms you oh graeboe you are the one i want i knew you liked me but i never thought youd be willing to give up your natural form so i diverted myself with another notion just hang on and be the fulfillment of my quest he smiled i think perhaps i can do that now she leaned over him and kissed his little face you must graeboe i would be desolate without you i did not want to live without you and so he had been fading having no reason to fight to survive magician trent had known now the rest of the truth was out she had been unblinded graeboe closed his eyes again but this time he seemed to be headed for a restorative sleep instead of a final fadeout he should be able to survive until they reached the transplant they resumed their float up the river the rain was still coming down and total gloom covered the landscape but now things seemed brighter finally the chasm narrowed and gave out they emerged on a slanting plain of hardened volcanic rock the covering of ash had been washed off what had been the chasm was now a mere indentation trent kicked marrow back to his normal configuration and they followed the indent around a curving surface until a new and jagged terrain appeared there were ridges and spikes interspersed with a crackedglaze pattern of crevices a hulking knucklewalking brute came around a pile of stones huh it exclaimed spying them then it lifted its snout and sounded a howl awooooo the mountain took note the rock shuddered steam issued from the little crevices boiling red lava appeared flowing in pursuit of the steam we may have a problem trent said mildly pinatuba knows were here gloha agreed its focusing on us well never get through metria trent said materialize the demoness appeared you realize this means more mischief she said if you are willing to act as a decoy we may be able to proceed she pursed her lips follow the path up to that crack in the cone she said pointing ill do what i can then metria fogged into smoke and reformed as a monstrous toad come and get me you numbskull the toad croaked gloha hoped that the mountain was not smart enough to realize that it had to be a fake frogs not toads croaked but maybe it didnt matter the mountain would know she was a demoness and go after her regardless the toad hopped landing with a plop cant catch me firesnoot she called the lava fairly boiled out of the cracks hissing as the rain struck it it formed pools then began to flow after the toad scattered bits of wood and brush burst into fire as the lava touched them in passing the several runnels formed into one big one gaining speed they seemed to have forgotten about the main party but there was so much lava that it spread out across much of the surface as it flowed trent led the way quickly to the nearest ridge so that they could avoid the burning rock flow it surrounded their elevation like a shallow lake there was nothing to do except follow the ridge on up the crest became higher and sharper the lava still prevented them from returning to more level terrain so they had to stay high the ridge turned pointed until the two sides met in a knifelike cut veleno had no trouble the slowmud simply slid across one side of the ridge sticking to it like a snail graeboe rode along firmly fastened in place gloha was able to fly just above the ridge though the rain and gusts of wind made this nervous business marrow straddled the crest having no flesh to be cut that left trent but marrow solved that problem with a kick he assumed the configuration of a platform across the top braced by arm and leg bones on either side trent sat on this platform and the skeleton skidded smartly along carrying him gloha was even able to join them so that she didnt have to fight the foggy winds then another vulgar flapped by awk it exclaimed spying them then it headed directly for the mountains cone we had better hurry trent said mildly they hurried the skeleton platform clattered along the ridge and the slowmud kept the pace the ridge seemed to lead toward the crack in the cone that metria had pointed out but it turned away at the last moment they were stuck at the end of a long island with molten rock flowing between them and the cone there was a crevice that might be used as a path up the side of the cone but they couldnt reach it mount pinatuba got the word the cone rumbled then a torrent of ash spewed out the top it was trying to catch them with its ash but they were too close the worst of the ash and hot stones were flying too far out gloha could fly across though she feared for her wings in the moderate rain of hot ash but none of the others could transform me into a roc bird ill carry you across no the volcano could orient on a target of that size and drop fireballs on your wings we need to stay small i can help marrows head said from the platform kick me into a ladder then cross on me good notion but how will i stand on this ridge without your support the slowmud blew a white bubble then it slid up until its muddy snout crossed the razor edge the mud caked up on either side of the ridge dulling the edge thank you trent said he got off the platform carefully and sat astride the ridge his midsection protected by the hard rounded mud gloha hovered nervously near then trent hauled the bone platform up held it over his right foot and gave it a good kick it flew apart and formed into a double line of bones connected by crossbones in fact it was a rope ladder without rope there was a skeletal hand at each end trent lifted the bundled ladder and put it on the end of the ridge the fingers felt around the rock until they found good fingerholds and the hand clenched tightly then trent held the other end up for gloha she took the bonehand and flew across to the base of the cone the bone rope strung out behind her it was heavy but for this short hop she could handle it she landed on the crevice and bent down to set the hand there the fingers got a good grip and the bone ladder drew itself tight the slowmud slid up onto the ladder and started across progress was slow because there wasnt much surface for the mud to cling to but it was getting there and bringing graeboe along mount pinatuba realized what was happening he sounded an enraged honk oompah so much ash shot out of the cone so fast and high that it didnt come down it stayed up in the high air and cooled xanth a degree but he couldnt stop the crossing veleno and graeboe made it across then trent started he went on hands and knees gripping the rungs of the ladder as if he were climbing but now cumulo fracto nimbus the evil storm cloud came to the volcanos rescue he huffed and puffed trying to blow the man down when that didnt work he formed a terrible funnel the funnel seemed to be sucking up everything it touched and it had a lot of power trouble indeed trent saw it metria he called the demoness appeared you realize that my appearance here will just draw pinatubas attention to she saw the funnel point taken ill handle this she changed into the biggest stink horn gloha had ever seen it fairly festered with contained stench the funnel swept in casting somewhat blindly about for the man on the ladder the screaming sound of the winds around it drowned out almost all else the stink horn moved to intercept the mouth of the funnel in a quarter of a moment the horn was sucked in and up there was a pause then the funnel exploded with the foulsmelling noise typical of stink horns bbbrrrrrrummpppoopooh the noise dissipated into a miasmic fog that saturated the region it was all gloha could do to keep from choking as the stench reached them the demoness had certainly found the way to get rid of the evil clouds mouth not only that fracto himself had been so disrupted by the taste of the fetor weed that he was unable to continue raining his fragments drifted away and a beam of sunshine ventured down though it wrinkled its rays at the lingering reek even the molten lava below was revolted it blistered and solidified nobody could stand a stink horn the volcano continued to erupt impotently trent completed his crossing then hauled in the ladder after him they were all on the crevicepath now and not far from their destination to keep them safe gloha flew up with marrows ladder end and helped him catch hold higher on the path then the others used the ladder as a guardrail so they werent in danger of falling off the steep slope but now the mountain used its last weapon high above them black goo issued from a fissure it slid slowly down the cone toward them gloha alarmed flew up to investigate but marrows skull which was in the middle of the bone ladder called out a warning that may be poison she halted just outside its range she caught the barest whiff the same stuff they had encountered at the magic dust village this was the worst menace yet she flew back down we cant handle that we must flee before it reaches us i think not trent said but it will kill us all except marrow and metria and they arent even a couple it wont kill the transplant because thats one of the mountains precious possessions if we join the plant we should be safe could it be gloha wasnt sure just how logical the volcano might be it might wipe out the plant to be sure of getting the intruders but she realized the graeboe would die if they retreated now so they had to gamble on the plant perhaps in more than one respect lets hurry she said again they hurried working their way up as the poison blob worked its way down the first nauseating whiffs of gas drifted down making them cough gloha worried about graeboe any little thing could wipe him out and this wasnt little but as they got closer to the opening in the cone that the crevice was leading to the terrible odor faded gloha looked up the deadly glob was detouring sliding away from the cave trent was right the mountain wouldnt destroy its treasure they came into the open grotto there in the recess grew the transplant exactly as it had been described it hardly looked unusual but her excitement made it almost seem to glow now lets get this operation done trent said briskly before the mountain thinks of some other device to balk us veleno carried graeboe to one side of the plant marrow bones resumed his regular form and went to the other side trent set the bloodroot sprig down between them gloha thought that there would be some procedure or invocation but the plant simply wrapped tendrils around marrows left leg bone and others around graeboes right arm while still others picked up the bloodroot then it lifted needle stickers drilled one into the bone and the other into one of the elfs veins gloha winced watching but knew better than to protest it took longer to get into the skeletons hard bone than into the elfs soft arm but the plant did another thing it brought a large yellow flower around until it was leaning over graeboes body it looked like a sunflower but of course couldnt be because this wasnt the right type of plant there was a glow from the flower it bathed graeboe he writhed but did not seem to be in actual pain his flesh did not change but gloha was sure that something significant was happening my understanding is limited trent said but i think that the patients defective marrow has to be killed so that the new marrow can takes its place that must be the radiation that accomplishes that graeboe will die very soon if the transplant is not accomplished the marrow of the donor is liquefied and mixed with the blood of the bloodroot and that mix is put into the body of the recipient and finds its own way into the bone something like that we simply have to trust that the process is effective oh i hope it is gloha breathed she couldnt bear to watch any more so she turned her gaze outward and froze a squadron of vulgars was flying toward the cave they would be able to come right in and attack the party trent followed her gaze we shall have to defend ourselves he said mildly i think i shall this time have to transform you gloha she realized that he had declined to do so on the way in because she hadnt yet done the thing required to give graeboe the will to live declaring her love for him she had had to remain in her natural form until then so that he would be assured it was her but now she was free to defend the group yes transform me she agreed be careful to look at none of us he said never turn your gaze into the cave why not but even as he spoke he was transforming her she found herself in a lizard body a lizard what good would this do she almost turned to direct a questioning glance at him but caught herself so instead she gazed out at the swiftly approaching dirty birds the first bird met her gazeand abruptly plummeted from the sky what had happened the second looked at herand dropped out too then she realized what it was trent had transformed her into a basilisk her very gaze could kill she glared around and vulgars dropped like burning stones soon none were left she was more deadly than a firebreathing dragon suddenly she was herself again a little of that goes a long way trent remarked now it was safe to look at the others nervous in retrospect about the damage she could have done she was relieved more time must have passed than she had realized the transplant was withdrawing its needles she went to graeboe how do you feel she asked anxiously he looked surprised better i feel the new marrow taking hold revitalizing my blood i think it will be a while before i am completely restored but surely it is happening he paused glancing at the skeleton there is something i must do now help me up she put her arm around his shoulders and helped him stand he did seem stronger though still weak some magic was not instantaneous but that did not lessen its value he walked unsteadily across to marrow you have given me life take half my soul he extended his hand the skeleton reached down to clasp the fleshhand in his bonehand now i will accept it he said the hands touched there was a glow gloha in contact with graeboe felt an eerie thinning or separation not painful just uneasy it was his soul fissioning then their hands separated graeboe tottered weakened again and gloha quickly supported him marrow fell back against the wall oh he said in wonder metria appeared now you know what i feel like i believe i do marrow said it is wonderful yet frightening exactly the demoness agreed she stepped in to kiss him on the fleshless mouth but you do get used to it gradually especially if you have a friend he has friends gloha said graeboe nodded agreement trent turned to the slowmud you have been most helpful he said i think that any inconvenience you may have caused us has been ameliorated then veleno was standing in his natural form yes gloha agreed you risked your life to bring graeboe here i shall always be grateful and she emulated metria flying up to plant a kiss on his surprised face now i think we had better get out of here before pinatuba fields another ploy to dispatch us trent said he went to the edge of the grotto and looked down i think we cant depart the way we came the poison goo is all around you could change me to a roc bird gloha said so i can carry the rest of you out no the volcano is alert for that hes putting out hot rocks to set fire to feathers gloha looked out pinatuba was sending a barrage of burning ashes into the air furious that the party had won its way to the transplant lava and poison were strewn all across the ground their prospects for escape did look bleak graeboe joined her i mink i could make it out he said in my natural form invisible i could step on the clean ridges and be away before the volcano knows what is happening then by all means go gloha said the rest of us will follow when we are able no if i am able to do it then we all are i will carry you you should be invisible too if i curl my fingers around you but you arent invisible any more marrow reminded him and you are weakened by losing half your soul i should not have taken it yet i should be invisible when healthy i am weak now but healthy and if i carry you my soul will be reunited for that time it might be a harrowing ride for you but i believe i could do it my natural body is familiar to me and i should be able to keep my balance and step well gloha looked at trent do you think the magician nodded if he believes he can do it he probably can but it would be better to wait for him to recover more of his strength i think not marrow said i believe i hear the scritching of nickelpedes nickelpedes gloha cried in horror we cant stay here if theyre coming therell be too many for trent to transform and theyll gouge out nickelsized chunks of our flesh yes i shall try to toss out as many as i can but i fear a swarm indeed now they all could hear the scritching coming from deep inside the cave as the mountains creatures the nickelpedes would not bother the transplant but they would soon strip the flesh from any fleshly creatures they could get at gloha could become a basilisk again but wouldnt be very effective against the antennae of creatures who were more interested in chomping than in looking pinatuba had found something they could not readily nullify graeboe stood at the brink of the cave and extended his right hand toward gloha all of you take hold of my fingers he said then transform me magician i will try to hold you gently the offer would have been laughable if they had not understood what was about to happen because the elf had the smallest hands of any of them gloha extended her hand to touch his tiny little finger marrow touched his next finger veleno his middle finger metria his forefinger and trent his thumb suddenly graeboe was gone but the hand was there incomparably largerand invisible only then touches on the massive fingers gave them assurance immediately they were scrambling up gloha had no trouble she spread her wings and half flew to the top of the finger she was on marrow wrapped his skeletal arms around his finger but veleno and trent were having problems the nickelpedes were bursting into view a swarming tide of them pincers leading metria fogged out she reappeared behind veleno in the form of an ogress get up there my love she said boosting him head over heels into the hand gloha saw him roll across the invisible surface and come to rest bemused and you magician she added heaving trent up similarly then she puffed into smoke just as the first nickelpede snapped at her feet the hand closed carefully they all tumbled together in the palm held by loosely clenching fingers the hand lifted gloha righted herself and peered out between or through the invisible fingers they were swinging way up through the air and the burning ashes but they were protected by the giants flesh now the giant was tramping away from the mountain gloha saw a ridge squish flat and a cleft fill in as if pressed by a phenomenal weight their speed was remarkable for graeboe was taking giant steps and not dawdling there was a sound behind oompah mount pinatuba was venting his absolute rage at their escape such a torrent of material shot out of his cone that it was likely to cool xanth another degree before it settled out there were fiery boulders too arcing down to fall all around them but they were already getting safely out of range they had made it the pace slowed the giant stopped at a nice glade and brought his hand down so they could dismount then trent faced the region where graeboe stood what form would you like to assume now he called i the giants voice came im falling trent leaped for the hand then a naked winged goblin man was there falling forward trent caught him had he not made the transformation the giant might have fallen on the rest of them graeboe gloha cried whats the matter then she saw for herself his body was covered with terrible burns he had been shielding them from that barrage taking the burns without complaint but he had been weak from his recent malady and this had added intolerably to his burden gloha whipped out her handkerchief it had a bit of healing elixir in it she needed all of it now she dabbed it on graeboes bums and blisters and they healed when she ran out of dabs of elixir she kissed the spots instead and this seemed to work almost as well oh my darling she breathed as she worked you never said you were getting all burned protecting us trent had been holding graeboe up but glohas ministrations were rapidly restoring him so trent moved clear suddenly she realized that the exgiant was not wearing anything she moved to shield him from embarrassment and suddenly was in his arms they kissed after her head stopped spinning gloha drew back of course you can be a giant if you really prefer i never sought to i am getting healthier by the moment graeboe said either get me some clothing or take off yours the others laughed metria appeared with some clothing she had scrounged from somewhere soon graeboe was decent but glohas trace of guilt remained you never asked me to become a giantess for you i dont think its right to make you change for me so if you have any second or third thoughts hold the tableau the demoness said and vanished whats she up to trent asked something nice im sure veleno said shes a wonderful woman gloha decided not to debate that so she changed the subject i think i know what graeboe and i will be doing she said also veleno and metria marrow will go home with his half soul to his family and share it with them so all our quests have been accomplished but what of you magician trent are you going to fade out now trent looked thoughtful i must say i had forgotten how exhilarating youthful adventure could be i believe ill keep my youth for a while longer and tell my wife to try it too i think it is not yet time to fade out im glad to hear that gloha said she was understating the case but didnt think it appropriate to say more then the demoness reappeared she handed graeboe a mirror whats this for he asked its a magic mirror the goblins liberated from a storehouse by miracle lake metria explained with a hint of the old mischief they said you should have it as a wedding present and i think its ideal it will tell you anything your beloved seeks to hide shell have no secrets from you you wont even need to ask her just ask the mirror any private feelings any doubts any misgivings will be mercilessly revealed graeboe nodded unconcerned its for you my love he said handing it to gloha have a harpy time authors note i dont do routine authors notes nevertheless this one is routine so those who arent interested in lists of credits might as well skip to the last page glohas quest

in the note for demons dont dream when she had an iris named after her she had been paralyzed and blinded by an unkind ailment but still liked xanth she died while i was writing this novel so i took her to xanth as i did with our dog bubbles in the last novel and gave her back her motion and her sight so she could have a better life there among her irises i dont undertake to do this for other

minus a moment ill try to catch up on them in the next novel gets of the gargoyle the story lines take their devious turns and avoid some notions i expect to use there are a lot of puns but the welfare of the story always comes first jenny elf did not appear in this novelshes entitled to some time off you knowbut her namesake in mundania continues to improve but there can be snags for example when she was at cumbersome horsepital to sharpen her computer skills she was outside when another patient had a seizure jennys attendant hurried to help forgetting that jennys wheelchair was on a slope jenny strapped in went rolling off the path and over a bank and cracked her head on the ground several stitches but no internal damage her main complaint was when they hauled her off for treatment without her makeup she was sweet sixteen at the time and makeup is important who says life in a wheelchair is dull my only adventure in this period was when i attended magicon the world science fiction convention in orlando florida i wasnt going to go but my wife said she was tired of the dull home routine so we went my daughters were there of course theyve been con freaks since i made the mistake of taking them to necronomicon in tampa a decade before and now have attended more cons than i have ive never been to a world con before my attendance was unannounced i had given no commitments in advance because i wanted to do what i wanted to do instead of what i was programmed to do for once it was interesting and i met a number of figures in the field including one who said id called him a nazi what bothered me was that he seemed to believe his charge and insisted on it in the presence of two publishers i have been charged with many things over the years and i dont mean just bad writing but this was the first time anyone had the nerve to do it to my face with witnesses so i am pursing it as a matter of slander and well see all my other contacts were positive my autographing session sunday morning took almost an hour and a half the word had leaked out and my fans were appearing barbara hambly called hello from the next autographing table and i got to meet hal clement whose needle and mission of gravity were part of my formative years in the genre i regret that i didnt get to meet the guest of honor jack vance whom i regard as the finest fantasy writer extant but thats the way of big conventions there are so many things happening all at once that the things you want to do are squeezed out by the incidentals so it was fun once but i wont rush to do it again we picked up literature on the worldcon in glasgow scotland we might attend that i was born in england some time ago but have never been back its about time thus my quiet life in the months of awghost saptimber and octogre remember if you want my catalog of titles and such ilk call hi piers
